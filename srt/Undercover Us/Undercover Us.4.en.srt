1
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,720
Let's go! Let's go!

2
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,120
The show is about to start.

3
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,180
Let's go. Let's go.

4
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,080
Today,

5
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,960
is

6
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:25,560
the Golden and Jade Alliance.

7
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,240
I don't know how.

8
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,200
It's okay.

9
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,660
Let me teach you. Let me teach you.

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,520
This...

11
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,039
What happened?

12
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,039
Take it

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,930
Look carefully.

14
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,680
Madam.

15
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,200
Continue.

16
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,360
Okay.

17
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,280
Is it fun, madam?

18
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,280
I didn't expect

19
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,120
you can play shadow puppets.

20
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,120
You're indeed talented.

21
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,120
Sir,

22
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,680
is so lucky.

23
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,680
You are beautiful

24
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,960
It matches

25
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,080
in my shop.

26
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,060
Why don't you choose one or two for Her Ladyship?

27
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,280
I think these

28
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,080
are really rare.

29
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,279
How much

30
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,079
How much is it?

31
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,680
You have good taste.

32
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,000
This jade pendant is the only one.

33
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,840
If you like it,

34
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,880
take it.

35
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,240
Just give me money.

36
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,680
It's indeed a good thing.

37
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,220
Beautiful jade shatters.

38
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,060
Your Ladyship.

39
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,040
Be careful.

40
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,240
If it weren't for the disguise,

41
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,760
it's none of your business to laugh at me.

42
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,800
Thank you for reminding me, Your Highness.

43
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,680
Thank you.

44
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,640
You can't just say it.

45
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,360
Your sachet looks good.

46
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,160
I'll use it as a thank you gift.

47
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,600
Thank you, Your Highness.

48
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,000
Keep it then.

49
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,080
It's getting late.

50
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,200
Let's go home.

51
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,600
Okay.

52
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,080
I'm tired too.

53
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,920
Your Highness, you're still up?

54
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,450
I made you some sweet soup to calm your nerves.

55
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,280
I walked outside all day today.

56
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,480
Have some good sleep.

57
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,720
Prince Xuanping is indeed the best playboy in the capital.

58
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,600
He's responsible for the monthly expenses of the brothel.

59
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,880
I've never heard of it.

60
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,120
So what?

61
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,800
Master Rong is his sister.

62
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,060
How can I not spoil him?

63
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,240
I heard that Master Rong

64
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,080
Do you want to die?

65
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,440
Come on, let's drink.

66
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,600
Let's drink.

67
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,900
Medicinal fragrance.

68
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,880
Which beauty in Qifeng Pavilion

69
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Let me see her face.

70
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,640
I'm new here.

71
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,360
Please

72
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,040
please forgive me.

73
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,480
and fell into my hands.

74
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,840
There's no reason to run away.

75
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,240
Your Highness.

76
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,640
do you have something to tell me?

77
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
I

78
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,400
have a question for you.

79
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,290
Your Highness, please.

80
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,560
What do you think

81
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,720
freedom?

82
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,920
Freedom?

83
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,600
is the moment

84
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,320
redeemed me from Qifeng Pavilion.

85
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,440
No.

86
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,159
I'm stupid.

87
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,159
Please enlighten me.

88
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,960
You got married from Qifeng Pavilion to the mansion.

89
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,600
from Qifeng Pavilion?

90
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,640
You don't like the formalities in the mansion,

91
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,560
nor my rebellion.

92
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,530
You force yourself to accept everything you don't like.

93
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,880
There is no freedom at all.

94
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,200
Compared to Qifeng Pavilion,

95
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,920
I'm free

96
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,320
with you.

97
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,480
I'm not telling you this

98
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,980
to force you to show your loyalty.

99
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,080
I'm just bored.

100
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,600
I was just chatting.

101
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,440
Do you think

102
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,040
freedom

103
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,400
What do you know?

104
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,120
You have the right to make your own decision.

105
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,159
For example,

106
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,559
this marriage...

107
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,120
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

108
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,200
I made a mistake.

109
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,520
After drinking the sleeping potion,

110
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,760
Have a good sleep.

111
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,640
I heard that

112
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,850
many girls went missing recently.

113
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,200
It's related to Lieutenant Li who is in charge of the city's safety.

114
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,280
At midnight,

115
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,120
through the east gate.

116
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,010
You must stop the carriage.

117
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,160
Who are you?

118
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,120
Let those girls go!

119
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,120
You overestimate yourself.

120
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,480
A mere killer...

121
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,400
How dare you fight against us?

122
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,320
Listen up!

123
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,690
Take down this traitor!

124
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,020
The lieutenant will be rewarded.

125
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,240
Attack!

126
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,400
Playing poison again?

127
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,520
Do we need to

128
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,720
to deal with criminals?
