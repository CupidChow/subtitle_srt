1
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,840
On behalf of Master Lin, if there is a chance to kill Xie Cizhou,

2
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:10,320
Nameless Pavilion will be the ruler of Yunzhou.

3
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,840
Tonight,

4
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,080
it's a good opportunity.

5
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,640
It's a trap.

6
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,600
An assassin escaped tonight.

7
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,800
Search every room.

8
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,680
Yes.

9
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
Thank you.

10
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,120
I finally found you.

11
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,640
He doesn't look like a guard.

12
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,440
Who is he?

13
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,280
Go!

14
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,000
Get him back!

15
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No matter alive or dead.

16
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,320
Yes.

17
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,240
Search!

18
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,920
Don't miss any corner.

19
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,560
Yes.

20
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,000
You're here so soon.

21
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,400
Your Highness.

22
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,440
Your Highness.

23
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,480
Your Highness.

24
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,560
What's wrong?

25
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,360
He suddenly rushed in.

26
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
I was scared.

27
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,080
That's why I disturbed you.

28
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,200
You again?

29
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,520
Are you deliberately picking on me

30
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,400
because she thinks highly of you?

31
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,159
Your Highness.

32
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,120
An assassin attacked Master Rong in the villa.

33
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,960
I'm ordered to search.

34
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,720
Assassin?

35
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,560
Is Sister Wang in danger?

36
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
Master Rong is fine.

37
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,680
But the assassin should still be in the mansion.

38
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,000
You may leave.

39
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
I'll be right there.

40
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,040
Your Highness.

41
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,280
There's an assassin in the mansion.

42
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,160
Master Rong.

43
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,720
Will she blame you?

44
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,000
You care about my safety.

45
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,080
I feel so relieved.

46
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,160
How about this?

47
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,960
come with me to apologize to Ms. Wang.

48
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,560
How is it?

49
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,040
How is Sister Wang?

50
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,240
I'm fine.

51
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,760
But that thief is cunning.

52
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,520
He ran away.

53
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,560
It's all my fault.

54
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,120
You didn't arrange the assassin.

55
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,240
What did you do wrong?

56
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,720
I shouldn't have invited Ms. Wang

57
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,880
for my sake.

58
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,640
I almost made a big mistake.

59
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,600
I deserve to die.

60
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,400
You have many loopholes

61
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,560
has many loopholes.

62
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,120
I'm really worried.

63
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,480
How about this?

64
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,480
Let Qinglin stay.

65
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,080
If anything happens in the mansion,

66
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,800
we can take care of each other.

67
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,160
Such a loser.

68
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,680
It's fine that the governor can't catch the assassin.

69
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,800
Even the assassin who concerns Wang's safety

70
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,040
who concerns her safety.

71
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:36,960
Your Highness.

72
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,840
Watch your mouth.

73
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,040
I was talking nonsense when I was drunk.

74
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Sister Wang gave it to me.

75
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,400
is the best.

76
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,400
I

77
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,920
thank God.

78
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,440
It's settled then.

79
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,680
Such a big thing happened tonight.

80
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,840
I can't stay here anymore.

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,360
I'll take Chuan back to the City Governor's Residence.

82
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,200
Please retract your order.

83
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,720
and send others to guard the mansion.

84
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,800
Are you going to disobey my order?

85
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,120
I dare not.

86
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,160
I...

87
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm just worried about Master Rong's safety.

88
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,920
Qinglin,

89
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,480
You are the person I trust the most.

90
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,760
In this world,

91
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,120
people's hearts are the most unpredictable.

92
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,840
The most reliable is the heart.

93
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,120
I only trust you.

94
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,480
I

95
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,880
I won't let you down.

96
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,400
Who

97
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,760
Who could it be?

98
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,400
The wedding night.

99
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,960
You must have suffered.

100
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,560
Please don't mind.

101
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,760
It's good that everyone is safe.

102
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,960
It's fine now.

103
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,840
You never know.

104
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,360
You should go back and rest.

105
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,920
What about His Highness?

106
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,720
After what happened,

107
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
I still need to write the memorials.

108
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
I'll stay in the study tonight.

109
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,240
Don't blame me for neglecting you.

110
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,760
Go ahead, Your Highness.

111
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,800
I'll take my leave.

112
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
Is Liu Ruyue trying to kill His Highness?

113
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,800
She knew that

114
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,360
in your body.

115
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,520
The injury caused by the mother Gu is caused by the Son Gu.

116
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,960
If Si Yao succeeds tonight,

117
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,200
Xie Cizhou will not be the one to die.

118
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,920
but

119
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,680
you.

120
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,400
From what I know about Liu Ruyue,

121
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,880
what happened tonight doesn't seem to be her order.

122
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,760
She won't harm me.

123
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,960
There must be something behind this.

124
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,760
But...

125
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,800
Go ahead.

126
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,520
It doesn't matter.

127
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,120
I'm stupid.

128
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,400
Your identity

129
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,160
except Liu Ruyue,

130
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,600
except Liu Ruyue.

131
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,240
It’s easier to expose if you keep Si Yao by your side.

132
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,520
Then why did you marry her?

133
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,400
We both know

134
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,800
Both of us know that.

135
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,880
that was the only time in the past ten years

136
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,200
When the Ziye Gu is out of control,

137
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
can calm down in an instant.

138
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,000
So this female killer

139
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,320
is not just an orphan.

140
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,720
You're hurt.

141
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,440
You must be disappointed

142
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,360
you must be disappointed.

143
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,040
You're smart.

144
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,240
I knew it.

145
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,360
Master always said

146
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,120
once you enter the nameless Pavilion,

147
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,960
no betrayal is allowed.

148
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,400
But why did you betray me

149
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,720
in the assessment mission?

150
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
to inform Prince Xuanping's Mansion.

151
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,280
What does this mean?

152
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,680
As a killer,

153
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,640
only by being betrayed

154
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,960
and isolated,

155
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,960
and helpless.

156
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,160
Nameless Pavilion.

157
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,240
No betrayal is allowed.

158
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,600
but you can't guarantee that you won't betray me.

159
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,320
Your colleague

160
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,960
may be the one who betrayed you.

161
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,800
This is your last lesson before you graduate.

162
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,760
Of course.

163
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,400
if you die

164
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,160
die tonight,

165
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,520
That's only a failure.

166
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,680
But...

167
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,960
you did well.

168
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,080
From now on,

169
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,280
you

170
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,760
a member of the nameless Pavilion.

171
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,000
Thank you, Master.

172
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:51,560
Baby.

173
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,000
The leading role of the role.

174
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,360
The lead actor of the role.

175
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,320
Xie Ciyuan/Wufeng Pan Youcheng

176
00:12:59,680 --> 00:12:59,960
Xie Ciyuan Wufeng Pan Youcheng

177
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,600
Actor.

178
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:00,880
Shi An Elric.

179
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:00,680
Actor?

180
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,240
Shi An.

181
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:01,560
Liu Ruyue, Yu, green onion

182
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:01,920
Thank you.

183
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:01,560
Liu Ruyue

184
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,160
Thank you, Lu Yanyan.

185
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,520
Xie Ying Chuan, Hu Jianyu.

186
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:02,880
Xie Ying Chuan, Hu Jianyu.

187
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:02,640
Chu, one, Dai Shaodong.

188
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,200
The young Dong of Chu Dynasty.

189
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,440
Fangyu Yan Feng.

190
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:03,760
Fangyu Yan Feng.

191
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,440
Qing Lin.

192
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Li Rui, Guo Xin.

193
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:04,800
Qing Lin, Chen Guo Liang.

194
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,080
