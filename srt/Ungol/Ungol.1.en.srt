1
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:47,578
- Is she really a lesbian?
- You’re friends with Gin, right?

2
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:50,449
Yes! I’ll ask her later.
Hey! Gin!

3
00:03:50,474 --> 00:03:51,767
- Cora?
- There she is.

4
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:54,713
Who are you gossiping about now?

5
00:03:54,738 --> 00:03:57,917
Gin, you tell us.

6
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:01,731
Is it true that Esther's
daughter is a lesbian?

7
00:04:01,928 --> 00:04:08,101
Someone saw her go
into your room with a girl!

8
00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:10,542
- Is that true, Gin?
- I don't know.

9
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:13,982
You're no fun to bond with.

10
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:17,319
Come on, I’ll get your nails done.
The gossip is not true!

11
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:19,932
Good morning, Susan!

12
00:04:19,957 --> 00:04:20,971
Gin!

13
00:04:20,996 --> 00:04:24,792
Here is my payment for the
soft drinks I got from you last time.

14
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:26,957
Gin, you don't need
to pay it back so soon.

15
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:28,394
That's okay.

16
00:04:28,737 --> 00:04:31,194
If you borrow something,
you need to return it right away.

17
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:32,626
So you can borrow again.

18
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:34,566
It’s nice of you, Gin.

19
00:04:34,591 --> 00:04:38,730
You’re not like everyone else here,
who have no shame.

20
00:04:38,755 --> 00:04:41,066
There are so many
here who can see.

21
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:46,035
But they only see opportunities
to take advantage of others.

22
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:49,508
- Okay.
- Thank you.

23
00:04:50,674 --> 00:04:51,674
Gin!

24
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,097
We’ll rent your room again later.

25
00:04:54,373 --> 00:04:56,667
We can’t do it at
home because of our kids.

26
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:58,277
It’s really been a while!

27
00:04:58,302 --> 00:05:00,403
Okay, Emil. What time?

28
00:05:00,428 --> 00:05:01,621
The same as always.

29
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,444
Okay.

[background chatter]

31
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,199
Let’s stop drinking.
That’s our last bottle.

33
00:05:09,854 --> 00:05:10,854
Cheers.

37
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,769
I know it's you Abet.

38
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:29,402
I can tell just by
the sound you make.

39
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:35,422
Didn't I tell you that if you're going
to the market, I'll come with you.

40
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:36,894
What time do you think it is?

41
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:39,707
There was a procession earlier,

42
00:05:40,026 --> 00:05:41,111
which means a job for me.

43
00:05:41,136 --> 00:05:42,417
Couldn't waste it.

44
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:43,847
Oh, here.

45
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:45,660
For you. Take this.

46
00:05:47,142 --> 00:05:48,351
I got you this.

47
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:49,786
What will I do with this?

48
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:52,253
I don't know.
Sell it if you like.

49
00:05:52,278 --> 00:05:55,277
I just couldn’t
resist to get you one.

50
00:05:56,234 --> 00:05:57,917
You can make it
up to me next time.

51
00:05:58,111 --> 00:05:59,111
Hey.

52
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:02,298
Can you buy me
supplies for the room?

53
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:04,316
- I forgot.
- Sure, give it to me.

54
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,522
[background chatter]

55
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:07,547
Thanks!

[background chatter]

57
00:06:11,974 --> 00:06:12,974
Okay.

58
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:15,259
Yeah.

59
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:17,409
[background chatter]

60
00:06:33,386 --> 00:06:34,665
Thank you.

61
00:06:45,342 --> 00:06:47,034
So, Gin, is your room vacant?

62
00:06:47,452 --> 00:06:49,097
Yeah, it's been waiting for you.

63
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:03,918
So good!

64
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,931
- Is it good?
- Yes, you’re so good!

65
00:07:13,394 --> 00:07:14,437
You’re so great!

66
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
Yes!

67
00:07:24,587 --> 00:07:26,506
I’m close!

68
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:35,333
Here’s our payment.

69
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,350
This isn't enough.

70
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,375
What?

71
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,050
What are you saying?
That's 100.

72
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:44,968
No, this is not 100.

73
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,762
These two coins are too small,

74
00:07:47,787 --> 00:07:49,472
they don't match.

75
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:52,902
This is a 10-peso coin, Ricky.

76
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:56,167
Then this small one is a 5-peso coin.

77
00:07:56,688 --> 00:07:58,003
Ricky,

78
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:00,071
I may be blind,
but I'm not stupid.

79
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,314
Fine. Fine.

80
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:02,568
Here.

81
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:04,027
I just miscounted.

82
00:08:04,645 --> 00:08:07,611
Sorry about him Gin.
Ricky is just being an idiot.

83
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,030
It’s okay, Mona.

84
00:08:09,268 --> 00:08:10,769
Just don't let it happen again.

85
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,414
Let’s go.

86
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,477
Gin!

87
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,521
Gin!

88
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,438
Here are your supplies.

89
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,300
Here we go!

90
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,055
I’ll just play.

91
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,691
What game should I choose?

92
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:55,814
This looks solid.

93
00:10:56,038 --> 00:10:57,386
This is good.

94
00:10:58,304 --> 00:10:59,304
Here we go.

95
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,746
<i>Free spins.</i>

96
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,084
Oh, nice!

97
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:08,542
I’m so lucky!

98
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,587
Easy money!

99
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,621
Let’s go!

100
00:11:13,184 --> 00:11:14,977
Hey! Let’s go!

101
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,843
Let’s go!

102
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,733
There!

103
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,555
One more! One more!

104
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:36,071
Nice!

105
00:11:36,587 --> 00:11:37,587
Yes!

106
00:11:37,774 --> 00:11:39,415
Unbelievable! One more!

107
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:42,411
Big win!

108
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,582
Yes, easy money!
Let’s go!

109
00:11:51,424 --> 00:11:52,530
Scatter, man!

110
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:53,922
Bring it on!

111
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,665
Scatter, let’s go!

112
00:11:55,876 --> 00:11:57,837
Scatter! Scatter! Boom!

113
00:11:58,719 --> 00:11:59,719
Scatter!

114
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,388
Big win, baby!

115
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:02,720
Shit!

116
00:12:02,744 --> 00:12:04,655
- I won!
- Damn it...

117
00:12:05,352 --> 00:12:06,579
I won!

118
00:12:08,305 --> 00:12:09,354
Hey, Bet!

119
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:11,891
You're too loud!
You're getting on my nerves!

120
00:12:12,218 --> 00:12:13,430
You ruined my day!

121
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:19,212
You should be glad
I was the one inside,

122
00:12:19,237 --> 00:12:21,633
and not some moody customer.

123
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,576
I almost got a heart attack
from your screams.

124
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:27,055
I got a scatter on Playtime.ph.

125
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,751
Look! Look!

126
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:32,055
Look! Aren’t you happy for me?

127
00:12:32,746 --> 00:12:35,204
And it’s easy to cash out here.

128
00:12:35,229 --> 00:12:36,969
I already got my winnings.

129
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,257
Don’t worry!

130
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:40,743
Tomorrow, I’ll make it up to you.

131
00:12:41,046 --> 00:12:42,070
Okay?

132
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,948
I’ll buy you beef stew.

133
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,087
Promise?

134
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:47,680
Thank you.

135
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,719
What were you doing inside?

136
00:12:50,744 --> 00:12:52,133
What took you so long?

137
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:53,860
Playing dumb?

138
00:12:54,727 --> 00:12:56,156
You’re unbelievable!

139
00:12:56,492 --> 00:12:59,282
Did your customer's
horniness rub off on you?

140
00:12:59,307 --> 00:13:00,307
Why?

141
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:02,298
Is there a problem with lust?

142
00:13:03,256 --> 00:13:05,532
That’s the reason why I was born.

143
00:13:05,557 --> 00:13:08,055
And that's how I make a living.

144
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:18,672
What about me?

145
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:21,934
You just ignore me when
I’m feeling horny for you.

146
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,892
Why would I have sex with you?

147
00:13:24,362 --> 00:13:27,532
Rumor has it that yours
is just as big as a chili.

148
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,864
Hey, screw you, try grabbing it now!

149
00:13:30,012 --> 00:13:31,417
It's jaw dropping.

150
00:13:31,488 --> 00:13:32,610
In your dreams, stupid!

151
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,080
And besides,

152
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,520
I won't let just anyone
take my virginity.

153
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:37,545
Is that so?

154
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:39,723
I'm just anyone to you.

155
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:42,801
Don't be dramatic.
It doesn't suit you.

156
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:43,936
You’re really unbelievable!

157
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:51,817
Hey.

158
00:13:52,371 --> 00:13:53,877
I have something for you.

159
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:56,114
Again?

160
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:57,503
Where?

161
00:13:57,576 --> 00:13:58,903
Close your eyes, first.

162
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:00,289
Idiot.

163
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,734
As if I’ll see that even
if me eyes are open.

164
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,629
Come on, can't you take a joke?

165
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,395
Can't you just humor me?

166
00:14:11,993 --> 00:14:13,203
Wow!

167
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:14,848
So? What do you think?

168
00:14:14,873 --> 00:14:16,168
That smells so good.

169
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:18,348
That's the perfume
I’ve been saving for.

170
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:21,317
I saw someone using
this on the MRT earlier.

171
00:14:21,516 --> 00:14:23,153
I made sure to get it.

172
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,488
That was so easy.

173
00:14:24,911 --> 00:14:26,043
How did you do it?

174
00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:28,411
You might not believe me

175
00:14:29,074 --> 00:14:30,747
when I say

176
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:34,122
I just rubbed my
thing on him a bit.

177
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:36,000
You dumbass!

178
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,209
Here. It's yours.

179
00:14:39,691 --> 00:14:40,691
But...

180
00:14:41,302 --> 00:14:43,321
You do know I won’t
use this, right?

181
00:14:43,346 --> 00:14:45,426
I don't like receiving
things that were stolen, Abet.

182
00:14:47,292 --> 00:14:49,137
Come on!

183
00:14:49,524 --> 00:14:50,524
Really?

184
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:53,020
That's why I'm making
you help me out here,

185
00:14:53,264 --> 00:14:55,270
so you don't have to
make a living by stealing.

186
00:14:55,842 --> 00:14:59,473
I'm helping you
because I want to.

187
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:05,934
Fine, I'll just put this
with the other things you don't want.

188
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:34,731
Bet, for you.

189
00:15:35,174 --> 00:15:36,356
Thank you.

190
00:15:36,443 --> 00:15:37,481
Anything for you.

191
00:15:39,987 --> 00:15:40,987
Gin...

192
00:15:41,334 --> 00:15:42,895
I'll come back tomorrow.

193
00:15:44,993 --> 00:15:46,176
Take care.

194
00:18:38,865 --> 00:18:39,865
Hey, Gin!

195
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,890
Didn't I tell you to sleep?

196
00:18:41,915 --> 00:18:43,906
I couldn't sleep.

197
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:51,421
What did you hear?

198
00:18:52,595 --> 00:18:54,968
The same sounds as last night,

199
00:18:54,993 --> 00:18:56,319
and the night before that,

200
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:57,609
and the night before that.

201
00:18:59,136 --> 00:19:03,164
Mom, I’m still young,
yet you’re too lusty.

202
00:19:03,595 --> 00:19:07,045
Hey, miss! You're blind, not rude!

203
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:08,507
Sorry.

204
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:11,859
Come here.

205
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:34,420
Hold this.

206
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:41,828
This is a lot, ma!

207
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,828
That's still far from enough.

208
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,203
I add to that every night.

209
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,333
Once that's full,

210
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:52,140
I can take you abroad
to get your eyes fixed.

211
00:19:52,472 --> 00:19:53,472
You never know,

212
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,329
your mom could get lucky

213
00:19:55,354 --> 00:19:58,921
and meet someone who’ll
give us the money we need.

214
00:19:59,829 --> 00:20:02,859
Someone who will
moan from pleasure.

215
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,023
That's all for you. Come here.

216
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:15,910
I love you, Gin.

217
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:33,221
Hold on.

218
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:46,292
What is it?

219
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:48,835
Is this Gin's place?

220
00:20:49,379 --> 00:20:50,671
Are you going to rent the room?

221
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:51,852
Is it vacant?

222
00:20:51,972 --> 00:20:53,436
One hundred per hour.

223
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:56,210
Fifty pesos for every additional hour.

224
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
Great.

225
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,523
Are you serious?

226
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:09,077
Don't worry, I don't see anything.

227
00:21:17,294 --> 00:21:20,140
I don't see you,
but I can feel you.

228
00:21:20,354 --> 00:21:21,994
I know that you're
dancing in front of me.

229
00:21:26,176 --> 00:21:27,484
Are you alone here?

230
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:29,656
Someone stays over sometimes.

231
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:31,640
He's just at work now.

232
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:32,875
Hey!

233
00:21:33,406 --> 00:21:34,833
These are great.

234
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:37,022
Are you into
the buy and sell business?

235
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:39,421
These are good!

236
00:21:40,155 --> 00:21:42,319
Perfect! These bags are great.

237
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,880
You’re not allowed to go there.

238
00:21:44,491 --> 00:21:45,828
The room is over there.

239
00:21:46,317 --> 00:21:49,530
Usually, I only let
people I know in here.

240
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,077
But since you're new,

241
00:21:51,459 --> 00:21:52,929
I'll take the payment upfront.

242
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:55,273
You’re so annoying.

243
00:21:55,475 --> 00:21:57,725
So, you think we
don't have money?

244
00:21:57,874 --> 00:21:59,057
Hey, Leo!

245
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:00,788
Pay her.

246
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,046
She's accusing us
of being broke.

247
00:22:05,215 --> 00:22:06,215
Here.

248
00:22:08,765 --> 00:22:09,765
There you go.

249
00:22:11,076 --> 00:22:12,274
It’s settled. Let’s go.

250
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,380
You like that?

251
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:57,783
Shit!

252
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,479
I'm close!

253
00:27:04,408 --> 00:27:05,408
Yes!

254
00:27:08,643 --> 00:27:10,431
Ouch!

255
00:27:13,705 --> 00:27:15,332
Ouch!

256
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,010
- Are you okay?
- Hey!

257
00:27:21,035 --> 00:27:22,923
- Sorry. My head hurts.
- Are you okay?

258
00:27:24,182 --> 00:27:25,447
What happened?

259
00:27:25,472 --> 00:27:26,472
Are you okay?

260
00:27:27,141 --> 00:27:28,141
Are you okay?

261
00:27:28,302 --> 00:27:29,742
- I’m fine.
- What?

262
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:30,994
I’m sorry.

263
00:27:33,117 --> 00:27:34,478
What really happened?

264
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,702
Something fell on me.

265
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:37,989
What?

266
00:27:39,986 --> 00:27:41,791
Be careful next time, okay?

267
00:27:42,604 --> 00:27:44,299
You’re all alone here.

268
00:27:44,694 --> 00:27:48,072
Good thing we’re here.

269
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:04,793
Damn, Bet!

270
00:28:05,055 --> 00:28:07,495
This was the first time in
a long time that I felt so aroused.

271
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:10,353
Screw that.

272
00:28:11,265 --> 00:28:12,736
His moans...

273
00:28:15,063 --> 00:28:17,579
I can still hear his moans...

274
00:28:19,174 --> 00:28:22,494
It's been a while since
I heard moaning like that.

275
00:28:27,101 --> 00:28:28,101
You know what?

276
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:33,307
That's the kind of moan I could hear
coming from my mother's room before.

277
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:37,697
That's the kind I always want to hear.

278
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,054
For real?

279
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:44,723
You want to hear moans?

280
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,250
There. How’s that?

281
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:55,275
Lame.

282
00:28:56,245 --> 00:28:57,713
I bet

283
00:28:58,625 --> 00:28:59,625
he’s ugly.

284
00:29:00,512 --> 00:29:03,275
Because everyone
who's got a good voice

285
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:04,666
is ugly, right?

286
00:29:05,185 --> 00:29:06,185
Damn you!

287
00:29:06,426 --> 00:29:07,978
Get out of my face.

288
00:29:08,525 --> 00:29:09,915
I'm not in your face.

289
00:29:10,361 --> 00:29:11,729
You really are blind, huh?

290
00:29:12,113 --> 00:29:13,113
Idiot!

291
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:44,200
Wait a minute.

292
00:30:09,187 --> 00:30:10,447
Is the room available?

293
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:13,134
Yes, it's been waiting for you.

294
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:23,656
You smell good.

295
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:40,086
Hey, Gin, where's the restroom?

296
00:32:40,313 --> 00:32:41,313
At the back.

297
00:32:41,702 --> 00:32:42,702
Okay.

298
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,426
Here’s our payment.

299
00:32:57,741 --> 00:32:59,602
So, it was good, right?

300
00:33:00,202 --> 00:33:01,202
What?

301
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:06,032
I know you've been listening to us.

302
00:33:07,032 --> 00:33:08,032
I wasn’t.

303
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,272
Your voices were just loud.

304
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,540
I just so happen to hear you.

305
00:33:14,861 --> 00:33:17,179
Don't worry about it.

306
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,650
Think of it as an act of charity.

307
00:33:25,155 --> 00:33:28,175
Leo, hurry up! Why is it
taking you so long to pee?

308
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,273
- Coming.
- We might get stuck in traffic.

309
00:33:32,589 --> 00:33:33,589
Uh...

310
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,048
How were you able to do that?

311
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:38,808
Do what?

312
00:33:39,897 --> 00:33:41,101
To make him

313
00:33:41,491 --> 00:33:43,081
moan like that.

314
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:44,621
He sounded like

315
00:33:45,288 --> 00:33:46,603
he was really enjoying it.

316
00:33:48,164 --> 00:33:49,164
You know,

317
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,222
for me,

318
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,305
having sex

319
00:33:53,585 --> 00:33:55,612
is like going to the battle field.

320
00:33:55,877 --> 00:33:57,858
And if you're going to a war,

321
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:02,186
you need to bring
your strongest weapon.

322
00:34:03,163 --> 00:34:04,320
And for me,

323
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,793
that's my mouth.

324
00:34:06,273 --> 00:34:09,257
Every touch of tongue and lips,

325
00:34:09,282 --> 00:34:11,226
elicits pleasure.

326
00:34:11,694 --> 00:34:13,598
Not everyone can do that.

327
00:34:19,161 --> 00:34:20,871
Let’s go.

328
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:58,359
I saw your crush.

329
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,847
So that’s Mr. Moans!

330
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,468
How could you tell?

331
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:09,875
Because you said that couple comes
every 9am on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

332
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,388
Then that really was him.

333
00:35:11,797 --> 00:35:14,270
So... you're going
to mock him again?

334
00:35:14,295 --> 00:35:15,297
No!

335
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,824
I won't mock him

336
00:35:16,896 --> 00:35:18,059
Put this over there.

337
00:35:18,401 --> 00:35:20,130
It might annoy you.

338
00:35:20,221 --> 00:35:21,221
And...

339
00:35:22,523 --> 00:35:24,239
I don't want you to feel hurt.

340
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,106
So, were you right?

341
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,020
Was he ugly?

342
00:35:29,242 --> 00:35:30,242
He was okay.

343
00:35:30,607 --> 00:35:31,793
Not bad looking.

344
00:35:32,351 --> 00:35:33,351
But...

345
00:35:34,707 --> 00:35:36,179
I'm more handsome than him.

346
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,264
So, what did he look like?

347
00:35:39,035 --> 00:35:40,813
Hmm...

348
00:35:43,512 --> 00:35:45,389
Uh...

349
00:35:46,216 --> 00:35:48,031
Dark skinned...

350
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:50,391
Tall...

351
00:35:51,022 --> 00:35:53,411
Toned arms...

352
00:35:54,061 --> 00:35:56,419
And he’s got a big bulge.

353
00:35:57,124 --> 00:35:59,739
And he has washboard abs!

354
00:36:00,442 --> 00:36:01,864
He got tattoos...

355
00:36:02,543 --> 00:36:03,919
Sexy...

356
00:36:04,407 --> 00:36:05,817
But...

357
00:36:06,094 --> 00:36:08,098
He looked like a pervert.

358
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:10,544
I’m absolutely better than him.

359
00:36:14,607 --> 00:36:15,607
Hey, Gin!

360
00:36:15,796 --> 00:36:16,796
Are you okay?

361
00:36:17,818 --> 00:36:18,826
Hey!

362
00:36:18,851 --> 00:36:20,691
- Hey, what are you doing!
- Your dick, Abet!

363
00:36:20,939 --> 00:36:23,700
- Your dick, Abet! Take that out.
- Stop that! Stop!

364
00:36:23,992 --> 00:36:26,129
- Are you crazy?
- Take this out!

365
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,098
- Hurry, I might hear his moans from you.
- Stop that!

366
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,083
- Stop! You’re crazy.
- Abet, please.

367
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:32,108
Shit!

368
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:35,439
Oh, shit!

369
00:36:37,002 --> 00:36:38,002
Shit!

370
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,181
Shit! Shit!

371
00:36:47,759 --> 00:36:49,124
Damn! Shit!

372
00:36:53,813 --> 00:36:54,853
Shit!

373
00:36:54,899 --> 00:36:55,920
Shit...

374
00:36:55,945 --> 00:36:56,945
Shit.

375
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:01,094
Ah! Shit! Shit!

376
00:37:10,815 --> 00:37:11,815
Shit! Shit!

377
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:17,653
Shit! Shit!

378
00:37:21,841 --> 00:37:22,841
Shit!

379
00:37:27,068 --> 00:37:28,068
You’re frustrating!

380
00:37:28,093 --> 00:37:29,093
Why?

381
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,077
You’re crazy!

382
00:38:04,103 --> 00:38:06,592
Do you really have to
show me how much you hated it?

383
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:09,217
Your moans are so bad.

384
00:38:10,815 --> 00:38:12,522
Are you disgusted?

385
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,920
Just because I threw up?

386
00:38:15,562 --> 00:38:17,444
What else could that mean?

387
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:19,639
You can't get
pregnant from that.

388
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:20,997
Hey!

389
00:38:21,022 --> 00:38:22,381
Don't joke about that.

390
00:38:22,813 --> 00:38:24,084
But if...

391
00:38:24,829 --> 00:38:26,733
I ever get you pregnant,

392
00:38:27,988 --> 00:38:29,358
I’ll take full responsibility.

393
00:38:30,384 --> 00:38:31,384
But

394
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,928
you won’t get me pregnant.

395
00:38:36,264 --> 00:38:37,264
Okay.

396
00:38:44,014 --> 00:38:45,014
Okay.

397
00:38:45,216 --> 00:38:46,216
Okay.

398
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:50,319
Hey!

399
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:51,950
What kind of face is that?

400
00:38:52,103 --> 00:38:53,103
Nothing.

401
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
It's nothing

402
00:38:54,524 --> 00:38:55,655
Are you crying?

403
00:38:55,907 --> 00:38:56,907
I’m not.

404
00:38:56,932 --> 00:38:58,334
It's nothing. Screw off.

405
00:38:58,724 --> 00:38:59,769
Hey, Abet!

406
00:38:59,794 --> 00:39:00,959
Where are you going?

407
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:03,834
Abet!

408
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:22,738
<i>9:31 AM</i>

409
00:39:44,588 --> 00:39:45,588
Gin!

410
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:50,989
Abet?

411
00:39:51,257 --> 00:39:52,257
Gin,

412
00:39:52,283 --> 00:39:53,815
we'll use the room.

413
00:39:54,065 --> 00:39:55,221
I'm with someone.

414
00:39:55,246 --> 00:39:56,246
Come on.

415
00:40:31,916 --> 00:40:34,095
You like that?

416
00:40:56,948 --> 00:40:58,080
Oh, yes!

417
00:41:00,463 --> 00:41:01,463
Oh, yes!

418
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:06,005
Oh, yes!

419
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,103
Yes!

420
00:41:20,116 --> 00:41:21,116
Oh, yes!

421
00:41:45,978 --> 00:41:47,229
Oh, yes!

422
00:41:58,737 --> 00:41:59,737
Yes!

423
00:42:02,178 --> 00:42:03,178
Yes!

424
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:04,787
Yes!

425
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:06,612
Oh, yes!

426
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:27,240
Oh, yes! Oh!

427
00:42:27,265 --> 00:42:29,699
Oh, yes!

428
00:42:29,724 --> 00:42:31,669
Uh-huh!

429
00:42:33,903 --> 00:42:34,997
Oh, yes!

430
00:42:36,617 --> 00:42:37,617
Yes!

431
00:42:37,642 --> 00:42:38,642
Uh-huh!

432
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:43,436
Yes! So good!

433
00:42:48,013 --> 00:42:49,316
Yes!

434
00:42:51,123 --> 00:42:52,544
Shit! This is so good!

435
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,197
Damn you!

436
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:55,824
Damn you!

437
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:58,159
Shit! So good!

438
00:42:58,942 --> 00:43:00,095
Oh, yes!

439
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,329
Screw you!

440
00:43:02,028 --> 00:43:03,163
Damn you!

441
00:43:03,887 --> 00:43:05,325
Shit!

442
00:43:07,772 --> 00:43:08,772
Shit!

443
00:43:11,106 --> 00:43:12,256
Shit!

444
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:14,759
Screw you!

445
00:43:14,784 --> 00:43:16,161
Damn!

446
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:17,405
Hold on.

447
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:24,709
Gin, it’s me.

448
00:44:25,712 --> 00:44:26,838
I’ll use your room.

449
00:44:26,863 --> 00:44:28,211
You're later than usual.

450
00:44:28,534 --> 00:44:29,534
I’m alone.

451
00:44:29,605 --> 00:44:30,605
It's just me.

452
00:44:32,578 --> 00:44:33,989
Alright, come in.

453
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,251
Sorry, sorry.

454
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:43,551
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

455
00:47:12,543 --> 00:47:14,998
This is wrong. This is wrong.
You have a girlfriend.

456
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:03,626
I'm still a virgin.

457
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:06,586
I’ll go gently.

458
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:11,467
Slowly.

459
00:50:26,227 --> 00:50:28,289
Hey! What are you doing?

460
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:30,336
Why do you have that? Thief!

461
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:32,063
Shit! Thief!

462
00:50:32,088 --> 00:50:33,930
- Damn you!
- You thief!

463
00:50:35,828 --> 00:50:38,161
- Leo, come on!
- What’s happening?

464
00:50:39,448 --> 00:50:41,875
Block her!
She's a thief. Damn!

465
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,156
- There’s a thief!
- Block that damn girl!

466
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,180
Damn you!
Give that back! Hey!

467
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:47,501
Give that...

468
00:50:47,526 --> 00:50:48,953
Give me that!

469
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,179
Damn it!

470
00:50:50,204 --> 00:50:51,945
- Let me go!
- Give me that!

471
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:53,310
Let me go!

472
00:50:53,515 --> 00:50:55,633
Give me that! Hey!

473
00:50:56,324 --> 00:50:57,324
Damn you!

474
00:50:58,797 --> 00:50:59,890
Ouch!

475
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:00,980
Ouch!

476
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:08,849
Damn you!

477
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,453
The money! Grab the money!

478
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:17,825
Damn you!

479
00:51:34,078 --> 00:51:35,078
Leo!

480
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:53,568
Abet!

481
00:51:53,759 --> 00:51:56,063
Abet!

482
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:01,828
Abet! Abet!

483
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:05,414
Abet!

484
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:08,501
Abet!

485
00:52:09,061 --> 00:52:11,980
What happened to you, Abet?

486
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:21,597
Abet!

487
00:53:02,859 --> 00:53:04,969
Gin.

488
00:53:06,891 --> 00:53:07,910
Don’t...

489
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,061
Don’t leave me, Gin!

490
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:10,771
I won't leave you, Abet.

491
00:53:11,507 --> 00:53:12,813
Don’t leave me, Gin!

492
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,766
I won't leave you, Abet.

493
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:16,652
I’m here, Abet.

494
00:53:23,328 --> 00:53:24,891
Don’t leave me, Gin!

495
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:42,802
Ma?

496
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:47,725
Ma?

497
00:53:51,332 --> 00:53:52,332
Ma?

498
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,570
Ma?

499
00:54:00,802 --> 00:54:01,803
Ma?

500
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:08,297
Ma, where are you?

501
00:54:10,797 --> 00:54:13,466
Ma?

502
00:54:15,916 --> 00:54:17,793
Ma?

503
00:54:17,818 --> 00:54:19,828
Ma?

504
00:54:20,087 --> 00:54:23,961
Where are you, Ma?

505
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:27,974
Ma!

506
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:33,562
Where are you, Ma?

507
00:54:36,758 --> 00:54:41,629
Ma!

508
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:47,368
Where are you, Ma?

509
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:55,251
Ma!

510
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:01,966
Ma!

511
00:55:03,718 --> 00:55:06,679
Ma, where are you?

512
00:55:10,487 --> 00:55:13,031
Ma!

513
00:55:19,237 --> 00:55:22,414
Don't leave me.

514
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:25,239
Don't leave me.

515
00:55:25,264 --> 00:55:26,574
Don't leave me, Gin.

516
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:29,242
I won't leave you, Abet.
I'm here.

517
00:55:45,121 --> 00:55:46,121
Bet...

518
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:47,899
Listen to this.

519
00:56:12,765 --> 00:56:15,211
My mother was always
with different men.

520
00:56:16,551 --> 00:56:19,039
That's the sound I used to listen to.

521
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:21,383
She thought

522
00:56:22,116 --> 00:56:24,750
I was listening to
her favorite song.

523
00:56:26,526 --> 00:56:27,789
But she doesn't know

524
00:56:28,881 --> 00:56:30,891
that I recorded her moans.

525
00:56:33,208 --> 00:56:36,305
Those moans helped calm me.

526
00:56:38,082 --> 00:56:41,578
As if she’s just here.

527
00:56:43,225 --> 00:56:44,225
But you know what, Bet?

528
00:56:45,617 --> 00:56:47,680
I won't look for
that sound anymore.

529
00:56:50,097 --> 00:56:54,000
Because when I heard you moan
that night you got hurt because of me,

530
00:56:55,566 --> 00:56:56,984
that’s when I found out that

531
00:56:57,446 --> 00:56:58,876
you’re enough for me.

532
00:56:59,812 --> 00:57:01,194
That’s when I found out that

533
00:57:02,164 --> 00:57:03,743
you would never leave me.

534
00:57:06,282 --> 00:57:07,408
I can’t believe you.

535
00:57:08,266 --> 00:57:09,485
So that’s what you want?

536
00:57:09,516 --> 00:57:10,718
To get me hurt.

537
00:57:11,491 --> 00:57:14,524
I should've let you beat
me up a long time ago.

538
00:57:14,953 --> 00:57:17,289
- Ouch!
- Fool!

539
00:57:17,989 --> 00:57:20,116
Ouch!

540
00:57:21,156 --> 00:57:22,156
Ouch!

541
00:57:23,914 --> 00:57:25,178
Let me hear that again.
