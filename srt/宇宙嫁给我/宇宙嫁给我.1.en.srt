1
00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:04,929
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

2
00:00:04,953 --> 00:00:06,924
PRODUCTION SPONSORS
MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS AND TOURISM AND KOCCA

3
00:00:06,948 --> 00:00:08,592
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, ETC. ARE FICTIONAL

4
00:00:08,616 --> 00:00:10,218
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED
WITH GUARDIANS PRESENT

5
00:00:10,242 --> 00:00:11,929
ANIMALS WERE FILMED
UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION AND WELFARE RULES

6
00:00:16,645 --> 00:00:20,732
Last year's blue crab festival logo
put too much emphasis on the crab,

7
00:00:20,816 --> 00:00:22,651
making it look
like a fish market promotion.

8
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:24,778
I think that was a bit unfortunate.

9
00:00:25,153 --> 00:00:26,905
So, Merry Design Studio

10
00:00:28,073 --> 00:00:31,535
came up with a design
that portrays a festival

11
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:34,121
you can enjoy
with family, friends, and dates.

12
00:00:34,955 --> 00:00:39,084
Also, the souvenirs you'll give out
to the visitors

13
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:44,297
will include the cute crab image
that we designed.

14
00:00:45,173 --> 00:00:46,383
Like this.

15
00:00:47,092 --> 00:00:48,885
GENERAL EVALUATION:
I DO NOT WISH TO SELECT THIS COMPANY

16
00:00:51,638 --> 00:00:54,725
Ms. Yoo, do you like blue crabs?

17
00:00:54,975 --> 00:00:56,184
Of course, I do.

18
00:00:56,393 --> 00:00:58,770
I'm a blue crab killer.

19
00:00:58,854 --> 00:01:01,565
I can eat about three in a sitting.

20
00:01:01,648 --> 00:01:06,611
Ohh! Say there's a big one
and a small one. Which would you prefer?

21
00:01:06,695 --> 00:01:09,906
Of course, I prefer a big, fleshy one.

22
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,534
The salty, flavorful taste
of a fat crab...

23
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:15,078
My mouth is watering already.

24
00:01:15,162 --> 00:01:16,830
So, you like them big.

25
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,957
There's more to it than just the size.

26
00:01:21,043 --> 00:01:22,961
Ms. Yoo, you're not married, are you?

27
00:01:23,545 --> 00:01:24,880
-No.
-Hmm.

28
00:01:27,132 --> 00:01:29,092
Show her what's good.

29
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:31,803
She likes them big and fleshy.

30
00:01:32,554 --> 00:01:34,639
He's known as the Hongju City Killer.

31
00:01:34,723 --> 00:01:36,433
-Good luck with him.

32
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:38,977
-Watch yourself.
-I will.

33
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,562
2025 BLUE CRAB FESTIVAL
DESIGN PITCH

34
00:01:40,645 --> 00:01:42,773
Sir, what you just said.

35
00:01:42,856 --> 00:01:45,067
May I ask exactly what you meant?

36
00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:47,652
Pardon? What did I say?

37
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:49,905
You wished me good luck.

38
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:51,907
Good luck with what, exactly?

39
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,700
Why don't you wrap up your presentation?

40
00:01:53,784 --> 00:01:56,703
We're short on time,
so don't try to pick a fight.

41
00:01:56,787 --> 00:01:58,205
I'm not picking a fight.

42
00:01:58,914 --> 00:02:02,042
I just want to know
what you meant when you said--

43
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:03,877
- Ms. Yoo?
-Yes?

44
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,961
Don't you want the job?

45
00:02:05,712 --> 00:02:08,215
We wanted to give
an obscure company a project,

46
00:02:08,298 --> 00:02:11,009
but who'd want to work
with someone so aggressive?

47
00:02:20,936 --> 00:02:21,937
Fine.

48
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,063
Don't work with me.

49
00:02:24,773 --> 00:02:25,982
I refuse the job.

50
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,652
I'm sorry, but to be honest,

51
00:02:29,111 --> 00:02:31,863
I'm picky about who I work with myself.

52
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:34,407
I might as well say this
since I won't get the job.

53
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:36,076
You there.

54
00:02:38,578 --> 00:02:40,872
Yes, you. The man who just pointed.

55
00:02:40,956 --> 00:02:43,166
Do you think you hold a lot of power?

56
00:02:44,543 --> 00:02:47,712
You might have the advantage here,
but outside, I have the upper hand.

57
00:02:47,796 --> 00:02:50,423
My taxes pay your salary.

58
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:52,968
I had no idea

59
00:02:53,051 --> 00:02:56,555
my tax money ended up
in the pockets of such trash.

60
00:02:56,638 --> 00:02:58,181
- What?

61
00:02:58,265 --> 00:03:00,016
What did you just say?

62
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,643
-Me?
-Yes, you.

63
00:03:01,726 --> 00:03:04,020
-How old are you?
-Why would you ask my age?

64
00:03:04,104 --> 00:03:07,107
-How dare she talk like that?
-Are you jealous that I'm young?

65
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:09,442
You dare take that tone with me?

66
00:03:09,526 --> 00:03:11,361
-Let go of me.
- Leave it.

67
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:15,115
-Do you look down on our city?
-No, Hongju City is blameless.

68
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,577
JAMYANG PRINT SHOP

69
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:26,751
<i>So basically,</i>
<i>you caused a stir and got kicked out.</i>

70
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:28,044
Don't worry.

71
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,254
You're my only employee.

72
00:03:29,337 --> 00:03:30,964
I'll manage to pay you somehow.

73
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:32,299
<i>I doubt that.</i>

74
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:35,552
We scored zero projects this month.

75
00:03:35,635 --> 00:03:37,429
How will you pay this month's rent?

76
00:03:38,096 --> 00:03:40,557
Did we get any inquiries
on our social platforms?

77
00:03:40,974 --> 00:03:44,352
Stay on the line while I go and see.

78
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:50,317
I think we got a couple of small jobs.

79
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:52,360
2 PROJECTS UNDERWAY

80
00:03:52,444 --> 00:03:54,571
Giveaways for a new butcher shop

81
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:56,323
and a logo for a Magok coffee shop.

82
00:03:56,406 --> 00:03:59,868
The coffee shop owner wants to see
a portfolio before they decide.

83
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:02,245
Should we send our old herbal tea design?

84
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:04,581
Sure, will you come back to the office?

85
00:04:04,664 --> 00:04:05,999
Oh, no. I have to drop by

86
00:04:06,082 --> 00:04:08,585
a nearby department store
while I'm out in Euljiro.

87
00:04:08,668 --> 00:04:10,879
You can finish the draft and go home.

88
00:04:15,217 --> 00:04:16,343
Sir.

89
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:21,556
Could you lower
the saturation of this part

90
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,516
while keeping the color Pantone 213?

91
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,601
I lowered it already.

92
00:04:24,684 --> 00:04:28,563
Yes, but the case is transparent,
so it'll look different when it's filled.

93
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:30,607
You can't mind that, too. Who will notice?

94
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,275
A reprint will just cost you more.

95
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:33,860
I know the difference.

96
00:04:33,944 --> 00:04:37,197
I can't sell anything to a customer
if something bothers me.

97
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,281
You're too picky.

98
00:04:38,573 --> 00:04:39,991
You'll never make a fortune doing that.

99
00:04:41,493 --> 00:04:42,619
Sir.

100
00:04:42,994 --> 00:04:43,995
Thank you.

101
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,506
We engraved the wedding bands
with your initials.

102
00:04:55,257 --> 00:04:56,258
Thanks.

103
00:04:56,341 --> 00:04:59,469
The receipt, warranty card,
and raffle ticket are inside.

104
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:01,096
Thank you.

105
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:02,847
Thank you. Goodbye.

106
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:09,145
I emailed a copy
of my boyfriend's passport.

107
00:05:09,604 --> 00:05:10,814
Yes, Kim Wooju.

108
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:13,066
Thank you. Bye.

109
00:05:15,151 --> 00:05:18,488
That's the honeymoon booked.

110
00:05:20,991 --> 00:05:22,951
WHEN WILL YOU BE DONE?

111
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,209
I love you.

112
00:05:50,353 --> 00:05:51,688
<i>When will you be done?</i>

113
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:54,691
<i>I'm in a meeting.</i>

114
00:05:54,983 --> 00:05:56,609
<i>You're working late again today?</i>

115
00:05:56,693 --> 00:05:57,736
YOU'RE WORKING LATE AGAIN TODAY?

116
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:58,820
<i>It must be tiresome.</i>

117
00:05:58,903 --> 00:05:59,904
-Who is it?
<i>-</i> <i>You've got this.</i>

118
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,114
<i>-</i><i> I love you.</i>
-What did she say?

119
00:06:10,665 --> 00:06:13,168
<i>I was hoping to have dinner</i>
<i>with him.</i>

120
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:14,294
Oh, gosh.

121
00:06:14,377 --> 00:06:15,545
Sorry.

122
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:21,009
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

123
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:23,178
EPISODE 1

124
00:06:27,223 --> 00:06:28,600
ALWAYS ACCEPT AN APOLOGY

125
00:06:28,683 --> 00:06:30,518
CUTE WOOJU
NEVER LET A FIGHT LAST MORE THAN A DAY

126
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:31,978
WOOJU TAKES OUT THE RECYCLING

127
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:33,563
HANDWRITE LETTERS ON ANNIVERSARIES

128
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:34,981
TAKE A MONTHLY TRIP IN KOREA

129
00:06:35,565 --> 00:06:37,650
Forget the wedding and whatnot.

130
00:06:37,734 --> 00:06:39,110
I wish I could call it all off.

131
00:06:41,196 --> 00:06:42,530
Oh, Meri.

132
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:46,910
You can't just register your marriage
and say it's done.

133
00:06:46,993 --> 00:06:49,621
-It's a hassle, but a necessary one.
<i>-</i> <i>Mom.</i>

134
00:06:49,704 --> 00:06:52,290
The problem is that there's so much to do.

135
00:06:52,374 --> 00:06:54,000
I have so little money to spare,

136
00:06:54,084 --> 00:06:56,669
but Wooju's mother
keeps going on about a hotel.

137
00:06:56,753 --> 00:06:58,546
It's driving me up the wall.

138
00:06:59,255 --> 00:07:02,342
If she has the money for a hotel wedding,
she should contribute to our rent.

139
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:05,887
Her son has a fancy degree,
and her husband's a university professor.

140
00:07:06,304 --> 00:07:08,473
She has an appearance to keep up.

141
00:07:08,556 --> 00:07:10,308
Try to understand.

142
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:12,018
Where are you?

143
00:07:12,102 --> 00:07:13,478
-Did you have dinner?
<i>-Yes.</i>

144
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:15,105
I ate.

145
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,816
I'm at our new place.

146
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:21,653
I come by whenever I can
to unpack and organize stuff.

147
00:07:23,113 --> 00:07:25,782
Did you have dinner, Mom?

148
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:27,742
I did. What about Wooju?

149
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:30,245
He moved in already.

150
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:34,040
He didn't call to tell you?

151
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:38,169
He must know we couldn't afford this place
without your help.

152
00:07:38,253 --> 00:07:39,838
Leave it.

153
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:42,424
I gave you the money
so he'd be good to you.

154
00:07:42,507 --> 00:07:46,010
Let me give you a word of caution.

155
00:07:46,094 --> 00:07:48,930
Don't nag him for not having
contributed to the deposit.

156
00:07:49,013 --> 00:07:51,057
You shouldn't discourage a man.

157
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:53,226
What? Why would he be discouraged?

158
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:55,061
I cater to him in every way.

159
00:07:55,145 --> 00:07:58,314
I'm good wife material
that's rare these days.

160
00:07:58,398 --> 00:07:59,899
You're the kid out of the two of us.

161
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,445
Mom.

162
00:08:04,112 --> 00:08:06,281
I'll make lots of money

163
00:08:06,364 --> 00:08:08,408
and pay you back soo--

164
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:10,785
<i>What's the matter?</i>

165
00:08:11,494 --> 00:08:12,620
It's fine.

166
00:08:12,704 --> 00:08:14,622
I just stepped on something.

167
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:20,920
Mom, I'll call you back a bit later.

168
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:22,881
Bye.

169
00:08:33,016 --> 00:08:34,392
What is this?

170
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:36,603
It's not my...

171
00:09:14,557 --> 00:09:16,726
I look like a model.

172
00:09:21,064 --> 00:09:22,273
What about this?

173
00:09:22,357 --> 00:09:24,609
It's when I played golf
with some investors.

174
00:09:25,276 --> 00:09:26,277
I know that.

175
00:09:26,945 --> 00:09:28,530
-A comment on that post.
-Yes.

176
00:09:29,864 --> 00:09:31,032
"Sweet Jenny 97."

177
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,245
-What?
-She liked every single post of yours.

178
00:09:35,787 --> 00:09:37,872
SWEET_JENNY97
YOUR FACE IS ALL I SEE

179
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:40,416
You follow each other. Who is that?

180
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:44,712
She's just a colleague of mine.

181
00:09:45,338 --> 00:09:47,340
Didn't I mention her? I bet I did.

182
00:09:47,423 --> 00:09:50,093
She went to school in Hong Kong.

183
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:51,302
Did you sleep with her?

184
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:56,933
Hey.

185
00:09:57,016 --> 00:09:58,059
What's up with you?

186
00:09:58,142 --> 00:10:00,812
Why the heck would I sleep with her?

187
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:07,360
Then why did I find this by the bed?

188
00:10:07,986 --> 00:10:09,070
What's this?

189
00:10:27,797 --> 00:10:31,092
Oh, I was at a company workshop
in Gangwon-do last week.

190
00:10:31,426 --> 00:10:33,344
A few colleagues came by to look around.

191
00:10:33,678 --> 00:10:36,514
-Colleagues?
-You see, they were dead curious.

192
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:39,267
She must have dropped it then.

193
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:41,978
I should give it back.

194
00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:47,817
Last week, your department head
went fishing on Anmyeondo Island.

195
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:52,697
Your section chief
took his kids to Lotte World.

196
00:10:53,615 --> 00:10:54,824
Assistant Manager Jang.

197
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:58,494
He went to the wedding
of a guy he met in the army.

198
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:01,372
The Gangwon-do workshop...

199
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,917
Did you and Jenny go on your own?

200
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:11,758
Sunset Resort.

201
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:14,636
Each suite has a private pool.

202
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:18,097
You were there overnight,
so I don't need to ask what went on.

203
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,224
What do you think?

204
00:11:20,308 --> 00:11:21,643
If you keep denying it,

205
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,104
should I cause a scene at your office
like some soap opera?

206
00:11:32,862 --> 00:11:33,863
Hey.

207
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:40,787
Fine.

208
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,747
I'll come clean.

209
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,374
I'm Adam, who fell for a snake's lies.

210
00:11:44,457 --> 00:11:46,584
I partook of the forbidden fruit. So what?

211
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:49,921
"So what?"

212
00:11:50,672 --> 00:11:52,173
Why do you think I did?

213
00:11:53,132 --> 00:11:55,301
It was because I was under so much stress.

214
00:11:56,052 --> 00:11:57,887
My investors call every day
about profit margins,

215
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,889
while I'm just a newbie
with a wedding coming up.

216
00:11:59,972 --> 00:12:01,724
Don't you see how much is on my mind?

217
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:04,602
I was already on edge,
and you nagged me so much.

218
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:07,230
You called, texted, and bossed me about
with the wedding prep.

219
00:12:07,313 --> 00:12:08,731
I felt like I was being fried.

220
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:10,942
Am I getting married on my own?

221
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:13,152
I work full-time, too.

222
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:15,613
-I'm busy, too!
-I know you are!

223
00:12:15,697 --> 00:12:16,948
That's why I...

224
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,244
I'm sorry.

225
00:12:22,412 --> 00:12:23,705
I'm a jerk.

226
00:12:24,872 --> 00:12:25,957
I deserve a beating!

227
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,001
Say a number. How many slaps?

228
00:12:31,045 --> 00:12:32,714
I know you have a glib tongue.

229
00:12:34,215 --> 00:12:35,383
But not today.

230
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:38,636
I won't let you off like that today.

231
00:12:42,557 --> 00:12:45,852
Meri. Let's think rationally.

232
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,354
We booked a wedding hall,
got a marriage license,

233
00:12:48,438 --> 00:12:49,480
and rented an apartment.

234
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:51,607
Leave me, and you'll be a divorcée
even without a wedding.

235
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:53,401
Wow, isn't that so unfair?

236
00:12:53,484 --> 00:12:54,485
It is unfair!

237
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:56,320
Right? That makes zero sense.

238
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,614
That girl, Jenny...

239
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:00,908
She's just a fling.

240
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:11,419
And you and I will be together forever.

241
00:13:12,128 --> 00:13:13,755
It was a one-time mistake,

242
00:13:14,046 --> 00:13:15,631
and I ended it with her already.

243
00:13:24,182 --> 00:13:25,308
JENNY

244
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:26,642
<i>When are you coming over?</i>

245
00:13:26,726 --> 00:13:29,103
<i>I'm waiting for you in the underwear</i>
<i>you got me yesterday.</i>

246
00:13:29,187 --> 00:13:30,188
<i>Isn't it pretty?</i>

247
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,531
It's my section chief.

248
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:41,949
About tomorrow's business trip.

249
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:45,620
Did I ever ask to see your phone?

250
00:13:47,455 --> 00:13:48,539
No.

251
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,416
I have a bad feeling.

252
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:54,128
If I don't see this now,
I might doubt you forever and ever.

253
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:55,630
Move your hand.

254
00:14:06,307 --> 00:14:07,517
What are you doing?

255
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,060
It was my section chief.

256
00:14:09,143 --> 00:14:10,394
Let me see it.

257
00:14:10,478 --> 00:14:11,479
It was my section chief, okay?

258
00:14:11,562 --> 00:14:13,105
Exactly, that's why I want to see.

259
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:14,273
Why see my section chief's...

260
00:14:20,154 --> 00:14:21,239
Are you all right?

261
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:22,490
-Did he step on her hand?
-Hey.

262
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:23,574
He stomped on her hand.

263
00:14:23,658 --> 00:14:25,368
-What's going on?
-Is she okay?

264
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:29,413
Why did you try to see my phone?

265
00:14:30,122 --> 00:14:32,542
You shouldn't cross the line
however close you are with someone.

266
00:14:34,627 --> 00:14:35,711
Let's see your hand.

267
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:39,757
"The line?"

268
00:14:41,717 --> 00:14:43,511
You're the one who crossed the line.

269
00:14:44,637 --> 00:14:46,722
That apartment is ours,
and we're soon to be married.

270
00:14:47,265 --> 00:14:49,183
You brought another woman over.

271
00:14:50,685 --> 00:14:52,270
-No way.
-How could you do that?

272
00:14:52,937 --> 00:14:54,397
Is he out of his mind?

273
00:14:58,943 --> 00:15:01,821
For seven months
after you got your new job,

274
00:15:02,738 --> 00:15:05,032
you always worked late
or had a team dinner.

275
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:07,285
You were so hard to reach.

276
00:15:09,412 --> 00:15:12,164
You even forgot my birthday
and our anniversary.

277
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,043
I got fitted for a wedding dress on my own
because you were too busy.

278
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:19,630
I couldn't bear...

279
00:15:22,675 --> 00:15:25,261
the thought of letting
our five years go to waste.

280
00:15:26,971 --> 00:15:30,349
So, I told myself to ignore everything
and just marry you.

281
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:33,185
But I won't.

282
00:15:34,645 --> 00:15:37,356
I think I'll divorce you one day
even if we do get married.

283
00:15:39,483 --> 00:15:40,902
If it's bound to happen one day,

284
00:15:42,403 --> 00:15:43,696
that might as well be today.

285
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:47,658
Meri.

286
00:15:59,378 --> 00:16:01,005
She actually drenched him.

287
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:03,466
- Did you see that?
- That was insane.

288
00:16:09,847 --> 00:16:13,643
She's pretty old, you see,
and I need to sit next to her.

289
00:16:13,726 --> 00:16:15,937
- Is it for health concerns?
- Yes.

290
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,855
Could you get him to swap with me?

291
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:20,107
I'll ask the gentleman
for you.

292
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:21,901
-Will you come with me?
- Sure.

293
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:24,111
- Let's go.
- Yes, thanks.

294
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:29,367
Sir?

295
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,369
Were you assigned seat 5D?

296
00:16:32,036 --> 00:16:33,079
Yes.

297
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:34,622
This gentleman says

298
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:38,167
he was given a seat
apart from his elderly mother.

299
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,169
He'd like to know
if you could switch with him.

300
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,129
I'm so sorry.

301
00:16:42,213 --> 00:16:44,006
My mother is very old,

302
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,968
and I need to assist her
during the flight.

303
00:16:47,927 --> 00:16:49,470
Will you swap with me, sir?

304
00:16:50,054 --> 00:16:51,138
I don't want to.

305
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:54,350
My seat is also in business class.

306
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,853
Sir?

307
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:01,399
Hello?

308
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,576
<i>We have reached our destination</i>

309
00:17:12,743 --> 00:17:14,870
<i>at Incheon International Airport.</i>

310
00:17:15,663 --> 00:17:18,249
<i>When opening overhead storage</i>
<i>after the plane stops,</i>

311
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:20,876
<i>please take care to ensure</i>
<i>nothing falls out.</i>

312
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,961
Thank you.

313
00:17:25,631 --> 00:17:28,551
14 HOURS PRIOR

314
00:17:29,468 --> 00:17:32,263
The old hag's trying to run away
without selling the land,

315
00:17:32,722 --> 00:17:35,766
so I'll sit next to her
and get her to sign the papers.

316
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:39,937
My big sister in Seoul
won't let me anywhere near Mom.

317
00:17:40,021 --> 00:17:43,524
I need to get the papers signed
on the plane.

318
00:17:43,607 --> 00:17:45,359
Mom could die any day now.

319
00:17:45,443 --> 00:17:47,653
That's why I need the papers signed soon.

320
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:50,573
Ma'am.

321
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:54,201
Keep the land deeds until the day you die.

322
00:17:54,285 --> 00:17:56,328
Don't trust your son
and hand it right over.

323
00:17:56,412 --> 00:17:58,414
You can't trust anyone out there.

324
00:18:12,762 --> 00:18:14,055
I just landed.

325
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:15,222
I'm going straight to Yangyang.

326
00:18:16,348 --> 00:18:17,349
<i>You rotten fool.</i>

327
00:18:17,808 --> 00:18:19,435
Why not drop by to say hi first?

328
00:18:20,227 --> 00:18:22,480
I made a video call
before I got on the plane.

329
00:18:22,563 --> 00:18:24,440
<i>It's not that I want to see you.</i>

330
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,275
I picked too many zucchinis.

331
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:27,735
I can't eat it all.

332
00:18:27,818 --> 00:18:31,822
Put them in the freezer.
I'll eat them when I'm back.

333
00:18:31,906 --> 00:18:34,408
You never say you'll come by.

334
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:37,912
I'm scared you'll put me right to work.

335
00:18:37,995 --> 00:18:40,372
Grandma, it's my first holiday
in three years.

336
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:42,750
I'll let you off just this once.

337
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,460
Just wait until you start work.

338
00:18:44,543 --> 00:18:47,588
How can you only think about putting
your one and only grandson to work?

339
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:49,924
I spent a fortune to feed and educate you.

340
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:52,301
I have a long way to go
to make up for the tuition I invested.

341
00:18:52,384 --> 00:18:54,095
You're so calculative.

342
00:18:54,178 --> 00:18:56,430
A peddler's not a peddler
if they're not calculative.

343
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:57,723
Okay, fine.

344
00:18:58,349 --> 00:19:01,435
Good luck with the zucchinis
and sweet potatoes while I'm away.

345
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,561
See you in a month.

346
00:19:04,647 --> 00:19:05,689
I'll be in touch.

347
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:18,786
You prepared a lot of food.

348
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:21,789
-Shall I stay and eat with you?
-No.

349
00:19:22,581 --> 00:19:25,918
He survived on hamburgers
in a foreign country without his parents.

350
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:28,379
I was hoping to feed him
some home-cooked food.

351
00:21:10,231 --> 00:21:11,649
HAPPINESS

352
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,838
ONE MONTH LATER

353
00:21:34,922 --> 00:21:36,632
<i>The one-month consideration period</i>
<i>has ended,</i>

354

<i>and I confirm Kim Wooju</i>
<i>and Yoo Meri's intent to divorce.</i>

I can't believe
all the things you make me do.

356
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:52,815
Stupid me.

357
00:21:52,898 --> 00:21:55,484
I shouldn't have registered our marriage
when you asked to.

358
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:57,820
It was the only way to get your mother
to pay the housing deposit.

359
00:21:57,903 --> 00:21:59,613
Are you saying
she forced you against your will?

360
00:21:59,738 --> 00:22:01,156
-You--
-That's not true.

361
00:22:06,954 --> 00:22:09,498
-What did your mother say?
-She didn't say anything.

362
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,085
I couldn't tell her I became a divorcée
before I even walked down the aisle.

363
00:22:14,044 --> 00:22:15,296
Sorry.

364
00:22:16,463 --> 00:22:17,965
I'll tell her later when the time's right.

365
00:22:18,507 --> 00:22:20,718
I said we'd postpone the wedding
because you're busy.

366
00:22:20,801 --> 00:22:22,094
Keep that in mind.

367
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,221
Okay.

368
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:27,891
I'll vacate the apartment,
so take your stuff.

369
00:22:28,892 --> 00:22:30,102
Are you moving out?

370
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:31,812
Do you want me to live there when you...

371
00:22:31,895 --> 00:22:33,647
I took out a massive loan.

372
00:22:34,398 --> 00:22:35,399
You're right.

373
00:22:37,484 --> 00:22:39,069
You'll have much less debt, at least.

374
00:22:39,236 --> 00:22:40,654
It's a good thing we broke up.

375
00:22:41,113 --> 00:22:42,865
Sure, it's just great.

376
00:22:42,948 --> 00:22:44,742
I'm so grateful I could cry.

377
00:22:44,825 --> 00:22:46,035
I have much less debt.

378
00:22:55,502 --> 00:22:56,503
Hi, Jenny.

379
00:22:58,213 --> 00:22:59,465

380
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:01,592
Yes, I'm just about to leave.

385
00:23:15,856 --> 00:23:17,066
Yes.

386
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:18,484
Thanks for submitting it for me.

387
00:23:18,942 --> 00:23:20,194
Don't thank me.

00:23:23,947 --> 00:23:26,283
Hey, don't hate me too much.

390
00:23:27,117 --> 00:23:28,118

I got many inquiries

461
00:29:05,914 --> 00:29:07,999

462
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:11,253

in charge of the property
while she was abroad.

504
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:15,126
Without the realtor knowing,

505
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:17,295
their assistant got someone
to pretend to be the homeowner

506
00:31:17,379 --> 00:31:18,839

You have to move out,

509

will report you for trespassing.

510

I can't move out
until I get my security deposit back.

511

You need to sue the people
who conned you to get that back.

512
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:39,568
But the fake homeowner is a vagrant
who let the scammer use his identity.

I might not get my money back?

525
00:32:27,449 --> 00:32:30,660

534
00:32:49,596 --> 00:32:53,808
I picked up this time for old time's sake,
but I won't anymore, okay?

535
00:32:53,892 --> 00:32:54,893
<i>No, wait.</i>

536
00:32:55,852 --> 00:32:57,187
-Wooju, hello?

537
00:32:58,146 --> 00:32:59,522
WOOJU

538
00:33:02,984 --> 00:33:06,154
<i>The phone is off.</i>
<i>Transferring to voicemail.</i>

539
00:33:06,237 --> 00:33:07,572
Oh, no.

540
00:33:09,658 --> 00:33:12,035
What do I do?

541
00:33:17,707 --> 00:33:19,000
He's right.

542
00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:24,839
We are complete strangers now.

543
00:33:26,716 --> 00:33:27,801
But even so.

544
00:33:28,343 --> 00:33:30,345
We only just broke up.

545
00:33:31,304 --> 00:33:32,973
Is that all he could say?

546
00:33:34,891 --> 00:33:37,602
I haven't even submitted
our divorce decree.

547
00:33:51,324 --> 00:33:52,325
If not for you,

548
00:33:53,493 --> 00:33:56,329
I wouldn't even have
rented that apartment.

549
00:33:56,413 --> 00:33:58,790
And now you're turning your back on me?

550
00:33:59,624 --> 00:34:01,334
What am I to do now?

551
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,511
MOM

552
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,688
Hi, Mom.

553
00:34:21,771 --> 00:34:23,648
Hey, Meri.

554
00:34:23,732 --> 00:34:26,526
I braised some yellow croaker
and seasoned some cucumbers.

555
00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:27,944
Wooju's parents haven't moved, right?

556
00:34:28,028 --> 00:34:29,029
What?

557
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,615
You don't have to send them food.

558
00:34:33,116 --> 00:34:35,952
Let's keep the good food to ourselves.

559
00:34:36,036 --> 00:34:38,788
Why cook for them?
It's extra work for you.

560
00:34:38,872 --> 00:34:41,958
I made a little extra while I was at it.

561
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:44,711
Cooking a bit more food
doesn't wear my hands or feet.

562
00:34:44,794 --> 00:34:47,005
Just don't send them anything.

563
00:34:47,964 --> 00:34:50,341
Why would you keep sending them stuff?

564
00:34:50,425 --> 00:34:51,509
MERI

565
00:34:53,053 --> 00:34:54,137
What's up with you?

566
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,347
Do they not like my food?

567
00:34:57,182 --> 00:35:00,268
No, it's not that.

568
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:02,812
There's nothing else I can do for them.

569
00:35:02,896 --> 00:35:05,315
I want to do what I can for you and them.

570
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:08,902
I can only do this while I'm still able.

571
00:35:08,985 --> 00:35:10,153
I don't have much longer.

572
00:35:11,154 --> 00:35:15,033
My shoulders are beginning
to ache, you know.

573
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,618
-Mom.

574
00:35:19,788 --> 00:35:21,039
I'm sorry.

575
00:35:21,122 --> 00:35:22,290
<i>What the heck?</i>

576
00:35:22,832 --> 00:35:27,045
<i>Have you finally grown up</i>
<i>now that it's time to get married?</i>

577
00:35:29,214 --> 00:35:30,215
Meri.

578
00:35:30,715 --> 00:35:33,968
Don't think too much and go to bed.

579
00:35:35,011 --> 00:35:37,472
I have to watch my favorite show. Bye.

580
00:35:38,348 --> 00:35:39,349
Okay, bye.

581
00:35:55,615 --> 00:35:57,117
CHEONGHUN 1-GA

582
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,868
<i>You went off course.</i>

583
00:35:58,952 --> 00:36:00,995
-What?
<i>-Rerouting.</i>

584
00:36:01,996 --> 00:36:03,373
Oh, geez.

585
00:36:03,873 --> 00:36:06,751
<i>Turn right at the next corner.</i>

586
00:36:20,974 --> 00:36:22,559
WOOJU

587
00:36:24,811 --> 00:36:26,604
Kim Wooju, you punk.

588
00:36:31,734 --> 00:36:34,988
Why did it send me this way?

589
00:36:41,661 --> 00:36:42,662
My goodness...

590
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:45,623
<i>Go straight for 150 meters and turn right.</i>

591
00:36:56,885 --> 00:36:57,886
What was that?

592
00:37:04,976 --> 00:37:06,186
Are you all right?

593
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:14,194
I'm fine.

594
00:37:15,737 --> 00:37:16,946
Are you really fine?

595
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,782
I'm fine. It hurts a bit, but I'm okay.

596
00:37:19,866 --> 00:37:21,743
Let's go to a hospital just in case.

597
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,037
I'm good.

598
00:37:25,538 --> 00:37:27,290
I'll give you my number, then.

599
00:37:27,373 --> 00:37:28,708
See a doctor, then call me.

600
00:37:30,043 --> 00:37:31,753
What a hassle.

601
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:45,433
Here you go.

602
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:46,851
Thank you.

603
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:48,978
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

604
00:37:58,238 --> 00:37:59,572
KIM WOOJU

605
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:01,491
"Kim Wooju"?

606
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:17,257
Yes, that's my name.

607
00:38:25,306 --> 00:38:26,641
You piece of dirt.

608
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:30,103
Why did you ignore my calls?

609
00:38:30,812 --> 00:38:32,105
-Me?

610
00:38:32,355 --> 00:38:33,481
You punk!

611
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:35,858
Do you think avoiding me will work?

612
00:38:36,985 --> 00:38:39,112
Why would I avoid you? I'm not like that.

613
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:45,660
You're not?

614
00:38:47,495 --> 00:38:48,663
Take responsibility, then.

615
00:38:48,746 --> 00:38:50,039
"Take responsibility?"

616
00:38:50,123 --> 00:38:51,124
Aah!

617
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:53,251
You want a settlement?

618
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:55,753
Whatever. Hand it over right now.

619
00:38:55,837 --> 00:38:56,921
Fine.

620
00:38:57,005 --> 00:38:58,548
How much do you want?

621
00:38:59,549 --> 00:39:00,550
A hundred million won.

622
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:03,928
-A hundred million won?
-Yes, that's right.

623
00:39:04,262 --> 00:39:06,347
What is wrong with you?

624
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:07,682
Do you take me for a pushover?

625
00:39:07,765 --> 00:39:09,309
-You're being unreasonable.

626
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:11,060
You're the unreasonable one.

627
00:39:11,144 --> 00:39:12,312
Do as I say.

628
00:39:12,395 --> 00:39:13,521
-Hand it over.
-What?

629
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:15,148
It's my mom's money.

630
00:39:15,231 --> 00:39:17,400
Hand it over, punk.

631
00:39:17,483 --> 00:39:18,484
You're insane.

632
00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:25,033
Why are you asking me
for the money to give to your mom?

633
00:39:27,618 --> 00:39:28,953
Where do you think you're going?

634
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,082
Where are you going?

635
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:36,210
What do you think you're doing?

636
00:39:37,086 --> 00:39:38,880
Get out of my car.

637
00:39:39,339 --> 00:39:40,465
I won't.

638
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:46,888
What the...

639
00:39:47,972 --> 00:39:49,474
Drive on.

640
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:50,725
My goodness.

641
00:39:59,108 --> 00:40:01,152
Why are you so strong?

642
00:40:02,528 --> 00:40:03,613
-Get out.
-No.

643
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:06,783
Get out.

644
00:40:09,577 --> 00:40:10,870
Come here.

645
00:40:11,621 --> 00:40:13,748
-Will you stop it?
-Get out already.

646
00:40:13,831 --> 00:40:15,124
Leave me alone.

647
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:16,459
-Stop it.

648
00:40:17,335 --> 00:40:18,419
Darn you.

649
00:40:28,346 --> 00:40:31,265
If you don't stop this,
I'll call the police.

650
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:35,978
Hey, you.

651
00:40:43,194 --> 00:40:45,113
What are you doing now?

652
00:40:45,196 --> 00:40:46,364
You can't go.

653
00:40:47,323 --> 00:40:49,784
Why do you keep trying to get away?

654
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:54,872
-Is she crazy?
-Shouldn't we stop her?

655
00:40:54,956 --> 00:40:56,040
You want to run away?

656
00:40:56,124 --> 00:40:57,542
Hey, are you seeing this?

657
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:58,626
Should we do something?

658
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:00,002
-What's wrong with her?
-I don't know.

659
00:41:13,933 --> 00:41:15,101
Hey.

660
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:18,980
Aren't you being too hard on me?

661
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:24,610
You cheated on me.

662
00:41:25,403 --> 00:41:28,281
What makes you think you're in the right?

663
00:41:28,364 --> 00:41:31,951
-What?
-Why are you doing this to me?

664
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:35,913
Why are you making me do this?

665
00:41:37,623 --> 00:41:39,750
I became a divorcée

666
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:42,295
without ever getting
to walk down the aisle.

667
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:45,631
My mom...

668
00:41:45,715 --> 00:41:48,217
It will break her poor heart.

669
00:41:49,469 --> 00:41:51,929
What about my mom?

670
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:56,642
I can't tell her the truth.

671
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:03,107
Mom...

672
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:09,030
Mom, what should I do?

673
00:42:09,822 --> 00:42:11,824
Mom...

674
00:42:12,867 --> 00:42:14,285
Hey, are you all right?

675
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:16,704
You...

676
00:42:17,371 --> 00:42:18,873
I don't think you are.

677
00:42:21,459 --> 00:42:22,502
You're...

678
00:42:42,897 --> 00:42:45,441
-It hurts!
-You...

679
00:42:48,444 --> 00:42:49,445
Come here.

680
00:42:50,488 --> 00:42:52,823
Help me.

681
00:42:52,907 --> 00:42:54,283
Why would you...

682
00:43:11,634 --> 00:43:13,302
- How many did we get?

683
00:43:13,386 --> 00:43:15,012
A total of 17.

684
00:43:15,096 --> 00:43:16,347
Did we get everything?

685
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,640
There's one more over there.

686
00:43:17,723 --> 00:43:19,016
Oh, here it is.

687
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:30,278
We're done.

688
00:43:31,279 --> 00:43:33,239
Don't shower for the next two days.

689
00:43:33,322 --> 00:43:35,366
I'll prescribe you
a painkiller and antibiotics.

690
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:36,993
Okay.

691
00:43:39,412 --> 00:43:41,080
Hey, how did it happen?

692
00:43:41,163 --> 00:43:42,582
Wasn't she drunk?

693
00:43:42,665 --> 00:43:45,001
She reeked of alcohol.

694
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:47,461
How could you confuse

695
00:43:47,545 --> 00:43:49,255
a cactus for a stool
because you were drunk?

696
00:43:49,338 --> 00:43:52,133
Sitting on a cactus must be so painful.

697
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,828
It'll throb for a few days,
but she'll be fine.

698
00:44:22,038 --> 00:44:24,498
It's usually a job for the interns,

699
00:44:24,582 --> 00:44:26,709
but I did it myself because you asked.

700
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:29,086
Thanks, Jingyeong.

701
00:44:29,587 --> 00:44:32,131
-You were the first to come to mind.
-What?

702
00:44:32,214 --> 00:44:33,883
Only when you need help?

703
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:36,177
You've been back for a month,
and you never called.

704
00:44:37,345 --> 00:44:38,471
How did you know I was back?

705
00:44:38,554 --> 00:44:41,515
My dad is your grandmother's doctor.

706
00:44:42,308 --> 00:44:43,893
He heard it during her checkup.

707
00:44:43,976 --> 00:44:45,186
Aah!

708
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:46,562
So...

709
00:44:47,188 --> 00:44:49,357
Who is that woman?

710
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,483
Your girlfriend?

711
00:44:50,566 --> 00:44:51,901
It didn't seem so.

712
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:52,985
My girlfriend?

713
00:44:53,486 --> 00:44:54,945
As if she'd be my girlfriend.

714
00:44:55,738 --> 00:44:58,032
She's just some drunk I met in the street.

715
00:44:58,115 --> 00:44:59,408
She bumped into my car.

716
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:03,287
You did that to her?

717
00:45:03,746 --> 00:45:05,623
What? Well, no.

718
00:45:06,624 --> 00:45:08,125
It's a long story.

719
00:45:08,209 --> 00:45:09,460
I'll tell you another time.

720
00:45:10,211 --> 00:45:13,089
Do you work late all the time?

721
00:45:13,756 --> 00:45:16,050
Yes, I'm preparing for a conference,

722
00:45:16,133 --> 00:45:18,052
so I have to stay up for a whole week.

723
00:45:21,389 --> 00:45:22,598
I'm so tired.

724
00:45:25,226 --> 00:45:27,353
Cover your mouth when you yawn.

725
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,235
Wooju.

726
00:45:35,903 --> 00:45:38,197
I treated her, so you owe me a coffee.

727
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,281
A coffee?

728
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:40,783
Sounds good.

729
00:45:45,788 --> 00:45:47,790
What's wrong with her?

730
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:49,375
I told her to get an X-ray.

731
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:53,295
Hey, Jingyeong.

732
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:54,714
The coffee has to wait.

733
00:45:55,339 --> 00:45:56,590
Wooju.

734
00:45:57,258 --> 00:45:58,801
Kim Wooju!

735
00:46:01,387 --> 00:46:03,305
Couldn't he even stay for a coffee?

736
00:46:15,401 --> 00:46:17,945
I could take a taxi.

737
00:46:19,655 --> 00:46:20,656
And sit like that?

738
00:46:24,744 --> 00:46:27,121
You must've been so flustered earlier.

739
00:46:27,204 --> 00:46:29,832
The alcohol must've made me lose my mind.

740
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,586
I know you thought I was a weirdo.

741
00:46:35,129 --> 00:46:38,799
To be honest, I had a bad day today.

742
00:46:38,883 --> 00:46:41,969
I can't go into detail
since we just met, but...

743
00:46:43,179 --> 00:46:44,764
I mistook you for someone else.

744
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:47,057
You happened to have the same name.

745
00:46:51,312 --> 00:46:55,775
By the way,
I don't need to get an arm X-ray.

746
00:46:57,067 --> 00:46:59,320
-It was just a slight bump...

747
00:47:02,782 --> 00:47:05,951
I smell the alcohol whenever you talk.

748
00:47:06,911 --> 00:47:07,953
I feel dizzy.

749
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,011
Excuse me.

750
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:25,221
I'm really sorry,

751
00:47:25,763 --> 00:47:26,931
but could you pull over?

752
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:29,391
What for?

753
00:47:29,475 --> 00:47:31,560
Going backwards gives me motion sickness.

754
00:47:31,644 --> 00:47:33,521
Seriously?

755
00:47:35,272 --> 00:47:36,565
Fine.

756
00:47:36,649 --> 00:47:37,650
Thank you.

757
00:48:08,806 --> 00:48:09,932
Are you all right?

758
00:48:33,998 --> 00:48:35,791
The sun is rising.

759
00:48:39,879 --> 00:48:42,381
It's like a red flower...

760
00:48:44,884 --> 00:48:47,177
blooming through the dark.

761
00:48:51,557 --> 00:48:54,018
Even though my world crumbles,

762
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:56,395
the sun still rises,

763
00:48:57,479 --> 00:48:59,773
and morning still comes.

764
00:49:04,612 --> 00:49:07,281
There's always a way out, right?

765
00:49:11,243 --> 00:49:14,747
It feels as if Mother Nature...

766
00:49:16,707 --> 00:49:19,209
is giving me a message.

767
00:49:26,467 --> 00:49:28,260
The message must be "feed me."

768
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:36,268
I'm the type...

769
00:49:38,437 --> 00:49:41,315
who must eat breakfast every morning.

770
00:49:42,816 --> 00:49:44,693
Would you like to get breakfast?

771
00:49:44,777 --> 00:49:45,945
It'll be my treat.

772
00:49:46,028 --> 00:49:47,988
I know a good hangover soup place nearby.

773
00:49:48,072 --> 00:49:49,406
No, thanks.

774
00:49:49,949 --> 00:49:50,950
Let's go.

775
00:49:51,033 --> 00:49:52,326
Okay.

776
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:29,488
Thank you.

777
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:35,244
About your arm.

778
00:50:36,537 --> 00:50:39,039
You should get it checked.

779
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:40,290
Don't complain about it later.

780
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:41,792
Okay.

781
00:50:42,251 --> 00:50:44,378
Thanks so much for everything today.

782
00:50:44,878 --> 00:50:47,506
Text me your account details.
I'll wire you the gas--

783
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:10,529
What is wrong with me?

784
00:51:13,073 --> 00:51:14,408
Oh, whatever.

785
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:20,330
It hurts.

786
00:51:28,467 --> 00:51:32,345
<i>Where every step</i>
<i>and every breath carries elegance.</i>

787
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,973
<i>Where life becomes art.</i>

788
00:51:37,267 --> 00:51:39,144
<i>It's Beauté Palace.</i>

789
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,105
Beauté Department Store's
wedding festival

790
00:51:42,189 --> 00:51:44,191
is for newlyweds
who want a great beginning.

791
00:51:44,274 --> 00:51:46,777
A Beauté Palace unit
worth five million dollars

792
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,112
you just saw in the video
is the grand prize.

793
00:51:49,196 --> 00:51:50,238
Yes, that's right.

794
00:51:50,322 --> 00:51:52,282
It's Beauté Construction's
ambitious new project,

795
00:51:52,365 --> 00:51:54,910
a high-end luxury town house.

796
00:51:54,993 --> 00:51:58,497
It gathered a lot of attention,
and so many entered the raffle.

797
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,917
The couple that wins the apartment
must be so pleased.

798
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,544
I'd have delayed my wedding
if only I'd known.

799
00:52:04,628 --> 00:52:06,588
I'm so sad I'm not a newlywed!

800
00:52:08,256 --> 00:52:10,300
-Shall we pick the winners?
-Yes.

801
00:52:15,222 --> 00:52:17,682
<i>Everyone wants one of these at home.</i>

802
00:52:17,766 --> 00:52:20,477
<i>A must-have</i>
<i>for the fashion-conscious, a styler!</i>

803
00:52:21,436 --> 00:52:23,772
Why make a huge fuss when it's rigged?

804
00:52:24,689 --> 00:52:26,733
It must look real to avoid complaints.

805
00:52:27,943 --> 00:52:28,944
You think?

806
00:52:30,445 --> 00:52:32,030
I'm sure you took care of it.

807
00:52:32,114 --> 00:52:33,448
<i>Congratulations.</i>

808
00:52:33,532 --> 00:52:34,658
What do I do now?

809
00:52:35,325 --> 00:52:36,535
<i>One, zero,</i>

810
00:52:37,577 --> 00:52:39,621
<i>seven, three!</i>

811
00:52:39,704 --> 00:52:41,832
<i>Ha Minyeong, congratulations!</i>

812
00:52:41,915 --> 00:52:43,625

The mayor's wife's nephew?

815
00:52:46,878 --> 00:52:48,463
Yes, that's right.

816
00:53:03,854 --> 00:53:04,855
In case I get mixed up.

817
00:53:08,859 --> 00:53:12,154
Beauté Department Store's
30th anniversary wedding festival.

818
00:53:12,237 --> 00:53:16,199
It's time to select
the winner of the grand prize.

819
00:53:16,283 --> 00:53:19,161
Let's not waste time and get right to it.

820
00:53:19,244 --> 00:53:23,707
Beauté Department Store's CEO
will select the grand prize winner.

821
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:25,167
Sir! Come on up.

822
00:54:05,624 --> 00:54:08,752
Our CEO is doing his best
to select the right winner.

823
00:54:11,129 --> 00:54:12,339
Give him some applause!

824
00:54:30,523 --> 00:54:31,775
He picked a ticket at last.

825
00:54:32,567 --> 00:54:35,111
The grand prize,
the Beauté Palace unit goes to...

826
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:36,613
Please announce the winner.

827
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,786
As the CEO of Beauté Department Store,
I will announce the winner myself.

828
00:54:43,703 --> 00:54:44,704
The grand prize winner is...

829
00:55:19,322 --> 00:55:20,532
Hello?

830
00:55:21,574 --> 00:55:22,617
Is this Ms. Yoo Meri?

831
00:55:22,701 --> 00:55:25,120
This is Beauté Department Store's PR Team.

832
00:55:28,123 --> 00:55:29,207
A raffle?

833
00:55:30,834 --> 00:55:33,086
What raffle do you mean?

834
00:55:33,169 --> 00:55:36,214
2 MONTHS AGO

835
00:55:37,841 --> 00:55:39,217
Sorry.

If I win,
I'll spend the rest of my life...

839
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,320
No, I'll do good even in the afterlife.

840
00:56:15,003 --> 00:56:16,421
Oh, that.

841
00:56:17,797 --> 00:56:19,341
I won?

842
00:56:20,467 --> 00:56:21,468
What?

843
00:56:22,344 --> 00:56:23,553
Yes.

844
00:56:23,636 --> 00:56:26,097
Yes, that's me. I'm Yoo Meri.

845
00:56:27,182 --> 00:56:29,017
Yes, of course. I'm sure it's me.

846
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,102
Congratulations, Ms. Yoo.

847
00:56:31,186 --> 00:56:32,937
I need to confirm your identity.

848
00:56:33,021 --> 00:56:35,231
Can you send us a few documents?

849
00:56:36,066 --> 00:56:37,108
Oh, documents.

850
00:56:37,192 --> 00:56:38,777
Yes, of course, I'll send them.

851
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:40,236
Give me a moment.

852
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:46,910
Yes, I'm ready.

853
00:56:46,993 --> 00:56:48,411
<i>A copy of your ID card.</i>

854
00:56:48,495 --> 00:56:49,954
A copy of my ID.

855
00:56:50,872 --> 00:56:52,123
<i>Proof that you don't own a home.</i>

856
00:56:52,374 --> 00:56:54,876
Proof that I don't own a home.

857
00:56:56,044 --> 00:56:57,420
Proof of income,

858
00:56:57,504 --> 00:56:59,589
and proof of marriage. That's it.

859
00:56:59,672 --> 00:57:01,132
Proof of...

860
00:57:01,216 --> 00:57:03,176
-Proof of marriage?
<i>-Yes.</i>

861
00:57:03,259 --> 00:57:06,304
To be eligible to win, you must make
less than 80 million won a year

862
00:57:06,388 --> 00:57:08,431
and be newlyweds who don't own a home.

863
00:57:09,891 --> 00:57:12,268
Yes, okay. I understand.

864
00:57:12,769 --> 00:57:13,770
Bye.

865
00:57:18,858 --> 00:57:20,151
Proof of marriage?

866
00:57:22,362 --> 00:57:23,571
Will they cancel my win

867
00:57:24,572 --> 00:57:26,366
if I say I'm divorced?

868
00:57:31,246 --> 00:57:32,330
I didn't hand that thing in.

869
00:57:40,505 --> 00:57:41,756
SEOUL FAMILY COURT

870
00:57:44,592 --> 00:57:46,052
DIVORCE DECREE

871
00:57:46,136 --> 00:57:47,303
I still have it.

872
00:57:53,518 --> 00:57:55,645
Since I haven't handed it in yet...

873
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:57,230
FAMILY REGISTRATION DETAILS

874
00:57:59,482 --> 00:58:00,733
SPOUSE: KIM WOOJU

875
00:58:04,154 --> 00:58:05,655
I'm still legally married.

876
00:58:09,576 --> 00:58:10,702
THIS DOCUMENT CERTIFIES THE ABOVE DETAILS

877
00:58:22,255 --> 00:58:24,340
I checked everything thoroughly.

878
00:58:25,008 --> 00:58:27,343
They're newlyweds
who got married five months ago,

879
00:58:27,427 --> 00:58:28,636
don't own a home,

880
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,305
and their income meets the criteria, too.

881
00:58:30,388 --> 00:58:32,682
She meets every requirement completely.

882
00:58:35,393 --> 00:58:38,062
Shall we go ahead with the award ceremony?

883
00:58:38,938 --> 00:58:40,482
Our CEO should attend as well.

884
00:58:40,565 --> 00:58:41,691
-Postpone it for now.
-Okay.

885
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,944
What? To when?

886
00:58:48,156 --> 00:58:51,409
Well, Yoo Meri said
her husband couldn't come.

887
00:58:51,493 --> 00:58:54,537
If we push back the ceremony,
I need to ask her if they'll be free.

888
00:58:55,455 --> 00:58:56,623
Her husband can't come?

889
00:58:58,374 --> 00:58:59,459
Why not?

890
00:58:59,542 --> 00:59:02,420
I talked to her on the phone earlier.

891
00:59:03,338 --> 00:59:05,048
Yes, I got all the documents.

892
00:59:06,216 --> 00:59:09,010
Will your husband be abroad for a while?

893
00:59:09,093 --> 00:59:10,303
Well...

894
00:59:11,638 --> 00:59:13,348
I don't see why you can't come alone.

895
00:59:13,431 --> 00:59:15,600
-That's a no.
-What?

896
00:59:15,683 --> 00:59:17,477
Didn't you read the fine print?

897
00:59:20,146 --> 00:59:22,023
The fine print?

898
00:59:22,106 --> 00:59:26,027
Yes, I just noticed the fine print
of the terms and conditions.

899
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:27,237
"The win will be canceled

900
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,031
if it turns out they lied
on any of the documents,

901
00:59:30,114 --> 00:59:33,409
and the winner will be held
legally responsible."

902
00:59:36,746 --> 00:59:37,997
And also...

903
00:59:39,457 --> 00:59:43,211
"The winner must actively participate in
any company promotions,

904
00:59:43,294 --> 00:59:46,548
and they must attend
the award ceremony as a couple."

905
00:59:46,631 --> 00:59:47,715
That's a must.

906
00:59:47,799 --> 00:59:49,175
There are no exceptions.

907
00:59:49,676 --> 00:59:50,718
What?

908
00:59:51,302 --> 00:59:54,222
You said earlier today
that it wouldn't matter.

909
00:59:54,305 --> 00:59:55,431
Why the sudden change?

910
00:59:56,683 --> 00:59:59,894
What happens if my husband can't make it?

911
01:00:03,189 --> 01:00:04,315
Then it will be canceled.

912
01:00:04,399 --> 01:00:07,068
It'll be canceled? That's not fair.

913
01:00:07,151 --> 01:00:09,237
I won the raffle. You just need me.

914
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,155
Who cares if my husband's there or not?

915
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:12,365
That's the rule.

916
01:00:13,074 --> 01:00:14,075
That's the rule.

917
01:00:14,158 --> 01:00:15,451
There's nothing I can do.

918
01:00:16,077 --> 01:00:17,161
Ah!

919
01:00:19,455 --> 01:00:21,374
CEO YOO MERI

920
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:23,585
Okay, I got it for now.

921
01:00:23,668 --> 01:00:25,712
I'll be in touch.

922
01:00:30,717 --> 01:00:33,469
What kind of rule is that?

923
01:00:34,762 --> 01:00:35,930
This is madness.

924
01:00:45,481 --> 01:00:46,482
Give me a kiss.

925
01:00:48,026 --> 01:00:49,027
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

926
01:00:49,277 --> 01:00:51,029

01:01:00,246 --> 01:01:01,581
-Hello?

930
01:01:04,584 --> 01:01:07,170
It's me. I can't seem to reach you.

931
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,841
I have something urgent to discuss.
Can you call me quickly?

932
01:01:13,593 --> 01:01:15,261
It's really important.

933
01:01:16,054 --> 01:01:19,307
I won a lucky draw kind of thing.

934
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:24,854
This is paradise.

935
01:01:27,231 --> 01:01:28,232
Hey, baby.

936
01:01:29,233 --> 01:01:30,234
You're back.

937
01:01:31,694 --> 01:01:32,695
My cutie.

938
01:01:35,281 --> 01:01:36,324
Aren't you hungry?

939
01:01:36,407 --> 01:01:38,242
-Are you hungry, Jenny?
-Yes.

940
01:01:38,743 --> 01:01:40,370
-Shall we go eat?
-Yes.

941
01:01:41,913 --> 01:01:42,997
NEW MESSAGE

942
01:01:45,792 --> 01:01:46,876

MERI

944
01:01:49,462 --> 01:01:50,672
Who is it from?

945
01:01:52,924 --> 01:01:53,925
It's a spam message.

Okay.

950

WOOJU

951
01:02:09,148 --> 01:02:10,692
<i>The call cannot be connected.</i>

952
01:02:10,775 --> 01:02:12,777
<i>Transferring to voicemail.</i>

953
01:02:14,987 --> 01:02:18,282
Come on. Pick up.

954
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:24,622
I can't do anything
if I can't talk to you.

955
01:02:33,965 --> 01:02:35,508
<i>It's as good as out of my reach.</i>

956
01:02:36,843 --> 01:02:38,219
It's a pie in the sky.

957
01:02:48,354 --> 01:02:49,522
<i>This is Kim Wooju.</i>

958
01:02:50,148 --> 01:02:52,191
<i>I was wondering if you went to the doctor.</i>

959
01:02:52,275 --> 01:02:54,902
No, I was too busy to...

960
01:02:57,405 --> 01:02:59,532
NO, I WAS TOO BUSY TO

961
01:03:01,075 --> 01:03:03,244
KIM WOOJU

962
01:03:16,632 --> 01:03:20,470

KIM WOOJU

964
01:03:32,565 --> 01:03:33,900
KIM WOOJU

965
01:03:33,983 --> 01:03:35,318
He has the same name.

966
01:03:36,486 --> 01:03:39,572
The department store people
won't know if I bring someone else.

967
01:03:40,615 --> 01:03:41,949
They've never seen him.

968
01:04:03,346 --> 01:04:04,430
What did the doctor say?

969
01:04:04,889 --> 01:04:05,973
Did you get a doctor's note?

970
01:04:06,849 --> 01:04:08,059
Oh, the doctor.

971
01:04:10,102 --> 01:04:11,979
I was too busy to see one.

972
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:21,847
Are you perhaps married?

973
01:04:23,282 --> 01:04:24,283
I'm sorry?

974
01:04:25,284 --> 01:04:28,162
Are you a married man?

975
01:04:29,121 --> 01:04:30,122
No, why?

976
01:04:30,581 --> 01:04:32,750
That's a relief.

977
01:04:32,834 --> 01:04:33,835
What is?

978
01:04:34,794 --> 01:04:37,421
I gave it a lot of thought.

979
01:04:38,047 --> 01:04:42,426
I know it's rash to say this
when we've only met once,

980
01:04:43,135 --> 01:04:44,929
but you're the only one I can turn to.

981
01:04:48,724 --> 01:04:50,476
Could you...

982
01:04:52,353 --> 01:04:53,646
be my husband?

983
01:05:39,108 --> 01:05:41,777
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

984
01:05:41,861 --> 01:05:43,571
<i>You'll pay me</i>
<i>to play your fake husband</i>

985
01:05:43,654 --> 01:05:44,947
-for a day?
- Yes.

986
01:05:45,031 --> 01:05:48,701
<i>I'm not kind enough</i>
<i>to be generous to a scammer.</i>

987
01:05:48,784 --> 01:05:49,994
<i>The husband must be present.</i>

988
01:05:50,077 --> 01:05:51,245
Otherwise, we'll redraw.

989
01:05:51,329 --> 01:05:53,122
-Are they in?
<i>-</i> <i>They'll call after discussing.</i>

990
01:05:53,205 --> 01:05:55,249
<i>You quit as team leader if you fail.</i>

991
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:58,336
<i>I lost everything in a rental con,</i>
<i>but I won a five-million-dollar house.</i>

992
01:05:58,419 --> 01:06:00,796
<i>-I just need a husband to tag along.</i>
-You won a prize?

993
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,423
So, that's what this is all about.

994
01:06:02,506 --> 01:06:05,593
Do you have any idea
how risky this scam is?

995
01:06:05,676 --> 01:06:06,802
It's me. How have you been?

996
01:06:06,886 --> 01:06:08,012
<i>I'm in Seoul.</i>

997
01:06:08,095 --> 01:06:09,805
I'm one of the residents here.

998
01:06:09,889 --> 01:06:12,808
-Over there?
-That one?
