CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED

00:00:10,104 --> 00:00:11,791
ANIMALS WERE FILMED
UNDER EXPERT SUPERVISION AND WELFARE RULES

00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:29,013
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>Are you trying to make me mad, son?</i>

7
00:00:29,097 --> 00:00:30,098
<i>- Honey!</i>
- <i>Will you stop?</i>

8
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:31,599
<i>I told you it's my teacher's.</i>

9
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:35,705
Please help me.

10
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,181
<i>This is Kim Wooju.</i>

11
00:01:53,264 --> 00:01:54,974
<i>I was wondering if you went to the doctor.</i>

12
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:59,312
Maybe I should ask him.

13
00:01:59,896 --> 00:02:01,731
He has the same name.

14
00:02:05,443 --> 00:02:08,071
Jingyeong, can you help me?

15
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,698
Someone needs medical attention.

16
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,747
BUS STOP

17
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:22,961
Which way are you headed?

18
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,921
Right.

19
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,799
He didn't seem like a weirdo.

20
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:34,973
I only need him briefly
at the ceremony.

21
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:36,229
KIM WOOJU

00:02:39,899 --> 00:02:40,900
CALLING

CACTUS

24
00:03:01,546 --> 00:03:04,465
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:06,134
EPISODE 2

26
00:03:06,217 --> 00:03:08,803
What did the doctor say?
Did you get a doctor's note?

27
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:10,763
Oh, the doctor.

28
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:14,892
I was too busy to see one.

29
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:24,485
Are you perhaps married?

30
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,071
I'm sorry?

31
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:30,992
Are you a married man?

32
00:03:31,951 --> 00:03:32,952
No, why?

33
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:35,580
That's a relief.

34
00:03:35,663 --> 00:03:36,664
What is?

35
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,043
I gave it a lot of thought.

36
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:45,298
I know it's rash to say this
when we've only met once,

37
00:03:45,965 --> 00:03:47,759
but you're the only one I can turn to.

38
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:53,222
Could you...

39
00:03:55,224 --> 00:03:56,893
be my husband?

40
00:04:06,903 --> 00:04:08,154
Your... your husband?

41
00:04:08,237 --> 00:04:11,449
Of course, I don't mean it for real.

42
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:14,827
You'd be my husband for one day.

43
00:04:14,911 --> 00:04:19,207
I was wondering
if you could play my husband.

44
00:04:19,499 --> 00:04:21,542
Is this a joke?

45
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:24,253
I thought this was
about your medical bills.

46
00:04:24,754 --> 00:04:25,963
No, wait!

47
00:04:27,882 --> 00:04:28,925
Sorry about that.

48
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:32,386
This isn't a joke,
and I haven't lost my mind.

49
00:04:33,638 --> 00:04:35,765
It's really urgent, that's all.

50
00:04:36,307 --> 00:04:40,019
It'd take at least four days
to tell you my whole story.

51
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,397
But my life literally depends on this.

52
00:04:47,276 --> 00:04:49,278
I'll hear you out, then.

53
00:04:49,987 --> 00:04:51,364
Oh, thanks.

54
00:04:52,532 --> 00:04:56,202
I need a husband for a particular reason.

55
00:04:56,285 --> 00:04:58,121
He has to come with me somewhere.

56
00:04:58,204 --> 00:04:59,831
- Where?
- The department store.

57
00:04:59,914 --> 00:05:02,625
- To shop?
- It's not that.

58
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:04,710
Uh...

59
00:05:06,546 --> 00:05:08,172
<i>Should I tell him about the prize?</i>

60
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,342
<i>I don't want word to get out.</i>

61
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:16,139
I'll tell you the details

62
00:05:17,473 --> 00:05:19,517
once you agree to help me.

63
00:05:19,976 --> 00:05:22,103
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

64
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:26,274
How can I help you
without knowing when, why, and how?

65
00:05:26,357 --> 00:05:27,859
I have my own life, too.

66
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:29,777
Oh, of course.

67
00:05:30,945 --> 00:05:32,530
It'll be this Saturday at 3:00 p.m.

68
00:05:32,613 --> 00:05:34,866
You can meet me
at Beauté Department Store.

69
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:36,075
Hmm...

70
00:05:37,743 --> 00:05:40,121
All I have to do is
pretend to be your husband?

71
00:05:40,204 --> 00:05:41,330
That's right.

72
00:05:42,373 --> 00:05:44,041
It won't even take that long.

73
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,546
I'll offer compensation
that'll make your time worthwhile.

74
00:05:49,046 --> 00:05:50,131
How much?

75
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:57,346
A hundred million won?

76
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,514
A hundred million won?

77
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:00,892
That's a bit too much.

78
00:06:00,975 --> 00:06:03,686
How come?
I thought that was your base rate.

79
00:06:04,187 --> 00:06:06,063
How much do you want?

80
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:08,399
A hundred million won.

81
00:06:10,234 --> 00:06:11,652
Oh, that night?

82
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:13,237
Sorry about that.

83
00:06:13,321 --> 00:06:16,199
I was so drunk
that I mistook you for someone else.

84
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:20,036
You still seem drunk,
judging by how you're taking me for.

85
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:25,416
You'll pay me
to play your fake husband for a day?

86
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:28,878
It's easy to picture
how this will play out.

87
00:06:34,508 --> 00:06:35,509
Hubby!

88
00:06:35,593 --> 00:06:37,511
How dare you lock lips with my wife?

89
00:06:37,595 --> 00:06:40,932
<i>You want me to catch you in the act
and collect a settlement from a guy.</i>

90
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:42,183
Is that it?

91
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:43,351
A settlement?

92
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:44,894
Aren't you doing this for money?

93
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:48,439
I guess you could say money is involved.

94
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:49,649
See? I knew it.

95
00:06:49,732 --> 00:06:52,735
- You want to shake down some poor guy.
- What?

96
00:06:52,818 --> 00:06:54,028
But look here,

97
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:56,572
aren't you too young
to be doing things like this?

98
00:06:56,656 --> 00:06:59,492
Think about finding work
and earning decent money,

99
00:06:59,575 --> 00:07:00,826
rather than planning a shakedown.

100
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,995
You have it all wrong. I--

101
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:06,707
That dirty scam of yours will never work.

102
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,585
I usually don't bother
with others' business,

103
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:12,004
but I can't let con artists
have their way.

104
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:14,507
Saturday, 3:00 p.m.,
at Beauté Department Store?

105
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:16,050
I'll remember that.

106
00:07:16,676 --> 00:07:19,845
You'll pay for it
if you try anything funny.

107
00:07:21,055 --> 00:07:23,391
You were never going to say yes, were you?

108
00:07:23,474 --> 00:07:25,851
- No.
- Then why did you play along?

109
00:07:25,935 --> 00:07:28,896
I figured it would hurt more
to have hope and then lose it.

110
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:32,024
That's mean.

111
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:35,319
- You don't even know my story.
- As if I need to know that.

112
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,740
I'm not kind enough
to be generous to a scammer.

113
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:42,034
Wait, hold on!

114
00:08:01,345 --> 00:08:03,723
<i>Wooju as head</i>
<i>of the Marketing Team?</i>

115
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:06,100
What about my Eungsoo, then?

116
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:08,144
You'll kick out someone doing good work

117
00:08:08,227 --> 00:08:10,438
just to make room for Wooju
at the company?

118
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:13,316
"Kick out?" The correct term
would be a demotion.

119
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,443
A demotion?
That's even more annoying to hear.

120
00:08:15,526 --> 00:08:18,571
So, what if you're annoyed?
He should've done better.

121
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,490
Sales have plummeted
since Eungsoo took over marketing.

122
00:08:21,574 --> 00:08:22,908
Didn't your husband tell you?

123
00:08:23,868 --> 00:08:26,787
That's because
he's only been there for a year.

124
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:28,080
Once he adjusts--

125
00:08:28,164 --> 00:08:29,957
Where was he before the transfer?

126
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,709
He worked in planning for two years.

127
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:34,045
Two years is plenty of time to settle in.

128
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:36,422
How many projects did he ruin
during that time?

129
00:08:36,505 --> 00:08:39,216
- Mom, why dredge up the past--
- Three.

130
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,595
That shows he's incompetent, not unlucky.

131
00:08:42,678 --> 00:08:44,305
But you can't replace him with Wooju.

132
00:08:44,388 --> 00:08:46,140
What would people think?

133
00:08:46,223 --> 00:08:49,101
They'll claim you favor your son's child
over your daughter's.

134
00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:51,395
I'm not favoring Wooju at all.

135
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:52,813
Eungsoo had the opportunity first.

136
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:54,940
I'm taking it away since he did poorly.

137
00:08:55,024 --> 00:08:57,026
Mom, is this how it's going to be?

138
00:08:57,109 --> 00:08:58,819
Your son and his wife are long gone,

139
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:01,072
and I'll be the one to care for you
in your old age.

140
00:09:01,155 --> 00:09:02,615
You can't do this to me.

141
00:09:02,698 --> 00:09:04,742
Confirm if our <i>hangwa</i> will be served
at the Blue House banquet

142
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:06,535
- for global business moguls.
- Yes, ma'am.

143
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:09,455
Also, get her out of my face!

144
00:09:09,538 --> 00:09:11,832
- She's making me dizzy.
- Mom!

145
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,459
CFO
JANG HANGU

146
00:09:13,542 --> 00:09:14,835
What the...

147
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,879
Seriously?

148
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:18,756
No way.

149
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:29,308
Mom, want a bite?

150
00:09:29,392 --> 00:09:32,853
It's one of our newest products,
and it's good. It'll be a huge hit.

151
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:35,439
You damn brat.

152
00:09:35,898 --> 00:09:37,608
How can you be enjoying that right now?

153
00:09:38,442 --> 00:09:40,569
What now? Why are you all prickly?

154
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,241
Grandma got under your skin again,
didn't she?

155
00:09:45,324 --> 00:09:47,451
I have you to blame for that!

156
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:51,122
How aren't you annoyed
when Wooju is about to replace you?

157
00:09:52,164 --> 00:09:54,291
Mom, here's the thing.

158
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:58,003
If the mountain can't be conquered,
you should try to go around it.

159
00:09:58,087 --> 00:10:03,134
To me, hanging on like a damp leaf
feels like pure wisdom.

160
00:10:03,217 --> 00:10:05,094
Gosh, I've got a knot in my back.

161
00:10:06,137 --> 00:10:08,514
You're no damp leaf,

162
00:10:08,597 --> 00:10:10,933
but more like a dog kicked to the curb.
Wake up, you brat!

163
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:14,854
If you don't have your grandma's approval,
Wooju will take everything from you.

164
00:10:14,937 --> 00:10:16,647
Don't worry, Mom.

165
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,067
I'm not that clueless,
and I have my own plans.

166
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:27,408
I have it all figured out.

167
00:10:29,243 --> 00:10:31,537
It's from that movie we enjoyed.

168
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,456
Remember?

169
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:34,582
- As if!

170
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:35,749
What's your problem, Mom?

171
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,710
You said you wouldn't do that
at the office.

172
00:10:37,793 --> 00:10:40,421
- As if!
- Mom, come on!

173
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:43,382
Dad, can you please stop Mom?

174
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:45,217
- Don't be like this in the office.
- Get back here.

175
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:48,137
She's in a foul mood,
so try to cheer her up.

176
00:10:50,473 --> 00:10:53,017
Why didn't you say anything earlier?

177
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,313
She only looks down on Eungsoo more
since you don't stand up for him.

178
00:10:57,855 --> 00:10:59,648
What could I have said?

179
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:01,567
This is a business we're trying to run.

180
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,236
You still should've butted heads with her.

181
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,364
"How could you be so heartless
when I've worked here for 30 years?

182
00:11:07,448 --> 00:11:10,534
If you keep treating my son that way,
I'll have to put my foot down."

183
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:12,495
The situation called for it!

184
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:16,040
Nothing good comes from raising voices
among family members.

185
00:11:16,123 --> 00:11:18,125
Besides, having Wooju here
will be good for Eungsoo.

186
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,878
Having competition helps you grow.

187
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:23,923
My goodness, you're killing me.

188
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:26,258
Can't you see how serious this is?

189
00:11:26,342 --> 00:11:28,886
Quit fuming about this
and head to the sauna.

190
00:11:28,969 --> 00:11:31,555
I'll book us a table for dinner
at your favorite sushi place.

191
00:11:32,097 --> 00:11:33,599
- That place?
- Yes.

192
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:38,854
DAEJU GENERAL HOSPITAL
YOON JINGYEONG

193
00:12:01,126 --> 00:12:02,336
WOOJU

194
00:12:14,098 --> 00:12:15,641
Hey, Wooju.

195
00:12:17,476 --> 00:12:19,144
When do you start work?

196
00:12:19,895 --> 00:12:20,896
Tomorrow.

197
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,232
You'll be busier now.

198
00:12:23,816 --> 00:12:26,527
Still, your grandma will be happy
to see you every day.

199
00:12:27,194 --> 00:12:30,322
She couldn't visit you in the US
because she couldn't get on planes.

200
00:12:30,406 --> 00:12:32,241
And you rarely flew in to see her.

201
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:35,077
I knew I could count on you
to look after her.

202
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:38,956
I can't look after her forever, though.

203
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,375
It's not like
I'm her granddaughter-in-law.

204
00:12:44,878 --> 00:12:45,879
Are you really

205
00:12:46,297 --> 00:12:47,840
interested in Eungsoo?

206
00:12:47,923 --> 00:12:49,174
Of course not!

207
00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:53,679
That reminds me.

208
00:12:53,762 --> 00:12:56,473
What happened with that woman?

209
00:12:56,557 --> 00:12:58,100
The cactus lady.

210
00:12:58,642 --> 00:12:59,643
She never came back.

211
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:03,731
Oh, don't worry about her.
She's perfectly fine.

212
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:06,275
Actually, no. I wouldn't say she's fine.

213
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:09,361
She must've injured her head,
not her butt.

214
00:13:09,445 --> 00:13:11,363
- She's not right in the head.
- What?

215
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:14,199
Out of nowhere,
she asked me to be her husband.

216
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,701
What?

217
00:13:16,619 --> 00:13:17,786
Does she like you?

218
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:22,583
No, she said it was for something else,
but I couldn't care less.

219
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,168
Ayeong!

220
00:13:24,877 --> 00:13:26,086
Seriously.

221
00:13:26,837 --> 00:13:28,714
- Ayeong!
- Goodness.

222
00:13:28,797 --> 00:13:31,425
- My goodness, come on.

223
00:13:31,508 --> 00:13:34,094
I told you not to run.

224
00:13:34,178 --> 00:13:35,429
Are you okay?

225
00:13:36,096 --> 00:13:37,306
Let me see.

226
00:13:52,738 --> 00:13:56,533
<i>Enough with the tears,</i>
<i>or the tiger will come and get you.</i>

227
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,993
Take it.

228
00:14:02,122 --> 00:14:03,499
Goodness.

229
00:14:03,582 --> 00:14:04,958
Does anything hurt?

230
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,461
Enough.

231
00:14:07,544 --> 00:14:10,255
Enough with the tears,
or the tiger will come and get you.

232
00:14:15,678 --> 00:14:16,929
Thank you.

233
00:14:17,638 --> 00:14:19,056
Here.

234
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:21,558
Can you wear it yourself?

235
00:14:21,642 --> 00:14:23,352
There you go. Good girl.

236
00:14:23,435 --> 00:14:24,770
Let's get you on your feet.

237
00:14:24,853 --> 00:14:26,522
- Thank you.
- No problem.

238
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:30,526
Are you okay to walk?

239
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,320
No running, okay?

240
00:14:33,862 --> 00:14:35,072
What was that?

241
00:14:35,155 --> 00:14:36,240
A tiger?

242
00:14:36,699 --> 00:14:38,409
Where did you pick that up?

243
00:14:39,243 --> 00:14:41,120
Beats me.

244
00:14:41,203 --> 00:14:43,664
Maybe it was my grandma.

245
00:14:44,206 --> 00:14:45,457
By the way,

246
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,210
are key rings on backpacks
a thing these days?

247
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:49,920
Oh, stuffed toys on key rings like that?

248
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,715
Why? Do you want one?

249
00:14:53,173 --> 00:14:54,174
Of course not.

250
00:14:55,467 --> 00:14:59,680
Wait, didn't you find a toy like that
when you were little?

251
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:02,641
- I think you said someone gave it to you.
- What?

252
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:05,894
That toy you took with you
when you went to the US.

253
00:15:06,353 --> 00:15:08,605
I teased you
if it was from your first crush.

254
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:09,815
Don't you remember?

255
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,609
What do you mean, first crush?

256
00:15:12,693 --> 00:15:14,528
- Who was it from?
- I don't know.

257
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:20,159
I mean it. I don't even remember her name.

258
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:23,370
I suppose she's living
a good life somewhere.

259
00:15:24,997 --> 00:15:26,248
Hold on.

260
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:32,379
Still, you can't barge in here like this
in the middle of the night.

261
00:15:32,463 --> 00:15:35,257
I texted you
that the renovation begins next week.

262
00:15:36,175 --> 00:15:38,510
Sir, hurry in there

263
00:15:38,594 --> 00:15:41,221
and measure the sink and windows.

264
00:15:41,305 --> 00:15:43,724
Sure. Sorry about this. We're coming in!

265
00:15:43,807 --> 00:15:44,975
- Sorry.
- Excuse us.

266
00:15:45,058 --> 00:15:46,685
Just a second.

267
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:47,936
Ma'am, please.

268
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:50,773
But...

269
00:16:13,504 --> 00:16:15,506
MOM

270
00:16:27,184 --> 00:16:28,936
Hey, Mom. What's up?

271
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:31,313
It's just that

272
00:16:31,396 --> 00:16:35,067
since your wedding got postponed,
Sori has to book a new flight

273
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,819
and wanted to know the date.

274
00:16:36,902 --> 00:16:40,155
Apparently, the earlier you book flights,
the cheaper they are.

275
00:16:40,823 --> 00:16:43,283
Wooju's extremely busy, you see.

276
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:45,327
I'll call after discussing it with him.

277
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:48,163
By the way, how's Sori doing?

278
00:16:49,164 --> 00:16:53,585
She must be doing well
at her restaurant job in the US.

279
00:16:53,669 --> 00:16:55,546
You won't believe
how good her English is now.

280
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:59,842
She has no problem
talking to Americans on her own.

281
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:01,051
- Really?
- Yes.

282
00:17:02,261 --> 00:17:04,388
Good for her.

283
00:17:05,013 --> 00:17:07,850
It sounds like she's tied up with her job,

284
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:10,686
so tell her not to stress
about attending the wedding.

285
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:12,688
Hey, that's nonsense.

286
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:16,024
Of course, she should attend
her big sister's wedding.

287
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:22,447
Just give us a date, or at least tell us
whether it'll happen within the year.

288
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:24,533
I have a lot to prepare on my end, too.

289
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:28,745
I'll visit you soon, Mom,
so let's talk then.

290
00:17:29,496 --> 00:17:30,956
I have something to tell you.

291
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,001
As in what?

292
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:37,045
It's not something we should talk about
over the phone.

293
00:17:38,338 --> 00:17:41,884
Don't tell me
you and Wooju got into a fight.

294
00:17:41,967 --> 00:17:43,093
Huh?

295
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:47,097
Well, you've already registered
your marriage,

296
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,308
- so what's the point of fighting?
- Right.

297
00:17:49,391 --> 00:17:51,435
Instead of arguing with him
about everything,

298
00:17:51,518 --> 00:17:53,270
just give him what he wants.

299
00:17:53,353 --> 00:17:55,022
Sometimes, losing is winning.

300
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:56,106
<i>Got it?</i>

301
00:17:56,857 --> 00:17:57,858
Mom...

302
00:17:58,775 --> 00:18:00,903
- You see--
- <i>Excuse me.</i>

303
00:18:00,986 --> 00:18:03,447
<i>Come on in.</i>
<i>Meri, I have a customer.</i>

304
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,990
We'll talk again some other time.

305
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:07,534
- Mom...

306
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:16,335
I need to tell her the truth.

307
00:18:18,128 --> 00:18:20,047
But when?

308
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,139
MYUNGSOONDANG

309
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,769
- Uncle.
- Hey.

310
00:18:33,852 --> 00:18:35,854
Come on in.

311
00:18:36,605 --> 00:18:37,940
Have you been well?

312
00:18:39,232 --> 00:18:42,319
It's really reassuring
to have you at the office.

313
00:18:42,402 --> 00:18:43,403
Is it your first time here?

314
00:18:43,487 --> 00:18:47,240
I came by a few times as a kid,
but not since the offices were renovated.

315
00:18:47,324 --> 00:18:48,367
A lot has changed.

316
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:52,412
You'll need to adjust quickly, Wooju,
since there's a lot for you to do.

317
00:18:52,496 --> 00:18:53,872
I'll learn the ropes fast.

318
00:18:54,498 --> 00:18:57,376
Think of me as your father,
and come to me with any problems.

319
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:58,794
Thanks, Uncle.

320
00:18:59,294 --> 00:19:01,672
I've always been grateful
for how you've looked after me

321
00:19:01,755 --> 00:19:03,507
since I was a kid.

322
00:19:04,716 --> 00:19:06,259
I'm happy you think that way.

323
00:19:07,636 --> 00:19:09,680
- Why don't you say hi to everyone?
- Sure.

324
00:19:11,556 --> 00:19:13,934
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Kim Wooju.

325
00:19:16,979 --> 00:19:19,231
After completing
his MBA in the US,

326
00:19:19,314 --> 00:19:22,401
Team Leader Kim Wooju spent four years
at a consulting firm.

327
00:19:22,484 --> 00:19:24,486
It's his first time at a Korean company,

328
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:26,530
- so help him adjust smoothly.
- Yes, sir.

329
00:19:26,613 --> 00:19:27,614
- Of course.
- Sure.

330
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:30,784
You'll properly greet them later
at the team dinner.

331
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:34,371
Ms. Oh, can you give him
a full briefing on the current projects?

332
00:19:34,454 --> 00:19:36,289
Bring him up to speed before the meeting.

333
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:37,582
Yes, sir.

334
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:49,011
- Hello, sir.
- Hi.

335
00:19:49,094 --> 00:19:50,429
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

336
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:52,472
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

337
00:20:04,151 --> 00:20:06,611
I'm sure you remember
the afternoon meeting with the chairwoman.

338
00:20:07,821 --> 00:20:08,822
Of course.

339
00:20:09,197 --> 00:20:10,198
Are you prepared?

340
00:20:11,658 --> 00:20:12,659
Sure.

341
00:20:14,494 --> 00:20:15,829
PREMIUM <i>HANGWA</i> COLLECTION

342
00:20:15,912 --> 00:20:18,832
This is the seven-piece <i>hangwa</i>
assortment that was introduced

343
00:20:18,915 --> 00:20:21,668
at the Paris International
Dessert Fair last year.

344
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:23,670
When a K-pop artist
with 90 million followers

345
00:20:23,754 --> 00:20:25,714
posted our product on social media,

346
00:20:25,797 --> 00:20:28,592
the dessert went viral among zillennials.

347
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:32,721
To meet demand, we will
officially release this assortment.

348
00:20:33,263 --> 00:20:34,681
Are we launching in duty-free shops first?

349
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:35,974
That's right.

350
00:20:37,476 --> 00:20:39,936
With holidays approaching
in China and Japan,

351
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,606
the product will hit the shelves
this week.

352
00:20:42,689 --> 00:20:46,193
Beginning next week, it will be available
in department stores across the country.

353
00:20:46,276 --> 00:20:48,195
I like the idea behind the packaging.

354
00:20:48,278 --> 00:20:49,571
It's like an advent calendar.

355
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,910
Yes, there's joy in opening a door
to reveal the dessert inside.

356
00:20:55,577 --> 00:20:59,331
The packaging received a design award
at the dessert fair.

357
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,377
Hold on, Ms. Oh.

358
00:21:07,547 --> 00:21:10,300
Won't we face any copyright issues
with the packaging?

359
00:21:11,468 --> 00:21:12,886
- Sorry?
- I'm just saying

360
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,723
because I remember a time limit
on the packaging design copyright

361
00:21:16,807 --> 00:21:18,517
when we signed the contract last year.

362
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:20,936
Oh, that?

363
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,562
- Sir?

364
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:25,565
6 MONTHS AGO

365
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:28,527
Let me see.

366
00:21:29,277 --> 00:21:32,697
"Permanent rights to the design
versus single-use rights."

367
00:21:32,781 --> 00:21:34,116
Single-use rights.

368
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:36,076
So, we will only hold the rights to it
for a month.

369
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,829
Yes, but the cost will be much lower.

370
00:21:38,912 --> 00:21:39,913
Exactly.

371
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:44,709
Since it's only for the dessert fair,
let's keep the numbers low.

372
00:21:44,793 --> 00:21:46,128
It's a one-time event anyway.

373
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:50,257
At the time, we had no plans
to release this as an official product.

374
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,551
- So, you didn't renew the contract?

375
00:21:53,051 --> 00:21:57,305
Oh dear, what if the design company
sues us for copyright infringement?

376
00:21:57,389 --> 00:21:59,391
This is a delicate matter nowadays.

377
00:21:59,474 --> 00:22:00,684
Isn't it the team leader's job?

378
00:22:07,357 --> 00:22:08,358
I apologize.

379
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:11,153
I failed to recognize the issue.

380
00:22:12,237 --> 00:22:16,241
I'll reach out to the design company
right away, extend our contract,

381
00:22:16,324 --> 00:22:17,576
and handle the matter.

382
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:19,202
What a bunch of amateurs.

383
00:22:19,286 --> 00:22:22,247
Wasn't this supposed to be handled
before the meeting?

384
00:22:22,706 --> 00:22:23,707
Wasn't it?

385
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:26,459
I suppose only I thought that.

386
00:22:26,543 --> 00:22:27,586
I apologize.

387
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:29,379
Team Leader Kim Wooju

388
00:22:30,088 --> 00:22:32,007
will ensure the contract is extended.

389
00:22:32,424 --> 00:22:34,384
This is a crucial matter,
so be sure nothing goes wrong.

390
00:22:35,677 --> 00:22:37,429
Yes, ma'am.

391
00:22:45,187 --> 00:22:47,856
Did you say 50 million won?

392
00:22:48,857 --> 00:22:49,858
Fifty?

393
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,696
That's 10 times the original price.

394
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:57,449
Since we'll be giving up our copyright,

395
00:22:57,532 --> 00:23:00,952
we'll need to account
for the opportunity cost.

396
00:23:03,288 --> 00:23:05,165
Right, please give us a call.

397
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:06,499
Sure thing.

398
00:23:08,668 --> 00:23:11,213
- What did they say? Are they in?
- They'll call after discussing it.

399
00:23:13,298 --> 00:23:15,050
Are you really asking for 50 million won?

400
00:23:15,133 --> 00:23:16,801
Of course not.

401
00:23:17,385 --> 00:23:21,389
Still, I need to find out what the call
I got this morning was about.

402
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:25,644
2 HOURS AGO

403
00:23:25,727 --> 00:23:27,771
Hello, this is Merry Design Studio.

404
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:32,234
Myungsoondang?

405
00:23:33,026 --> 00:23:34,569
The <i>hangwa</i> packaging design?

406
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,197
Yes, that's one of our designs.

407
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,406
What is this about?

408
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,493
Myungsoondang will contact you soon.

409
00:23:41,576 --> 00:23:43,995
When they do,
ask for a high price on the design.

410
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:46,665
It can even be 10 times
the original price.

411
00:23:47,207 --> 00:23:48,208
What?

412
00:23:49,584 --> 00:23:51,544
I'm sorry, but who's this...

413
00:23:53,713 --> 00:23:54,965
Hello?

414
00:23:55,048 --> 00:23:57,300
I initially thought it was a prank,

415
00:23:57,384 --> 00:23:59,803
but Myungsoondang called soon after.

416
00:23:59,886 --> 00:24:01,137
This project was from a year ago.

417
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:03,640
I still feel we asked
for too high a price,

418
00:24:03,723 --> 00:24:05,767
just based on a stranger's words.

419
00:24:06,643 --> 00:24:08,186
What if they call off the deal?

420
00:24:14,776 --> 00:24:15,777
Change the design.

421
00:24:16,528 --> 00:24:18,446
There are other design companies,

422
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,782
and we can redesign the packaging.

423
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:22,659
I'm afraid...

424
00:24:23,535 --> 00:24:24,619
it won't be that easy.

425
00:24:28,415 --> 00:24:29,791
7-PIECE <i>HANGWA</i> ASSORTMENT
PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

426
00:24:29,874 --> 00:24:31,710
Over 150 million won

427
00:24:31,793 --> 00:24:35,005
went into the pre-production
of the packaging.

428
00:24:44,097 --> 00:24:46,224
Contact the CEO of the design company.

429
00:24:46,808 --> 00:24:48,393
- I'll negotiate.
- Yes, sir.

430
00:24:49,185 --> 00:24:51,980
<i>The grand prize winner is...</i>

431
00:24:52,063 --> 00:24:55,191
<i>Ms. Yoo Meri,
holder of ticket number 29710,</i>

432
00:24:55,275 --> 00:24:56,609
<i>congratulations.</i>

433
00:24:56,693 --> 00:24:58,695
<i>Ms. Yoo, congratulations.</i>

434
00:24:58,778 --> 00:25:01,823
BEAUTÉ CEO LEE SUNGWOO

435
00:25:02,574 --> 00:25:03,908
Damn it!

436
00:25:07,037 --> 00:25:08,955
What are you going to do about this?

437
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,999
We can't redraw the names
now that this is on NeoTube.

438
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:14,252
I'll look for a way to withdraw the prize.

439
00:25:15,837 --> 00:25:16,838
Can you actually do that?

440
00:25:16,921 --> 00:25:17,922
Come here a second.

441
00:25:20,592 --> 00:25:22,135
How? Just how?

442
00:25:24,012 --> 00:25:25,513
Don't be a crybaby.

443
00:25:29,017 --> 00:25:30,018
You.

444
00:25:32,228 --> 00:25:33,229
Get my shoes cleaned.

445
00:25:39,361 --> 00:25:40,653
Get lost!

446
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,292
BEAUTÉ MANAGING DIRECTOR BAEK SANGHYEON

447
00:26:07,138 --> 00:26:08,139
The mayor's extorting me.

448
00:26:08,223 --> 00:26:09,432
3 MONTHS AGO

449
00:26:09,516 --> 00:26:11,017
He wants one of the town houses

450
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:13,353
in exchange for approving
the department store development.

451
00:26:13,436 --> 00:26:14,896
- A town house?

452
00:26:14,979 --> 00:26:17,107
As in a unit at Beauté Palace?

453
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,692
That scumbag requested
a five-million-dollar unit.

454
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,777
You should give in.

455
00:26:21,861 --> 00:26:25,990
If construction doesn't begin this year,
delays and loan interest will cost more.

456
00:26:26,449 --> 00:26:28,284
Besides, anything can happen
under a new regime.

457
00:26:28,952 --> 00:26:31,329
Hey, as if I don't know that.

458
00:26:31,788 --> 00:26:34,958
I can always offer him one of the units
owned by the group.

459
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:37,794
But what if my father finds out
about the laundering?

460
00:26:39,003 --> 00:26:41,339
Shit, I can't handle that old man.

461
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,800
We'll give it away through a raffle.

462
00:26:44,426 --> 00:26:46,970
Last month,
the mayor's wife's nephew got married.

463
00:26:47,053 --> 00:26:49,472
The unit will be disguised
as a raffle prize

464
00:26:49,556 --> 00:26:50,974
during the department sale.

465
00:27:07,282 --> 00:27:09,701
It's me, Mr. Kwon.
Were you able to contact Yoo Meri?

466
00:27:12,662 --> 00:27:15,790
Of course, the husband must be present.
Otherwise, we'll redraw.

467
00:27:35,894 --> 00:27:37,979
- Should I call them?
- And say what?

468
00:27:38,062 --> 00:27:39,439
That...

469
00:27:40,273 --> 00:27:42,692
I was a bit tipsy
from day drinking earlier

470
00:27:42,775 --> 00:27:44,611
and added a zero by mistake.

471
00:27:45,737 --> 00:27:47,780
Don't. We'll wait a little longer.

472
00:27:48,281 --> 00:27:49,407
I'm sure they'll call.

473
00:27:54,162 --> 00:27:56,581
<i>Will your husband</i>
<i>be attending the ceremony?</i>

474
00:27:56,664 --> 00:27:59,542
<i>If he can't,
the prize will no longer be valid.</i>

475
00:28:01,711 --> 00:28:02,712
What did they say?

476
00:28:02,795 --> 00:28:04,255
That was for something else.

477
00:28:13,306 --> 00:28:14,849
- Songhee.
- Yes?

478
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:17,519
Don't you have an older brother
studying for the civil service exam?

479
00:28:17,602 --> 00:28:18,895
I do.

480
00:28:18,978 --> 00:28:20,563
- How's he doing?
- Beats me.

481
00:28:20,647 --> 00:28:23,566
I haven't seen that jerk
for about two months.

482
00:28:24,776 --> 00:28:25,777
Why do you ask?

483
00:28:28,488 --> 00:28:31,449
Could I maybe ask him for a favor?

484
00:28:33,701 --> 00:28:36,955
If he's free this weekend...

485
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:43,378
You'll pay for it
if you try anything funny.

486
00:28:44,128 --> 00:28:46,381
<i>What if he comes to the ceremony?</i>

487
00:28:46,965 --> 00:28:48,716
<i>I'll be done for if he rats me out.</i>

488
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:51,094
- Ms. Yoo.
- Yes?

489
00:28:51,803 --> 00:28:52,971
What kind of favor?

490
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,306
It's nothing.

491
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,767
I shouldn't. It's too risky.

492
00:29:04,357 --> 00:29:05,358
Are you going somewhere?

493
00:29:05,441 --> 00:29:08,861
There's someone I have to see.

494
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,990
Call me the moment
you hear from Myungsoondang.

495
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:18,246
Why hasn't Wooju been in touch?

496
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:20,873
The jerk went to Hong Kong
and turned off his phone.

497
00:29:21,374 --> 00:29:22,500
Give him time.

498
00:29:23,418 --> 00:29:25,128
Besides, no news is good news.

499
00:29:25,628 --> 00:29:26,629
- Mom.
- Yes?

500
00:29:28,464 --> 00:29:29,966
To be honest,

501
00:29:30,758 --> 00:29:32,885
there's something painful
about Wooju and Meri breaking up.

502
00:29:33,428 --> 00:29:34,596
What do you mean?

503
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:37,473
I can't have Meri's
green onion kimchi anymore.

504
00:29:37,557 --> 00:29:38,683
The sweet stir-fried eggplant was good,

505
00:29:39,142 --> 00:29:41,144
and her mom's <i>geotjeori</i>
was just the way I like it.

506
00:29:41,728 --> 00:29:43,646
Gosh, I get cravings sometimes.

507
00:29:44,105 --> 00:29:45,189
Same here.

508
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,192
As if her side dishes matter,

509
00:29:48,276 --> 00:29:50,903
when Wooju's new girlfriend
is filthy rich.

510
00:29:50,987 --> 00:29:54,449
Her family owns
a few buildings in Hong Kong.

511
00:29:54,532 --> 00:29:56,451
She's rich and then some.

512
00:29:58,494 --> 00:30:00,121
Lucky you, Mom.

513
00:30:00,204 --> 00:30:02,165
Your son will finally give you
a life of luxury.

514
00:30:02,248 --> 00:30:03,708
You hated that Meri wasn't enough.

515
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:06,002
Don't even bring up that name.

516
00:30:06,085 --> 00:30:07,420
SON

517
00:30:09,088 --> 00:30:10,381
- It's Wooju.
- Is it Wooju?

518
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,385
Why is she looking for you
when she's the one who got scammed?

519
00:30:14,469 --> 00:30:15,637
Of course not.

520
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,847
Who cares if you insisted
on getting that unit?

521
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,683
She always had the option to refuse.

522
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:23,311
Did she ask you for money?

523
00:30:23,394 --> 00:30:24,437
Of course not.

524
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,606
<i>You're not to blame,
so don't let it bother you.</i>

525
00:30:26,689 --> 00:30:28,149
And don't take Meri's calls.

526
00:30:28,733 --> 00:30:30,360
I've already blocked her number.

527
00:30:35,698 --> 00:30:37,033
Is Elizabeth well?

528
00:30:38,868 --> 00:30:40,328
Of course.

529
00:30:40,411 --> 00:30:43,581
Since she's Jenny's little sister,
we've been taking extra good care of her.

530
00:30:43,665 --> 00:30:47,543
We've been feeding her
only top organic French kibble.

531
00:30:48,044 --> 00:30:51,089
<i>Let Jenny know
we're taking good care of her.</i>

532
00:30:52,215 --> 00:30:53,966
By the way, when will you be back?

533
00:30:55,343 --> 00:30:57,345
- Next month.
<i>- Next month?</i>

534
00:30:57,428 --> 00:30:58,763
<i>What about work?</i>

535
00:30:58,846 --> 00:30:59,931
Your son...

536
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:01,974
tossed in his resignation letter.

537
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:04,227
You quit your job? Why?

538
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,895
- Why?
<i>- Don't worry.</i>

539
00:31:05,978 --> 00:31:07,730
Jenny's got me covered.

540
00:31:12,568 --> 00:31:14,237
What now?

541
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,697
Oh, the bowls.

542
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,617
Coming!

543
00:31:21,744 --> 00:31:24,455
Oh, well. That was sooner...

544
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:28,000
than usual.

545
00:31:37,677 --> 00:31:40,304
I haven't been able to reach Wooju.

546
00:31:40,972 --> 00:31:43,099
Why do you need to contact him
when you broke up?

547
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:45,268
There's an urgent matter.

548
00:31:45,768 --> 00:31:47,311
Is this about the rental scam?

549
00:31:47,395 --> 00:31:49,230
Did you get in touch with him?

550
00:31:49,313 --> 00:31:51,190
Yes, and he told us all about it.

551
00:31:51,274 --> 00:31:52,442
But what about it?

552
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:56,487
Did your mom tell you to cling to Wooju
by any means necessary?

553
00:31:57,238 --> 00:32:00,658
- What?
- I wasn't going to go this far,

554
00:32:00,742 --> 00:32:02,994
but you have absolutely no shame.

555
00:32:03,077 --> 00:32:05,204
You have only one parent, you're old,

556
00:32:05,288 --> 00:32:07,874
and you went to a third-rate university--

557
00:32:07,957 --> 00:32:09,500
She dropped out, remember?

558
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:11,919
That I didn't know.

559
00:32:12,503 --> 00:32:14,714
Let me get this straight.

560
00:32:14,797 --> 00:32:16,799
A college dropout dared to marry my Wooju,

561
00:32:16,883 --> 00:32:19,969
who graduated from both
a prestigious high school and university?

562
00:32:20,052 --> 00:32:24,098
I invested so much in him,
driving him around to his extra classes.

563
00:32:24,182 --> 00:32:25,475
Meanwhile, you did nothing.

564
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:27,894
The best you could do
was rent a place to live,

565
00:32:27,977 --> 00:32:30,271
but even that was only in your own name.

566
00:32:30,354 --> 00:32:32,064
I didn't know about that, either.

567
00:32:32,148 --> 00:32:34,358
Exactly, and I call that a scam.

568
00:32:34,442 --> 00:32:37,028
The place should've been
in both your names.

569
00:32:37,528 --> 00:32:40,865
The loan for the deposit
was taken out in my name, so--

570
00:32:40,948 --> 00:32:43,201
I'm glad you brought that up.

571
00:32:43,284 --> 00:32:46,662
Since the unit is in your name,
handle the rental scam yourself

572
00:32:46,746 --> 00:32:48,456
instead of troubling my Wooju.

573
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:50,291
I'm not trying to give him a hard time.

574
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:54,212
Mother, I came here today

575
00:32:54,295 --> 00:32:55,922
- because I won--
- Mom.

576
00:32:56,005 --> 00:32:57,173
This isn't worth our time.

577
00:32:57,632 --> 00:32:58,800
Just stop, okay?

578
00:32:58,883 --> 00:33:03,012
If you have a shred of conscience,
you won't bring Wooju down with you.

579
00:33:03,095 --> 00:33:05,056
You registered the marriage in advance

580
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:07,809
just to trap him, you gold digger.

581
00:33:07,892 --> 00:33:09,769
What did you just call me?

582
00:33:09,852 --> 00:33:11,854
Talk about a bad match.

583
00:33:11,938 --> 00:33:12,939
Get lost already.

584
00:33:13,397 --> 00:33:16,234
If we ever meet again,
let's act like strangers.

585
00:33:18,903 --> 00:33:20,905
Are you striking first?

586
00:33:20,988 --> 00:33:22,698
- What?

587
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:25,743
Are you worried I'll ask Wooju for money?

588
00:33:26,786 --> 00:33:30,122
Don't worry. I'll deal with the debt
that's in my name.

589
00:33:30,206 --> 00:33:33,042
But that's not what I
came here to talk about.

590
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:34,460
Either way,

591
00:33:35,253 --> 00:33:37,255
I suppose there's no point
in telling you anymore.

592
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:42,927
Please tell Wooju
that I won't be contacting him again.

593
00:33:43,386 --> 00:33:46,430
If you two happen to hear
about me, just ignore it.

594
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,184
I'll get going then.

595
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:53,437
I can see Wooju takes
so much after you, Mother.

596
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:57,567
Now I know where he got his audacity.

597
00:33:58,317 --> 00:33:59,694
Why you...

598
00:34:00,528 --> 00:34:03,281
That's hardly appropriate for a woman
from a family of educators.

599
00:34:04,448 --> 00:34:07,159
If you hit me,
I'll put up posters in the neighborhood

600
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:10,371
exposing that your husband was fired
for sexually harassing his TA.

601
00:34:12,164 --> 00:34:13,416
My gosh!

602
00:34:15,376 --> 00:34:17,545
That bitch!

603
00:34:28,431 --> 00:34:29,891
It's over now.

604
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:33,185
I tried my best.

605
00:34:41,444 --> 00:34:42,987
SONGHEE

606
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,781
What's up?

607
00:34:47,033 --> 00:34:48,034
Right now?

608
00:34:49,285 --> 00:34:51,537
No, I can make it, so say so.

609
00:34:53,205 --> 00:34:54,206
Sure.

610
00:35:01,047 --> 00:35:02,673
Yes, Ms. Yoo. Head straight up.

611
00:35:03,424 --> 00:35:04,425
Sure.

612
00:35:05,593 --> 00:35:08,012
Mr. Kim, the CEO
of the design company is here.

613
00:35:08,596 --> 00:35:10,389
- Conference Room Two, is it?
- Yes.

614
00:35:21,651 --> 00:35:22,735
Where are you headed?

615
00:35:22,818 --> 00:35:23,903
To sign the contract.

616
00:35:24,153 --> 00:35:25,988
With the designer?

617
00:35:26,948 --> 00:35:28,950
You're hard at work even on day one.

618
00:35:30,618 --> 00:35:32,495
I'm paid from the first day, aren't I?

619
00:35:32,578 --> 00:35:34,288
Oh, good one.

620
00:35:34,372 --> 00:35:35,873
That's a healthy approach.

621
00:35:36,332 --> 00:35:39,168
You must be carrying quite a burden
on your shoulders.

622
00:35:39,251 --> 00:35:40,795
Grandma's expecting results.

623
00:35:40,878 --> 00:35:43,214
Meanwhile, your load is light
because you have no work.

624
00:35:43,297 --> 00:35:46,092
Come on, man.
I was the team leader up until yesterday.

625
00:35:46,175 --> 00:35:49,303
So, the work you're handling now
used to be what I did.

626
00:35:49,387 --> 00:35:52,640
You should've taken care of this
instead of dumping it on the next person.

627
00:35:52,723 --> 00:35:54,600
I dumped what on you?

628
00:35:54,684 --> 00:35:55,726
The personnel shift...

629
00:35:57,478 --> 00:35:58,562
That wasn't me.

630
00:35:58,646 --> 00:36:01,232
I would've handled it
if I were the team leader.

631
00:36:01,315 --> 00:36:03,192
It seems like I was brought in
because you couldn't.

632
00:36:03,275 --> 00:36:05,653
What? What are you going on about?

633
00:36:06,237 --> 00:36:07,321
Okay, fine.

634
00:36:07,405 --> 00:36:10,658
If you think you can do it better,
extend the deal at the same price.

635
00:36:10,741 --> 00:36:13,911
Then I'll fully recognize
your talent and competence.

636
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:18,457
- Really?
- But if you don't get the deal,

637
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:21,085
you'll leave your position.

638
00:36:24,547 --> 00:36:28,342
What do you say?
We'll settle this man-to-man.

639
00:36:30,094 --> 00:36:31,387
I'm in.

640
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,763
If you're done, can you move?

641
00:36:32,847 --> 00:36:34,432
I have to go and clean up your mess.

642
00:36:34,515 --> 00:36:36,475
Is that the best you can put it?

643
00:36:46,569 --> 00:36:49,155
It won't be as easy as you think.

644
00:36:49,238 --> 00:36:51,115
I'm a man with a plan, you see.

645
00:37:14,346 --> 00:37:15,973
What's he doing here?

646
00:37:16,057 --> 00:37:17,683
I must've seen wrong.

647
00:37:22,605 --> 00:37:24,732
I guess I'm so stressed.

648
00:37:26,317 --> 00:37:28,360
I'm starting to see things.

649
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:41,544
He's our new team leader,

650
00:37:41,628 --> 00:37:44,589
and he wanted to talk to you in person.

651
00:37:47,717 --> 00:37:49,052
I'm Kim Wooju.

652
00:37:49,135 --> 00:37:51,387
- <i>This is my one last chance.</i>

653
00:37:52,138 --> 00:37:54,724
I'm Yoo Meri from Merry Design Studio.

654
00:37:57,977 --> 00:38:00,146
I'll get straight to the point.

655
00:38:01,105 --> 00:38:03,483
The price you asked for is too high.

656
00:38:03,566 --> 00:38:05,610
It's well over the market average,

657
00:38:05,693 --> 00:38:08,780
and most design companies could create
a design of similar level and quality.

658
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:12,116
However, if you agree to renew
the contract at the same price,

659
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,744
the company will offer an extra benefit.

660
00:38:15,578 --> 00:38:17,830
We'll ask you to handle
the packaging design

661
00:38:17,914 --> 00:38:20,083
for our latest product.

662
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:22,835
A partnership with our company

663
00:38:23,336 --> 00:38:26,130
will help you build your portfolio.

664
00:38:27,507 --> 00:38:28,549
Sure.

665
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:34,055
Thank you.

666
00:38:34,138 --> 00:38:36,516
I'm glad we're on the same page.

667
00:38:39,018 --> 00:38:41,020
On one condition, though.

668
00:38:42,188 --> 00:38:45,858
Would it be all right
if Mr. Kim and I talked alone?

669
00:38:48,194 --> 00:38:49,404
It's fine.

670
00:38:52,115 --> 00:38:53,199
STANDARD CONTRACT FOR DESIGN SERVICES

671
00:38:53,282 --> 00:38:54,534
I'll get back to work.

672
00:39:05,044 --> 00:39:06,504
What's your term?

673
00:39:06,587 --> 00:39:08,006
Be my husband.

674
00:39:08,881 --> 00:39:10,216
Are you still set on that?

675
00:39:10,299 --> 00:39:13,428
I'm making a new request,
given how our dynamic has changed.

676
00:39:13,511 --> 00:39:14,554
How has it changed?

677
00:39:14,637 --> 00:39:18,891
Well, before, I was the only one
who needed help,

678
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:23,187
but now you do, too, right?

679
00:39:25,523 --> 00:39:29,193
If I turn down this deal,
it could cost you billions.

680
00:39:29,277 --> 00:39:31,404
<i>How can we look</i>
<i>for another design company</i>

681
00:39:31,487 --> 00:39:35,033
now that the packaging is done
and the promotional posters are made?

682
00:39:35,658 --> 00:39:36,659
Right.

683
00:39:37,994 --> 00:39:40,288
Merry Design Studio is a small business,

684
00:39:40,371 --> 00:39:42,123
so we'll have to push hard
in negotiations.

685
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:44,625
That would be on our team leader.

686
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:55,261
You've already mass-produced
the packaging?

687
00:40:02,185 --> 00:40:03,686
You have leverage, is that it?

688
00:40:06,147 --> 00:40:10,276
It's more like I have a reason
to keep you at the table.

689
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,154
Consider this negotiation over.

690
00:40:13,237 --> 00:40:18,076
We may lose money over this,
but it beats being implicated in fraud.

691
00:40:18,701 --> 00:40:22,288
Ms. Yoo, you realize
you'll be arrested for attempted fraud

692
00:40:22,371 --> 00:40:25,208
if I report you to the authorities.

693
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:27,710
I'll make that call, then.

694
00:40:28,252 --> 00:40:29,420
Not so fast!

695
00:40:29,504 --> 00:40:31,464
What do you mean you'll report me?

696
00:40:31,547 --> 00:40:33,299
There's no reason to be mean.

697
00:40:33,841 --> 00:40:36,886
Don't we all deserve
to dream and fantasize?

698
00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:39,889
You openly suggested
that I commit a crime with you.

699
00:40:39,972 --> 00:40:41,599
How is that just fantasizing?

700
00:40:42,225 --> 00:40:43,226
But...

701
00:40:44,769 --> 00:40:47,230
But... Okay, hear me out.

702
00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:51,609
I lost everything in a rental scam,
but I won a five-million-dollar house.

703
00:40:51,692 --> 00:40:53,778
If it were you,
would you let this chance slip away?

704
00:40:53,861 --> 00:40:58,783
I just need a husband to tag along,
so wouldn't you do whatever it takes?

705
00:40:59,283 --> 00:41:00,284
You won a prize?

706
00:41:04,372 --> 00:41:06,207
So, that's what this is all about.

707
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:08,376
Sure.

708
00:41:09,669 --> 00:41:12,046
Exactly. I won a prize, okay?

709
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:13,965
So, please...

710
00:41:14,382 --> 00:41:17,218
Can you please just help me this once?

711
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:20,888
They suddenly said I have to bring
my husband to the ceremony,

712
00:41:20,972 --> 00:41:23,724
but I don't have time
to find someone else.

713
00:41:24,308 --> 00:41:25,434
That's too bad.

714
00:41:25,518 --> 00:41:27,061
I feel for your situation,

715
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,440
but my conscience won't allow it.

716
00:41:33,901 --> 00:41:35,111
<i>How's it going?</i>

717
00:41:35,194 --> 00:41:37,363
You'll step down as team leader
if this deal falls through.

718
00:41:38,823 --> 00:41:40,533
I'm texting to confirm our deal.

719
00:41:45,204 --> 00:41:48,708
<i>Team Leader Kim Wooju</i>
<i>will ensure the contract is extended.</i>

720
00:41:49,292 --> 00:41:51,627
This is a crucial matter,
so be sure nothing goes wrong.

721
00:41:55,047 --> 00:41:56,257
Mr. Kim!

722
00:41:58,176 --> 00:41:59,260
Look at this.

723
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,763
What if my elbow keeps hurting
whenever it rains?

724
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:07,393
The aftereffects of a car accident
are usually scarier.

725
00:42:07,476 --> 00:42:09,979
Come on. That only happened because you--

726
00:42:10,062 --> 00:42:12,565
Here. Where do I sign?

727
00:42:13,065 --> 00:42:14,442
Isn't this a win-win situation?

728
00:42:14,525 --> 00:42:16,736
I'm a pro at signing contracts.

729
00:42:16,819 --> 00:42:18,905
MYUNGSOONDANG
YOO MERI

730
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:34,337
It won't take long, so please relax.

731
00:42:34,837 --> 00:42:37,465
Did you perhaps read the text I sent?

732
00:42:37,548 --> 00:42:39,425
Our wedding date, address,
and the registration number.

733
00:42:39,508 --> 00:42:41,844
You said all I had to do
was stand next to you.

734
00:42:41,928 --> 00:42:43,095
Oh, of course.

735
00:42:44,972 --> 00:42:47,058
But you never know, so...

736
00:42:48,434 --> 00:42:50,811
Forget I said anything.
I'll handle all the questions.

737
00:42:50,895 --> 00:42:52,104
You just stand there...

738
00:42:56,108 --> 00:42:57,360
Wait for me.

739
00:43:02,281 --> 00:43:03,324
<i>Going up.</i>

740
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:13,834
Take this.

741
00:43:15,628 --> 00:43:16,754
It's a wedding band.

742
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:19,840
Sure.

743
00:43:23,594 --> 00:43:24,595
These too.

744
00:43:26,514 --> 00:43:30,142
In the photo I sent of Kim Wooju
to the department store,

745
00:43:30,226 --> 00:43:32,144
he was wearing glasses.

746
00:43:34,105 --> 00:43:35,106
Right.

747
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,236
You look like him.

748
00:43:44,156 --> 00:43:45,157
Hold on.

749
00:43:45,741 --> 00:43:47,910
How did you send a copy of an ID?
Did you fake it?

750
00:43:47,994 --> 00:43:49,620
Of course not.

751
00:43:49,704 --> 00:43:51,247
I had a copy of his passport,

752
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:53,916
which I sent to the travel agency
when I was booking our honeymoon.

753
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,876
- That's what I sent.
- I see.

754
00:43:58,921 --> 00:44:02,717
Do you have any idea
how risky this scam is?

755
00:44:03,676 --> 00:44:06,304
The other Kim Wooju wouldn't let this fly.

756
00:44:07,013 --> 00:44:09,015
You don't have to worry about that.

757
00:44:09,098 --> 00:44:11,100
Kim Wooju's the one
who's been dodging my calls,

758
00:44:11,183 --> 00:44:13,811
and I won't tell anyone else about this.

759
00:44:13,894 --> 00:44:16,522
I'll sell the house as soon as I get it.

760
00:44:16,939 --> 00:44:17,940
I won't get caught.

761
00:44:18,649 --> 00:44:22,945
Oh, just know I'll make it worth your time
once I sell the house.

762
00:44:23,404 --> 00:44:25,281
I seriously promise you that.

763
00:44:25,364 --> 00:44:26,365
Forget it.

764
00:44:26,449 --> 00:44:29,243
I don't want black money
or anything that feels wrong.

765
00:44:29,327 --> 00:44:32,955
I told you all about the situation I'm in.

766
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:35,833
I'm a victim of fraud,
and I have my mom's debt to pay.

767
00:44:35,916 --> 00:44:38,294
Who in this world
doesn't have a sob story?

768
00:44:38,377 --> 00:44:40,379
But not everyone scams others like you.

769
00:44:41,547 --> 00:44:44,633
Of course, I want to live
by my conscience,

770
00:44:45,176 --> 00:44:48,220
but the situation I'm in
is just too damn hard!

771
00:44:48,929 --> 00:44:50,931
Did you just raise your voice at me?

772
00:44:52,475 --> 00:44:53,559
Sorry.

773
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:59,065
A ceremony?

774
00:44:59,148 --> 00:45:00,524
Wasn't the prize called off?

775
00:45:00,608 --> 00:45:01,609
I'm sorry, sir.

776
00:45:04,278 --> 00:45:05,279
You.

777
00:45:06,697 --> 00:45:11,243
Is this what you call
handling the situation?

778
00:45:14,038 --> 00:45:15,247
What now?

779
00:45:15,331 --> 00:45:17,291
What will I tell my father
when he gets back?

780
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:19,960
I already informed him
that this is a social contribution event.

781
00:45:20,044 --> 00:45:23,672
- A social contribution?
- You've become active on social media

782
00:45:23,756 --> 00:45:25,466
to engage with zillennials.

783
00:45:25,549 --> 00:45:28,219
By presenting this as an event
to support young people without homes,

784
00:45:28,302 --> 00:45:29,762
the press will take an interest.

785
00:45:29,845 --> 00:45:32,681
On top of that,
a positive public image could help

786
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,934
get the new department store approved.

787
00:45:43,776 --> 00:45:45,694
Sounds good. Go with that.

788
00:45:55,329 --> 00:45:56,664
Congratulations.

789
00:45:57,206 --> 00:45:59,750
You're lucky to have a wife like her, sir.

790
00:46:05,005 --> 00:46:06,090
Yes, sure.

791
00:46:06,674 --> 00:46:09,969
It seems as though
reality hasn't sunk in yet for him.

792
00:46:10,052 --> 00:46:11,262
Of course.

793
00:46:11,345 --> 00:46:14,348
When we didn't hear back
from you yesterday,

794
00:46:14,432 --> 00:46:16,976
we thought we had to withdraw the prize.

795
00:46:18,018 --> 00:46:21,897
He just arrived in Korea this morning.

796
00:46:22,606 --> 00:46:24,316
You must be tired, honey.

797
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,569
Right, I kind of am.

798
00:46:28,154 --> 00:46:30,114
That must be why
you don't look like your photo.

799
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:36,579
You look somewhat different
from your ID photo.

800
00:46:38,038 --> 00:46:41,750
He took that photo a while back,
so that must be why.

801
00:46:43,919 --> 00:46:44,920
Of course.

802
00:46:45,379 --> 00:46:47,298
A lot of people
don't look like their photos.

803
00:46:47,381 --> 00:46:48,382
Exactly.

804
00:46:49,842 --> 00:46:52,595
May I see your IDs?

805
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,221
You already did.

806
00:46:54,305 --> 00:46:57,183
These are only copies,
and I need to check them in person.

807
00:46:59,059 --> 00:47:02,188
I'm not sure if we brought them with us.

808
00:47:06,859 --> 00:47:07,860
Did we?

809
00:47:10,154 --> 00:47:11,989
Mine's here, but...

810
00:47:12,072 --> 00:47:13,240
I can see that.

811
00:47:18,162 --> 00:47:19,163
That's you.

812
00:47:19,872 --> 00:47:21,081
And the husband?

813
00:47:23,626 --> 00:47:24,919
It's in the car.

814
00:47:25,002 --> 00:47:27,129
I forgot to tell him to bring it.

815
00:47:27,796 --> 00:47:29,131
I see.

816
00:47:30,007 --> 00:47:31,217
Then how should we proceed?

817
00:47:34,595 --> 00:47:36,305
What's your resident registration number?

818
00:47:36,388 --> 00:47:40,226
- It's 960902--
- It's 960902-102463.

819
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:42,353
Our address is
Unit 101, Green Villa, 118 Hanseo-dong,

820
00:47:42,436 --> 00:47:43,812
Jungmun-go, Seoul.

821
00:47:43,896 --> 00:47:46,357
We registered our marriage
on Monday, January 6 of this year.

822
00:47:50,152 --> 00:47:51,487
Confirmed.

823
00:47:52,738 --> 00:47:54,865
<i>When did he memorize all that?</i>

824
00:47:55,449 --> 00:47:56,700
<i>Is he a genius?</i>

825
00:48:00,287 --> 00:48:02,414
Sir, can you confirm the press release?

826
00:48:02,498 --> 00:48:03,624
Sure.

827
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:07,545
Please relax and enjoy your tea.

828
00:48:07,628 --> 00:48:09,505
The CEO isn't ready quite yet.

829
00:48:09,588 --> 00:48:10,756
Sure.

830
00:48:13,509 --> 00:48:14,843
IN AN INTERVIEW, THE LUCKY COUPLE...

831
00:48:16,971 --> 00:48:18,180
PRESS RELEASE, BEAUTÉ

832
00:48:18,264 --> 00:48:19,640
BEAUTÉ DEPARTMENT STORE 30TH ANNIVERSARY

833
00:48:19,723 --> 00:48:21,559
COUPLE WINS FIVE-MILLION-DOLLAR UNIT
AT BEAUTÉ PALACE

834
00:48:21,642 --> 00:48:22,643
Hold on.

835
00:48:23,894 --> 00:48:25,396
- Sir.
- Yes?

836
00:48:25,479 --> 00:48:27,356
Will this be in the press?

837
00:48:27,439 --> 00:48:28,941
Of course.

838
00:48:29,024 --> 00:48:31,527
An article will be released
right after the ceremony.

839
00:48:33,821 --> 00:48:36,073
- I had no idea.
- An article?

840
00:48:38,075 --> 00:48:39,410
- Sir.
- Yes?

841
00:48:40,828 --> 00:48:42,788
Sorry, we can't have this in the news.

842
00:48:43,998 --> 00:48:45,332
We don't want word to get out.

843
00:48:45,874 --> 00:48:46,875
Is it because...

844
00:48:49,253 --> 00:48:50,254
of creditors?

845
00:48:51,338 --> 00:48:53,007
- Because they could come after you?
- Right.

846
00:48:53,424 --> 00:48:55,301
- How did you know that?

847
00:48:55,384 --> 00:48:58,095
That's why I haven't been able
to share this with others.

848
00:48:58,178 --> 00:48:59,847
It's as I thought.

849
00:49:00,431 --> 00:49:01,724
It's not just creditors.

850
00:49:01,807 --> 00:49:04,727
You'll probably even get calls
from distant family members.

851
00:49:05,436 --> 00:49:06,645
Two years ago, was it?

852
00:49:06,729 --> 00:49:08,439
After winning fourth place in the lottery,

853
00:49:08,522 --> 00:49:11,275
I had to buy so many people meals
just for sharing it on social media.

854
00:49:12,151 --> 00:49:13,986
- You were one of them.
- That's right.

855
00:49:15,195 --> 00:49:17,489
I even had to pay
for my wife's nephew's college tuition.

856
00:49:18,657 --> 00:49:20,951
We appreciate your understanding.

857
00:49:21,035 --> 00:49:23,370
Please don't thank me
when I have to apologize.

858
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,372
The article has to be released.

859
00:49:25,456 --> 00:49:26,790
What? That can't happen.

860
00:49:26,874 --> 00:49:30,628
But, sir, this was never the agreement.

861
00:49:30,711 --> 00:49:32,588
You can't release an article
without our consent.

862
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,797
Here.

863
00:49:37,635 --> 00:49:41,180
"The prize winner is required
to cooperate with any event publicity."

864
00:49:41,263 --> 00:49:42,681
It says so right here.

865
00:49:47,561 --> 00:49:49,021
Then, could you at least

866
00:49:49,855 --> 00:49:51,023
let us use false names?

867
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:56,695
Sure, I'll consider that.

868
00:49:58,489 --> 00:50:01,116
YOO MERI 32, KIM WOOJU 29

869
00:50:02,034 --> 00:50:03,118
Put them under false names.

870
00:50:14,171 --> 00:50:16,173
Can I please take this call?

871
00:50:16,256 --> 00:50:19,051
The ceremony is about to begin,
so don't wander off.

872
00:50:19,134 --> 00:50:20,135
Sure.

873
00:50:21,095 --> 00:50:22,137
Hello?

874
00:50:25,974 --> 00:50:27,518
A case of African encephalitis?

875
00:50:29,395 --> 00:50:30,396
Sure.

876
00:50:30,813 --> 00:50:33,482
I have a fever, and my throat hurts.

877
00:50:35,567 --> 00:50:37,820
Could this be contagious?

878
00:50:41,699 --> 00:50:44,368
That means other people
could get it from me.

879
00:50:44,451 --> 00:50:46,161
I'm in a public space right now.

880
00:50:47,246 --> 00:50:48,622
Yes, of course.

881
00:50:48,706 --> 00:50:51,250
Please let me know
as soon as you have the test results.

882
00:50:52,418 --> 00:50:53,419
Got it.

883
00:50:59,842 --> 00:51:02,010
Honey, do you have a face mask?

884
00:51:02,094 --> 00:51:03,470
I don't. Why?

885
00:51:03,554 --> 00:51:07,141
One of the people I flew in with yesterday

886
00:51:07,641 --> 00:51:09,643
has a case of African encephalitis.

887
00:51:09,727 --> 00:51:11,103
- Goodness me.
- You've heard about it.

888
00:51:11,186 --> 00:51:14,898
It's an infectious disease
that's been taking lives around the world.

889
00:51:14,982 --> 00:51:17,693
- The one with the highest mortality rate.
- Right.

890
00:51:17,776 --> 00:51:19,445
Jeez, this is bad.

891
00:51:19,528 --> 00:51:21,697
My test results aren't back yet,

892
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,449
but since my coworker got it,

893
00:51:23,532 --> 00:51:24,908
they want me retested--

894
00:51:24,992 --> 00:51:26,326
Are you all right?

895
00:51:28,162 --> 00:51:29,538
I think I'm showing symptoms.

896
00:51:29,621 --> 00:51:31,039
This is terrible.

897
00:51:39,423 --> 00:51:40,424
MR. KWON

898
00:51:41,383 --> 00:51:42,384
Yes, Mr. Kwon.

899
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,761
<i>Mr. Baek,</i>

900
00:51:44,303 --> 00:51:45,512
I have urgent news.

901
00:51:47,139 --> 00:51:48,348
A case of African encephalitis?

902
00:51:49,433 --> 00:51:52,186
He's not sick yet,
so make him wear a mask.

903
00:51:52,978 --> 00:51:55,355
That alone isn't enough
to call off the ceremony.

904
00:51:55,439 --> 00:51:57,858
Anyway, the article
about Mr. Lee matters most.

905
00:51:57,941 --> 00:52:00,110
Of course, sir. I understand.

906
00:52:04,031 --> 00:52:06,700
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. Shall we?

907
00:52:22,257 --> 00:52:23,509
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

908
00:52:23,592 --> 00:52:25,511
May I borrow this cap?

909
00:52:25,594 --> 00:52:26,595
Sure.

910
00:52:26,678 --> 00:52:27,805
I'll return it to you soon.

911
00:52:29,223 --> 00:52:33,185
I'll take the photo
in one, two, three.

912
00:52:33,852 --> 00:52:35,979
One, two...

913
00:52:36,063 --> 00:52:38,690
Ma'am, could you lower the flowers?
We can't see your face.

914
00:52:38,774 --> 00:52:41,735
Okay, that's better.
Sir, can you lift your cap a bit?

915
00:52:41,819 --> 00:52:44,613
Lower the flowers, too. Much better.

916
00:52:47,157 --> 00:52:48,784
Focus the camera on Mr. Lee.

917
00:52:48,867 --> 00:52:50,160
Right. Of course.

918
00:52:50,869 --> 00:52:53,622
Mr. Lee, can you flash a generous smile?

919
00:52:53,705 --> 00:52:55,541
Give a killer smile.

920
00:52:55,624 --> 00:52:57,459
One, two, three.

921
00:52:58,252 --> 00:53:00,379
One, two, three!

922
00:53:06,718 --> 00:53:07,803
<i>I'll head out first.</i>

923
00:53:08,971 --> 00:53:10,180
<i>Thanks for today.</i>

924
00:53:10,889 --> 00:53:13,433
<i>I was actually going to take you out
for a meal afterward...</i>

925
00:53:17,437 --> 00:53:18,480
All right.

926
00:53:19,022 --> 00:53:21,525
Now that the ceremony is over,
you can collect your prize.

927
00:53:21,608 --> 00:53:22,609
Right.

928
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:25,904
Here you go.

929
00:53:36,206 --> 00:53:37,291
Thank you.

930
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:40,669
We want nothing but happiness
for you both.

931
00:53:40,752 --> 00:53:42,254
- Right.
- Just a second.

932
00:53:47,968 --> 00:53:51,013
Could you sign this form
saying you received the prize?

933
00:53:51,096 --> 00:53:53,599
- Sure.
- And read the instructions on the back.

934
00:53:53,682 --> 00:53:54,683
Right.

935
00:53:56,143 --> 00:53:57,811
THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE SIGNING THE FORM

936
00:53:59,688 --> 00:54:01,607
RECIPIENT: YOO MERI

937
00:54:03,483 --> 00:54:06,445
- I'll now escort you to the town house.
- Okay.

938
00:54:06,528 --> 00:54:07,863
Good.

939
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:09,781
Hold on.

940
00:54:10,324 --> 00:54:11,450
Where's your husband?

941
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,829
Oh, he went to the hospital
to get retested.

942
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:19,082
It looks like
I'll be the only one to come with you.

943
00:54:19,541 --> 00:54:21,043
Oh, I see.

944
00:54:22,044 --> 00:54:23,503
Shall we get going, then?

945
00:54:40,604 --> 00:54:42,689
- I see you're still here.
- Oh, right.

946
00:54:43,982 --> 00:54:45,317
I was just about to leave.

947
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,860
Which way is the hospital?

948
00:54:49,112 --> 00:54:50,989
Well...

949
00:54:52,032 --> 00:54:54,576
It's in Gangnam.

950
00:54:57,204 --> 00:54:59,331
That's good to hear. I'll drive you there.

951
00:54:59,414 --> 00:55:02,334
No, it's fine. I can just take a cab.

952
00:55:02,417 --> 00:55:04,378
We're headed in that direction anyway.

953
00:55:04,461 --> 00:55:05,921
Which hospital is it?

954
00:55:11,718 --> 00:55:14,971
Actually, I just got off a call
with the hospital.

955
00:55:15,055 --> 00:55:16,306
My test came back negative.

956
00:55:17,766 --> 00:55:19,643
I don't have to get retested.

957
00:55:29,778 --> 00:55:31,113
You should come with us, then.

958
00:55:31,697 --> 00:55:34,157
You'll need a tour of the town house, too.

959
00:55:34,991 --> 00:55:36,159
Sure. What?

960
00:55:36,243 --> 00:55:37,244
Go where?

961
00:55:38,036 --> 00:55:39,037
I'm sorry.

962
00:56:21,913 --> 00:56:25,041
Beauté Palace
is a luxury town house compound

963
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:28,420
created, marketed, and sold
by our own Beauté Construction.

964
00:56:29,588 --> 00:56:33,175
The whole compound was designed
following feng shui principles,

965
00:56:33,258 --> 00:56:34,634
said to provide good energy.

966
00:56:34,718 --> 00:56:37,304
Because of that, it's now home
to political and business leaders

967
00:56:37,387 --> 00:56:40,098
as well as
world-famous Korean celebrities.

968
00:56:40,515 --> 00:56:43,226
You might bump into them
at the gym or cafe inside the compound.

969
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:48,690
Each unit sells for millions,
but none are on the market.

970
00:56:49,274 --> 00:56:53,445
There are three complexes,
and the house you won is in Complex Two.

971
00:56:54,321 --> 00:56:55,322
I see.

972
00:57:18,178 --> 00:57:21,306
You said the chairman
loves kimchi from Punggukdang.

973
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:27,354
Gosh, orders were already full,
but I paid extra to skip ahead in line.

974
00:57:27,437 --> 00:57:29,022
That's right.

975
00:57:29,105 --> 00:57:30,398
Our <i>hangwa?</i>

976
00:57:30,816 --> 00:57:33,902
Of course, we brought some.
That's our main goal today.

977
00:57:34,653 --> 00:57:36,988
I asked them to box only the pretty ones.

978
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,699
Sure. Got it.

979
00:57:39,783 --> 00:57:41,868
I'll call after I'm done.

980
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:45,205
But, Mom,

981
00:57:45,288 --> 00:57:48,667
shouldn't Dad go, since it's the chairman
of the Association of Business Executives?

982
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:50,377
He and Dad went to the same college.

983
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,712
Your dad's giving you an opportunity.

984
00:57:52,796 --> 00:57:55,465
He wants you to accomplish
something in your name.

985
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:59,845
Can I say I did this myself?

986
00:57:59,928 --> 00:58:00,929
That's right.

987
00:58:01,721 --> 00:58:05,684
I heard Wooju handled the design contract
on his first day at the office.

988
00:58:06,101 --> 00:58:08,937
So, you need to do a good job, too.

989
00:58:09,855 --> 00:58:12,816
Also, always keep an eye on him
to see if he's up to anything suspicious.

990
00:58:12,899 --> 00:58:15,360
Sure, I'm to keep an eye on him.

991
00:58:16,945 --> 00:58:20,115
Just wait until I catch him doing
something questionable.

992
00:58:21,241 --> 00:58:23,243
By the way, it's really nice here.

993
00:58:23,326 --> 00:58:25,036
Where am I supposed to go?

994
00:58:44,014 --> 00:58:45,223
The appliances are built in,

995
00:58:45,307 --> 00:58:48,393
and the place comes furnished
since it was used as a show house.

996
00:58:48,476 --> 00:58:50,979
If you'd like,
we could remove them for you.

997
00:58:52,022 --> 00:58:55,066
Not at all. We're grateful to have it all.

998
00:59:01,197 --> 00:59:03,074
There's even a yard.

999
00:59:04,367 --> 00:59:06,703
This looks like a fancy resort.

1000
00:59:10,123 --> 00:59:11,458
I'm glad you like it.

1001
00:59:11,917 --> 00:59:14,336
When are you planning to move in?

1002
00:59:16,421 --> 00:59:17,964
Move in?

1003
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:24,638
You see, there's a chance
we might sell it right away.

1004
00:59:24,721 --> 00:59:28,642
It's quite far
from both of our workplaces.

1005
00:59:29,434 --> 00:59:31,728
It's better to live closer to work.

1006
00:59:36,483 --> 00:59:38,944
Of course, you can sell the house.

1007
00:59:39,402 --> 00:59:41,488
But not right away.

1008
00:59:46,451 --> 00:59:48,203
THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE RECEIVING THE PRIZE

1009
00:59:51,081 --> 00:59:52,624
As previously informed,

1010
00:59:52,707 --> 00:59:55,251
the house can be transferred to
a different owner only after three months.

1011
00:59:55,335 --> 00:59:59,172
Until then, you can't sell it because
it technically belongs to our company.

1012
00:59:59,255 --> 01:00:02,467
Then, why did you give me a key earlier?

1013
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:04,928
It symbolizes your right
to stay in this house.

1014
01:00:07,514 --> 01:00:08,932
Five years ago in England,

1015
01:00:09,015 --> 01:00:11,977
a similar prize event was held
for a million-pound house.

1016
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:15,021
Right after receiving the prize,
the couple got divorced,

1017
01:00:15,105 --> 01:00:16,773
making a mockery of the event.

1018
01:00:17,482 --> 01:00:20,443
That's why we introduced
a three-month grace period

1019
01:00:20,527 --> 01:00:23,029
to demonstrate the event's sincerity.

1020
01:00:23,113 --> 01:00:25,657
If you get divorced during that period,

1021
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:28,827
the prize will become invalid
and be withdrawn.

1022
01:00:29,911 --> 01:00:32,956
Three  months?

1023
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,541
Is there a problem?

1024
01:00:34,958 --> 01:00:38,253
No, of course not.

1025
01:00:38,837 --> 01:00:41,381
We have to move out
of where we're staying now

1026
01:00:41,464 --> 01:00:43,758
and find another place to live.

1027
01:00:44,342 --> 01:00:47,012
We can live here for three months
before selling it.

1028
01:00:48,555 --> 01:00:51,891
Also, there may be a few inspections.

1029
01:00:51,975 --> 01:00:53,059
Inspections?

1030
01:00:53,601 --> 01:00:55,437
It's only a formality,

1031
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,106
but our inspector will call you
before visiting.

1032
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:00,942
But in your case, that won't be necessary

1033
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:03,445
since I'll see you every day.

1034
01:01:04,029 --> 01:01:05,280
- Sorry?
- What?

1035
01:01:05,363 --> 01:01:07,365
I'm one of the residents here.

1036
01:01:07,824 --> 01:01:09,451
What? You live here, too?

1037
01:01:09,534 --> 01:01:10,785
Which house is yours?

1038
01:01:10,869 --> 01:01:11,995
The one across the street.

1039
01:01:15,874 --> 01:01:17,417
That...

1040
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,252
- Over there?
- That one?

1041
01:01:20,128 --> 01:01:24,424
It's been lonely with the house empty,
and I'm thrilled to have new neighbors.

1042
01:01:27,594 --> 01:01:29,596
That's great.

1043
01:01:30,388 --> 01:01:32,599
You can
take a look around later on.

1044
01:01:32,682 --> 01:01:36,561
For now, I'll show you
the community center and walking trail.

1045
01:01:36,644 --> 01:01:38,980
We'll meet out front in 20 minutes.

1046
01:01:39,064 --> 01:01:40,815
I'll go and get changed.

1047
01:01:40,899 --> 01:01:42,275
- Sure.
- Right.

1048
01:01:42,358 --> 01:01:43,359
Then...

1049
01:02:01,086 --> 01:02:03,254
THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE RECEIVING THE PRIZE

1050
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:15,350
Seriously.

1051
01:02:15,433 --> 01:02:17,769
What do you mean you'll move in here?

1052
01:02:18,394 --> 01:02:19,771
Do you want to get caught?

1053
01:02:20,688 --> 01:02:22,524
You see,

1054
01:02:22,607 --> 01:02:25,527
I need to move out by the end of this week

1055
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:26,903
and have nowhere to go.

1056
01:02:28,738 --> 01:02:29,989
But don't worry too much.

1057
01:02:30,073 --> 01:02:33,827
He may live across the street,
but I doubt I'll see him often.

1058
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:37,288
He just said he was thrilled
to have new neighbors.

1059
01:02:37,372 --> 01:02:39,582
He could come by every morning
and suggest we work out together.

1060
01:02:42,418 --> 01:02:43,461
Then,

1061
01:02:44,629 --> 01:02:46,881
I'll say you're on a business trip.

1062
01:02:46,965 --> 01:02:48,508
Will you say that every time?

1063
01:02:49,134 --> 01:02:50,552
That's even more suspicious.

1064
01:02:50,635 --> 01:02:52,053
Why not just say

1065
01:02:52,137 --> 01:02:55,140
I spend months at sea fishing
or that I'm a pilot?

1066
01:02:55,223 --> 01:02:56,975
That's a great idea.

1067
01:02:57,058 --> 01:02:58,184
What?

1068
01:02:58,268 --> 01:03:00,103
How is that a good idea?

1069
01:03:00,645 --> 01:03:02,647
What can we do, then?

1070
01:03:03,982 --> 01:03:06,359
If you have any good suggestions,
I'm all ears.

1071
01:03:06,442 --> 01:03:08,278
Why are you turning to me for ideas?

1072
01:03:08,361 --> 01:03:11,030
This is your mess to clean up.

1073
01:03:13,992 --> 01:03:17,370
So much for this being a one-time thing.

1074
01:03:17,996 --> 01:03:20,039
I shouldn't have believed you.

1075
01:03:22,041 --> 01:03:23,293
What now?

1076
01:03:23,376 --> 01:03:25,420
The guy across the street
will be watching us.

1077
01:03:26,004 --> 01:03:27,255
I'm sorry.

1078
01:03:28,256 --> 01:03:30,133
I'll make sure
you're not bothered by this.

1079
01:03:30,216 --> 01:03:32,343
How can I not be worried?

1080
01:03:32,427 --> 01:03:35,013
An article with our photo was published.

1081
01:03:35,555 --> 01:03:40,018
Now that I'm involved,
I'll also get in trouble if we get caught.

1082
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,478
Don't think about living here.

1083
01:03:42,562 --> 01:03:44,022
Things will get worse if we're caught.

1084
01:03:44,647 --> 01:03:47,400
Then, where am I supposed to live?

1085
01:03:47,483 --> 01:03:49,110
Stay at a dry sauna for all I care.

1086
01:04:22,644 --> 01:04:24,812

TEAM LEADER KIM WOOJU

1088
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:38,493
Hello?

1089
01:04:38,576 --> 01:04:40,745
I'm sorry I yelled at you earlier,

1090
01:04:40,828 --> 01:04:42,789
but if you were in my shoes--

1091
01:04:44,457 --> 01:04:46,960
Excuse me, can you help us?

1092
01:04:47,043 --> 01:04:48,544
Where's Complex Three...

1093
01:04:49,504 --> 01:04:50,505
Wooju, is that you?

1094
01:04:51,798 --> 01:04:52,840
Wooju?

1095
01:04:54,509 --> 01:04:55,593
Hello?

1096
01:05:00,473 --> 01:05:01,474
Mr. Kim?

1097
01:05:05,895 --> 01:05:07,313
Where are you right now?

1098
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:10,191
Auntie.

1099
01:05:10,275 --> 01:05:11,526
What are you doing here?

1100
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:15,363
Oh, I'm here to see a friend.

1101
01:05:15,446 --> 01:05:18,199
What? A friend? What friend?

1102
01:05:18,908 --> 01:05:19,909
Just a friend.

1103
01:05:19,993 --> 01:05:21,577
Anyway, what brings you two here?

1104
01:05:21,661 --> 01:05:23,621
We're here to see the chairman of--

1105
01:05:23,705 --> 01:05:25,790
We're here to see someone we know.

1106
01:05:25,873 --> 01:05:27,583
It's nothing important.

1107
01:05:30,128 --> 01:05:31,587
You're already out.

1108
01:05:35,216 --> 01:05:36,801
- I'll see you around.
- Sure.

1109
01:05:40,054 --> 01:05:42,724
Hey, did you say
the walking trail was that way?

1110
01:05:42,807 --> 01:05:43,850
- It is.
- Right.

1111
01:05:48,813 --> 01:05:50,064
What about your wife?

1112
01:05:50,648 --> 01:05:51,649
Sorry?

1113
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:54,986
His wife?

1114

CACTUS

1115
01:07:14,388 --> 01:07:17,114
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

1116
01:07:17,193 --> 01:07:20,363
- Who were those people?
- <i>My relatives.</i>

1117
01:07:20,446 --> 01:07:22,031
<i>The winner was announced.</i>

1118
01:07:22,115 --> 01:07:23,241
<i>The winner is...</i>

1119
01:07:23,324 --> 01:07:25,785
I'd love for you
to be my granddaughter-in-law.

1120
01:07:25,868 --> 01:07:28,621
<i>I'll trust you've got my back</i>
<i>and make my move on him.</i>

1121
01:07:28,704 --> 01:07:31,207
<i>Looks like you could be</i>
<i>getting what you want</i>

1122
01:07:31,666 --> 01:07:33,292
<i>by pretending it's for wedding photos.</i>

1123
01:07:33,376 --> 01:07:34,669
What was that look just now?

1124
01:07:36,963 --> 01:07:41,217
<i>Does your husband</i>
<i>actually live here?</i>
