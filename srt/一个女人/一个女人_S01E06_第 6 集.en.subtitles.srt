1
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:39,998
Ms. Kim.

2
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,668
Sorry for asking you
to do that last night.

3
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,005
It's my job.

4
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,300
How's Mi-na?

5
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,390
This was from a while ago.

6
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,517
Yes?

7
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,852
Just as you did,

8
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:05,774
Madam instructed us
to feed Ms. Kang food with peanuts in it.

9
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,986
I wasn't home at the time,
so someone else served it to her.

10
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,990
She wanted to know
how serious her nut allergy was

11
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,409
and whether or not
she'd actually die from it.

12
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,870
I think that's what she wanted to know.

13
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:23,833
Since Ms. Kang
had not lost her memory back then,

14
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,212
she could've stopped eating
if she felt something strange.

15
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,380
But now, since she has no memory,

16
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,050
she'd keep eating
even if she feels something wrong.

17
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:38,807
Did it not matter what happened to her?

18
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,978
Make your point.

19
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,941
That was why

20
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:52,445
when you told me
to make Ms. Kang kongguksu,

21
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:57,033
I made it with all soybeans
and no nut powder.

22
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,667
I don't care what you do
outside for the company.

23
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,670
But don't drag that into the home.

24
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,090
However,

25
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,721
Ms. Kang said she got sick
because of the kongguksu.

26
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,433
How strange.

27
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,998
Darn it.

28
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,000
Whatever.

29
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,299
Mr. No, where are you?

30
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,051
I heard you're taking the day off.

31
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,887
So why did you call me?

32
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,305
I'm busy.

33
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,015
I'm stuck in my room all day.

34
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,808
I'm bored to death.

35
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,476
By the way,

36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,563
what is Mr. Han doing today?

37
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,273
Why do you ask?

38
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,026
You said you're busy.

39
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,279
And you two are the only ones
I know at the moment.

40
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,739
So what is he doing?

41
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,492
I'm the head of legal,

42
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,995
not his personal assistant.

43
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,831
Satisfy your personal curiosity
on your own.

44
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,418
Leave Mr. Han alone today.

45
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,211
You're cranky today.

46
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,338
Fine, I get it.

47
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:34,672
But the thing is,

48
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,885
I can't sleep at night
when I'm curious about something.

49
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,929
Why must I leave him alone today?

50
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,848
I just told you to satisfy
your personal curiosity on your own.

51
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,184
Why won't you listen to me?

52
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,770
He has many places to visit today.

53
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,104
Leave him alone.

54
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,190
Why? Where is he going?

55
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,484
What is it? Why?

56
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,526
Jeez.

57
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:00,240
HEAD OF LEGAL DEPARTMENT, NO HAK-TAE

58
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,676
HAN KANG-SIK

59
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,103
It seems like Sung-hye was

60
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,981
planning to reveal
your father's accounting fraud.

61
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,650
So your father must have tried

62
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,360
to either move the ledgers

63
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,363
or burn them up, thinking it was too late.

64
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,365
What a fool.

65
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:47,120
He couldn't escape the fire
because of the ledgers.

66
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,329
Uncle.

67
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,457
You know my father wouldn't do that.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,418
Please look into it again.

69
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,629
Think about all the kindness
my father has shown

70
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,131
to Hanju Fashion and Sung-hye.

71
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,342
He would never do that.

72
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,386
You don't seem to understand.

73
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,888
Business doesn't work like that.

74
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,349
Just because
you've shown kindness to someone

75
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,184
doesn't mean you'll be repaid.

76
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:15,940
Rather, it would prove more beneficial
to have something on that person.

77
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,372
It seems like Chief will step down

78
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,458
in the next reshuffle.

79
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,795
-Is that right?
-He's likely to lose investigation rights.

80
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,796
Rumor has it

81
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,631
that you're most likely to be

82
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,383
the next chief.

83
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:46,763
If you become the chief,
you're on the vice-minister level, right?

84
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,016
Congratulations in advance, Chief.

85
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,018
I mean, Deputy Chief.

86
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,479
It's not like I'm going to be
the vice-minister.

87
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,981
He's right. That's not the point.

88
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,733
Once he becomes the chief,

89
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,027
it means he can even become
Prosecutor General someday.

90
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,487
You're almost there, sir.

91
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,781
Come on.

92
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,783
Your chief is being demoted.

93
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,117
How could you say that?

94
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,829
Of course, we feel devastated.

95
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,749
I thought he was on a roll.

96
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,375
Who would've known he'd fall

97
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,087
because of the bribes
he took from conglomerates?

98
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,714
Does that make any sense?

99
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,382
What do you think?

100
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,934
Any update on the missing person report?

101
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,895
-The police seem confused.
-Why?

102
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,480
She's a young female prosecutor,

103
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,774
and she was seen at the office
a few days ago.

104
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,943
They're unsure if she really went missing.

105
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,362
-Gosh.
-They're searching for her,

106
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,531
but they think
she may have disappeared voluntarily.

107
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,742
Do you have her address?

108
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,046
My gosh. What are you doing here?

109
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,132
Do I know you?

110
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,300
Doesn't she recognize me?

111
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,347
You're Ms. Kang Mi-na, aren't you?

112
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,435
Well, yes.
I have some business to take care of here.

113
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,981
Don't you remember me?

114
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,566
I was your chauffeur for a while.

115
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,152
My name is Hwang Yong-sik.

116
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,530
Oh, right. I remember you now.

117
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,282
Nice to see you.

118
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,199
What's going on?

119
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,160
I'll pay you a visit soon.

120
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,786
Sure.

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,834
Who is he?

122
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,753
He claims to be
Kang Mi-na's old chauffeur.

123
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,006
Her chauffeur?

124
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,759
Why couldn't you wait
until I got off the phone?

125
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,387
You shouldn't talk to strangers like that.

126
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,764
You were taking too long.

127
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,476
I couldn't hang up on an officer, could I?

128
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,270
The prosecutor I was supposed to meet
went missing.

129
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,107
Maybe I should look for her.

130
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,902
Is looking for missing persons your job?

131
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,988
You haven't even found Kang Mi-na yet.

132
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:12,325
Apparently, I was the last person
to talk to her on the phone.

133
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,660
I'm worried she told someone

134
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,662
about talking to me
and someone harmed her.

135
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,997
You may not be

136
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,749
as important as you think you are.

137
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:23,294
But I'm not as unimportant
as you think I am.

138
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,630
I'm the head of legal at Hanju Group.

139
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,090
It's hard for me to keep a low profile.

140
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,301
Sure, people do notice you.

141
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,054
But you're a bit like that stuff
that goes under sashimi.

142
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,138
People do notice it,

143
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,474
but no one knows what it's called,
nor does anyone eat it.

144
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,475
So what's the use?

145
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,978
If I'm so unimportant,
why do you want my company?

146
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,396
You could've ordered food online.

147
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,981
That would take forever.

148
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,275
I'm starving.

149
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,652
Gosh. What should I eat first?

150
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:52,031
Did she take off after getting a fill-in
who looks just like her?

151
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,576
Anyway, that woman is pretending

152
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,329
to be Kang Mi-na. Is that it?

153
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,002
-Hello?
-You punk.

154
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:09,423
I told you to lie low somewhere abroad.
Why are you back here causing trouble?

155
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,051
Oh, my. What a surprise.

156
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:17,640
I was going to visit you soon.
But I didn't expect you to call me first.

157
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:29,110
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

158
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,612
I heard it's your birthday today.

159
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,532
She wouldn't stop grilling me.

160
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,201
Is your birthday a national secret?

161
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,871
Why would you hide it?
We should celebrate. Come here.

162
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,332
At home,

163
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,877
I never get to throw parties like this.

164
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,046
I'm grilling meat
because I want to have it,

165
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,756
not because it's your birthday.

166
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,511
Nice.

167
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,392
When you cook,

168
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:05,062
you need to cut them into big pieces

169
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,856
so they taste better.

170
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,608
Ms. Kim tells me

171
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:12,069
to cut vegetables into thin strips
and make a flower out of a carrot.

172
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,989
She makes me do weird stuff
and treats me like a terrible cook.

173
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,410
What is it? Are you embarrassed by me?

174
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,495
Please be understanding.

175
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,248
Because of an allergic reaction
to peanuts or some beans,

176
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,126
I had to pretend like I was sick
and starved all day. Jeez.

177
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,799
By the way, the fridges here are so empty.

178
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,594
-I don't like it either.
-I know, right?

179
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,137
I don't cook at all.

180
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,389
I don't like salty food either.

181
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,229
Who made this?

182
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,732
Who else? I did.

183
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,817
It's so good.

184
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,904
I'm such a good cook,
but no one in the family likes it,

185
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,405
so I'm frustrated.

186
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,159
Don't mind him.

187
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,997
I shouldn't. He said he doesn't like
salty food, but he emptied it.

188
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,421
I couldn't help but finish it

189
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,923
since you made it.

190
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,634
Maybe I was a restaurant owner

191
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:17,927
or something.

192
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,970
I wish I was.

193
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,889
Excuse me.

194
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,433
Can you grill it longer?

195
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,768
I like my beef well done.

196
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,021
Goodness, you don't know
how to enjoy beef.

197
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,148
It's nicely cooked.

198
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,071
You know,
rich people tend to be out of trend.

199
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,908
I'll cook it thoroughly so it'll be chewy.

200
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,915
DIRECTOR HAN SUNG-HYE

201
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,168
The surveillance camera records
within the hotel have all been erased.

202
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,545
What about Mi-na?

203
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,589
I've looked into the records
in emergency centers, nursing homes

204
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,509
and departures like you told me,
but there's nothing noticeable

205
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,635
until this hour.

206
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,720
But…

207
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,141
it looks like someone
checked those records already.

208
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,644
It seems like
someone from Yumin Group did.

209
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,732
-Could it be someone from the board?
-I haven't figured that out yet.

210
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,068
I don't think it'll be easy to find her.

211
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,028
How about reporting it to the police?

212
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,698
Do you want all the subsidiaries
to be handed over to Yumin Group

213
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,032
by telling the public she's fake?

214
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,536
Don't ever expose what you've found out,

215
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,248
and use any means possible to find her.

216
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,209
We'll decide whom to work with

217
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,378
after that.

218
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,504
Yes, ma'am.

219
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:40,342
I'm looking for the missing paintings
through some of the art dealers.

220
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,179
This is the record
of the auction you asked for.

221
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,847
You can leave.

222
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,407
What?

223
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,497
Lee Bong-sik?

224
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:26,889
My gosh.

225
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,100
Why didn't we meet
in a cafe with big windows

226
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,477
on a fine day like this?

227
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,312
Why did you want to see me

228
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,397
in a dark parking lot?

229
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,816
You scum.

230
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,694
Who did you meet here?

231
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:41,695
Why?

232
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,740
Am I supposed to meet some people?

233
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,451
Didn't anyone follow you around?

234
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,744
Who would…

235
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,248
Bong-sik.

236
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,916
Isn't that you, Bong-sik?

237
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,044
Of course.

238
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,130
There was someone.

239
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,844
So what happened?

240
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,472
-What do you mean?
-Did you…

241
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,476
Did you tell her that I let go of you

242
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,519
on purpose?

243
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,729
Was I not supposed to say that?

244
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:16,814
Why that jerk…

245
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:17,982
Answer me straight!

246
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,316
Prosecutor Ryu.

247
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,402
Are you flustered?

248
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,655
Use that good brain of yours and think.

249
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,823
Someone did follow me,

250
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,075
but I wouldn't be here
if I'd told her about it.

251
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,288
So who is she anyway?

252
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,081
Is she on our side or is she our foe?

253
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,834
You piece of trash.

254
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,215
Don't go blabbering around.

255
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,676
-Leave the country with this.
-Gosh.

256
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,139
My gosh, Prosecutor Ryu.

257
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,517
You're upset, aren't you?

258
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,187
My gosh, it's money.

259
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,817
By the way, three years ago,

260
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,652
during Lee Bong-sik-gate,

261
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,863
you told me this.

262
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:09,325
You said everyone including
you, me, and the rich lady

263
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,161
will have an easy life if I disappeared.

264
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,038
So I did,

265
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,498
and everyone seemed to be
living an easy life.

266
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,958
But it looked like

267
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,086
I was the only one suffering.

268
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:26,091
Besides, a prosecutor such as yourself

269
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,469
came to deliver cash to me.

270
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,558
It seems like I have the upper hand.

271
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,268
You jerk.

272
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,978
What are you scheming?

273
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,816
There seems to be something fishy
about that rich lady,

274
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,610
so I've been thinking about

275
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,905
whether to blackmail her or befriend her.

276
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,950
I'll give it more thought.

277
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,403
This is what I meant by useless manners.

278
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,155
It feels refreshing
to open a can of beer myself.

279
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,573
Congratulations.

280
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,958
I haven't been able to drink at all
because of Kang Mi-na.

281
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,210
She doesn't know
what she's missing out on.

282
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,381
I can't believe
I had a meal with people on my birthday.

283
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,341
You're lucky.

284
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,011
I don't know when mine is,
so I can't celebrate it.

285
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,596
I heard you hate
celebrating your birthday,

286
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,474
so I skipped blowing candles.
You can thank me later.

287
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,310
It's been quite a while
since I celebrated it.

288
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,188
Then what did you do on your birthdays?

289
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,358
I watched the stars, and…

290
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,944
Stars? Why would you watch the stars?

291
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,988
Where are they?

292
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,364
I didn't mean that.

293
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,036
When you type in your birthday
on the NASA homepage,

294
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:22,291
they show you a photo of space
taken on that day.

295
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,959
This is incredible.

296
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,630
My father died on my birthday.

297
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,802
Was he sick?

298
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,346
No, he died in a fire accident.

299
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,646
I was very interested
in my father's company then,

300
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,858
and my friend from college
who was also an accountant

301
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,528
told me that there was something wrong
with the company's ledger.

302
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,365
So I asked my dad about it the next day,

303
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,786
and he went to check the ledger

304
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,747
at the Hanju Fashion factory.

305
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,334
And a fire broke out there.

306
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,213
But people said

307
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,840
it was my dad who manipulated the ledger.

308
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,054
What would've happened
if I hadn't told him about the ledger?

309
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,475
At least he wouldn't have died
in the factory.

310
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,231
But it's not like

311
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,109
I can turn back time.

312
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,699
When I'm tormented with such thoughts,

313
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,786
seeing such a vast universe

314
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,622
makes me think those thoughts are trivial.

315
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,124
Then I feel a little better.

316
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,880
My mom and Mr. No,

317
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,715
and all of my close friends know

318
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,469
that my dad died on my birthday,
so they always tried to keep it low-key.

319
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,140
It's been a while
since someone wished me a happy birthday.

320
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,269
It's probably the best thing you did

321
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,146
after you lost your memory.

322
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,443
But you know,

323
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,823
you're not 100 percent responsible

324
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,283
for what happened.

325
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,205
I can't say this for sure,

326
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,499
but I'm certain that your father

327
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,625
wouldn't want his son

328
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:32,212
to be tormented for the rest of his life.

329
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,845
Gosh, the weather is great.

330
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,023
Are you okay?

331
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,073
What is it?

332
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,872
You're the first person

333
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,876
who asked me if I was okay

334
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,878
the whole day today.

335
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,297
Well…

336
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,717
You look so sad.

337
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,349
Because of me, my father…

338
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,901
CREMATION AUTHORIZATION FORM

339
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,236
DECEASED ON OCTOBER 2, 2007

340
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,528
DATE OF BIRTH, OCTOBER 2, 1986

341
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,405
His father passed away on his birthday.

342
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,417
You know,

343
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,463
I heard somewhere in this universe,

344
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,925
you can see the sun rise and set
sixteen times a day.

345
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:06,181
So in that sense, dates mean nothing.

346
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,144
When I think about
how vast the universe is,

347
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,814
things like today's date

348
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,942
and all the special days
that roll around every year

349
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,237
don't mean much to me.

350
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:42,884
What is it?

351
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,846
What? Nothing.

352
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,350
You should get going, right?

353
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,519
Why are you trying to kick me out?

354
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,731
I live with my in-laws at the moment.

355
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,108
Do you really think
I'd want to go home now?

356
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,277
When I'm out, people treat me with respect

357
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,445
and call me "Chairman."

358
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,404
When I'm home,

359
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,114
everyone bosses me around.

360
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,993
AFFAIR WITH HUSBAND'S COUSIN?

361
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,036
What's this?

362
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,998
Another tabloid article about Sung-woon?

363
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,085
My gosh. It's about Mi-na.

364
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,463
She must be totally out of her mind.

365
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,674
She must've been hanging out
with her cousin-in-law so often

366
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,676
for such disgusting rumors to have spread.

367
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,180
So what will you do?

368
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,223
What do you mean?

369
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,392
Are you so dying

370
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,270
to get your hands on Mi-na's money
that you've lost your mind?

371
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,397
No, it's not that.

372
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,232
What could they even do with this?

373
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,819
There were rumors like this
in the past too.

374
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,613
It's happened before.

375
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,908
Why gather us and make all this fuss
knowing how busy everyone is?

376
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:51,078
Hey, get her pregnant at once
so she can't go out.

377
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,996
And you should serve as acting chairman.

378
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,248
Yes. You've tried all sorts of things

379
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,876
to get pregnant after you got married.

380
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,670
Give her some pointers.

381
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,339
My goodness.

382
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,883
What are you talking about?
I didn't even have to try.

383
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:08,136
My kind heart helped me conceive easily,

384
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,263
-and I gave birth to my son.
-Be quiet.

385
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,975
What are you going to do?
When can you get her pregnant?

386
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,561
Can you not get it done
because you think of it as work?

387
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,939
Mom, please.
It's not something I can control.

388
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,316
This is the only
tabloid article about her,

389
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,151
but how many do you have?

390
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,946
If she wants a divorce and sues you,
you'll be at a disadvantage.

391
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,531
Will you sit back and do nothing?

392
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,032
Okay, I heard you.

393
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,289
Seriously,
why are you trying to kick me out?

394
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:37,874
Okay, fine.

395
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,377
I'll just have one more beer and leave.

396
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,385
My gosh, you're so lame.

397
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,054
Why do you keep a stash of this
in your fridge?

398
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,432
This is the magic powder
that puts you in a good mood.

399
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,615
I call this "Magic Powder."

400
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,909
Have some when you feel down.
It'll cheer you up.

401
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,122
Just what I need right now.

402
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:37,058
What? What now?

403
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,270
Are you upset that I ate this?

404
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,147
Have you been saving this sugar packet?

405
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,358
Who told you?

406
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,069
That it's called "Magic Powder"?

407
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,156
I don't know.
Don't many people call it that?

408
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,662
Let's go.

409
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,853
Where were you all day?
You said you weren't feeling well.

410
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,689
I had so much work to do.

411
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,109
Work, my foot.

412
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,196
You sure you weren't hanging out
with your cousin-in-law all day?

413
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,908
What? Do you feel guilty
because I'm right?

414
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,744
I guess the rumors are true.

415
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,206
Stop going out and doing stupid things.

416
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,832
Just stay home and have a kid.

417
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,878
I didn't say anything until now
because I didn't want a grandkid

418
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,004
born of your blood,

419
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,464
but the situation has changed.

420
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,259
I know that my son

421
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,095
never even spared you a glance
in the past,

422
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,514
but what's the problem now?

423
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,058
Don't tell me you're on birth control.

424
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,060
Gosh, seriously.

425
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,813
It's your son's private life.

426
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,732
Aren't you embarrassed
to ask your daughter-in-law about it?

427
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,360
It's like you're trying
to get pigs to mate or something.

428
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,113
What? Pigs?

429
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,490
Hey! For a family like us,

430
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:17,200
it is not considered "private."

431
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,785
"A family like us?" What are you?

432
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,996
Do you think
you're the Joseon royal family?

433
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,207
If you were born in the Joseon Dynasty,
you'd just be a rich commoner.

434
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,293
A mere commoner!

435
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,795
I guess I should be glad
that you didn't gather around

436
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,839
and discuss your son's sex life.

437
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:40,598
Please refrain from discussing
such personal matters.

438
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,225
I'll be upstairs.

439
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,855
We've been nice to you so far,
but you're way out of line.

440
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,733
I'm trying to be understanding,

441
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,651
but you've changed too much.

442
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,194
You know,

443
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,113
you say that you're trying

444
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,406
to be understanding,

445
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,451
but you're always the one who talks about

446
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,411
what kind of person I was

447
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,121
and use that to bog me down.

448
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,081
What?

449
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,084
Are you saying I'm putting on a charade?

450
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,131
Yes, that thing.

451
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,551
The tablet you used to carry around
all the time.

452
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:19,971
Unlock it.

453
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,976
-You mean, this?
-Let's have a look.

454
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,773
You used it to badmouth the entire family
on social media.

455
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,652
I'm just curious
if you've stopped doing it.

456
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,073
Let's find out who's more fake.

457
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,452
You activated the fingerprint lock

458
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,995
so no one could get into it.

459
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,544
Unlock it right now.

460
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:46,808
Let's go.

461
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,017
TWO HOURS AGO

462
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,645
Why do you keep trying to kick me out?

463
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,815
Okay, fine.

464
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,984
I'll leave
as soon as I unlock this tablet.

465
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,902
Are you planning to spend the night here?

466
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,071
People are simpler than you think.

467
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:04,159
Passcodes are often birthdays
or a series of numbers easy to enter.

468
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,828
I might succeed after just a few attempts.

469
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,165
When was Kang Mi-na's birthday again?

470
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,250
June 23, 1988.

471
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,878
What?

472
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,634
It's wrong.

473
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,429
Then it must be the birthday

474
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,389
of someone important to her.

475
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,349
But how are you going to figure that out?

476
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,352
You're two years older than her, right?

477
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,158
Bingo.

478
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,494
What?

479
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,163
I unlocked it by entering today's date.

480
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,040
Your birthday.

481
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,133
Did you two even share the same passcode?

482
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,598
There's nothing here.

483
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,225
No social media apps or anything.

484
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,102
Wait.

485
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:18,066
"Heo Jae-hee, Conglomerates Fund?"

486
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,443
She knew about that?

487
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,238
What's this?

488
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,865
It seemed like

489
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,992
the first daughter-in-law fell for a scam.

490
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,830
I wonder why Mi-na wrote this here.

491
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:32,872
Beats me.

492
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,208
Was she going to blackmail her
or something?

493
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:04,946
"Sung-woon has had an affair with
news anchor Park So-yi for years."

494
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:10,493
"From 2018 to 2019,
he dated golfer Jung Bo-bae."

495
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,912
"From 2017 to 2018,
he dated patissier Park Hye-na."

496
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:13,955
"From 2016 to 2017…"

497
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,582
I bet

498
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:19,294
this scumbag is even
going to hit on a nurse on his deathbed.

499
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,421
"Han Sung-mi."

500
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,464
DRUGS FOUND IN HER ROOM

501
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,859
"Until recently, she had been going
to drug parties many times a month."

502
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,321
She was the one
the prosecution should've taken.

503
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,864
Why did they take me?

504
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,407
"Seo Myung-won."

505
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,951
"Seo Myung-won?" Who's that?

506
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,544
Say that again. What did you just say?

507
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,256
I said you should stop.

508
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,092
It's not like

509
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,470
either of us wanted to be born

510
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,597
or live this kind of life.

511
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,600
How dare you…

512
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,101
How could you?

513
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,777
"She was banned from
attending their memorial service

514
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,946
for being a love child,
and she took it out on…

515
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:29,989
her second daughter-in-law."

516
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,285
These medical records show
that Mi-na was hit

517
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,912
on the same day every year.

518
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,705
Unbelievable.

519
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:41,084
They were both born out of wedlock.
How could she take it out on Mi-na?

520
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,378
When two people are similar,
they become friends.

521
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,047
But when they're too similar,
they often become enemies.

522
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:49,676
Mi-na probably reminded her
of something she wanted to hide.

523
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,803
Wait a second.

524
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,722
About Han Sung-hye and Han Young-sik,

525
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,809
she only wrote, "2007 accounting fraud,"

526
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,519
and nothing more.

527
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,897
That must involve my father.

528
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:07,610
Maybe the whole thing is their weakness.

529
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,904
Once the truth comes out,

530
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,280
it'll be their weakness?

531
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:13,950
Does that mean

532
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:17,912
all Hanju Group members' weaknesses

533
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,956
are in my hands?

534
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,046
This is the assailant's call log.

535
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,923
Hello?

536
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,341
Hello?

537
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,846
I don't think it's something
you should be happy about.

538
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,473
What if this is the reason

539
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,684
they ran you over?

540
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:40,977
And they're keeping you alive

541
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,604
because you're supposed to have
forgotten about this now.

542
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,356
You think so?

543
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:49,110
I've been suspecting they not only
framed my father for the fraud

544
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,612
but also were involved in his death.

545
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,948
And I'm more convinced now.

546
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,826
Is that why you came back to Korea?

547
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,165
Even though it happened a long time ago,

548
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:05,043
if I could find witnesses
or evidence related to the case,

549
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,920
I thought I could clear my father's name.

550
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,049
And Mi-na was supposed to help me.

551
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,259
But as you know,

552
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,636
she got switched with you.

553
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,478
Anyway, after seeing what's on her tablet,

554
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,937
I'm thinking Mi-na

555
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,690
may have gone into hiding on purpose.

556
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,859
Then what are you going to do?

557
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:32,945
Since she ran on her own,
are you going to stop looking for her?

558
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,574
More importantly,

559
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,953
why are we taking this long walk?

560
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,497
What can I do?

561
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,332
I was supposed to starve all day

562
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,959
but ended up feasting on meat
and even drinking.

563
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:51,005
I can't go home smelling like this.

564
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,549
I'm hoping the fresh air
will remove some of the smell.

565
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,219
Stop making such a fuss.

566
00:34:56,302 --> 00:35:00,264
What I don't understand is
why we have to take a walk like this.

567
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,100
I didn't ask you to come with me.

568
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,060
You volunteered.

569
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,771
Also, even if a car speeds by,

570
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,982
you don't have to protect me
by grabbing me by the waist or something.

571
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,567
I'm different from most girls.

572
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,611
If you do that,
instead of falling in love,

573
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:17,031
I'll throw you to the ground right away.

574
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,741
Come on.

575
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,621
Is this really necessary?

576
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,040
Up close,
you smelled like a middle-aged man.

577
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,250
What?

578
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,378
I think you're ready to go home.

579
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,048
What are you going to do now?

580
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,926
I've tested the waters
with a prosecutor at Seopyung DPO

581
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,344
regarding the old case.

582
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,762
Seopyung DPO?

583
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,223
Is it the one who came to take me?

584
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,435
I figured he would be up for
going against Hanju Group.

585
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,229
You can never trust prosecutors.

586
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,064
You have no idea what they're like.

587
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:35,067
They kiss up to whoever is next in line

588
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,779
and are always in search of someone
who will have their backs.

589
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,031
Mr. Cha.

590
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,658
-Isn't that Ms. Cho over there?
-Ms. Cho?

591
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:45,119
You should never trust prosecutors.

592
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,706
Also, did you say Seopyung,
not Seoul Central?

593
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,874
Forget it.

594
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,709
-What's with her?
-No way.

595
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,545
Why is she badmouthing prosecutors
near the office while on leave?

596
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,423
-I doubt all prosecutors are like that.
-They are.

597
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:01,219
Also, I can't go on like this.

598
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,428
What does she mean?

599
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,847
Didn't you see what's on that tablet?

600
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:05,848
Who knows?

601
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,100
Maybe they hired someone to harm me.

602
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,853
What tablet is she talking about?

603
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,897
Be quiet. Let's keep listening.

604
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,983
Why don't we just tell the police?

605
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,861
This is just too complicated.
I can't stand it anymore.

606
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,321
I'd rather serve time in prison

607
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,907
for impersonation
and live the rest of my life in peace.

608
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,285
What did she say? Is she going to prison?

609
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,871
What is she going to tell the police?

610
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,957
Is she going to
turn the prosecution upside down?

611
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,626
Then I'll try to find out more
about that prosecutor.

612
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,378
You stall as long as you can

613
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,754
until you're summoned.

614
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:39,632
-What…
-Delete the notes on the tablet.

615
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,217
Reset the fingerprint lock too.

616
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,678
Do you understand? Okay?

617
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,931
Let's go. And take this.

618
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,312
Use it once more before you go home.

619
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,150
Gosh.

620
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,697
My goodness.

621
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:06,993
Unlock it.

622
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,379
What is it you want to know?

623
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,973
It seems clean.

624
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,559
We already deleted all her social media.

625
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,916
Why does he keep telling me
to stall for time?

626
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,377
Does that mean he doesn't care
whether I die or not?

627
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,420
Seriously.

628
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,049
My gosh.

629
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:07,094
Where is he going at this hour?

630
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,014
Why even bother to ask?
I'm sure he's going out to cheat on Mi-na.

631
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,642
Gosh, I can't stay here any longer
because it gives me heart attacks.

632
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,938
Let's relax.

633
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,698
What a nice scent.

634
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,673
You wanted to see me outside? What's up?

635
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:45,966
Order your drink.

636
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,302
A fresh-squeezed juice, please.

637
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,473
Things are hectic at work

638
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,058
because they're reshuffling.

639
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,769
It looks like they're reshuffling
on a large scale.

640
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,396
You might be replaced too.

641
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,439
What do you mean?

642
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,899
It's exactly as you heard.

643
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,818
I don't think I can support you
any longer.

644
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:09,824
Since we didn't have
any financial arrangements,

645
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,325
so there's nothing to settle.

646
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:17,623
We've been playing with fire
for too long, haven't we?

647
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:19,834
You want to break up with me?

648
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,089
Drink up.

649
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,973
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

650
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,810
Do you think I've been keeping my position
thanks to you?

651
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,604
You must think networks are a joke.

652
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,022
You.

653
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,484
I guess you've had a drink or two
with the higher-ups,

654
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:49,113
but I'm the one who passed the exam
and the audition and became an anchor.

655
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:52,783
How dare you belittle me as a gold digger
who got the job from a man?

656
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,037
Are you asking to break up with me
because of your wife?

657
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,415
It's not because of her, to be precise.

658
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:02,001
It's because of you
who kept nagging at me because of my wife.

659
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,087
I want to focus on my family too.

660
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,882
I believe it'd be better
for the both of us

661
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,009
to say it coldly
and to leave no room for reconciliation.

662
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,095
-Hope you understand for the old time's--
-Shut it.

663
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,264
What did you say?

664
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,516
What? What's wrong with that?

665
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,144
That wasn't even a curse.

666
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,314
What's wrong with you?

667
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,798
Since I bet my life on a jerk like you,

668
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,592
I deserve this.

669
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,512
I'll only come to my senses
after such humiliation.

670
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,107
Then what are you going to do?

671
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:51,110
Since she ran on her own,
are you going to stop looking for her?

672
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,372
Ms. Kim, why are you up so early?

673
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,333
I should be asking you.

674
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:51,420
I usually wake up at this hour.
It's too early for you to go out.

675
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,757
I'm going to work early.

676
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,217
It looks like you didn't sleep a wink.

677
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,677
Is something bothering you?

678
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,888
Oh, not at all.

679
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,390
You got sick
after having kongguksu, right?

680
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,101
Yes. Why am I allergic to nuts?

681
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,896
It's fine. It's okay to forget.

682
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,522
That day,

683
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,567
we were out of peanuts
to add in kongguksu,

684
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,069
so I only added soybeans.

685
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:19,948
Director Han Sung-hye told me
to make kongguksu and feed you.

686
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:22,993
Pardon?

687
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:31,168
No wonder! I wasn't that sick!

688
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,880
Of course. Since you didn't add nuts,
I wasn't that sick.

689
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,757
Since you made it with soybeans only.

690
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,885
So I wasn't supposed to be sick, right?

691
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,305
Who told you
that Ms. Kang is allergic to nuts?

692
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:47,685
Are you doubting me or something, Ms. Kim?

693
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:51,397
I told the same thing to Director Han.

694
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,857
That I made kongguksu with soybeans only.

695
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,776
I'm only sharing this fairly.

696
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:00,072
Ms. Kang didn't get along
with the members of this family,

697
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:03,534
but at least she looked like one of them

698
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,370
since she grew up in a similar background.

699
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,789
But you look like…

700
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,753
I'm sure many people will find out soon.

701
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:19,383
But why are you telling me this?

702
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,009
I'm also wondering.

703
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,929
I'm working as a housekeeper,

704
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:26,181
so I should keep my mouth shut.

705
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,935
I guess I'm nearing my end.

706
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,697
That was why Director Han

707
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,324
told me to unlock the tablet
in front of everyone.

708
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,702
She was completely convinced
that I was fake.

709
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,331
This doesn't concern you at all.

710
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:55,294
Everyone's doubting my identity, so
my true identity might be revealed soon.

711
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,295
How can you yawn?

712
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:58,589
If it didn't concern me at all,

713
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:02,259
I wouldn't have come out
so early in the morning.

714
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,969
Because I'm concerned,

715
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:06,638
because you told me
that you want to leave the house fast,

716
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,974
I'm sitting here driving for you.

717
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,101
Haven't you heard?

718
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:12,561
Heard what?

719
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:17,149
Hanju Group told me to return
as the head of the legal department.

720
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,610
It's only right

721
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:20,903
to work as your assistant

722
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,738
in Yumin Group, but…

723
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,031
But why so suddenly?

724
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:27,117
The legal department

725
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,911
has been struggling

726
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,371
without me as their head.

727
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,499
So it's nothing too sudden.

728
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,250
But what worries me

729
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,086
is that

730
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,048
Director Han might be trying

731
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:46,094
to bind your hands and feet.

732
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:50,599
Is that why she's trying
to separate me from you?

733
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:51,975
I see.

734
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:55,354
You're not that important,
so I'm sure that's not her intention.

735
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:59,816
She might have found out
that you were a double agent.

736
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,444
-That I'm concerned about.
-Darn it.

737
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:28,345
-Hello?
-Chairman Kang Mi-na?

738
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,347
Who is this?

739
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,266
This is Prosecutor An Yu-jun
of Seopyung DPO.

740
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:35,143
I'm calling you about the summons.

741
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,353
How can a prosecutor

742
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,522
call a chairman directly?

743
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:39,856
How did you get my number?

744
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,400
Through my connections,

745
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:43,944
I got your number from Ms. Kang Eun-hwa
of Yumin Foundation.

746
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,071
Darn that woman.

747
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:51,034
I see. But why did you call me personally?

748
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,412
We can inform you of the date via post,

749
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,581
but some insist
they never received their summons.

750
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:58,208
That's why I'm calling you personally.

751
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,669
We expect you to be here

752
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:03,297
at 10:00 a.m., three days from today.
Does that work for you?

753
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,007
I see. But the thing is,

754
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,509
that's too soon.

755
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,553
Would you be able to postpone it?

756
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,847
The following week
is the last week of the month.

757
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,057
We have to wrap up a lot of cases by then,

758
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,684
so I can't move it. I'm too busy.

759
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,520
You can't move it because you're too busy?

760
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,980
That's right.

761
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:24,693
Well, then 10:00 a.m. is too early,

762
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,695
so can you at least move it
to later in the day?

763
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,323
The investigators
don't work late these days.

764
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:32,200
If we move it to later in the day,
they'll have to stay late.

765
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,785
This is a small office,

766
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,495
so we're short-staffed.

767
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,290
If you're so short-staffed,
you don't have to--

768
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:41,168
If you're thinking you should just go to
the Central District Prosecutors' Office

769
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,794
instead of causing us trouble,

770
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,255
I'm afraid you can't run away
like you did last time

771
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,258
because this was reassigned to me from
the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

772
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,886
Look. As you know,
I was in an accident recently,

773
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,679
so I'm still not well.

774
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,182
Then we'll analyze all
the security camera footage right away,

775
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,601
and you'll have to come in
if you can move and walk.

776
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,729
-I have to go overseas for work--
-You said you were still not well.

777
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:03,315
We'll put a travel ban on you,
so come in first.

778
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:05,317
A prosecutor like you is hard to come by.

779
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,780
Prosecutors like me aren't so rare.

780
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:12,199
We're so busy working
we have no time to climb the ladder,

781
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,743
so people like you
rarely get to meet us. That's all.

782
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,453
Do you have some kind of illness

783
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,747
that makes you
want to bring the rich to justice?

784
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,791
Not at all. I have no symptoms.

785
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,459
Maybe you just don't know.

786
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:26,004
Hold on, I feel like I've had
this kind of interaction before.

787
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,506
Why does this feel so familiar?

788
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:33,428
Anyway, now you know the date and time.

789
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,721
I have to go.

790
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,849
Wait. Hello?

791
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,645
What a lunatic!

792
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,317
Who was that?

793
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,777
Chairman Kang Mi-na.

794
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,654
You called her yourself?

795
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,948
She's being very difficult.

796
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:56,284
Are you making sure
she can't trick us like she did last time?

797
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,494
What do you mean?

798
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:00,664
I called to tell her that she has
to make it work because we're busy.

799
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:05,252
PROSECUTOR AN YU-JUN

800
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,546
He sounds like a piece of work.

801
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:10,298
Prosecutors like him
can get you in serious trouble.

802
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,093
But why are you telling me this?

803
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,636
Then what do I do?

804
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,555
I can't turn to Mr. No anymore.

805
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:19,433
Should I vent to my secretary
whom I've never met before then?

806
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,559
What if she's a snitch?

807
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:23,311
Nothing happened
when you were questioned last time.

808
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,605
Back then, I was clean.

809
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,233
They had to let me go
because not a single drug was found

810
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,026
in my hair, urine, and blood.

811
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,319
But this time,

812
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,864
Kang Mi-na was involved
in that suspicious art dealing.

813
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:37,367
It means I must keep my statements
consistent about things I don't remember.

814
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:40,370
They're just questioning you as a witness.
It won't be that bad.

815
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,164
Have you been questioned by a prosecutor?

816
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:44,499
Do you even know how prosecutors are?

817
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:47,878
The multiple-choice questions
on the bar exam have eight choices.

818
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,880
It's impossible to guess
the correct answers.

819
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:52,549
Those persistent, determined prosecutors
who passed such an exam

820
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:54,301
will doubt every single thing I say.

821
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,720
So how can I make sure
my statements are consistent?

822
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,598
You're talking as if
you've done this in the past.

823
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,143
That's not important now!

824
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,811
I'm saying I can't do it.

825
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,898
Why won't you call the police
and report Kang Mi-na missing?

826
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,234
I have thought about
reporting her missing,

827
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,945
but if people find out
that you're not the real Kang Mi-na,

828
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:18,158
the Hanju family will track her down
no matter what and hurt her.

829
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,869
Then what about me?

830
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,707
Do you only care about finding her?
Do you not care what happens to me?

831
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,959
I know it'll be stressful,

832
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,462
but let's try to postpone it
and wait it out.

833
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,798
That prosecutor won't postpone it.

834
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,049
And I feel like

835
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:36,134
I'll get caught for something right away…

836
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,220
Forget it!

837
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,391
What's with her?

838
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:50,106
Talk about true love.

839
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,859
Yes, I shouldn't trust anyone.

840
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,653
Only I can protect myself.

841
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,407
YUMIN HOSPITAL

842
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:17,259
If there's anything you need,
I can step out and…

843
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,345
I need to rest alone.

844
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:24,015
Block entry to this floor
and don't let anyone in.

845
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,559
Yes, ma'am.

846
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,821
CHAIRMAN KANG MI-NA HOSPITALIZED
DUE TO EXTREME STRESS

847
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,406
Well, that was quick.

848
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,867
Whatever I do,
I'm always the center of attention.

849
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,662
Someone saw Prosecutor Cho Yeon-ju

850
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,914
saying how rotten and corrupt
the prosecution is

851
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:51,459
and that the prosecutors need a lesson
right by the Prosecutors' Office.

852
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,253
She must've been very drunk.

853
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,922
No. Apparently, she was sober.

854
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,258
What, then? Is she going to start
a revolt or something?

855
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:02,679
I heard through the grapevine
that she's been on leave for a while now.

856
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:05,181
People like her always take time off
before they cause trouble.

857
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:06,933
I also heard about a tablet PC.

858
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,852
So there really is something.

859
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,020
Who will get in trouble this time?

860
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,606
Why would you write that here?

861
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,441
Everyone's been going on
about this all day.

862
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,359
It's not like I made it up.

863
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:21,156
And no one will know
where the rumor came from anyway.

864
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,657
Just eat your food.

865
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:32,667
I heard someone saw Ms. Cho
near the office yesterday.

866
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,628
I heard the rumors too.

867
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,380
The prosecutors are saying
she found something

868
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:40,300
about a conglomerate on some tablet

869
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,178
and is now planning a coup
using that info.

870
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:45,221
-A tablet?
-Yes.

871
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,643
You know, the chief prosecutor

872
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,854
got fired because of the lobbying case.

873
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,315
Goodness.

874
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,443
You may leave.

875
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:08,495
Sir.

876
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,581
You left this yesterday.

877
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,589
Where did you find it?

878
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,467
You took it out to look up something
when we were out drinking

879
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,135
after our team dinner.

880
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,763
This shouldn't get leaked, you know.

881
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,473
I kept it safe for you, sir.

882
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:33,812
All right. There's nothing on it anyway.

883
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,066
-Get going.
-Yes, sir.

884
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,821
There was something, indeed.

885
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,200
Is that when she got her hands on it?

886
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:52,706
Lee Bong-sik, this idiot.
Has he left the country or not?

887
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:55,917
I regret showing him what money can do.

888
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,760
HANJU HOTEL

889
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,305
-She's in the hospital?
-Yes, ma'am.

890
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:10,890
What will she do now?

891
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,351
If the prosecutors find out
that she's lying,

892
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:15,061
things will get even worse for her.

893
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,438
Call the reporters.

894
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:19,274
Just bring it, will you?
I said I'll pay for it!

895
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:21,359
Darn it.

896
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:25,155
-Please don't cause a scene here.
-Hey, get me a glass of tomato juice.

897
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,116
-Why don't we talk inside--
-I said, I'll pay for it!

898
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,618
Hurry up!

899
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:36,291
Hey, go get it now.
It's not like I'm asking you for booze!

900
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,877
I'm sorry, ma'am.

901
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,337
He's been doing that since this morning.

902
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:44,716
-He keeps saying he has to meet someone.
-Okay, get back to work.

903
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,430
I'll tell him to come up to the office.

904
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:53,475
Animals can be smarter than people.

905
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,143
Pardon me?

906
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:02,609
He's setting a trap for himself.

907
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:11,284
You promised to leave the country.
What are you doing here?

908
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:12,452
I promised?

909
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:16,706
It wasn't a promise.
I believe we had a deal.

910
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:20,919
But in hindsight, it was an unfair deal.

911
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,922
You'll never understand

912
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:27,008
because you grew up like a princess
thanks to your rich parents.

913
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:29,302
But it's tough for ordinary folk like me.

914
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:31,429
They say we'll live to 100,

915
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,139
but I have no retirement savings.

916
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:36,142
It's really frustrating.

917
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,561
You talk too much.

918
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,313
What?

919
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:44,984
Losers always talk too much.

920
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:48,530
The same goes for dogs.
The ones that bite never bark.

921
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:55,203
Be a better judge of character
if you want to call yourself

922
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,247
a con man.

923
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,508
Look at him slurping the noodles.

924
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:11,094
It's hot.

925
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,222
The noodles have soaked up the broth.

926
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:16,266
-I'm starving.
-He's slurping nonstop.

927
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,559
The color of the noodles--

928
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:26,067
Mr. No, can you come by now?

929
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:27,861
What's going on?

930
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,697
I'm starving.

931
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,533
I just remembered
that I haven't eaten anything all day.

932
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:36,369
I'm hungry too.

933
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,163
Because of the backlog of lawsuits,

934
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:40,039
I'm still working
and haven't even eaten yet.

935
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,332
Don't they feed you there?

936
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:44,794
I told them I had acute stomach cramps,
so they're only giving me porridge.

937
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:47,088
It's not even porridge. It's like water.

938
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:49,382
Be patient.

939
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:53,678
What if I visit you during office hours
and people get the wrong idea?

940
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,388
Fine. Bye.

941
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,281
Hello?

942
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:17,702
The thing is, I'm starving to death.

943
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:22,165
Can you get me a jokbaengi set?

944
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:25,335
Get you what?

945
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:26,836
A jokbaengi set.

946
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:30,006
I mean jokbal plus golbaengi.
Never heard of it?

947
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,301
You're the one who stormed out earlier.

948
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,470
How could you call me
out of the blue and ask…

949
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:38,932
-I'm busy.
-Hold on.

950
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,892
Please, I beg you.

951
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:43,937
I'm practically locked up here,
and Mr. No can't come over.

952
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,480
I'm faking acute stomach cramps,

953
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,649
so they're only giving me water.

954
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:52,237
Why did you pick acute stomach cramps,
of all diseases?

955
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,780
What else could I do?

956
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,823
If I'd said I had a herniated disc
or broke an arm or leg,

957
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,825
the prosecutors would've
gone through the CCTV.

958
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:01,246
Since I was fine this morning,
it had to be an acute condition.

959
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:03,790
Also, if it was anything serious,
the stock prices would plummet,

960
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,875
so it had to be minor and stress-related.

961
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,836
That's why I picked
a common stomach condition.

962
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,630
Not again.

963
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:14,217
Forget it if you can't come. Bye.

964
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,596
Gosh.

965
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:23,017
Isn't she the one who was angry
that I was bossing her around?

966
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,896
Does she expect me
to ask around at the hospital

967
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,898
and get her jokbaengi
when she tells me to?

968
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,900
Does she think I'm her personal assistant?

969
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,664
Jokbaengi…

970
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:47,875
Jokbaengi…

971
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,044
Jokbaengi!

972
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,426
How did you get in?
I told them not to let anyone in.

973
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:59,220
Do you know how much I donate
to this foundation every year?

974
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:00,722
I have my ways.

975
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,016
Here.

976
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,184
Flowers are not food.

977
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,604
Didn't you bring any food?

978
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,648
Do you want everyone to find out
you're faking your condition?

979
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,859
The flowers are to hide the smell.

980
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,652
Good thinking.

981
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,779
You're so meticulous.

982
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:19,198
-I'll be going now.
-Hold on.

983
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,200
Are you leaving?

984
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,619
What now? I brought you food.

985
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:26,080
I hate hospitals.

986
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,765
I can eat in just about any situation.

987
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:45,850
Aren't you impressed
by my mental strength?

988
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:48,144
I think it's your stomach that's strong.

989
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,648
Anyway, even though I sincerely appreciate

990
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:52,982
the sushi you brought,

991
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:58,237
being in the hospital makes me crave
some super soft jokbal,

992
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,865
sweet and spicy golbaengi,

993
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:04,243
and a refreshing shot of soju.

994
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:07,163
-Didn't you just have them in your dream?
-How did you know?

995
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:10,500
If anyone hears you talk in your sleep,
they'll find out you're not Kang Mi-na.

996
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:13,294
I can't possibly pretend
to be Kang Mi-na in my sleep too.

997
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:17,048
Was she graceful even in her sleep?

998
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:19,258
Well…

999
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,011
What? Why are you suddenly being shy?

1000
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:26,391
So what was she like?

1001
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:33,356
Shouldn't you be more curious
about who you are?

1002
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:37,402
I'm not sure what Mi-na was like

1003
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:39,946
anymore.

1004
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:41,823
Sometimes,

1005
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:46,202
I even think you feel
more like Mi-na than herself.

1006
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,209
That means,
even though I'm doing a good job,

1007
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:55,336
I'm not really her.

1008
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,880
To compliment something fake,

1009
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,465
you say it feels real.

1010
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,885
A doll that looks like a real person.
A painting that looks like a photo.

1011
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,971
A dream that feels like reality.

1012
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:07,515
And you say I feel like Kang Mi-na.

1013
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:15,690
-What do you do when you're by yourself?
-Why?

1014
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:17,984
Judging from the way you talk and behave,

1015
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:20,069
you must've been pretty extraordinary.

1016
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:23,114
And the things you do
when you're by yourself

1017
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:25,324
often reveal who you really are.

1018
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:29,203
Why do you want to know
who I am all of a sudden?

1019
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:32,665
I'm curious where you'll be going back to.

1020
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,042
I'm also worried

1021
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:39,255
if you were involved
with dangerous people.

1022
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:40,715
Are you worried

1023
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,217
I might be someone dangerous?

1024
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:46,220
I'm worried you'll be in danger.

1025
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:52,143
I'm searching the whole world

1026
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:54,187
using all the resources I have.

1027
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:55,813
You'll be going back soon.

1028
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:03,362
By the way, why do you hate hospitals?

1029
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:10,119
If it's not something serious,
I'm wondering if you could

1030
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:11,829
drop off food while I'm here.

1031
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:12,914
Why should I?

1032
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:17,585
I'll be stuck here for the next few days,
and Mr. No can't visit me.

1033
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,755
Do you hate hospitals so much?

1034
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:22,215
Being in a hospital

1035
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:24,842
brings back bad memories.

1036
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:27,345
It's all in the past though.

1037
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:32,350
It's not in the past
if you still hate to be reminded of it.

1038
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,937
Fine. If all else fails,

1039
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,231
I'll go down to the emergency room
wearing a mask

1040
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:39,857
and make do with some instant coffee.

1041
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:42,068
You know what?

1042
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:45,613
The warmest place in a hospital at night
is in front of the emergency room.

1043
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:47,114
And they have instant coffee there.

1044
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:52,245
It's crowded with people there
around the clock.

1045
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,837
I call this "Magic Powder."

1046
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,798
Have some when you feel down.
It'll cheer you up.

1047
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,927
Just what I need right now.

1048
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:14,475
I could only find two.

1049
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,894
They have more in the emergency room.

1050
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:21,315
You know what?

1051
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:25,069
The warmest place in a hospital at night
is in front of the emergency room.

1052
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,573
It's crowded with people there
around the clock.

1053
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,734
EPILOGUE

1054
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:24,003
HAN KANG-SIK

1055
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,356
CHOI SEUNG-OK

1056
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:47,318
To think that she's alone
even on a day like this.

1057
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:49,320
I feel so sorry for her
that I want to cry.

1058
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,824
Is she really not coming today?

1059
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:58,996
Her son is in prison.

1060
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:01,624
And her granddaughter isn't showing up

1061
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,417
on the anniversary of her death.

1062
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:13,052
This apartment is vacant.

1063
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:16,347
Did someone book
flower delivery in advance?

1064
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,641
I wonder if anyone will pick it up.

1065
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,482
After being so mean to me all these years,

1066
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:28,567
aren't you afraid to send me
to the prosecution?

1067
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,736
Don't you think something is off

1068
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,862
about Chairman Kang?

1069
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,990
A woman I had never met before

1070
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:36,575
looked frail but very strong
at the same time.

1071
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:40,246
When a prosecutor goes missing,
it's often a bad sign.

1072
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:43,833
Didn't I have any family members
who would look for me when I go missing?

1073
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:46,377
I have that much information.
What I need is evidence.

1074
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:49,755
Can you tell me the location
of the car Chairman Kang is driving?

1075
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:50,840
Shall we give you a chance?
