1
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,222
Gosh, I'm so hung over.

2
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,895
I should never go too long

3
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,730
without drinking again.

4
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,150
I hadn't drunk in a while.

5
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,651
That's why I'm hung over.

6
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,552
Did I sleep here last night?

7
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,682
Darn it. The entire family
must be making a huge fuss right now.

8
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,945
I've lost my mind.

9
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,323
What happened next?

10
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,952
I have a feeling
something important happened.

11
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,456
Did I call someone I shouldn't?

12
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,375
My goodness.

13
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,293
Where's my phone?

14
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,970
You crazy little…

15
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,054
MOTHER-IN-LAW

16
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,057
What did I say to this woman?

17
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,811
Do you know who I really am?

18
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,480
I'm not Kang Mi-na.

19
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,398
I am

20
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,903
Cho…

21
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,365
And then? What came next?

22
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,868
What did I say?

23
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,495
Oh, my gosh.

24
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,625
-What?
-Where are you?

25
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,003
How much did you drink last night?

26
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,713
What did you say to Mom

27
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,631
that she won't leave her room?

28
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,926
Did anything else happen?

29
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,637
What else? Things only happen to you.

30
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,765
I know things are a mess
because of the list yesterday,

31
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,726
but how could you stay out all night?

32
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:05,643
List?

33
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,942
The police have not given a statement

34
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,819
regarding the memo left by Lee Bong-sik

35
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,156
who died while being investigated.

36
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,658
The prosecutor stated
that there were no signs

37
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:24,245
of police brutality
or violations of human rights.

38
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,747
Was it suicide or murder?

39
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,915
-Who's the prosecutor on the case?
-Who is it?

40
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,250
Did Hanju Group
give you separate instructions?

41
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,044
CHIEF PROSECUTOR RYU SEUNG-DUK

42
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,045
-Excuse me.
-Step aside.

43
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,090
I can't get kicked out of the family
until I uncover the link

44
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,592
between the chief prosecutor and Hanju.

45
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,471
What did I say when I was drunk?

46
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,350
Yes. Let's go to work first.

47
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,018
It's okay.

48
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,187
I'm used to not remembering things.

49
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,981
I can handle it.

50
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,919
-Last night…
-Wait.

51
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,547
I don't remember
what happened last night, so…

52
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,007
You don't…

53
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,260
remember?

54
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,429
No. I'm not playing dumb like some coward.

55
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,140
I remember up to that part.

56
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,350
But afterward…

57
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,018
What's "that?"

58
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,270
"That?"

59
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,063
That's…

60
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,315
So…

61
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,110
Do you remember
being sprawled on the floor?

62
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,616
Yes, I do. I remember.

63
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,702
And that you got into your place
thanks to me?

64
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:50,415
Guess my door code

65
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,167
That's right. So…

66
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,420
Whose daughter you are, whom you resemble,

67
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,464
who likes you…

68
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,508
None of that matters to me.

69
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,845
I'm going to go for what I want
and do what I want to do.

70
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,179
I won't let anyone take from me again.

71
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,683
I was grateful. So I…

72
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,983
-Ki…
-Yes, that.

73
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,819
I remember up to that part,
but that's all.

74
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:23,156
It's all spotty after that. Well…

75
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,451
I see.

76
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,205
Goodness. Are you all right?

77
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,916
Why did you drink so much?

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,293
And why did you call?

79
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,004
Did I call you too?

80
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,172
What did I say?

81
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,424
You'll regret it if you hear it.
Should I tell you?

82
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,384
No. Don't.

83
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,803
Darn it.

84
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,726
Maybe Lee Bong-sik's death shook her.

85
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:52,977
What's wrong with her?

86
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,701
Why did he look like that
when I said my memory ended there?

87
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,579
Why do I feel like

88
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,373
something very important happened?

89
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,542
Hey!

90
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,670
You said all sorts of garbage last night.

91
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:20,963
Why are you silent today?

92
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,675
Did I call you too?

93
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,593
What did I say?

94
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,886
You cursed me out.

95
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,097
Is that all?

96
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,724
What do you mean, is that all?
You cursed at your chief.

97
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,851
I'm letting it slide

98
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,604
since I know how you felt.

99
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,605
Get it together.

100
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,734
Summon Kang Mi-na and investigate.

101
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,112
What about Lee Bong-sik's case?

102
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,364
That again?

103
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:47,907
I said to bury it.

104
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,953
Will you give up your career
to investigate just that one case?

105
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,789
-Don't you want to be promoted?
-Is my promotion the only thing

106
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,499
you can threaten me with?

107
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,792
No, I don't want to.

108
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,087
Lee Bong-sik didn't kill himself.
I'll catch his killer.

109
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:02,922
Hey!

110
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:11,389
Don't give up. Why are you so extreme?
Don't give up on your promotion.

111
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,224
Do you want to get transferred

112
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:16,102
somewhere deep in the boonies
after searching for his killer?

113
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,854
You have such a bright future
ahead of you.

114
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,731
Just do as I say, will you?

115
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,943
Listen.

116
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,989
We'll close Lee Bong-sik's matter
with Kang Mi-na

117
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,699
and we'll call it even. Okay?

118
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,539
I'll give you three days.

119
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:40,042
I'll take you off all of your other cases,

120
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,294
so summon Kang Mi-na

121
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,671
within three days.

122
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,391
The boonies?

123
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,976
Fine. I'll go.

124
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,645
I'll resolve the disputes between grandpas

125
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,315
and catch people from savings clubs
that take off with the money.

126
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,358
Living like that wouldn't be so…

127
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,485
good.

128
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:09,030
I'll never see
the inside of the Central District again.

129
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,578
You are so unpredictable
but very predictable.

130
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,915
You always sober up with milk
after getting wasted.

131
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,792
Yu-jun, most women

132
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,504
who reject a guy three times in a row

133
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,881
feel bad and treat him nicely

134
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,675
or keep a distance from him, right?

135
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,719
But not me.

136
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,971
We'll stay like this
for the rest of our lives.

137
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,308
We'll be the Green Dragon and White Tiger
of Prosecution Services.

138
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,226
Yes.

139
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,981
Don't get me wrong. I'm not here for you.

140
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,775
I'm here because
your chief called me here.

141
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,401
Why?

142
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,489
We're going to dig into
Kang Mi-na for real now.

143
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,698
Don't act out.

144
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,451
Just follow my lead, okay?

145
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,079
Did you bring what you got
when you investigated her?

146
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,247
Yes.

147
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,957
CHIEF RYU SEUNG-DUK

148
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,004
HYEBYUL GALLERY HOLDS
VOLUNTEER EVENT FOR ANIMAL SHELTER

149
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,799
Which one's Kang Mi-na?

150
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,592
The one wearing sunglasses.

151
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,136
They're all wearing sunglasses.

152
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,055
The tall woman.

153
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,937
She's a head taller than the rest.

154
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,648
"September 17, 2019."

155
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,067
"She did volunteer work
for an animal shelter

156
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,694
suspected of embezzling funds."

157
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,246
What's this? Is this everything?

158
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,582
-Yes.
-Yes?

159
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,667
Are you messing with me?

160
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,712
You barged into the office

161
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,839
of Yumin's chairman with a drug tip.

162
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,718
But you come in here
with one sheet of paper?

163
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,305
Your senior is trying so hard
to teach you how to fish,

164
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,015
but this is all you can do?

165
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,225
I don't like fish very much.

166
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,648
Get out.

167
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,066
Yes, sir.

168
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,531
You punk.

169
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,326
I saw you have cod stew at lunch before.

170
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:24,081
He's going crazy
because he's working with Hanju.

171
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,793
I'm sure they're the reason
Lee Bong-sik died.

172
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,755
What will you do?
Will you really summon Kang Mi-na?

173
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,633
What is there to do? It's a fake list.

174
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,217
How can you prove it?

175
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,137
Do you know why
I haven't been found out yet?

176
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,973
Because the real Kang Mi-na
hasn't shown up.

177
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,808
No matter how well a fake does,

178
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,354
it'll be obvious she's a fake
once the real one shows up.

179
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,273
I have to find the real one.

180
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,108
Lee Bong-sik's original list.

181
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,693
Do you think it's out there?

182
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,528
I'm sure it is.

183
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:58,282
That was why Chief was so afraid of him.

184
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,200
And…

185
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,452
Either find me a boat to stow away

186
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,204
or put money into a Swiss account.

187
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,497
I need to see evidence

188
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,500
to decide whether or not
I give you what you ask for.

189
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,671
He said he'd give it to me.

190
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,217
I'm sure he's connected to someone.

191
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,177
Where do I start digging first?

192
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,223
Remember how you asked if Samgeori Gang
got Kang Mi-na out of the country too?

193
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,725
-Yes.
-I don't think it was them.

194
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,769
Lee Bong-sik acted alone.

195
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,814
I think maybe Samgeori Gang was involved

196
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,607
with people he was trying to hide.

197
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,026
They gave me the tip
about Kang Mi-na and the drugs.

198
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:39,240
Are you saying Hanju
is working with Samgeori Gang?

199
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,920
Lee Bong-sik, that jerk.

200
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,923
That's what you get for acting arrogant.

201
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,759
Serves you right.

202
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:05,975
Hello, sir.

203
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,935
The thing with the list

204
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,812
happened rather too dramatically.

205
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,939
My point exactly. What happened?

206
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,817
Pulling the trigger like this
without giving me a heads-up

207
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,652
will only put me in a difficult position.

208
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,696
What are you talking about?

209
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,658
You see, I had no idea.

210
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,745
People are saying the prosecution
is deliberately withholding

211
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,040
Lee Bong-sik's list and that
some of the prosecutors were in on it too.

212
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,792
All these misunderstandings

213
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,419
are giving me such a headache.

214
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,005
What's with this attitude?

215
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:38,591
Pardon me?

216
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,469
I simply pointed out
that there was something wrong

217
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,679
with Lee Bong-sik's list. That's all.

218
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:44,847
What are you talking about?

219
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,353
My apologies.

220
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,190
It seems like I was misinformed.

221
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,233
No wonder your intention
is being misunderstood.

222
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,570
Why did you have to withhold the list
and complicate everything?

223
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,654
I'm hanging up.

224
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,491
How dare he try to blame me?

225
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,454
Goodness, look at him drawing the line.

226
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,874
Whose fault is it
that I'm in this mess now?

227
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,459
CHIEF RYU SEUNG-DUK

228
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,215
What did I tell you?

229
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,091
I told you the chief prosecutor

230
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,636
would act like he had something on us
if we weren't careful.

231
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,346
Dad.

232
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,558
Why are you saying this to me?

233
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,144
It is your own fault
that we're in this mess.

234
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,481
Back then and now.

235
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,198
You must stay strong.

236
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,325
It's your own fault.

237
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,868
All of this happened because of you.

238
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:56,669
BOARD MEETING
MERGER OF HANJU FASHION AND HOTEL

239
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,593
Is this a military operation or something?

240
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,554
Why call a board meeting in the wee hours?

241
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,305
I apologize

242
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,975
on behalf of Chairman Han

243
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,477
for causing the accounting
and embezzlement scandal

244
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,187
right before the merger.

245
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,774
However, we should
no longer let my brother's mistakes

246
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,736
affect the company's reputation

247
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,114
and stock price for everyone's sake.

248
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,615
Therefore,

249
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,619
we should put it all behind us now.

250
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,874
I'll now take responsibility
for everything

251
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,500
that is related to Chairman Han.

252
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,129
To save time,
we'll decide by a show of hands

253
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,089
instead of a secret ballot,

254
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,258
so please raise your hand
if you agree to the merger.

255
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,896
Chairman Han Kang-sik of Hanju Hotel

256
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,522
passed away due to the fire

257
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,400
that broke out at Hanju Fashion's factory
in Seopyung last night.

258
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,652
Hanju Fashion and Hanju Hotel held

259
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,031
an emergency board meeting this morning
and decided to merge the two companies.

260
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,618
Han Sung-hye has been appointed
the new CEO of Hanju Hotel.

261
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,162
It is said that she was a key member

262
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,955
of Hanju Fashion's management team,

263
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,833
so a change in the company's
management structure will be inevitable.

264
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,086
This reminds me of that day 14 years ago.

265
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,133
That agreement was made in secret,
just like what's happening now.

266
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,512
You'll find a way
to get out of the reinspection.

267
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,141
You'll collude with the accounting firm
to get the upper hand on the shares

268
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,601
and push through with the merger.

269
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,188
Do you know what really
reminds me of that time?

270
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,774
The fact that the owner
has something to hide.

271
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,612
What is Mi-na up to?
She didn't come home last night.

272
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,489
Why are you asking me?

273
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,533
I think I can ask you this question
because you ran out the door

274
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,202
as soon as you saw the news about her.

275
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,624
There are rampant rumors
about her name being on the list.

276
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,795
And as you know,
the hotel business is all about image.

277
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,465
So ideally,
we wouldn't want the focus to be on Yumin.

278
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,971
How about we change the name
to Hanju after the merger?

279
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,224
And it'd be best
if I could take over the CEO position.

280
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,727
Since this already happened,

281
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,480
we'll downsize and merge with Yumin.

282
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,481
Let's make sure this is a win-win deal.

283
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,694
What if I say no to any of the conditions?

284
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,571
I'm not asking for your consent.

285
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,616
I'm just relaying a message.

286
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,203
So if you decline this offer,

287
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,580
things will get even worse

288
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,332
for Chairman Kang Mi-na.

289
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,007
All right. Are we done now?

290
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,384
How about we grab a bite to eat?

291
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,637
I have to meet someone.

292
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,315
The talk with Yumin went well.

293
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,278
Let's take this as an opportunity
to fire the employees

294
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,780
higher up the pay scale
and those who are disobedient.

295
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,824
Let's get rid of them all.

296
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,838
What did they say?

297
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,382
What do you think? They told me
to bring Kang Mi-na at once.

298
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,634
But you know,

299
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,845
Kang Mi-na and I are not related at all,

300
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,805
but we look identical.

301
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,182
Doesn't that mean

302
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,476
there could be someone else
that looks like us?

303
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,395
Can't we find another look-alike?

304
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,484
Stop talking nonsense.

305
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,820
Right, I shouldn't talk to you.

306
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,865
If you want to vent, go talk to Mr. Han.

307
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,202
No, I can't vent to him.

308
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:08,295
I used to tell you these things,

309
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,507
but I can't do that anymore.

310
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:17,638
Gosh, I must've looked so stupid.

311
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,139
Darn it.

312
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,393
Don't do it if you don't want to.
What's with all the fuss?

313
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,166
That car is owned by Hanju Group?

314
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,334
Are you sure?

315
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,796
Okay.

316
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,298
CHIEF RYU SEUNG-DUK

317
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,137
HYEBYUL GALLERY HOLDS
VOLUNTEER EVENT FOR ANIMAL SHELTER

318
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,682
What do Cho Yeon-ju
and that punk who doesn't like fish

319
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,101
have to do with Hanju?

320
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,646
VOLUNTEERS

321
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,360
That's right.

322
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,075
I hope you like the food.

323
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,995
Everyone who has to cook three meals a day

324
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,289
loves to dine out.

325
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,250
I love eating out, regardless of the menu.

326
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,671
I wanted to say hello to you
in person last time.

327
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,966
I'm sorry for leaving like that.

328
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,551
Don't be sorry.

329
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,846
You probably never wanted to
set foot in that house again.

330
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,557
I couldn't even eat

331
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,517
the cockles that you sent me

332
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,227
because they reminded me of my father.

333
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,105
I sent them to you
so you'd think of your father.

334
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,693
You should go back to the US.

335
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,281
You know, 14 years ago…

336
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,286
Your father and I were very close.

337
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,539
Yes, I'm aware.

338
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:11,126
But I was also
close to Chairman Han Young-sik.

339
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,130
The two of them didn't know though.

340
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,132
You know, there are people

341
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,552
who can switch sides back and forth

342
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,971
without revealing their cards
and monitor the situation.

343
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:27,726
You mean, you're neutral like Switzerland?

344
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,394
No, like a double agent.

345
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,028
Back then, I thought I had no choice

346
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,239
if I wanted to
keep working for the family.

347
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,035
But I've been feeling guilty

348
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,204
ever since we lost your father like that.

349
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,457
Maybe that happened

350
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,002
because of some things
that I had said or done.

351
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,090
Since then,

352
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,717
I have never taken anyone's side.

353
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,186
I'm sure it wasn't entirely your fault,

354
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,524
so please don't beat yourself up.

355
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,154
I'm giving you the advice
someone else gave me.

356
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,156
Thank you.

357
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,411
But Chairman Han seems to think

358
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,706
that I'm still okay being his spy.

359
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,209
He asked me to meet with you.

360
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:40,007
He is capable of ditching Sung-hye

361
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,592
and joining hands with you.

362
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:47,014
I think he wants to know how you'd feel

363
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,058
if the merger conditions
were in your favor.

364
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,561
-I'm…
-No.

365
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,398
Don't tell me anything.

366
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,900
I'll have to relay it if you do.

367
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,115
I'll tell him you didn't say anything.

368
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,999
This is good.

369
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,877
Michelin isn't an absolute standard,

370
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,546
but I guess it could give you some hints.

371
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:40,567
That's right. If they found out who I am,

372
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,986
Mi-na's mother-in-law
wouldn't have just sat back.

373
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,738
Since she's been quiet,

374
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,698
I'll assume I didn't get caught.

375
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:52,037
Wait a second. What if she's waiting
to catch me off guard?

376
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,123
What if I find a swarm of police officers
in the living room?

377
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:01,254
Then again, she doesn't come across
as such a meticulous person.

378
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,284
I drink too much last night

379
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,494
and made a mistake.

380
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,915
So did you sleep in the apartment
near the Prosecutors' Office?

381
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:38,834
What?

382
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,756
Why are you so surprised?

383
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,175
People are saying
you'll be summoned again soon.

384
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,386
Since you're being summoned so often,

385
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,888
I assumed you'd found a place
in that neighborhood.

386
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,559
Shouldn't you start looking for one?

387
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,241
Hello, Mother. It's me.

388
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,451
How could you do this to me?

389
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:17,789
When you told me
to prepare breakfast at 5 a.m.,

390
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,292
I knew how mean all of you were.

391
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,503
But do you have to
make me suffer this much?

392
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,631
You must be losing your mind
because of that list.

393
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,758
Serves you right.

394
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,556
Do you find this amusing, woman?

395
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,682
Do you?

396
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,520
Let's see how much longer
you can enjoy this, woman.

397
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,731
I'll tell everyone!

398
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,609
I'll reveal your dirt to the whole world.

399
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,611
I know everything!

400
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,282
What? You called me "woman?"

401
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:53,992
You must be out of your mind.

402
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,038
Do you know who I really am?

403
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,916
I'm not Kang Mi-na.

404
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,585
I'm Cho…

405
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,129
Cho…

406
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,131
Cho…

407
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,217
What are you doing?

408
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,095
I'm the queen of Joseon!

409
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,432
I'm the queen of Joseon!

410
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:19,643
You've completely lost your mind.

411
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:23,480
How dare you call me
and throw a drunken tantrum?

412
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:28,193
Darn it. The call got cut off.

413
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,403
Why wouldn't you let me talk?

414
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,119
I have a feeling something more happened.

415
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,622
What are you mumbling?

416
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,169
Hey, you said
you had something on me last night.

417
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,254
What is it?

418
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,631
I don't want to remember it.

419
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,467
No. I still have to.

420
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,011
But I don't want to.

421
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,015
Gosh, what do I do?

422
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,560
Hey! I'm talking to you!

423
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,313
What did she find on me now?

424
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,275
I have no idea what it could be.

425
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:21,997
FRESH MILK

426
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,966
Even today,

427
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,927
there are people who decide
whom their grandchildren should marry.

428
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,346
Isn't that funny?

429
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:42,058
As you probably know, I'm still mourning,

430
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,893
so I felt uncomfortable coming here.

431
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,439
My family must have
pushed you into doing this.

432
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,150
No. If my grandpa

433
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:53,403
hadn't shown me your picture,
that would have been the case.

434
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:55,905
But when I saw your picture,

435
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,200
I wanted to meet you.

436
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,542
Are you okay now?

437
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,339
-Sorry?
-On the day my father passed away,

438
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:17,052
I heard that something unfortunate
happened to you at the hospital.

439
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:23,808
Instead of being so useless all your life
and successfully taking your life one day,

440
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:28,188
why don't you
do our family some good for once?

441
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,982
The old man at Hanju Group seems to

442
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,859
want to marry his grandson off to you

443
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,736
to expand his business.

444
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,197
In terms of risk management,

445
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,907
it's quite a tempting offer.

446
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,160
I wouldn't mind
getting you out of my sight,

447
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:45,830
and you'd be more than happy
to leave my house, wouldn't you?

448
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,502
I don't want to talk about that.

449
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,631
I'm trying to forget
what happened that day.

450
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,718
I see.

451
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,488
Like you said,
when I look through a telescope,

452
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,657
I realize how vast the universe is,

453
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,659
and it makes me think

454
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,369
my problems are trivial.

455
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,122
I thought you'd like it.

456
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:28,790
Me?

457
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,000
Did I say that?

458
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,087
How do you use this?

459
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,094
Well…

460
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,220
Try looking into this.

461
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,566
Say no to restructuring!

462
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,484
Say no to restructuring!

463
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,696
Hanju Group, cancel the merger!

464
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,906
Cancel the merger!

465
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,994
Keep the existing staff!

466
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,329
Keep the existing staff!

467
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,249
Say no to restructuring!

468
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,043
Hanju Group, cancel the merger!

469
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,421
Cancel the merger!

470
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,465
Keep the existing staff!

471
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:23,303
Keep the existing staff!

472
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,387
Keep the existing staff!

473
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:28,808
-Keep the existing staff!
-Keep the staff!

474
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,356
Ma'am.

475
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,193
-What is she doing?
-What's going on?

476
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,569
Goodness.

477
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,112
Members of the Hanju Hotel community.

478
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,282
Many of you here

479
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,702
must remember me from 20 years ago.

480
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,622
Every school break,

481
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,373
I would return to Korea

482
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,542
and wash the dishes in the hotel kitchen

483
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,463
and help out at every event
held by the hotel.

484
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,803
I can see that many of you were there
when I did the dishes in the kitchen.

485
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:08,306
Why would I not want to
keep working with you?

486
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,976
But as you know,

487
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,938
Hanju Hotel is being
acquired by Yumin Hotel.

488
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:19,317
They insisted on
performing due diligence again

489
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,027
and are now demanding

490
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,363
a large-scale restructuring.

491
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,699
I really feel terrible about it.

492
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,578
I don't know what to say to you.

493
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,247
Are you saying

494
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,041
Yumin Hotel is forcing you
to go through restructuring?

495
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,960
It's humiliating to admit,

496
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,753
but that's right.

497
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,757
Yumin Group's Chairman Kang

498
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,844
is giving orders without even showing up.

499
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,722
What could I possibly do?

500
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,767
Isn't that just an excuse?
You're related to Chairman Kang.

501
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,186
Apparently,

502
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,314
Chairman Kang thinks differently.

503
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,568
I'm really sorry.

504
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:06,114
I mean… You didn't have to kneel.

505
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,825
This isn't going to change anything.

506
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,578
-I agree!
-Shouldn't we go to Yumin Group?

507
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,745
What do you say?

508
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,080
This isn't going to work.

509
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,124
-Let's go to Yumin Hotel instead!
-Let's!

510
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,793
-Let's go!
-Let's hurry.

511
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,295
Put that banner away right now!

512
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,796
Put that away!

513
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,173
Hey, hurry up and…

514
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,677
-Cancel the restructuring!
-Cancel!

515
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,679
Give up the merger!

516
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,265
What's going on?

517
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,852
WHERE IS CHAIRMAN KANG MI-NA?

518
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,396
Why are they looking for Kang Mi-na?

519
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:41,524
Don't look so guilty.

520
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,443
They're asking her

521
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,029
to sit at the negotiation table.

522
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,655
That's a relief.

523
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,950
But why Kang Mi-na?

524
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,076
What do they want?

525
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,536
I'm not sure.

526
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,289
Leave us alone!

527
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,333
They're not even Yumin Hotel employees.

528
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,920
There might be reporters.

529
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:05,381
You don't want to be photographed.

530
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,799
Let's keep driving.

531
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:10,428
They wouldn't stop me
from going in, would they?

532
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,180
You couldn't go to work yesterday.

533
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,641
It'll be bad
if you can't go in today either.

534
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,851
What a dilemma.

535
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,313
Then I'll cover myself up a little
so that they won't know I'm Kang Mi-na.

536
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,482
Okay.

537
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,735
-What do you think?
-You need to cover your face.

538
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,654
What about this? Here.

539
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:29,739
Good. That works.

540
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:30,990
-Okay.
-Okay.

541
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,956
Cancel the merger!

542
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,999
Cancel the merger!

543
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,459
Cancel the acquisition

544
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,628
that kills laborers!

545
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,588
Cancel the acquisition!

546
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:49,509
Yumin should stay away from Hanju Hotel--

547
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:51,511
It's Kang Mi-na!

548
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,720
How did he know?

549
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,890
-What should we do?
-Stop right there.

550
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,642
I didn't want to do this,

551
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,521
but there are two foolproof methods
for getting out of a sticky situation.

552
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,606
Money or a loud voice.

553
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,442
-Will you use money?
-No, my voice.

554
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,823
Fire!

555
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,163
Mr. No! Run!

556
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,899
Darn it.

557
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,194
Chairman Kang.
Why are you running away like a coward?

558
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,530
Why are you avoiding us?

559
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,449
I'm not hiding on purpose!

560
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,908
I have my reasons.

561
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,076
So do we!

562
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,870
That's not it! No…

563
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,164
I have so much to say.

564
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,052
Gosh.

565
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,558
Darn it.

566
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:33,112
If you're done washing up,
let's go to the Prosecutors' Office.

567
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,822
Looks like you can't make it
to work today either.

568
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,909
Why were Hanju's workers
throwing eggs at me?

569
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,952
Did Hanju send them?

570
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,538
Darn it. It's not like
I can press charges for this.

571
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,998
However…

572
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,543
However what?

573
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,047
They did press charges.

574
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,673
Who did?

575
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,220
What? He's still at the police station?

576
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,139
Send him to the prosecutor
right this instant!

577
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,476
Darn it. That insolent twerp.

578
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:07,688
How dare he throw an egg at my wife?

579
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:11,609
I'll make sure he rots in prison
for the rest of his life

580
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,570
and wishes he were never born!

581
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:19,367
Why did that jerk suddenly switch sides?

582
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,869
He's utterly useless.

583
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:23,871
Assault cases

584
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,414
are investigated by the police,

585
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,625
so it'll take time
for them to reach a prosecutor.

586
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,130
Hello?

587
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,965
You need to hurry in.

588
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,134
-Why?
-The guy who threw eggs

589
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,970
at Chairman Kang was arrested for assault.

590
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,972
Her husband is pushing hard,

591
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,307
so Deputy Chief wants it resolved
by the end of the day.

592
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,227
You're the only prosecutor
who has room on her docket.

593
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,024
Darn it.

594
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,159
The thing is

595
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,537
it'll be bad for us too if she gets hurt.

596
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,707
The most devoted husband in the world
is sitting right here.

597
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,876
It was just a few raw eggs.

598
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,920
You've aligned yourself
with the wrong person.

599
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,173
I don't think it's about
aligning with her.

600
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,259
-What do you mean?
-Think about it.

601
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:21,095
You practically covered her
in eggs before,

602
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,388
and he didn't bat an eye.

603
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,266
Do you like her for real?

604
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,769
What? No way. That's ridiculous.

605
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,522
I don't like her.

606
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,940
Not at all.

607
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,777
Look at him making a fuss.

608
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,863
They may have a baby soon.

609
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,742
You have to consider Mi-na's age.

610
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,994
And I don't think she wants to.

611
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,913
You already have a grandson.

612
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,831
You have Sun-woo.

613
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,458
Her age?

614
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,960
Hey. The hospital director
ran a bunch of useless tests

615
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,547
when they took her blood
after the accident,

616
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,966
and he said her ovaries were
way too healthy.

617
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,760
Really?

618
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,471
I was sure…

619
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,810
I'm sterile.

620
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:15,399
-What?
-So you don't have to worry.

621
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,110
He won't have any children

622
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,071
as long as he's with me.

623
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:24,367
What?

624
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,036
Nothing.

625
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,751
Where did you get the guts
to attack a chairman?

626
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,086
UNIFIED PROTEST

627
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,587
You figured conglomerate owners

628
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,090
would have common sense too
since they're still human like us

629
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,716
even if the world stinks, right?

630
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,093
But conglomerate chairmen

631
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,595
supersede common sense and can send you

632
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,515
to the Central District
Prosecutors' Office in half a day.

633
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,599
Like this.

634
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,936
You hit her square on.
Your curveball was so…

635
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,981
It's tough to grip an egg.

636
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:58,109
But you smacked her on the forehead.

637
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,777
Did you play baseball before?

638
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,028
Yes, in high school.

639
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,154
Listen!

640
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,032
This is criminal assault.

641
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,909
As per Section 260 of the Penal Code,

642
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:10,079
assaulting a person can get you
up to two years in prison

643
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,123
or up to five million won in fines.

644
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,083
How could throwing an egg

645
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,793
cost me five million won?

646
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,296
Why you… Have you been hit by an egg?

647
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,506
It was degrading and humiliating.

648
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,550
What?

649
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,636
Of course, I've never been hit either.

650
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,181
But a person should be able to
empathize that much.

651
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,476
Assault is one of those crimes

652
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,438
that cannot be punished
unless the victim wants it.

653
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,440
If you apologize to Chairman Kang here,

654
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,234
I'll relay the message to her
and put an end to this.

655
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,820
-I refuse.
-Why?

656
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,822
I can't apologize to someone like her.

657
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,324
What did she do?

658
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:49,493
She didn't even know that you were fired.

659
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,662
It wasn't even your company.

660
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,081
Why did you come
all the way to Yumin to throw eggs?

661
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,125
Did someone send you?

662
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,044
Yumin was the one ordering people around.

663
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,921
I hear they ordered the reorganization.

664
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,840
What? Says who?

665
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:05,343
Our senior managing director,
Ms. Han Sung-hye.

666
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,178
Oh, my gosh. You actually believe her?

667
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,597
She even got on her knees and apologized

668
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,932
for being unable to take all of us.

669
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,643
She values and loves
all of the employees so much.

670
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,270
Why wouldn't I believe her?

671
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,897
Oh, my gosh. What's the big deal

672
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,273
about getting on her knees?

673
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,234
I was kneeling
in front of the toilet yesterday too

674
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,278
because I was hung over.

675
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,822
Do I value and love my toilet?

676
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,657
What kind of…

677
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,160
Anyway, I'm too bitter to apologize.

678
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,871
She partied all her life
and luckily became the owner.

679
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,456
If she tells us to leave,

680
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,209
are we supposed to just obey and leave?

681
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:42,463
I wouldn't do this
if my daughter were healthy.

682
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,883
She has to get dialysis twice a week.

683
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,177
If I get fired,

684
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,887
we'll lose our health insurance.

685
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,138
That's why I saw red.

686
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,016
To be blunt, aren't the police

687
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,268
and prosecutors supposed to
help people like us?

688
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:01,857
How could you come down so hard on us?
You're so mean.

689
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,605
What is it?

690
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,024
When did I come down hard on you?

691
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,445
If anything, I'd sucker punch a bad guy.

692
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,280
Darn it.

693
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,370
Ms. Cho!

694
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,458
Darn it.

695
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,710
Did you know that there will be
a reorganization

696
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,587
prior to the merger with Hanju Hotel?

697
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,755
Yes, I heard.

698
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,675
If they want to fire employees,
they should start with the owner

699
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,552
and those with decision-making authority.

700
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:15,181
Why only fire dutiful workers?
Is this how the merger will be done?

701
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,974
It's not that simple.

702
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,643
My father used to run Hanju Hotel.

703
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,146
Pushing the merger through

704
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:25,191
and fixing the management issues
could be more important now--

705
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,318
I didn't want to overstep my boundaries

706
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,987
and put my two cents in
about how another company should be run,

707
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,238
but this is just wrong.

708
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,241
You don't care what happens
to the employees

709
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,951
as long as you get the hotel back?

710
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,746
Prosecutors may prioritize
what they think is "right,"

711
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:39,955
but this is a business.

712
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:43,834
Keeping the company afloat at all costs
might be better for Yumin employees.

713
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,629
You're no different from the Hanju family.

714
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:52,134
Don't tell me you're in this
just to get Hanju Hotel back.

715
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,471
You're just like Han Sung-hye,
who fires everyone

716
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,765
after kneeling
in front of the union members?

717
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,226
It's hard for us to say no
or make specific requests.

718
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,102
What if Hanju colludes
with the prosecution

719
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,604
to get Kang Mi-na arrested?

720
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,855
Right.

721
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,024
I'm in no position to make such requests.

722
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,318
Once again, I forgot my place.

723
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,778
Sorry for taking up your time.

724
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,473
You said people threw eggs at Ms. Cho.
Is she all right?

725
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,851
Didn't you say
you were stepping out to see her?

726
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,689
Must you two talk over me
even after meeting up?

727
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,400
She never tells me when she's not okay.

728
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,485
Well, she's in deep trouble now.

729
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,779
Getting hit by a few eggs isn't the issue.

730
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:57,157
The Central District Office
is telling her to bring Kang Mi-na.

731
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:00,202
If she refuses,
they'll transfer her to the boonies.

732
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,538
And now Lee Bong-sik is dead,

733
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:05,291
so there's no one to prove
that the list is fake.

734
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,669
And she can't even
tell you these things anymore.

735
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,045
Isn't it so strange?

736
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,007
I know that it's not her,

737
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:17,011
but I keep feeling the same way I felt
when I used to look at her.

738
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,598
You like someone else now.
Why does it have to be so complicated?

739
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,226
I told you to cut ties for your sake,

740
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,353
but this is awfully inconvenient for me.

741
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,940
Just follow your heart.

742
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:35,029
Follow my heart? Can I really do that?

743
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,406
You're so old-fashioned for someone

744
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:38,866
who lived in the US for years.

745
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:43,787
Listen. Even automatic doors remain closed

746
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,498
until someone stands in front of them.

747
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,709
And the compass needle doesn't move

748
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,502
until you start moving around.

749
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,796
You need to make a move

750
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,465
for you to get anywhere.

751
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,551
What do you want to do?

752
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,892
CHAIRMAN HAN YOUNG-SIK

753
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:10,314
You stormed out
as if you'd never see me again.

754
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,191
What brought you here today?

755
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:16,862
Someone told me you were
capable of ditching Sung-hye

756
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,697
and joining hands with me.

757
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,368
I thought you took after your father,

758
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,912
but I see that you have
a cold, discerning side to you.

759
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:25,829
Yes.

760
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:27,831
I've realized that

761
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,835
whether or not Sung-hye gets
the upper hand in the merger

762
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,088
won't affect you at all.

763
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:39,051
I didn't think you'd do this
to your children as well.

764
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,144
Here's a share transfer agreement.

765
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,480
Ten percent of Yumin Electronics,
which I own.

766
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:56,527
As you know, Yumin is in a bind
because of Lee Bong-sik's list.

767
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,780
I'm sure you can help us out a little.

768
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,746
Also,

769
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,624
I have one small request to make
regarding the merger.

770
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,709
You're okay with that, right?

771
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,712
This is great.

772
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,799
Then I have a condition too.

773
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:24,513
Don't summon Kang Mi-na?

774
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,558
RYU SEUNG-DUK

775
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,396
What is this?

776
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,982
Why this sudden change? What is going on?

777
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,567
Isn't it what you wanted?

778
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,403
What is the reason though?

779
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,534
I'm sure you know the reason.

780
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:47,536
Pardon?

781
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:55,502
I saw you getting in Hanju Group's car.

782
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,299
You're never in your office these days.

783
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:03,844
With all the odd things going on,
I knew something was up.

784
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,188
An Yu-jun brought this to me.

785
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,277
Should I tell you why the two of you

786
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,988
can't get Chairman Kang Mi-na?

787
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:26,241
It's because

788
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,578
you…

789
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,506
received a car from Hanju.

790
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,386
I can't believe
you already got yourself a backer.

791
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,348
What kind of deal
did you strike with Hanju?

792
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,225
Did they contact you directly?

793
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:54,478
Then you should've told me!

794
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:57,856
Yeon-ju, I am a prosecutor too after all.

795
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,441
If you accept things like this

796
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:00,901
without even telling me,

797
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,570
I have no choice but to turn into a thug!

798
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:06,657
Chief.

799
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:10,160
Yes! I am the chief prosecutor
at the Central District Office.

800
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,704
I've made it this far because

801
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,831
I'm this insightful and perceptive.

802
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,000
I'm worried about you.

803
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:19,086
You're awfully imperceptive.

804
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,880
How are you going to survive
in this cutthroat organization?

805
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,426
-Then what about that car?
-Stop falsely accusing me.

806
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:30,722
Have you never accepted an offer
for a ride during your entire career?

807
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,724
Why are you suddenly acting all upright?

808
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,102
This is so unlike you.

809
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,186
Goodness.

810
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,075
Thank goodness he's bad.

811
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,368
That was a close one.

812
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,580
By the way,
what's with Hanju all of a sudden?

813
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,957
PROSECUTOR CHO YEON-JU

814
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,252
Earlier today, Hanju Hotel and Yumin Hotel

815
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,212
entered into a merger agreement.

816
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:05,340
The joint corporation will operate
under the name of Hanju Hotel.

817
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:08,885
Managing Director Han Sung-hye
and Han Sung-woon,

818
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,722
the younger son of Chairman Han Young-sik,

819
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:14,099
who hasn't taken part
in management in the past,

820
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,684
have been appointed co-CEOs.

821
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:21,690
It is expected that the two of them will
now start competing over the company…

822
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:24,526
He sure chose his side wisely.

823
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,111
Mom, you didn't know either?

824
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,447
Hey, what did I say to Sung-woon earlier?

825
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,782
Do you think he was offended?

826
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,659
You didn't say much earlier.

827
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,786
But you're usually so mean to him.

828
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,997
I'm sure he was offended every day.

829
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,750
I can't believe this.

830
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,794
What's going to happen to Sun-woo now?

831
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,176
Hey, stop making such a fuss over nothing.

832
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,594
It's not like

833
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,846
he has inherited the entire company.

834
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,807
He's just the co-CEO of the hotel.
That's all.

835
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,518
Let's go.

836
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,313
-Mom!
-Mother!

837
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:07,235
Both hotels have stated that
they will not go through restructuring

838
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:11,490
and have denied the rumors
about large-scale layoffs.

839
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,867
There were no specific conditions

840
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,953
other than making sure that
all of the employees could be retained.

841
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:21,583
Those whose tasks overlap will be sent
to our new business team.

842
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:25,837
This was strongly requested
by Ms. Han Sung-hye.

843
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,881
I'd like to express
my respect and gratitude

844
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:30,634
to Ms. Han Sung-hye for making sure

845
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,552
that every employee could be retained.

846
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,108
You changed the terms and conditions

847
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:48,276
of the merger without even telling me.

848
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:50,821
And what's the deal with Sung-woon?

849
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:54,908
Well, Seung-wook offered to hand over

850
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:57,035
ten percent of his Yumin shares.

851
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,580
It means we'll obtain those shares

852
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:03,625
while also reducing
Seung-wook's power in the company,

853
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:07,629
so the board won't object to it.

854
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,715
Well, I think

855
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,717
what we're gaining in this deal is bigger

856
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,386
than what we had initially expected,

857
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:15,554
so just sign it.

858
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,514
But why would he…

859
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,308
do all this?

860
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:22,436
For Mi-na?

861
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,521
That's none of our business.

862
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:28,567
Everyone's competing to gain more shares,
so we have nothing to lose.

863
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,487
And if he's doing this
because of his personal feelings,

864
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,781
we should welcome it with open arms.

865
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,451
Besides,

866
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,828
I can appoint whomever I want
to run my subsidiary.

867
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,037
Why are you so angry?

868
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,583
Why are you acting like you own Hanju?

869
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:51,840
What kind of a deal

870
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:54,217
did Mr. Han cut with them?

871
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:57,220
The summons is canceled,

872
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,139
and even those from the union
are gone now.

873
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,266
Why don't you ask him?

874
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:04,352
But what's this?

875
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,730
"Stock transfer approval request?"

876
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:10,275
Why are the stocks
being transferred to Hanju?

877
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:15,614
TRANSFEROR: HAN SEUNG-WOOK

878
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,742
It seems like Mr. Han
is transferring his stocks to Hanju.

879
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,788
The board approved it immediately

880
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,456
and is requesting your approval.

881
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:27,417
Where is he now?

882
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,504
He must be announcing the merger.
Is it over?

883
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,839
When my father

884
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,758
was establishing Hanju Hotel,

885
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:38,261
he would take me with him
when he went to look at sites.

886
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,514
So I feel a special attachment
to the hotel.

887
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:45,644
My father would often quote
an American human rights activist.

888
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,855
"Walls turned sideways are bridges."

889
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:54,361
"Walls turned sideways are bridges."

890
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,615
The wall between Yumin and Hanju
is now turned sideways to become a bridge.

891
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,827
The ceremony should be over by now, right?

892
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:05,247
There's usually a celebration afterward.

893
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,915
He might still be at the hotel.

894
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:10,919
Thank you.

895
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:13,630
HANJU HOTEL AND RESORT MAKES A FRESH START

896
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:16,258
Let's hear from the CEO of Hanju Hotel

897
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,593
about their new start.

898
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,475
I'm the CEO of Hanju Hotel,

899
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,768
Han Sung-woon.

900
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,729
To keep up with the new trend,

901
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:33,358
Hanju Hotel will strive to stay young.

902
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,736
And I'll be leading that change.

903
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,542
Did you hand over your stocks to Hanju?

904
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,793
Why? That's such a shame.

905
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,548
You said you couldn't do anything

906
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,717
because you didn't know
what's on my mind. So why?

907
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:03,346
Do you remember that?

908
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,107
I won't leave because I'm told,
or let people take things from me.

909
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:17,277
That is why I came to Korea.

910
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,448
Whose daughter you are, whom you resemble,

911
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,534
who likes you…

912
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:26,912
None of that matters to me.

913
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:31,124
I'm going to go for what I want
and do what I want to do.

914
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,460
I won't let anyone take from me again.

915
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,256
Hey!

916
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,467
How could you break into my place

917
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,593
and kiss me?

918
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,805
You kissed me.

919
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,392
That was my first kiss.

920
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,688
Gosh, I can't believe you.

921
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,148
Without me,

922
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,275
you would've spent the night
in the hallway.

923
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,737
Sober up, will you?

924
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,781
My first kiss…

925
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:47,283
Is there water in the fridge?

926
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,494
Goodness.

927
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:58,003
After working my tail off

928
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,088
to reveal the chief's corruption…

929
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,049
The Hanju family ruined everything!

930
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,802
I don't know what to do with them!

931
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,941
Do you find this amusing, woman?

932
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,443
Do you?

933
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:25,905
Let's see how much longer
you can enjoy this, woman.

934
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,074
You've completely lost your mind.

935
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,827
I'll tell everyone!

936
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:34,039
I'll reveal your dirt to the whole world.

937
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:36,041
I know everything!

938
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:38,668
Do you know who I really am?

939
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:41,755
I'm not Kang Mi-na.

940
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:44,090
I'm Cho…

941
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,634
Cho…

942
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:49,804
-Stop.
-What are you doing?

943
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:52,182
I'm the queen of Joseon!

944
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,978
How dare you call me
and throw a drunken tantrum?

945
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,982
Darn it. The call got cut off.

946
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,151
Why wouldn't you let me talk?

947
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,278
Look.

948
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:11,242
I've messed up in so many ways,

949
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:14,621
but do you know the worst part?

950
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:20,502
Until now, I could tell you anything.

951
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:24,631
But I can no longer do that.

952
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,550
Why?

953
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:31,387
Because I like you.

954
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:35,141
And

955
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:39,187
Kang Myung-guk, that jerk,

956
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:42,982
made your father die.

957
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,530
So why won't you let me talk?

958
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,951
That's why I can't help but drink.

959
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:29,070
FRESH MILK

960
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:33,116
Why do you get milk delivered
if you don't drink it?

961
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:36,202
There was a pile of milk
in the hallway the other day.

962
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,412
Gosh.

963
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,542
I drink it.

964
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,628
Every now and then
when I need to calm down.

965
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:47,839
Milk isn't a tranquilizer or anything.

966
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:52,510
Here. Drink it.

967
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:30,089
When my father was looking for sites
to build Hanju Hotel,

968
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:33,009
he would often take me with him.

969
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,512
And there's something
he told me many times.

970
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,140
It's something
a human rights activist once said.

971
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,810
"Walls turned sideways are bridges."

972
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,480
When a wall falls,

973
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,815
you just have to walk over it.

974
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:53,530
Then you'll find another way.

975
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,245
I still feel the same way,

976
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:01,871
but I don't know how you feel.

977
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:05,416
So I can't comfort you

978
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:07,669
or get closer to you.

979
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,965
There's nothing I can do.

980
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,262
I'll get going.

981
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,556
Good night.

982
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,450
I may have heard

983
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:42,537
something important just now.

984
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,631
What about that quote?

985
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,092
Someone told me

986
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:58,219
the exact same thing 14 years ago.

987
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,069
Do you want this?

988
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:25,830
There's something my father often said.

989
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:31,461
A human rights activist once said it.

990
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:36,215
"Walls turned sideways are bridges."

991
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,469
Tomorrow morning,

992
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:41,638
my father might turn out to be someone

993
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:45,725
completely different from the person
I've thought him to be.

994
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,102
To me,

995
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:52,732
my father has always been a wall
I can lean against.

996
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,487
But things will change now.

997
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,407
Still,

998
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:05,203
I believe he will be a bridge for me
in one way or another.

999
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:07,997
A bridge

1000
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,418
that leads me into a new world.

1001
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:24,305
I thought

1002
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,226
I could never tell anyone this
because it was too embarrassing.

1003
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:31,396
Please forget I said that.

1004
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:32,855
Thanks

1005
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:35,441
for today.

1006
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:09,142
That person was you, right?

1007
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:11,811
That wasn't Mi-na,

1008
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:15,940
but you?

1009
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:20,069
It was me.

1010
01:02:58,399 --> 01:02:59,484
That day,

1011
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:02,653
I lost my grandma,
whom I had relied on all my life.

1012
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:06,824
Before she passed away, she told me

1013
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,577
she didn't want her death

1014
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,746
to stop me from doing things.

1015
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:16,584
Back then, I didn't even understand
what she meant.

1016
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,254
But when you told me that,

1017
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,049
I decided

1018
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,551
to move on to another world

1019
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,011
through my grandma.

1020
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,389
That's why I never forgot that.

1021
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:37,104
Maybe your words
were what got me this far.

1022
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:39,899
Everything makes sense now.

1023
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,736
The Mi-na I liked

1024
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:46,739
was the person I talked to that night.

1025
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,827
But I'm not

1026
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,038
that Kang Mi-na anymore.

1027
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:58,125
Who I am,

1028
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:00,503
whose daughter I am…

1029
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,090
Are you sure none of that matters to you?

1030
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:07,426
I'm not that boy anymore either.

1031
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:11,305
When you get to really know someone,

1032
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:15,142
the person often turns out to be different
from what you imagined.

1033
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:16,811
Also,

1034
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:19,188
that's when

1035
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,109
true love begins.

1036
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:34,305
EPILOGUE

1037
01:05:34,388 --> 01:05:36,390
It's important to review

1038
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:37,934
medical certificates thoroughly.

1039
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:41,062
In many cases, they're viewed
as assault rather than injury.

1040
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:42,605
By the way, Yu-jun,

1041
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:44,065
have I ever mentioned this?

1042
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,734
It's important to review
medical certificates thoroughly.

1043
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:47,777
In many cases,

1044
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,696
they're viewed as assault
rather than injury.

1045
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,490
-Yu-jun.
-Yes?

1046
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:53,491
Did you know this?

1047
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:56,077
It's important to review
medical certificates thoroughly.

1048
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:56,994
In many cases,

1049
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:59,830
they're viewed as assault
rather than injury.

1050
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:01,123
-I get it.
-Listen up.

1051
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:02,291
Did I tell you this?

1052
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:05,169
It's important to review
medical certificates thoroughly.

1053
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:07,838
Yu-jun.

1054
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:11,634
Yeon-ju misses you so much

1055
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:15,763
that her heart is fluttering.

1056
01:06:15,846 --> 01:06:19,433
Yeon-ju likes you so much.

1057
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:23,396
Can you come and see Yeon-ju right now?

1058
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:25,606
Can you?

1059
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:28,025
Can you, please?

1060
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:34,740
Ouch.

1061
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:40,204
Is she still talking?

1062
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:43,958
I feel so sorry for the flounder.

1063
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:49,255
How could you
so heartlessly cut off the fish heads?

1064
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:50,840
That must hurt so much.

1065
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:52,800
You're evil.

1066
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:56,012
You guys are evil!

1067
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:59,765
You're so mean

1068
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:03,477
You're the worst

1069
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:09,442
Cutting off the fish heads so heartlessly

1070
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:15,489
Flounder!

1071
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:16,949
Cho Yeon-ju!

1072
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:20,327
Hey, do you call yourself the chief?

1073
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:23,748
-Do you really deserve to?
-Hey!

1074
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,624
You're the conglomerates' minion.

1075
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:29,295
You sly dog. Just you wait.

1076
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:30,588
Do you know who I am?

1077
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:34,008
Do you know who I really am?

1078
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:37,887
Are you out of your mind? I'm your boss!

1079
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:40,097
Hello? Did she just hang up on me?

1080
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,311
This is unbelievable.

1081
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:50,149
Did my subordinate just swear at me?

1082
01:07:53,694 --> 01:07:56,030
But who did she say she was?

1083
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,616
Chairman Kang Mi-na of Hanju Group?

1084
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:02,995
Why is she Chairman Kang Mi-na?

1085
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:13,547
Like I said, when you're in love,

1086
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,758
you're not disappointed easily.
Let's see where this goes.

1087
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:19,011
There are rumors spreading
that Mi-na is an imposter.

1088
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:22,139
So I'd like to get a DNA test done.

1089
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,058
You and I are
in the same boat now, Father.

1090
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:26,769
Let's share our connections
in the prosecution.

1091
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:27,895
Chief!

1092
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:30,523
Darn it. Couldn't you knock?

1093
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,566
I thought she was talking nonsense
because she was drunk.

1094
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,527
Do you remember the drug I gave you?

1095
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:37,655
You think Sung-chan is the only one
who'd end up like that?

1096
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:40,157
No matter what you do and who you are,

1097
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:41,784
I'm never going to divorce you.

1098
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:43,744
I know you're not Kang Mi-na.
