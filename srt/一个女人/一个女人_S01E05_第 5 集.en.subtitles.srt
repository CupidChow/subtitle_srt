1
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,002
She slapped my back with such conviction.

2
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,462
My gosh.

3
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,798
You always have pork bone soup
once every three days,

4
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,592
so I was wondering what was going on.

5
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,929
According to her, I love pork bone soup

6
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,891
and run a huge tab.

7
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,476
Prosecutor! Over here!

8
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,440
Someone called me something similar once.

9
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:09,194
Hello there, Prosecutor.
Funny seeing you here.

10
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,530
Wasn't that a great tip?
Did you hit the jackpot with it?

11
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,784
Yes, that con artist.

12
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,953
So he really meant…

13
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,247
I am a prosecutor?

14
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,959
Wait a second. I'm extremely smart,

15
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,003
quick-witted,

16
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,047
and familiar with the law.

17
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,174
I know someone in the Prosecutors' Office,

18
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,968
and someone even called me "Prosecutor."

19
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,513
Does that mean…

20
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,022
Since the article about Hanju Group
helping us came out,

21
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,776
people seem to think I hit the jackpot.

22
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,822
Why did he even go there
in the first place?

23
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,157
Maybe he was meeting someone.

24
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:58,868
By any chance,

25
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,454
did you check his phone?

26
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,625
It was smashed to pieces in the accident.

27
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:10,004
Then could I at least
have his phone number?

28
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,433
Did his condition worsen lately?

29
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,269
No.

30
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:28,898
It started to worsen
around 14 or 15 years ago.

31
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,485
After the factory he worked at had a fire.

32
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,822
Come to think of it,

33
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:39,409
the factory he worked at
belonged to Hanju Group.

34
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,662
Hanju Fashion.

35
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,456
Hanju Fashion?

36
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,633
HAN KANG-SIK

37
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,304
HANJU GROUP'S FIRST SON DIES IN A FIRE

38
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:03,016
When the fire started,
my husband was asleep in the quarters.

39
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,686
Luckily, one person went around the rooms
and woke everyone up,

40
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,771
so he was able to avoid injury.

41
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,025
Still, it took a while
before he was rescued,

42
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,610
and it must've traumatized him.

43
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,238
His seizures got worse after that.

44
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,665
Wait a second. I'm extremely smart,

45
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,292
quick-witted,

46
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,419
and familiar with the law.

47
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,421
I know someone in the Prosecutors' Office,

48
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,549
and someone even called me "Prosecutor."

49
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,843
Does that mean…

50
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,265
I was impersonating a prosecutor?

51
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,600
Gosh.

52
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,269
Was I both a gangster and a con artist?

53
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,439
I knew it.

54
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,816
Honey.

55
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,738
Why did Seung-wook give you a ride?

56
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,866
Well, why do you think?

57
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,160
See?

58
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,996
I always know what to say
to throw the other person off.

59
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,290
That's a characteristic of a con artist.

60
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,043
What?

61
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,963
Of course, it was Mr. No
who came to pick me up.

62
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,340
But then he got a stomachache
and had to rush home.

63
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,968
Turns out, Seung-wook had followed me
to make sure

64
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,805
the new chairman he supported
as a major shareholder was safe.

65
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,766
And I figured this was my chance
to get to know him better.

66
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,435
That's why I asked him to give me a ride.

67
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,105
See how smooth that was?

68
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,523
I'm definitely a con artist.

69
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,861
I see. You should've called me.

70
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,613
Honey.

71
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:44,450
Maybe I'm too used to being
in the shadow of my big sister.

72
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,744
I don't feel inferior to my wife at all.

73
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,206
I sincerely hope you'll become successful.

74
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,965
You're the new chairman of Yumin Group,

75
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,050
and I never got
to congratulate you properly.

76
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,885
Congratulations.

77
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,305
Thanks.

78
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,474
By the way, honey…

79
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,351
What is it?

80
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,688
I can't seem to remember.

81
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:20,028
Did I have any close friends
I often hung out with?

82
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,281
I can't figure it out
because my phone broke into pieces.

83
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,367
Well, I'm not sure
if you should think about your friends

84
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,703
at a time like this.

85
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,039
You have a lot on your plate
right now, don't you?

86
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,541
You don't know, do you?

87
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,917
Did you ever even ask?

88
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,546
-Get out.
-What?

89
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,131
Get out.

90
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,549
Why did I even ask you?

91
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,218
Okay.

92
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,014
Good night.

93
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,688
How much longer do I have to lie?

94
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,691
Once Mi-na is found,

95
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,319
I'll make sure you can go back
to your normal life.

96
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,988
My normal life?

97
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,784
The life of a gangster and con artist?

98
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,955
Everyone wants to know
where Kang Mi-na is.

99
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,041
But no one is interested
in who I really am.

100
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:18,711
Even if I were a thug and crook,
I must have a family, right?

101
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,964
Is there really no one looking for me?

102
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,577
What is it, sir?

103
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,579
Inmate 3452. You have a visitor.

104
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,104
It was you guys?

105
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,940
Who else would come here?

106
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,777
You come at most once a year.

107
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,113
Don't talk like you come often.

108
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,491
Boss.

109
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,161
We have something to tell you.

110
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,122
There's a gang
called Samgeori Gang in Seopyung.

111
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:39,750
Those guys totally humiliated us recently.

112
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,461
-What happened was--
-I told you

113
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,338
not to come here to talk about your gang.

114
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,715
That's not it.

115
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,467
If you can't find a job,

116
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,428
say you're from Nammoon Gang
and start a YouTube channel.

117
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,762
I'll allow that.

118
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,515
No one will post nasty comments
on your videos.

119
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,811
Yeon-ju is a prosecutor,
a public official.

120
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,605
She is doing great things.

121
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,233
I refuse to taint her name any further.

122
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,737
She's doing well, right?

123
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,532
She cut ties with our world

124
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,659
and is a great prosecutor, right?

125
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,120
-I need to tell you--
-Hey!

126
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,292
Of course, she's doing well.

127
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,045
She's eating well and working hard.

128
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,589
Of course.

129
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,965
She's doing very well.

130
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,136
Darn it.

131
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,847
Why wouldn't you let me talk
after coming all the way here?

132
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,683
You saw his eyes sparkle
when he talked about his daughter.

133
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,062
How could we tell him
that his daughter had been

134
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,605
taking bribes and using violence

135
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:46,317
and is being hunted by Samgeori Gang
and that she's hiding from us as well?

136
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,029
I wasn't thinking straight.
He cut ties with her anyway.

137
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,031
What use is it if he knows in there?

138
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:56,077
What if he gets out on parole?
He'll be disappointed.

139
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,246
He's serving a life sentence.

140
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,249
He needs to serve at least 20 years first.

141
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,209
He has a long way to go.

142
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,684
Good morning.

143
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,477
What are you doing here?

144
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:27,108
I said I'd take care
of everything, didn't I?

145
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,403
Rather than have you meet
a bunch of people,

146
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,739
it's better to have the one person
who signed the oath deal with everything.

147
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:34,991
It's more cost-effective.

148
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,451
Rich people are worse.

149
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,455
Anyway, I look forward to working
with you, Mr. Double Agent.

150
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,899
Why are they doing this? It's too much.

151
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,527
It's to show respect for the new chairman.

152
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,197
Your father, Chairman Kang Jang-soo,
refused to give his children

153
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,200
their inheritance in advance
even if they had to pay taxes later.

154
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:19,869
That is why you,

155
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,872
his daughter, received everything he had,

156
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,333
including his wealth and power.

157
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,230
-Let's go.
-Okay.

158
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,915
CEO KANG MI-NA

159
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:10,211
I turned down the inauguration
and everything else,

160
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:14,215
but it would've seemed strange
if you passed on the briefings

161
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,550
regarding new businesses
of our core subsidiaries,

162
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,011
so you'll have to attend to those matters.

163
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,847
Will they talk to me and stuff?

164
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,057
What do I say?

165
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,934
Don't say too much.

166
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,353
Just say okay to everything for now.

167
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:32,483
You're just a fill-in anyway.
We should maintain the situation.

168
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:37,571
Let the real chairman decide
whether or not to keep it going.

169
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,790
But this is kind of…

170
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,463
Is there a problem?

171
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,925
Your aggressive marketing plan

172
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:01,095
is to just spend lots of money.

173
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,431
Buy one get one free promo,
giving out coupons,

174
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,851
giving kickbacks to dealers
for selling our products…

175
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,562
They're methods of sales as well.

176
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,688
Exactly.

177
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,690
I'm saying I don't like that method.

178
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,527
Don't try to use tricks
to start a new business.

179
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,947
Cut down on marketing costs
and invest in product development.

180
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,536
Bluetooth earphones?

181
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,913
Even a local business shuts down

182
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,583
if it can't recoup its capital
in five years.

183
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,669
This business keeps failing
year after year.

184
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,713
What is the point of changing the name

185
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,381
and doing the same thing?

186
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,385
Mobile healthcare platform business?

187
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,596
What about the legal aspects?

188
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,222
You must not know,

189
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,765
but the law was passed recently.

190
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,643
What passed recently
was Section Three of the Data Law.

191
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,855
This will have many issues
under the Health Law.

192
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,857
It falls under several regulations too.

193
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,526
Do you know what a pain it is
if we get cited for violations?

194
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,779
Revise it, including contingency plans.

195
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,297
I turned down everything else,

196
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,926
but furniture
is the core business this year.

197
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:26,138
The new chairman should come
and encourage them.

198
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,600
How is a higher-up
looking around encouraging?

199
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,103
I'll sit here for a bit and go.

200
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,732
Give the employees a small bonus.
That's how you encourage them.

201
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,151
You may go.

202
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,947
I won't check every corner of the store
or anything like that,

203
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,615
so go back to work comfortably.

204
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,703
What's this?

205
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,747
I turned down everything else,

206
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,625
but Yumin Group's motto this year

207
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,835
is global management,

208
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,089
so you should attend the video conference
with the Australia branch.

209
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,716
All you have to do is show your face.

210
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,554
What exactly did you turn down?

211
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,560
That's nice and comfy.

212
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,978
Your position is a bit…

213
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,813
What? It's perfect.

214
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,649
People don't buy sofas to sit on them.

215
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,317
They buy them to lie on.

216
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,165
What's wrong with this?

217
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,420
Hello?

218
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,965
These punks.

219
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,801
Are they doing this intentionally?

220
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,596
To make the decisions themselves
after I show my face?

221
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,518
They must look down on me
because I'm a young woman.

222
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:58,480
Tell them I'll reschedule the meeting
and attend properly from my office.

223
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,029
What?

224
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,282
I don't know what you did
in your previous life,

225
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,035
but I guess the board didn't
pass you for nothing.

226
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,580
I feel like I was worried
for nothing this morning.

227
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,960
Do you understand English too?

228
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,296
I think so.

229
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,425
I was at the Prosecutors' Office
all day yesterday.

230
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,928
Isn't this too much work
for the morning after?

231
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,930
No one made you do it.

232
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,016
You're the one who chose to work hard.

233
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,894
It'll be lunchtime soon, so wait.

234
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,730
I can eat comfortably, right?

235
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,613
Father, if you wanted to talk to me,

236
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,907
you could've talked to me
when you saw me at home

237
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,952
instead of outside at a restaurant.

238
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,039
Does this look like we're just eating?

239
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,836
Joining Yumin's new leader
during her first lunch

240
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,463
symbolizes a lot.

241
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,048
I see.

242
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,636
About the hotel
that you're launching in Jeju…

243
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,347
It opened without any fanfare.

244
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,974
You can't just leave it like that.

245
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,144
The entire family died
on the day of the grand opening.

246
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,355
That is a terrible image for a hotel.

247
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,315
Since it's already happened,

248
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,902
why don't you merge it
with our hotel business

249
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,446
and make a fresh start?

250
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:49,258
-Dad canceled the lunch with me?
-Yes, ma'am.

251
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,511
A lunch meeting was suddenly scheduled
with the new chairman of Yumin.

252
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,974
The new chairman of Yumin?

253
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,982
Do you want to become a politician?

254
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,900
Me? No.

255
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,819
Then you're being awfully gutsy.

256
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,405
You barged in
to arrest the head of a conglomerate

257
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,698
because of a mere tip-off?

258
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,074
It was a credible tip-off,

259
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:17,411
and we were afraid she'd flee
or try to destroy evidence.

260
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,662
And that's what happened.

261
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,123
She was released
because the test came back negative.

262
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,374
Stop talking nonsense.

263
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,335
Besides, the prosecution
takes hierarchy very seriously.

264
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,670
You can't just raid the office

265
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,589
without even reporting
to your higher-ups first.

266
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,591
Because it is illegal.

267
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:34,178
As a prosecutor, isn't it my job to
investigate and indict every unlawful act?

268
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,723
Since when did the prosecution
have to investigate every unlawful act?

269
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,642
I do not understand what you've just said.

270
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,815
Goodness. What am I going to do with you?
Have you given up on a promotion?

271
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,984
No. I was never interested to begin with.

272
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,613
Sure. Being in a small town like Seopyung
can make you feel that way.

273
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,283
Then I suggest
you start taking an interest in it.

274
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,744
What do you mean, sir?

275
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,204
You know…

276
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,165
about the Hanju lobbying case

277
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,459
that was assigned to Division Two, right?

278
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,503
I've reassigned it to your office.

279
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,924
You reassigned
a previously reassigned case?

280
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,217
I'm sure you're surprised.

281
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,096
Just think about all the hard work
I must've had to put in to pull this off.

282
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:23,143
According to my colleague at your office
who played a huge role in it,

283
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,479
the office is so tiny

284
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,148
that you are unfortunately the only one
who can take on

285
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,358
a case that huge.

286
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,402
With that said…

287
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,740
Just bury it.

288
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,871
I wanted to find out more about you today.

289
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,416
Clearly you don't want
to launch a career in politics later on.

290
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,752
You're not very interested
in becoming successful.

291
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,421
I guess you just work hard
without a plan for your future.

292
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,632
If you cover this up,

293
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,426
I can make you interested in success.

294
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,014
You're close to Cho Yeon-ju.

295
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,516
Then you must know.

296
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,601
Look at her. She got her act together

297
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,646
and managed to return to
the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

298
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,106
What about you though?

299
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,609
Will you work in the boondocks
for the rest of your life?

300
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,902
Do you have bad lungs?

301
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,029
Do you have to live in a place
with clean air?

302
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,241
Don't waste your time

303
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,577
on useless cases
like the Lee Bong-sik one.

304
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,080
This is fate,
and it'll be a great opportunity for you.

305
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,541
Do a good job with the investigation.

306
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,211
Make sure you refer to the precedents
for the lobbying cases

307
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,880
involving conglomerates.

308
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,180
Precedents are just precedents.

309
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,640
The law is different.

310
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,267
I'll take care of it.

311
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,606
So you'll follow the law?

312
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,777
Father, your charisma is incredible.

313
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,031
I couldn't even pick up my spoon
while you were talking.

314
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,867
-What?
-But you see,

315
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,870
at your first lunch meeting
with the new chairman of Yumin,

316
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:08,498
you're referring to the accident that
killed my entire family as a mere mishap.

317
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,459
And you expect me to agree to the merger?

318
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:15,505
As you know,
my family treated me like dirt,

319
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,342
but fortunately for me,
I completely lost all those memories.

320
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,846
So let me be blunt
without any hard feelings against them.

321
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,225
Don't you dare
take over our hotel like that.

322
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:32,356
Yumin Hotel is clearly greater
than Hanju Hotel.

323
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,863
No one can ever completely hide
their true colors.

324
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,075
Why did I never see this side of you?

325
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:51,166
Well, I should get going
before you see something else.

326
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,501
Enjoy the food.

327
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,216
They say every prosecutor
can make his own decisions,

328
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,927
but they won't let you do
whatever you want.

329
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,847
If Ms. Cho was around,
I wouldn't even be asking you.

330
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,142
We've even filed a missing person report.
Where is she?

331
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,770
The police don't even want to
investigate the case yet.

332
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,106
You've reported her missing?

333
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,900
Yes. She's nowhere to be found.

334
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,610
We can't just sit back and wait.

335
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,701
Anyway, I got your point.
If you're done talking, I'll get going.

336
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,120
-Enjoy your lunch.
-Hey.

337
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,955
Wait!

338
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,625
What is his deal, seriously?

339
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:41,091
You didn't have to storm out like that.

340
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,385
I couldn't really think
because I was so hungry.

341
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,888
We should leave now to pick up some gimbap
before the lunch hour is over.

342
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,265
Thanks for lunch.

343
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,434
What? He didn't finish the food.

344
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,521
-Mr. No, let's go back.
-Go back where?

345
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,940
They must've ordered expensive dishes
for the chairman.

346
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:00,485
We should eat the food.
Come on. Hurry. I'm starving.

347
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,362
Hurry!

348
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,830
Hey! Wait!

349
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,879
Mr. Chairman.

350
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,548
I didn't know I'd see you here.

351
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,133
Are you here for lunch?

352
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:27,679
We had to put a project on hold
because of the summons,

353
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,432
but look at you lunching at a restaurant.

354
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,143
I guess you have
a lot of time on your hands.

355
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,187
Well…

356
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,443
Please don't worry, sir.

357
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,487
This is done very often,

358
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,489
but I reassigned the case
to another office

359
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,074
where many of my colleagues work.

360
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,584
Well, I'm sure you'll take care of it.

361
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,504
Wait, sir.

362
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,464
Wait.

363
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,260
Darn it.

364
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,848
How come you still haven't had lunch?

365
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,141
I had a lunch meeting,

366
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,560
but something unappetizing happened,
so I left.

367
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,605
My gosh, the soup is delicious.

368
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,818
Where's the female colleague
you're fond of?

369
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,571
I thought she'd be here because I saw her
while delivering some orders last night.

370
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,532
-Who? Cho Yeon-ju?
-Yes.

371
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,867
Nonsense. I'm sure it was someone else.

372
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,912
No way. I've known her
since her rookie days.

373
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:37,124
I've developed a keen eye
through doing this for 30 years.

374
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,376
Don't be absurd. My goodness.

375
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,422
I saw Ms. Cho yesterday too.

376
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,301
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

377
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,141
What? Where?

378
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,351
In the hallway at
the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

379
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,769
She was with a man.

380
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,398
Are you sure you weren't mistaken?

381
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:04,025
I'm sure of it. I saw her snapping at him.

382
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,993
Didn't you hear I had to cancel our lunch?

383
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,786
Why are you waiting here?

384
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,623
Why didn't you call me
if you were having lunch with Mi-na?

385
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,710
It was about the hotel,
so I had to speak with her privately.

386
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,588
Are you already planning
a merger with Yumin?

387
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,300
If it's about the hotel,
shouldn't I know too?

388
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:31,011
I'm not trying to help you
with your business.

389
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,762
This is about expanding my business.

390
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,600
I received a summons
from the Seopyung District Office.

391
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:41,521
Goodness. Bribing the National Tax Service
is still bogging me down.

392
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,859
Without the list that has your name
from three years ago,

393
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,445
they had to summon Sung-woon's wife

394
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,614
because she's in charge
of artwork dealing now.

395
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,782
If there's any possible issue,

396
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,743
get it sorted out
with the gallery in advance.

397
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,494
Okay.

398
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,707
Let's see how Mi-na
handles things this time.

399
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,501
Whether I want to help you
with your business

400
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,253
or just focus on expanding my own

401
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,631
is a conversation to be had
after we sort that out.

402
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,517
I'm totally drained after that talk
with my father-in-law.

403
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,937
Can I go to the hospital
and get an IV or something?

404
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,730
Do you not want to work?

405
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,983
What do you take me for?

406
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,152
I'm really exhausted right now.

407
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,073
As the head of the group,

408
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,659
you can only be treated
by your personal physician.

409
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,829
And your doctor is attending a conference
in Singapore right now.

410
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,539
Sing, Sing, Singapore

411
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,501
I'll go to the pharmacy
and pick up some energy drinks.

412
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,294
Drink those and try to hang in there.

413
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,132
I'm the chairman of a group.

414
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,468
I can't go to the hospital
when my personal physician is away?

415
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:54,886
This is ridiculous.

416
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,223
The stock price is plummeting as is. If
rumors spread about your hospital visit,

417
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,432
the stock price is done for.

418
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,269
Why are you here?
Go look for the real Kang Mi-na--

419
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:03,770
Go find her.

420
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,815
I can't find her
if don't give me any info.

421
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,441
I couldn't even reach you.

422
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,403
I had no time to call you.
Do you know how busy I am?

423
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,029
Did you look into her daily routine,

424
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:16,157
her friends, and if anything else happened
the day she went missing?

425
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,492
No.

426
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,911
You said it'd be no problem.
What have you been doing?

427
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,788
It's not like I didn't even try.

428
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,457
No one seems to know
about her personal life.

429
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,335
Friends?

430
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,088
You never told me about your friends.

431
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:35,135
You didn't go out except to visit
the gallery or do volunteer work.

432
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:39,431
Whatever you did outside
had to be reported to the family.

433
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,808
No wonder you were stuck at home
all the time.

434
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,519
She was a speck of dust to her family,

435
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,313
her husband had zero interest in her,

436
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,064
and all her friends were closely watched.

437
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,443
It seems like she was never able
to open up to anyone.

438
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,906
You're one emotional man.

439
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,742
Your face tells how you're feeling.

440
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,744
What are you talking about?

441
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,372
Come to think of it,

442
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,709
I'm the chairman of Yumin Group now.

443
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,960
Yes, you are.

444
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,629
Then I'll postpone all projects.
They'll all be rejected anyway.

445
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,089
What?

446
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,009
It's not that I don't want to work.

447
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:19,137
Just look at your face.
I must find Kang Mi-na first.

448
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,140
Let's go to the gallery first.

449
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,393
The last person who saw Kang Mi-na
that day was the director there.

450
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,239
Will you be okay by yourself?

451
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,200
If I'm not, are you coming with me?

452
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:44,120
We don't know who was behind
the hotel and the drugs incidents.

453
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,538
You can't be too careful.

454
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,167
Why are you looking at me like that?

455
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,003
You don't have to thank me.

456
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:58,426
It's no problem for me
to deal with a few men by myself.

457
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,970
He's only going to get in my way.

458
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:05,308
Okay. I won't thank you.

459
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,687
I seem to keep thinking of you as Mi-na.

460
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,689
I'll try not to attract attention.

461
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,274
By the way,

462
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,568
will you really be okay at the gallery?

463
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:19,072
You may have to lie to people
you don't even recognize.

464
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,990
It's fine.

465
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,660
Because I'm a professional liar.

466
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,453
Gosh.

467
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,500
How can she be so confident?

468
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,796
-She wasn't here yesterday?
-No.

469
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,047
The phone is turned off.

470
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,340
But I heard she was.

471
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,466
Please leave a message…

472
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,760
Her phone is still turned off.
Nothing's changed.

473
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,730
Just what is she thinking?

474
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:57,068
Usually, radio silence is a bad sign.

475
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,905
Will she show up with Lee Bong-sik
out of nowhere or something?

476
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,203
Hey, are you sure you can't reach Yeon-ju?

477
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:10,749
Didn't I say I'd let you know
when I hear from her?

478
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,834
I heard that she came to work yesterday,

479
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,586
but she's out of reach again.

480
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,087
What's going on?

481
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,047
Is she trying to make me look for her?

482
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,759
If she was there yesterday,
she should come back soon.

483
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,177
I'm busy. I have to go.

484
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,929
Hello? Hey!

485
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,315
Why did she have to take so many bribes

486
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,692
that I had to rush over
before the police got here?

487
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,612
But what is she up to really?

488
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,699
SOONDAE SOUP

489
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,285
There's a weird rumor
going around about you.

490
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:50,330
-What is it?
-They call you Seopyung's vacuum cleaner.

491
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:53,416
They think you're a troublemaker
who sucks in chump change.

492
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,920
-So I succeeded.
-What do you mean?

493
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,923
Hey. After years of slaving away in Seoul,

494
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,217
I realized something
when I was transferred here.

495
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,220
I'm an ordinary prosecutor
with no money or connections.

496
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,639
Which do you think will be easier for me,

497
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,433
going to see the higher-ups
or making them come to see me?

498
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,311
Surprisingly, it's the latter.

499
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,271
Is that right?

500
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:19,150
For a nobody like me
to get the upper hand,

501
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,985
I must try my best to stand out.

502
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,447
That's why I try my best
to be a troublemaker.

503
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,326
You should stop coming to see me.
We should stop eating together too.

504
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,329
If people find out we're friends,

505
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,248
they'll think you're a troublemaker too.

506
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,090
What kind of mischief is she up to now?

507
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:49,764
WE WELCOME OUR NEW CHAIRMAN, KANG MI-NA

508
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,894
Who are you?

509
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,521
I'm not a bad person.

510
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,815
I just want to talk to the chairman.

511
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,233
Then…

512
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,860
what is this?

513
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,237
They're Bluetooth earphones.

514
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,203
Bluetooth earphones?

515
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,165
This business keeps failing
year after year.

516
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:00,335
What is the point of changing the name
and doing the same thing?

517
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:07,342
I was informed this morning
that the business plan was scrapped

518
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,802
and we didn't have to supply
our products anymore.

519
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,722
We're forced to discard everything
that we already produced.

520
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:13,765
That's why I came.

521
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:19,187
These have completely different features
from our old version.

522
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,855
I just wanted to show them to you.

523
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,941
Still, you can't barge in like this.

524
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,692
You should take proper steps--

525
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,320
While he does that,
his contract would be terminated.

526
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,530
Don't worry.

527
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,492
Which do you think is easier,
a supplier seeing the chairman

528
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,536
or the chairman coming to see a supplier?

529
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,455
Surprisingly, it's the latter.

530
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:42,043
When you have nothing
but want to get the upper hand,

531
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,753
this is often the only way.

532
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,966
Sir, I'll make sure
to pay you a visit soon.

533
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,218
Thank you. Thank you so much.

534
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,553
Still, protocol is protocol.

535
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,514
Please follow me to the security team.

536
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,865
Are you okay?

537
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,743
You seem to faint
every time you get shocked.

538
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,830
I suddenly felt dizzy. But I'm fine now.

539
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:24,460
Seeing how these things keep happening,

540
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,630
I wonder if that was really
the first accident Mi-na had.

541
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,217
Let's say these things
were happening all the time.

542
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,137
Even though I'm looking for her
using all the resources I have,

543
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,139
I still haven't found her.

544
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,016
Maybe it means she's actually abducted

545
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,768
or something even worse happened, but…

546
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,478
But?

547
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,274
What if Kang Mi-na is hiding on purpose?

548
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,776
What are you talking about?

549
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,697
Father.

550
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,164
Is someone hiding?

551
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,250
Who? Where?

552
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:17,180
Father, this has been a very eventful day.

553
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,058
After careful consideration,
I rejected a proposal.

554
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:23,019
Apparently it upset the supplier,
and he just attacked me.

555
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,189
Luckily, I was able to escape danger,

556
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:30,193
but I was concerned about the image
of both Yumin Group and Hanju Group.

557
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:33,446
So I was trying to come up with a way
to calm down the supplier.

558
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:36,282
That's when I remembered
our major shareholder, Alex Chang,

559
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:39,118
who is devoted
to building social enterprises.

560
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,164
But the supplier must be
a for-profit organization.

561
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,458
What does it have to do
with social enterprises?

562
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:53,299
Exactly. I realized that
after talking to him for a moment.

563
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,842
Since I injured my head,

564
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,302
he's worried

565
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:59,472
that I've been preoccupied with work
unlike the old Kang Mi-na.

566
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:02,308
"Look for the kind-hearted Mi-na
hiding within you."

567
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,478
That was his thoughtful suggestion.

568
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,277
People are complaining
that you sent back reports

569
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,863
that were just waiting
for Chairman Kang to sign off on.

570
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,990
Word spreads so quickly.

571
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,829
I don't have to do everything
exactly the way my father did.

572
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,665
Just because the chairman
has the final say doesn't mean

573
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,416
the chairman should dictate everything.

574
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:32,338
I know you hurt your head,
but you're out of control.

575
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,340
Why do you think
that rumor is circulating?

576
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,760
Do you know how much people are talking
about how strange you've become?

577
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,971
How well do you know me?

578
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,182
Human beings are complicated
with many sides to them.

579
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:46,894
People say something's changed
when it doesn't feel familiar anymore.

580
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,815
Can't you just see me for me,
for who I am now?

581
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,030
Do you come running whenever Mi-na calls?

582
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,451
Let's finish talking about this upstairs.

583
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,620
Upstairs?

584
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,708
-But…
-The stock price will fall again

585
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,710
since people say
the new chairman is crazy.

586
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,880
Stop it. Don't scare me like that.

587
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,549
I don't know what it's about,
but you should go.

588
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,301
You always make me go alone
in times like this.

589
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:21,304
You said earlier I reminded you of Mi-na
and you'd go with me.

590
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,515
No. You're different from Mi-na.

591
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,185
What now?
What are you trying to say this time?

592
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,521
You're cooler than Mi-na.

593
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,067
Although you wouldn't know.

594
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,822
Seriously.

595
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,835
Gosh. He thinks I'm cool?

596
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,177
What does he want to say to me?

597
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:07,391
You know I was investigated for lobbying
the National Tax Service, right?

598
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,559
I do.

599
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,648
I tried to stop it,
but annoying things keep happening.

600
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,900
Anyway,

601
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:19,028
you received a summons
from the Seopyung Prosecutors' Office.

602
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,907
You were in charge
of our family's artwork deals,

603
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,117
so you'll need to go.

604
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,286
Father.

605
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,829
It's been ten minutes since you said

606
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,748
I was out of control
after hurting my head.

607
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,833
Now you want me to go
to the prosecutors' office?

608
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,627
I don't know anything.

609
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:38,381
You'll say you don't know
and that you don't remember anyway.

610
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,549
Even if they use a lie detector,

611
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,552
it may go in your favor
since you really don't remember.

612
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,888
But…

613
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:48,557
Darn it.

614
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,603
This is the assailant's call log.

615
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:56,315
Am I the head of the legal department

616
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,484
or an employee
at a private detective's office?

617
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,404
Why did you go there alone?

618
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,615
It's unbecoming to just tell others
what to do but do nothing myself.

619
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,284
You knew that?

620
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,497
Is how I dress also unbecoming?

621
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,208
Why? Did someone say something?

622
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,668
Well…

623
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:20,548
Did that person also say it was unbecoming
to just tell others what to do?

624
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,425
Yes.

625
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,304
Whoever it is,
you should become close to them.

626
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,597
I think that person
will be of great help to you

627
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,142
both externally and internally.

628
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,855
Did you meet
that prosecutor you mentioned?

629
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,398
Actually,

630
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,775
I can't reach Cho Yeon-ju at all,

631
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,777
so I'm looking around.

632
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,654
It makes me uneasy.

633
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,949
I feel like she went into hiding.

634
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,409
Are you sure we can trust her?

635
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,119
I heard a lot about her

636
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:53,831
from junior prosecutors in Seoul
when she was appointed.

637
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,416
She was the top trainee

638
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,918
at the Institute and is infamous
for her hot temper.

639
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,672
But she has a poor background
and has no connections.

640
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,050
They say she's good at trials.

641
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:08,971
Do you think Hanju did something to her?

642
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,432
No, right?

643
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,892
I doubt they'd go that far.

644
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,936
Anyway, we'll have to find
a new prosecutor.

645
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:21,359
What about that prosecutor
who barged into Yumin's chairman's office?

646
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:24,820
Someone that bullheaded
wouldn't care what others think.

647
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,407
It may be the opposite.

648
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,952
Do you mean he may be with people
who are after Mi-na?

649
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:36,082
I'll look into him a little first.

650
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,460
Why don't I meet him instead?

651
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,469
-Mi-na took the paintings?
-Yes.

652
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,679
She asked us to bring them into the room.

653
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:54,934
I don't think she had them
when she was hit by the car,

654
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,269
so I thought someone else picked them up.

655
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,855
Didn't you know?

656
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,400
Why are you only telling me that now?

657
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,278
-Have you always been this sloppy?
-No.

658
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,365
I reported everything about Ms. Kang Mi-na

659
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,866
up until now.

660
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,702
This time was because of the accident…

661
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:15,996
I apologize.

662
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,750
The Seopyung Prosecutors' Office

663
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,211
will summon her soon
to question her about the paintings.

664
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:26,298
It'll probably become a pain
for you again.

665
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:31,387
Gosh. I was dragged here and there
a few years ago because of Lee Bong-sik.

666
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,472
What choice do I have?

667
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,266
I have to do a good job

668
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,685
so that you can win points
with the chairman.

669
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,354
Don't worry about me.

670
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,106
Even if I'm talking to a prosecutor,

671
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:45,484
my lips will be sealed again
as they were for you last time.

672
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,945
Ms. Kang Mi-na…

673
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,782
No, it's Chairman Kang Mi-na now.

674
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,827
Chairman Kang is another one
you need to be wary of now.

675
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:00,791
I won't tell Chairman Kang

676
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,836
that you had her watched
and things like that.

677
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,174
That wasn't my point.

678
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,342
Pardon?

679
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,763
You've worked hard for our family
all these years.

680
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,683
Why don't you take a trip somewhere,
given the circumstances?

681
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,603
Before the prosecutors start bugging you.

682
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,980
I'll clean things up here.

683
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,524
Was that what you meant?

684
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:30,029
Actually, it isn't that easy
being dragged here and there.

685
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,699
Then do that. You're due a break.

686
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,493
Get some air…

687
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,287
while you're away.

688
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,372
Thank you.

689
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,338
I'm not even well.

690
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,964
How could he send me to Seopyung?

691
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,299
Even if I am a tiger cub,

692
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,676
he shouldn't kick me
off of a cliff like this.

693
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,596
Did Mi-na really make deals
with paintings?

694
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,848
Ms. Han Sung-hye was in charge of that

695
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,017
until three years ago
to build up their slush fund.

696
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,270
But ever since
she was conned by Lee Bong-sik,

697
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,813
Mi-na made the deliveries.

698
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,024
Darn it.

699
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,610
What if I say something wrong
and end up behind bars?

700
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:14,198
Why do I have to clean up
after Kang Mi-na every time?

701
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,741
She may not have done it…

702
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:17,618
on her own volition.

703
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,288
Look at him still taking her side.

704
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,375
Forget this. Look.

705
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,002
If you can't find Mi-na,
at least find out who I am.

706
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,879
You're a rich American.

707
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,923
Call the FBI and have them
run my fingerprints

708
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,466
and find out who I am.

709
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,093
FBI? Are you joking?

710
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,262
Why would they have
a Korean citizen's fingerprints?

711
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:40,099
If you're so curious,
go to a police station and ask them.

712
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:41,850
Police station?

713
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,024
We're almost there. Pull over here.

714
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,447
Stay hidden.

715
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,706
Seopyung?

716
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,041
Do you think it's the prosecutor
I said I'd meet?

717
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,335
It's a small town, so it's very likely.

718
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,882
We need to find her quickly
before she goes in for questioning.

719
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,176
What if she says something wrong?

720
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,595
She'll be in danger.

721
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,639
Whom are you worried about?

722
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,266
Mi-na or…

723
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,988
What are you doing here?

724
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,074
Did Father tell you

725
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,451
about the summons?

726
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:43,370
Yes. That too.

727
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,748
What a shame. You're too late.

728
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:49,251
I came to see if I could help you,

729
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,795
but the director must have gotten a whiff.

730
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,465
She left for the US this morning
on business.

731
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:56,842
She did?

732
00:43:58,385 --> 00:43:59,428
Anyway,

733
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,348
I heard something strange.

734
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:05,351
On the day of your accident,

735
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,353
you had bought paintings at the auction.

736
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,813
The five billion-won painting
our family was supposed to buy

737
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,149
and the 300 million-won painting
you bought personally.

738
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,609
You bought two paintings.

739
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:16,028
But I heard you took them.

740
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,237
What?

741
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,369
You didn't have them on you
when you got hit

742
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,579
and you didn't give them to anyone either.

743
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:31,168
Apparently, you told the director
to bring the paintings to you.

744
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,004
What?

745
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,714
What could you have done with them…

746
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,842
before you lost your memory?

747
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:42,596
What were you trying to do
before the accident?

748
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,600
I want to find that out
more than anyone else.

749
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,942
You need to get your memory back soon.

750
00:44:56,276 --> 00:45:01,073
Either there was a mistake
or you put them somewhere safe.

751
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:03,742
I made up an excuse.

752
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:06,036
There's no need for you to go in.

753
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,455
Bye.

754
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,297
CALL LOG

755
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,174
WIFE, CLIENT, PARK

756
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,890
SEPTEMBER 12, OUTGOING CALL

757
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,195
Yes.

758
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,074
Hello?

759
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,285
Hello?

760
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,460
When he left the Hanju factory,

761
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:58,130
he received huge severance pay.

762
00:45:58,213 --> 00:45:59,756
On the morning of the accident,

763
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,177
he said he was expecting a big sum
and told me not to worry.

764
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:05,554
Hello?

765
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,727
What happened?

766
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,270
Did they answer?

767
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,365
We've got a problem.

768
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,076
Apparently, I ran off with paintings

769
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,287
that are worth 5 billion
and 300 million won.

770
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:34,374
Kang Mi-na said someone was coming
to pick them up that day.

771
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,293
What was she up to?

772
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,836
What do I do now?

773
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,421
That's not the problem now.

774
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,381
What is a bigger problem than this now?

775
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,092
We don't have time for this now.

776
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:47,095
Then what should we talk about?
She ran off with 5.3 billion won.

777
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,138
It's just 5.3 billion.

778
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,641
Pay it back with Mi-na's money,
or I can give you the money.

779
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:51,600
My gosh.

780
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,435
Talk about culture shock.

781
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,103
Right,

782
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,314
it's nothing in the world of the rich.

783
00:46:57,397 --> 00:47:01,318
No wonder Han Sung-hye said nothing
about paying back the 5.3 billion.

784
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:04,821
I think Han Sung-hye had something to do
with the accident.

785
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:07,366
-What?
-Looks like the driver

786
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:09,618
has a connection with Hanju.

787
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:13,330
The call log shows that he was in touch
with Han Sung-hye.

788
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:14,831
Kang Mi-na was the target.

789
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,041
But why?

790
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:20,254
She wasn't a chairman or anything.
She did nothing but stayed home all day.

791
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,130
Hold on.

792
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:26,134
So I have to go to the house of the one
who tried to kill me

793
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,512
and eat and sleep as if I know nothing?

794
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,597
No way. I'm just going to run away.

795
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,974
Where will you go?

796
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,392
What?

797
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,561
They don't know that the real Mi-na
is gone, so they're not looking.

798
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,689
But if you disappear, the Hanju family
will find you no matter what.

799
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,527
Let's be careful and see
how the situation unfolds.

800
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,029
Darn it.

801
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,710
I believe that Ms. Kang overheard
some inmates' conversations

802
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,588
while volunteering at the penitentiary.

803
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,423
Since then,

804
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,884
she's been doing a little digging
into the arson case

805
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,470
that took place at Hanju Fashion
14 years ago.

806
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:15,851
-Since when exactly?
-I think it's been a while.

807
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,895
Then how come she's been quiet
all this time?

808
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:22,232
To use it against us down the road?

809
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,860
Maybe she was planning
to hand it over to her family

810
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:28,280
and demand a divorce in return.

811
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:30,532
I suppose she doesn't really know
how to win a game like this.

812
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:34,828
In some games,
you lose if you hold on to a joker.

813
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,833
She was afraid things wouldn't go
according to her plan,

814
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:43,003
so she tried to run off
with the paintings?

815
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,797
Then who has the paintings now?

816
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,344
-Ma'am, about dinner--
-I have no appetite.

817
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:53,305
I knew you'd say that,
so I bought some pastries for you.

818
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,516
I'm difficult, right?

819
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,269
No, ma'am.

820
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,854
But this is how I am.

821
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:03,315
I'm naturally fussy.

822
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:07,527
You can change your ways,
but not how you naturally are.

823
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,488
Right?

824
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,074
What do you mean, ma'am?

825
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,662
There was this person
I just couldn't stand.

826
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:20,248
I could never tell what she was thinking.

827
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:21,208
But…

828
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,628
-Mi-na.
-Don't mind me.

829
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:27,422
I can say that much. What's wrong with it?

830
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:31,093
Who am I?

831
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,055
I can't believe how much she has changed.

832
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:39,184
You said you checked
the drug test results again.

833
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,227
Yes, ma'am.

834
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:43,480
I've confirmed that they found nothing.

835
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,863
Ms. Kim. It's me, Sung-hye.

836
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:54,991
What's for dinner?

837
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:17,013
Should I really be here when I know
that this is the tiger's den?

838
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,307
I think this is a bad idea.

839
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:21,017
I should go talk to them again.

840
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,060
You're home.

841
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:25,647
Did you hear what I just said?

842
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,483
Hear what? I came out just now.

843
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,654
The walls in these rich families' mansions
aren't that thin.

844
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:35,574
Did you have dinner?

845
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,409
It's okay. I'm good.

846
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:39,745
Did you have dinner?

847
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,706
Whether I had dinner or not,

848
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:45,417
you shouldn't have to fix dinner
more than once a day.

849
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,420
I've done it, so I know how annoying it is
to fix a meal

850
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,005
every time someone comes home--

851
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,882
-Come in.
-Yes, ma'am!

852
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,557
This must be hard for Jae-hee.

853
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,309
She's not used to doing housework.

854
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:04,311
Does it taste okay?

855
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,315
Why? Did she spit in this?

856
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,985
I made it, and I didn't spit in it.

857
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:16,156
It's good. You're the best, Ms. Kim.

858
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:19,367
Ms. Heo

859
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,286
took cooking classes

860
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,996
before she got married,

861
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:25,624
so she knows her way around the kitchen.

862
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:29,252
Of course, she took cooking lessons.
She's from a rich family.

863
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,134
I'm sure I did too.

864
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,136
Because of my amnesia,

865
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,305
I even forgot
all about the cooking lessons.

866
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,893
It was hard to get up
at 4 a.m. to do housework,

867
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:48,522
but approving stuff at work
isn't exactly easy either.

868
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,565
I guess nothing's easy in life.

869
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,238
Just do as you're told.

870
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,074
Sorry?

871
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,743
Just eat when someone fixes you a meal.

872
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:06,206
It's stressful because you insist
on doing the dishes too.

873
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:13,797
Just leave everything in the sink
when you're done.

874
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,941
My gosh!

875
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,318
What are you doing, hiding here?

876
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,904
I wasn't hiding. I just walked in.

877
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,824
I figured you'd be tired
because it was your first day.

878
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,617
I brought some tarts from the hotel.

879
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,286
I don't want them!

880
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:46,705
Don't worry.
They're cheese tarts, not walnut tarts.

881
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,999
I don't like baked goods.

882
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,084
Really?

883
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,295
You used to love them.

884
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,048
I no longer like them.

885
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,302
Then what do you like now?

886
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,555
What do you mean?

887
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:05,056
Well…

888
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,517
I'll make sure to get them
for you next time.

889
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,437
-Hey.
-"Honey".

890
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,690
What are you playing at here?
Why are you suddenly nice to me?

891
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,526
Come on. We were business partners
to begin with.

892
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,988
I must change now
that our contractual terms have changed.

893
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:21,781
Don't be like that.

894
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,492
Sweet dreams, honey.

895
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,703
Go away!

896
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:28,872
Enjoy the tarts.

897
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:33,793
My gosh.

898
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:38,506
Every eye in this house
is like a surveillance camera.

899
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,592
Why is he being so clingy all of a sudden?

900
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,010
Gosh.

901
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:44,888
Hold on.

902
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:48,975
Don't worry.
They're cheese tarts, not walnut tarts.

903
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:53,438
Get it together. How could you eat this?

904
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,523
Could it be…

905
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:03,740
Hello?

906
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:07,911
It's me. Was Mi-na allergic to nuts?

907
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:12,290
Yes. She couldn't even stand
the smell of them.

908
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:15,418
But Ms. Kim gave me kongguksu.

909
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,462
She must know I'm allergic.

910
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,714
Pretend you're sick tomorrow.

911
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,342
Avoid contact with family members
for the time being.

912
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,844
-Bye.
-Okay.

913
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,939
You used to show up like Superman
even when I didn't call you.

914
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:39,275
How could you hang up on me like that?
Answer me.

915
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:42,821
That's what I would normally say.

916
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:46,866
So why did I say,
"Okay," and just hang up?

917
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:52,080
You're different from Mi-na.

918
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:53,832
You're cooler than Mi-na.

919
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,710
Although you wouldn't know.

920
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,425
Stop. What are you thinking about?

921
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,177
She was a speck of dust to her family,

922
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:09,180
her husband had zero interest in her,
and all her friends were closely watched.

923
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:12,017
It seems like she was never able
to open up to anyone.

924
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:19,691
Oh, no.

925
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,360
If I think he's cool,

926
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,988
a slap in the face can wake me up.

927
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,407
But if I start to feel sorry for him,

928
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,075
it means it's over.

929
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,955
What is this?

930
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:37,042
Could it be that I'm innocent,

931
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,168
although I'm a crook?

932
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,129
My gosh!

933
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,339
What are you doing, hiding here?

934
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,009
See?

935
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:48,470
I totally acted like
I'd never dated anyone.

936
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:52,265
If the crook turns out
to be an innocent virgin,

937
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,142
what on earth

938
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:58,021
was the conglomerate's
daughter-in-law like?

939
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:11,951
Too bad we couldn't meet outside.

940
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,996
Prosecutors don't have time to go out.

941
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,624
We have to read all the records,

942
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:22,087
investigate, report, write up drafts
and gather statistics.

943
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:25,423
I only made time for you
because you told me

944
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,883
you had intel about Hanju Group.

945
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:28,718
So what is this about?

946
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,346
You received a tip about

947
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:33,890
the second daughter-in-law
of Hanju Group using drugs, right?

948
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:35,975
That's right.

949
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,478
Can you tell me who gave you the tip?

950
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,898
That case was transferred
to Seoul Central.

951
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:45,235
So you're not here to give me a tip
but to receive a tip?

952
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:47,070
I assume there aren't many prosecutors

953
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:50,073
who could barge in there like that
just because they received a tip.

954
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:53,368
In addition, you sent a summons
to the same person again.

955
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:57,956
I'm wondering if you have any plans
regarding Hanju Group.

956
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,626
It seems like you got the wrong idea.

957
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,629
I only went there because I received a tip
about her drug use.

958
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:09,717
And the summons was sent to a witness
in the National Tax Service bribery case.

959
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:11,970
I'm just an ordinary prosecutor.

960
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:15,140
Ordinary prosecutors are quite rare
these days, aren't they?

961
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:19,519
And an ordinary prosecutor is
just what I'm looking for.

962
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,940
I don't know what you imagine
an ordinary prosecutor to be like,

963
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:26,401
but prosecutors are just as
performance-driven as salespeople.

964
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:28,611
That's why ordinary prosecutors spend

965
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,488
all their time chasing petty offenders.

966
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:33,408
Then why don't you make time
for bringing down a big shot?

967
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,326
Wouldn't that help your career?

968
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,037
You might even be able
to put him behind bars.

969
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,005
I brought this

970
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:49,549
thinking you might want to know more
about Hanju Group.

971
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:52,093
You seem busy, so I'll get going now.

972
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,222
Right.

973
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:59,934
By the way, have we met before?

974
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:02,812
I ran a check on you,

975
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:07,525
but you and I don't seem to have

976
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:08,818
anything in common at all.

977
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:11,488
Bye then.

978
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,583
When we went to arrest Kang Mi-na,

979
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:27,504
he barged into the chairman's office
and complained it was an illegal arrest.

980
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,922
He did?

981
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,798
PROSECUTOR AN YU-JUN

982
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:31,883
What's that?

983
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,720
This is a pretty old case.

984
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:39,807
The Hanju Factory arson case.

985
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:43,102
Didn't the first son of Hanju Group
die in that fire?

986
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:46,064
-He's that guy's father.
-Really?

987
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,565
If I remember correctly,

988
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,651
the fire was started
by a worker who had been fired.

989
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:53,196
Anyway, he's a member
of the Hanju family himself.

990
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,323
Why did he bring that to you
and say those things?

991
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:59,869
Is he a Schrödinger's person?

992
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,121
A what?

993
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,374
You've heard of Schrödinger's cat, right?

994
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,298
You don't know what Schrodinger's cat is?

995
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:15,176
There's a cat in a box.

996
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,470
Until you open the box,

997
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:20,139
you don't know whether the cat
is alive or dead.

998
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,225
You can say
it's the world's most famous cat.

999
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,352
I'm like that.

1000
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:26,312
A Schrödinger's person, if you will.

1001
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,524
Does that answer my question?

1002
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:33,820
Do you really have to become successful
by doing exactly what someone did

1003
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,196
to your grandma?

1004
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,282
Yes, it answers your question.

1005
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:39,367
Until everything's over,

1006
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:43,037
you can't say someone is good or bad.

1007
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,791
On her deathbed,

1008
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:49,669
do you know what my grandma told me

1009
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,130
when I was blaming myself for her death?

1010
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:53,131
CHOI SEUNG-OK

1011
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,549
What did she tell you?

1012
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:58,761
"No one is 100 percent responsible
for anything that happens."

1013
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:02,056
She didn't want me to spend

1014
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,391
the rest of my life

1015
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,226
tormented by guilt, doing nothing.

1016
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:10,607
There's nothing that my memories
of Grandma can stop me from doing.

1017
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:14,569
So until the box is open,

1018
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,530
you shouldn't conclude

1019
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:18,990
whether I'm good or bad.

1020
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:25,830
Yes. I'll be abroad for a while.

1021
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:28,541
You might not be able to reach me.

1022
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,753
Sure. I'd like to get some good rest.

1023
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,255
Okay, bye.

1024
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:38,968
What's going on?

1025
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,638
That scared me.

1026
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:45,850
My goodness.

1027
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,654
The scene has been taken care of.

1028
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,614
The gallery will be sold to someone

1029
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,324
appropriate soon.

1030
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:03,993
People are so foolish.

1031
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:06,537
Unless you express your anger,

1032
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,332
they don't know you're angry
and keep crossing the line.

1033
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:13,252
But I couldn't get angry with someone
way below me, could I?

1034
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:18,633
Assistants can always be replaced
without any problem.

1035
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,468
Don't you agree?

1036
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:25,264
When you're getting
too big for your boots,

1037
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,142
when you think you're somebody,

1038
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:30,395
that's a sign…

1039
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,857
that you must think long and hard.

1040
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,319
Otherwise, those thoughts
will eat you alive.

1041
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,505
Oh, dear.

1042
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:00,007
My gosh.

1043
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,886
Oh, my. If it isn't Ms. Kang Mi-na.

1044
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,597
I almost forgot what you look like.

1045
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:10,768
It sounds like your memory
is getting pretty bad.

1046
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:13,354
Should I hang a picture of me
on the wall or something?

1047
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:16,691
Do you think I'm out of my mind like you?

1048
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:18,151
What I mean is,

1049
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,903
why have you been stuck
in your room all morning?

1050
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:24,365
I had kongguksu yesterday,

1051
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,367
and I've been feeling unwell since.

1052
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:27,994
Oh, gosh.

1053
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:31,164
Have you lost your mind?

1054
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:33,332
Why did you give that to her?

1055
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,010
Mother!

1056
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,263
Are you okay?

1057
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:50,516
I've seen her splashing coffee
on you countless times,

1058
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,893
so I saw this coming.

1059
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:54,937
What will you do
if she gets sick but doesn't die,

1060
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,522
causing our stock prices to fall?

1061
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:59,192
You got in my son's way and made him die.

1062
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:02,528
Your family copies everything we do
and gets in the whole family's way.

1063
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,697
Goodness. You frustrate me.

1064
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:09,702
Mother.

1065
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:12,163
I know you're taking it out on Jae-hee,

1066
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,664
but I think you're out of line.

1067
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:17,043
Hey, I didn't say anything to you.
Stay out of it.

1068
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:20,588
Seeing how you're picking on me,

1069
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:22,507
were you lying
when you said you were unwell?

1070
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:23,591
Was I lying?

1071
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:25,676
You get so aggressive
every time I say something.

1072
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,803
Are you a thug or what?

1073
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,180
A thug?

1074
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,224
Why are you so quiet?

1075
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:34,435
I'm sorry.

1076
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:38,481
It wasn't Ms. Heo who gave her kongguksu.
I gave it to her last night.

1077
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,900
I must be getting forgetful in my old age.

1078
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:43,653
Ms. Kim.

1079
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:48,783
At your age, if you make such a mistake,
people will think you have Alzheimer's.

1080
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:51,369
-Be more careful.
-I will be.

1081
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,414
Ms. Kang, I don't think

1082
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,708
you should eat anything today.

1083
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:59,752
-Go upstairs now.
-What?

1084
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,130
She's right.

1085
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:06,050
You're being questioned
by the prosecutors later.

1086
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:09,720
You're usually way too aggressive.
You should at least look sick.

1087
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,181
It worked out well.

1088
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:20,523
Ms. Kim.

1089
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:24,151
Sorry for asking you
to do that last night.

1090
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,154
It's my job.

1091
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:30,867
How's Mi-na?

1092
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:37,957
This was from a while ago.

1093
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:40,084
Yes?

1094
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:42,420
Just as you did,

1095
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:47,174
Madam instructed us
to feed Ms. Kang food with peanuts in it.

1096
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:50,553
I wasn't home at the time,
so someone else served it to her.

1097
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:54,015
She wanted to know
how serious her nut allergy was

1098
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:57,184
and whether or not
she'd actually die from it.

1099
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:59,395
I think that was what she wanted to know.

1100
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:03,941
Since Ms. Kang
had not lost her memory back then,

1101
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:07,570
she could've stopped eating
if she felt something strange.

1102
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:09,906
But now, since she has no memory,

1103
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:12,617
she'd keep eating
even if she feels something wrong.

1104
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:19,206
Did it not matter what happened to her?

1105
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,545
Make your point.

1106
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,049
That was why

1107
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:33,179
when you told me
to make Ms. Kang kongguksu,

1108
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:37,183
I made it with all soybeans
and no nut powder.

1109
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:46,067
I don't care what you do
outside for the company.

1110
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:49,320
But don't drag that into the home.

1111
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:52,531
However,

1112
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:58,871
Ms. Kang said she got sick
because of the kongguksu.

1113
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,042
How strange.

1114
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:15,513
Darn it. That witch yells at me
and tells me to starve,

1115
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:18,975
but I can't talk back
because I'm a crook and a gangster.

1116
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,311
-This is so annoying.
-Mi-na.

1117
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:23,938
Yes?

1118
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:28,401
I didn't know you cared so much about me.

1119
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,403
I don't exactly.

1120
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,029
It was more because of my temper.

1121
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:33,322
Regardless.

1122
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,992
I suddenly became
a third-class citizen in this house.

1123
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:39,203
You were the only person
to openly take my side.

1124
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:41,205
Sun-woo caught on and checks

1125
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:43,374
his grandma's facial expression.

1126
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,585
-Jae-hee.
-What?

1127
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:51,215
To be honest, you're not my type,

1128
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:54,093
but you have the tenacity
to survive in this family

1129
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:56,012
and have financial means.

1130
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:57,972
Why do you stay here like this?

1131
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,099
Your parents are loaded.

1132
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:02,560
You could ask them
to give you a subsidiary.

1133
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:05,187
You heard Mother earlier.

1134
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:06,856
My parents' company and Hanju

1135
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:10,109
overlap in types of business
and company size,

1136
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:13,571
so even they treat me like a spy.

1137
01:07:13,654 --> 01:07:15,990
I have my reasons too.

1138
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:17,867
I see.

1139
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:20,202
Which gets me thinking…

1140
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:21,787
To be honest,

1141
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:25,082
I've been closely watching
your every move.

1142
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:30,004
-And?
-This is the best time to ask.

1143
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,803
A few years ago,

1144
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:42,183
I decided I had to take care of myself
and found a hedge fund.

1145
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:43,559
Private Equity Fund for chaebols.

1146
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:48,564
Only people who qualify
can invest with them.

1147
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:52,234
The more funds the better.

1148
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,779
Can you invest in me?

1149
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,865
-Jae-hee.
-What?

1150
01:07:57,948 --> 01:07:59,950
When you hear
an explanation about something,

1151
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:02,328
if you think it sounds
too good to be true,

1152
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:03,704
it's always a con.

1153
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:07,041
What are you talking about?

1154
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:09,418
It's like if I want to
take out money I put in,

1155
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:12,797
I need to put in more money
so that I can get paid sooner.

1156
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,508
Those cons are popping into my head.

1157
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:17,426
That's not true.

1158
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,721
It's a small fund
with people who know one another.

1159
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:23,682
Deals involving money
between people who know one another.

1160
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,309
That's like in-laws.

1161
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:27,436
What does that mean?

1162
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:29,522
It may be okay.

1163
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:31,690
But that's rare.

1164
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,234
Pull out as soon as possible.

1165
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,737
It's not like you've pulled cons before.

1166
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:38,322
How do you know that?

1167
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,032
Right?

1168
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:45,204
If you don't want to give me the money,
fine. But don't be insulting.

1169
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:48,749
What if I do?

1170
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,459
What will you do for me then?

1171
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:55,381
Well, I won't just
sit back and do nothing.

1172
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:57,341
In that case,

1173
01:08:58,342 --> 01:08:59,802
tell them I'll invest

1174
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:03,639
and use that as bait
to get yourself paid first.

1175
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,391
Then pull out.

1176
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:07,810
Pull out?

1177
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:09,520
I'm telling you, it's a con.

1178
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:11,647
If it really is a moneymaker,
you do it alone.

1179
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:13,274
That's how the world works.

1180
01:09:13,357 --> 01:09:15,943
What do you have to do
to avoid Mother lashing out at you?

1181
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:17,736
You have to get angrier.

1182
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:22,199
If you don't want to get conned,
you have to pull a bigger con.

1183
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:24,869
Okay.

1184
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:26,287
You know, right?

1185
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:28,831
This stays between us.

1186
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,596
Why do I know those things so well?

1187
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,182
Did I pull cheap cons like that too?

1188
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:48,309
Darn it.

1189
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,825
EPILOGUE

1190
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:12,666
HANJU FACTORY FIRE IN SEOPYUNG

1191
01:10:16,086 --> 01:10:19,632
HANJU FACTORY ARSONIST FINALLY CONFESSES

1192
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:30,476
SUSPECT

1193
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:32,019
Please tell us.

1194
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:35,147
Why did you do it?

1195
01:10:57,294 --> 01:10:59,463
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

1196
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:01,173
I can't believe
I had a meal with people on my birthday.

1197
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:02,841
You should get going, right?

1198
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,468
Why are you trying to kick me out?

1199
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:07,054
She must've been hanging out
with her cousin-in-law so often

1200
01:11:07,137 --> 01:11:09,056
for such disgusting rumors to have spread.

1201
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:11,100
Who's on Chairman Kang Mi-na?

1202
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:12,643
-What are you doing here?
-Do I know you?

1203
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:15,562
You're the one
who used that to bog me down.

1204
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:19,483
I'm trying to be understanding,
but you've changed too much.

1205
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:21,068
I call this "Magic Powder."

1206
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:22,778
Who told you it's called "Magic Powder?"

1207
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:25,531
The tablet you used to carry around
all the time.

1208
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:26,991
You activated the fingerprint lock.

1209
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,243
Unlock it right now.
