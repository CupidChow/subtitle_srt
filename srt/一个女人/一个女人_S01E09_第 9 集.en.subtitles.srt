1
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,332
Ms. Kang wants me
to negotiate on her behalf.

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,293
You can talk to me from now on.

3
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,296
Isn't it considered cheating
to get involved now?

4
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,673
I didn't know there were such rules.

5
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,843
Don't be so stiff.

6
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:54,220
Let's try to achieve a win-win situation.

7
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,598
Business is all about

8
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,099
working together, right?

9
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:02,103
I know. Like Hanju Fashion in the past.

10
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,489
This is a report written up by Prix Fund.

11
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,909
It says Hanju Hotel's
due diligence was insufficient

12
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,119
and the valuation is biased
in favor of Hanju.

13
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:22,248
I'll have an external auditor reinspect.

14
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,667
You're out of line.

15
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,921
Are you implying
our due diligence was deceptive?

16
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,047
Am I

17
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,299
out of line?

18
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,593
I'm just following your example.

19
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:38,306
Just like when you were digging
into my father's accounting fraud.

20
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:42,685
But I never made it public
to protect the reputation of the deceased.

21
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,812
I see.

22
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,607
So you were being considerate
of my father.

23
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,488
But you must know this well.

24
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,032
When it comes to business,
just because you've been kind

25
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,450
doesn't mean you'll be repaid.

26
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,745
It would prove more beneficial

27
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,414
to have something on someone.

28
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,631
As you probably know,

29
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,008
it seems like Sung-hye was

30
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,344
planning to reveal
your father's accounting fraud.

31
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,723
So your father must have tried
to either move the ledgers

32
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,768
or burn them up, thinking it was too late.

33
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,687
What a fool.

34
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,650
He couldn't escape the fire
because of the ledgers.

35
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:31,651
Uncle.

36
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,404
You know my father wouldn't do that.

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,531
Please look into it again.

38
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,741
Think about all the kindness

39
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,661
my father has shown
to Hanju Fashion and Sung-hye.

40
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,831
He would never do that.

41
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,916
You don't seem to understand.

42
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,210
Business doesn't work like that.

43
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,963
Just because you've shown
kindness to someone

44
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,923
doesn't mean you'll be repaid.

45
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:59,470
Rather, it would prove more beneficial
to have something on that person.

46
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:16,988
Seung-wook.

47
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,158
I hope you're not picking a fight.

48
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,162
It's not like we want to have
something on each other.

49
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,538
Why would you say such a thing?

50
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,832
I hope not.

51
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,544
Let's talk again
once the due diligence is over.

52
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,803
Like father, like son.

53
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,557
If Uncle had remained quiet,

54
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,560
things would've been much easier
for many people.

55
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:57,153
WARDEN'S OFFICE

56
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:22,637
The prosecutor who wanted to see me

57
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,598
was you?

58
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,142
I heard you said no to all visits,

59
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,894
so I came here as a prosecutor.

60
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,772
I did hear

61
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,609
that you became a prosecutor.

62
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:40,947
My life here

63
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,908
is nothing special.

64
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,540
I eat and work out regularly,

65
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,874
watch some TV,

66
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,627
and work when I'm told to.

67
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,840
With the little money I'm given,

68
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:03,511
I sometimes buy the food I want

69
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,848
and post letters too.

70
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,935
Why did you do that?

71
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,359
-Sir.
-Goodness.

72
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,528
No one takes that road
except for the people

73
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,113
who work at the factory.

74
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,698
We don't even have a witness.

75
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,491
There is nothing we can do.

76
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,870
There must be some speed cameras
along the road.

77
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:32,040
The cameras in the area don't even work.

78
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,166
It's just for show.

79
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,627
You see, we're short-staffed
at the moment.

80
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,920
Just go home and wait.

81
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,465
We'll call you if anything turns up.

82
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,135
Do you know why we're short-handed?

83
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,805
What a problematic family.

84
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,975
Like father, like daughter.

85
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,310
Hey, go home.

86
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,645
How dare you throw a tantrum
at a police station?

87
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:57,815
You thug.

88
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,526
How could you start a fire
right after getting released?

89
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,280
If everyone set fire
to every company they get fired from,

90
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,865
there would be no companies left!

91
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,173
I always put up with being looked down on
as a thug's kid.

92
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,511
Was it so unfair that you got fired
because you were a thug?

93
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,015
Why did you tell Grandma
you'd start a fire

94
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,685
and make her rush there at night
and get run over by a car?

95
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,981
And why did you actually start a fire

96
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,861
and make all the ambulances
go to the factory instead of to Grandma?

97
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,866
I didn't know Mother would come.

98
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,327
-What?
-Yeon-ju.

99
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,662
Don't call my name.

100
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,250
To think that she was so concerned
about her lousy son

101
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,669
that she rushed over there.

102
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,964
And look what happened in the end.

103
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,091
Even on her deathbed,

104
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,177
she told me not to blame you.

105
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,685
But no.

106
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,271
It's all your fault.

107
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,942
Grandma died because of you.

108
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,114
After putting us through so muchâ€¦

109
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:33,035
After putting Grandma through so much,
how could you let her die like that?

110
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,003
I know

111
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,089
I'm responsible for Mother's death.

112
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,468
I know I couldn't pay for what I did

113
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,429
even if I rotted in prison
for the rest of my life.

114
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,848
I do know that.

115
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,107
What about
all the innocent people who died?

116
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,154
You didn't only make us suffer.

117
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,865
You made so many people's lives miserable.

118
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,117
And what did you say?

119
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,370
You eat and work out regularly?

120
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,664
Have you no shame?

121
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,211
After I tried so hard
to run away from you,

122
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:27,006
why do you still barge into my life
and mess up everything?

123
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,008
Why?

124
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,811
After I became a prosecutor,

125
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:45,024
I learned the definition of a thug.

126
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,110
"Someone who is ready

127
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,155
to use violence to achieve their goal."

128
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,990
"A social ill."

129
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,120
I shouldn't have expected
to hear anything reasonable

130
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,206
from such a person.

131
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,086
You'll never see me again.

132
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,765
WARDEN'S OFFICE

133
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,533
It's me.

134
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,286
Can we meet for a second?

135
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,252
We'll discuss the matter again

136
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,628
after a reinspection.

137
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,757
She'll be at a disadvantage
if the merger happens now,

138
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,676
so she'll soon make a bunch of requests.

139
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,720
Kang Mi-na is the one

140
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,514
who should be hearing this, not me.

141
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,936
I'm not saying this because
Kang Mi-na should hear it.

142
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,480
I wanted to say it to you.

143
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,652
By the way, where are we going now?

144
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,163
You've been acting like a different person
since you regained your memory.

145
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,291
It's like getting drunk
and befriending someone,

146
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:28,628
then meeting that person again
the next day, in broad daylight.

147
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,546
You once said to me

148
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,885
that there would be many things I could do
because I didn't know my past.

149
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,804
You were right.

150
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,891
Now that I've regained my memory
and know my past,

151
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:47,021
there are things that I simply can't do.

152
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,025
Things you simply can't do? Like what?

153
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,748
Why did you bring me here?

154
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,958
This is my grandmother.

155
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,546
The day she passed away
is the same as your birthday.

156
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:21,180
CHOI SEUNG OK, 16 SEPT 1939 - 2 OCT 2007

157
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,393
Her son had lost his job at a factory.

158
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,852
And that day, he told her

159
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,898
he wanted to set the factory on fire.
Worried about what she'd heard,

160
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,859
she left the house to go to the factory
and got into a hit-and-run.

161
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:37,238
And because she couldn't stop her son,

162
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,240
he actually ended up

163
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,617
setting the factory on fire.

164
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,204
What are you talking about?

165
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,541
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,793
That factory was

167
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,422
the Hanju factory.

168
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,594
And I'm the daughter

169
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,763
of Kang Myung-guk,

170
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,433
the arsonistâ€¦

171
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,937
who killed your father.

172
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,194
Everything he didâ€¦

173
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,197
I'm truly sorry.

174
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,575
I really mean it.

175
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,878
I should get going.

176
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,005
Wait.

177
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,674
That makes no sense.

178
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,593
His surname is different from yours.

179
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,636
I changed my surname

180
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,724
because I was sick of being his daughter.

181
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,771
I brought you here to tell you this.

182
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,525
I figured it would be too hard for me
to bring it up otherwise.

183
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,532
You know, my grandma was so scary.

184
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,077
I can't lie in front of her.

185
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,541
I'm off.

186
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,806
You can't leave like this.

187
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,227
Then what? Do you have something to say?

188
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,566
How about I say
what you want to say to me now?

189
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,528
Everyone reacts the same way

190
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,030
when they find out
my father is a thug and a murderer.

191
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,323
At first, they act like

192
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,575
they're not shocked. "Oh, I see."

193
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,786
Then they'd say this.

194
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,579
"Are you going to keep living here?"

195
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,958
"Don't tell us you thought
you could stay friends with us."

196
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,670
Then we would grow apart.

197
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,673
You'll be no different.

198
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,009
Besides, the man who died is yourâ€¦

199
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,311
It had nothing to do with you.

200
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,359
I don't know what other people say,
but I don't think

201
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,696
you have to take responsibility
for what your father did.

202
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,711
Come to think of it, I brought you here,
so how will you go home?

203
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,588
You didn't bring your car.

204
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,758
We can cut ties
after I give you a ride one last time.

205
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,177
Why must we cut ties?

206
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,305
And what? "One last time?" Why?

207
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,105
All right.

208
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,391
What is your relationship with Yeon-ju?

209
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,101
Who are you?

210
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,062
Just answer the question first--

211
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:41,523
First, tell me who you are.
That's the basic manner.

212
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,693
What is your relationship with Ms. Cho?

213
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:50,574
We are her father's brothers,

214
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,409
-That's right.
-which makes us

215
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,536
Yeon-ju's uncles.

216
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,246
That's right.

217
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,167
I see. I'm sorry. I didn't know.

218
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,962
You don't have to be that courteousâ€¦

219
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,047
What are you saying? We are her uncles.

220
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,092
That's right. We are Yeon-ju's uncles.

221
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,138
DIRECTOR HAN SUNG-HYE

222
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,183
The date for the reinspection
Yumin gave us is very soon.

223
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,893
Should I ask them to postpone it?

224
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,520
Just wait.

225
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,355
Any word on Lee Bong-sik?

226
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,108
Looks like the lead prosecutor
is putting off the investigation.

227
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,238
Didn't they dig up the old case
to track him down?

228
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,658
I thought they would go public
with the list right away.

229
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,703
-Who's the prosecutor in charge?
-I'll find out, ma'am.

230
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,622
Contact the prosecutor directly
and take care of it.

231
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,667
We don't want Lee Bong-sik
to say useless stuff

232
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,044
because we can't have a scandal
before the merger.

233
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,506
Mr. Alex Chang who is handling the merger

234
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,551
is a member of your family.

235
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,096
Wouldn't it be faster
to use your relationship with him?

236
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,099
"Family?"

237
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,060
What are you talking about?

238
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,855
He would hate to admit
that my father is his uncle.

239
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:11,655
So you and Yeon-ju
are just next-door neighbors?

240
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,158
Yes, that's correct.

241
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,785
Do people commonly visit

242
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,580
their neighbor's grandmother's
cremation niche these days?

243
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,751
And I believe I witnessed
a lovers' quarrel earlier.

244
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,252
My goodness.

245
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,838
Stop sticking your nose
into their love life.

246
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,840
That's not important now.

247
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,342
Then what is important now?

248
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:36,555
Do you own that place?

249
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,099
Pardon?

250
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,520
I'm on a month-to-month leaseâ€¦

251
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,646
Month-to-month?

252
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,858
Oh, dear. Yeon-ju is on a long-term lease.

253
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,152
The rent for that place
is probably quite high.

254
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,489
You need to save every penny
when you're young.

255
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,283
If you spend
that much money every month on rentâ€¦

256
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,536
Everyone lives like that
before they get married.

257
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,998
He'll buckle down and stop spending
after he gets married.

258
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:07,461
My goodness. Yeon-ju hasn't told you
about her father, right?

259
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:13,759
I'm not sure what she's told you,
but he loves his daughter very much.

260
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,595
Yes, I could tell.

261
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,389
You've met him?

262
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,975
Yes.

263
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,938
That means you and Yeon-ju
are very serious.

264
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,107
No, it's not that.

265
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,191
Come on!

266
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:33,737
You've met her father
and visited the cremation niche with her.

267
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,949
Il-yong now has nothing more to wish for.

268
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,034
"Il-yong?"

269
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,662
Isn't his name Kang Myung-guk?

270
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,498
My gosh! You even know his name?

271
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,503
Il-yong is his nickname.

272
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,757
When he was young,

273
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,719
a big fire broke out at his home,
so he got a burn on his arm.

274
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,181
That's how the dragon tattoo on his arm
became disfigured.

275
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,684
Hence the nickname,
Il-yong, as in "disfigured dragon".

276
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,436
That's why we started calling him Il-yong.

277
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:10,232
He's still so traumatized
that he even hates the word, "fire".

278
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,942
It always gets him in trouble.

279
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,986
Stop talking nonsense.

280
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,572
Where in Seopyung do you need to go?

281
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,201
Drop me off at
the Seopyung District Prosecutors' Office.

282
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,246
Let's hurry.

283
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,708
TAMNA FISH MARKET

284
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,920
I kept asking him why he did it,

285
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,089
but he wouldn't say.

286
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,758
Whenever I was shunned, picked on,

287
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,678
and got fired from my part-time jobs

288
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,013
because of him,

289
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,474
I thought I'd feel less wronged

290
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,018
if I at least knew the reason

291
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,603
why he had to do such a thing.

292
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,940
I asked him
because I thought it may still help.

293
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,235
You're not the type to just take it.

294
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,029
Right.

295
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,489
I was poor, but not just poor.

296
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,533
I was confidently poor.

297
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,993
Being poor isn't a crime.

298
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,623
But being a thug, arsonist and murderer

299
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,499
are crimes.

300
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,045
You can't add "confident"
in front of those words.

301
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,676
Forget it. What can I do?

302
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,637
My grandma said

303
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,973
a criminal's parent and child
suffering like that

304
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,683
is also a punishment for the criminal.

305
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,021
How could a prosecutor say that?
Guilt lies with the perpetrator.

306
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:35,901
One can only be punished
for crimes identified in the statutes.

307
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,904
According to the Korean Constitution,

308
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:43,909
no one in this country may be punished
for an act committed by a relative.

309
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:47,537
People who've never suffered
are always so naive.

310
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,581
Look. For people like us,

311
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,959
flying and things like that
aren't miracles.

312
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,712
A convicted felon's daughter
becoming a civil servant,

313
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,632
people hanging out and eating with me,

314
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,885
becoming friends with a rich boy like you.

315
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,679
Those are miracles.

316
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,516
What did Han Seung-wook say?

317
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,185
About what?

318
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,688
What did he say when you told him?

319
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,817
Why do you want to know?

320
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,487
Do you think he told me to drop dead
because I'm his enemy's daughter?

321
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,533
He's coming soon.

322
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,618
He wants to see
the case file from back then,

323
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,453
so help him out.

324
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,414
Are you okay?

325
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,670
I'm fine although you found out.
And you're a close friend.

326
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,088
Who cares if he knows?

327
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,759
I was always uncomfortable with him,
unlike with you.

328
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,678
I'm out.

329
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:51,643
I'm comfortable and he's uncomfortable?

330
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:56,565
Being uncomfortable is very dangerous.

331
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,949
How did he get here so quickly?

332
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,254
Excuse me.

333
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,217
You should let her be
when she's like that.

334
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,471
She's too proud to let people comfort her.

335
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,645
I'm not in a good mood today.

336
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,981
So tell me where the original is

337
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,066
and go.

338
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,609
This isn't what you promised!

339
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,861
-You said you'd get me out if I testified!
-Hey.

340
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,529
You've pulled cons all your life.

341
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,115
How can we take your word for it?
We need evidence.

342
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,785
You said you don't believe me.

343
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,455
Why must I believe you
and share that with you?

344
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,208
Either find me a boat to stow away

345
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,043
or put money into a Swiss account.

346
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,669
I need to see evidence

347
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,130
to decide whether or not
I give you what you ask for.

348
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,256
What?

349
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,676
Do you think this is a gambling joint?

350
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,428
How dare you make bets?

351
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,306
You're the one betting right now.

352
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,809
You may have arrested me,

353
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,853
but I have the upper hand.

354
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:21,566
You need me to give you the real list
so that you can stop

355
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,070
living your double life
as Hanju Group's daughter-in-law.

356
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:30,534
You're the one who will be in a pickle
if I change my mind.

357
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,578
You, Prosecutor Cho Yeon-ju

358
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,997
as well as Chairman Kang Mi-na.

359
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,668
Why, you twerp.

360
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,880
This pot looks so natural
calling the kettle black.

361
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,006
Hey!

362
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,009
You make it sound like
you did nothing wrong,

363
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,553
but I had you locked up.

364
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,513
Do you know how many years

365
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,974
you deserve
for lynching an active prosecutor?

366
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,725
You should be repenting!

367
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:03,024
Anyway! Give me a plan
that guarantees an out for me.

368
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,278
-That way, I'll give you the list--
-Hey, Bong-sik!

369
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,446
A plan?

370
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,201
You must think you're someone important,

371
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,912
but you're just a pawn on a chessboard.

372
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,456
If I don't move you,
you can't do a single thing.

373
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,460
Do you think I'd just take it
if you change your mind?

374
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,713
Do you really think
I didn't plan for that?

375
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,725
I don't have a plan.

376
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,561
Darn it. He didn't figure it out, did he?

377
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,355
Should I just strike a deal with Chief?

378
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:46,484
No. I need the original list
to make it worthwhile

379
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,069
for the chief to take the bait.

380
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,663
It's me.

381
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,041
So? Can I trust you?

382
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,793
Of course.

383
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,713
All of our boys
who are strong and can fight

384
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:10,133
are in prisons or detention centers.

385
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,762
Our organization is a mess,

386
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,432
but you've totally lucked out.

387
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:20,936
He's a real weasel,
so you can't put your guard down.

388
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,230
Don't just keep him safe from others.

389
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,857
Tell them to make sure
he doesn't do anything stupid.

390
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,817
Fraud, intimidation, assault.

391
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,820
I have different types of guys
spread out everywhere,

392
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,199
so don't you worry your little head.

393
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:15,407
Don't worry about the detention center.
I have people everywhere in there.

394
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,409
You want me to trust prison guards?

395
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,618
Not prison guards.

396
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,662
They're everywhere in the slammer.

397
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,706
I won't let you get stabbed,
so just stay there.

398
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,085
Is she protecting me or abusing her power?

399
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,798
-Let's go!
-Go inside.

400
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,886
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

401
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,722
Ms. Han Sung-hye from Hanju Hotel

402
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,890
-wishes to speak with you.
-Who?

403
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,685
Why?

404
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,396
-I don't know. Do you want--
-Tell her I'm not here.

405
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,647
Don't put her through.

406
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:54,112
She may call through different routes,
so don't connect me to any outside calls.

407
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,584
You can't reach them?

408
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,754
No. I've tried to contact them
through other prosecutors,

409
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,339
but no one can get through.

410
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,632
What are they up to?

411
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:27,771
You have a new cellmate.

412
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,250
Once you leave,
never step foot in this country again.

413
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,337
-Live a quiet life.
-Got it. Fine.

414
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,590
What a strange world.

415
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:57,175
High and mighty conglomerates

416
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:00,261
are associated with thugs
in the outskirts like Seopyung.

417
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,724
Don't go around running your mouth.

418
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:29,124
PROSECUTOR AN YU-JUN

419
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,208
Thank you.

420
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,628
Everyone's testimony

421
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,839
is perfectly consistent.

422
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,590
Everything points to Kang Myung-guk.

423
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,135
There isn't a single evidence
to the contrary.

424
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:44,681
Who prepared these records?

425
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,975
The police officers
at Seopyung Police at the time.

426
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,518
No one is there anymore.

427
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:53,189
-And the prosecutor who investigated?
-He's the chief prosecutor at the Central.

428
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,609
Did you look into it all already?

429
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,864
Yes, I did.

430
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:07,746
Last time when I came,
you said you were busy meeting your quota,

431
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,497
so I thought you weren't interested.

432
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,000
Do you know

433
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,545
who Kang Myung-guk is?

434
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,133
I happened to find out.

435
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,594
It's because of Prosecutor Cho.

436
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,182
What is your relationship with her?

437
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,733
I have no reason
to answer personal questions.

438
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,737
I was wondering
if you had feelings for her.

439
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,238
"Feelings?"

440
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:45,992
Wellâ€¦

441
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,536
I don't think so.

442
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,790
This is just a habit.

443
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,875
An old habit of mine.

444
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,295
A habit as a prosecutor, is that it?

445
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,888
Are you going out for lunch, Chief?

446
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,057
Not really.

447
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:13,102
Since I became the chief, I can't even eat
without worrying about what others think.

448
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,562
I understand.

449
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,481
You can call me anytime.

450
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,149
I'm here for you.

451
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,237
Are you sure you have time for that?

452
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,364
Shouldn't you

453
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:27,325
investigate Lee Bong-sik
and put him behind bars soon?

454
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:32,205
I'm sure he's racking his brain right now
to reduce his sentence.

455
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,707
He'll be happy
to hand over the list and everything.

456
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,251
What are you waiting for?

457
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,585
Don't worry.

458
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:41,631
I'm just waiting for the perfect timing

459
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,758
to catch all the bad guys at once.

460
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,472
Do a good job.

461
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,851
There are strange rumors
going around about you.

462
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,895
I can't trust you anymore.

463
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,106
You mean the rumors about whistle-blowing?

464
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,860
Chief, don't you know how I am?

465
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,862
Whistle-blowing isn't really my thing.

466
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:07,448
You can't fire a gun without knowing
where the bullet is going.

467
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,117
What if the wrong person gets shot?

468
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,537
You don't have to worry. Enjoy your lunch.

469
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,749
Go on in.

470
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,085
Me? Yes, sir.

471
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,296
Please.

472
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,724
PROVIDING A FUTURE IN WHICH
ORDER AND HUMAN RIGHTS COEXIST

473
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,012
Gosh, I'm too anxious.

474
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,476
Sir!

475
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,229
-What is it?
-Can I talk to the chief?

476
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,775
ESTABLISHMENT OF LAW AND ORDER

477
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:24,817
What do you want?

478
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,236
Can I go out and meet the prosecutor?

479
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,655
I have something to tell her.

480
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,657
Do you think this is a hotel?

481
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,619
Wait until the prosecutor summons you.
You can't go out just because you want to.

482
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,081
Then please at least call her.
Say I have something to tell her.

483
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,711
-Hello?
-This is Jungbu Detention Center.

484
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:47,465
Inmate number 3678, Lee Bong-sik,
wants to talk to Ms. Cho.

485
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,050
Hold, please.

486
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,428
The detention center
is asking for Ms. Cho.

487
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,430
The detention center?

488
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:57,433
Ms. Cho doesn't want to talk
to any outsiders for the time being.

489
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,189
The prosecutor must be busy.

490
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:06,192
But there will be a questioning soon.

491
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,986
You can meet her then.

492
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:16,119
"He set fire to the factory
after getting unfairly fired."

493
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:20,748
Back then, all the circumstances
seemed to point to him.

494
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,585
Since he even confessed,
no one raised any question.

495
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,879
But you're being suspicious?

496
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:31,926
If Hanju Group faked the death,
they may have faked the culprit as well.

497
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,261
That's my guess.

498
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,806
Also, when I met with him,
I felt something was off.

499
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,017
And this man turns out to be

500
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,268
Ms. Cho's father?

501
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:46,024
-You must've been shocked.
-You bet.

502
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,819
Usually, she talks back to me
every time I say something.

503
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,488
But this time, all she said
was that she was sorry.

504
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,158
She felt like a different person.

505
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,161
Why don't you do as she says?

506
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,997
Try to understand her position.

507
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,124
Are you telling me to cut ties with her?

508
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,752
If you're planning to continue
to dig into this case,

509
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,587
wouldn't that be best for both of you?

510
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,629
Again?

511
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,048
Pardon?

512
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:13,551
Am I supposed to accept
every decision made for me?

513
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,516
I had never thought Hanju Group was mine.

514
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,770
But everyone told me that I was the heir

515
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,148
and that I couldn't do
all the things I wanted to.

516
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,609
But then one day,

517
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:34,280
they told me Hanju Group was my uncle's
and I should forget about inheriting it.

518
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,324
Mi-na was the same.

519
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,577
Everyone told me
I was supposed to marry her.

520
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,497
When I finally began to like her,

521
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,124
they suddenly told me I couldn't.

522
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,419
Am I supposed to do that again?

523
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,172
If she wants to cut ties with me,

524
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,300
am I supposed to just accept it?

525
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,553
By the way,

526
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,557
I don't think I'm the person
who should be hearing this.

527
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,892
Why are you saying this to me?

528
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:08,397
Rest up.

529
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,983
I need to drive Ms. Kang home.

530
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:38,219
Any news on Kang Mi-na?

531
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:44,183
Lee Bong-sik said
he smuggled her into China,

532
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,644
so we're searching for her
following that route,

533
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,437
but there's something strange.

534
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,774
After a certain point,
she disappeared without a trace.

535
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,901
She vanished into thin air.

536
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,820
So I'm wondering,

537
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,823
could it be that

538
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,033
Lee Bong-sik lied?

539
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,579
That's what he asked me to relay to you.

540
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:05,663
I mean Mr. Han.

541
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,456
Oh.

542
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,667
Lee once smuggled himself
out of the country

543
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,545
with the help of a gang in Seopyung.

544
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:15,339
So I'm suspecting she used the same route.

545
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:19,051
I'll ask Seopyung DPO to ask around.

546
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,264
Should I relay that to Mr. Han?

547
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,266
Yes, please.

548
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,977
You could talk to each other directly.

549
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,229
What are you doing now?

550
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,232
And why do you look so down?

551
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,693
I'm sure you've already heard.

552
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,945
I don't deserve to be
so full of myself anymore.

553
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,697
Why not?

554
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,532
I like that about you.

555
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,410
You don't have to be perfect
to be confident about yourself.

556
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,288
What did you do so wrong?

557
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,832
You were just unlucky
to be born to such parents.

558
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:53,461
My father drank and hit people
all the time. He was a mess.

559
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,795
But look how I turned out.

560
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,422
I even passed the bar exam

561
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:59,508
and became the Head of Legal
at Hanju Group.

562
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,720
Once you're over 30,

563
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:06,057
you should stop benefiting from
or blaming your parents.

564
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,603
Be confident
regardless of what your father did.

565
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,775
Are you going to go home like that?

566
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,111
-Mr. No.
-What?

567
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,864
You're one wise man.

568
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,619
I know.

569
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:32,875
You're right. There's no reason
I should be hiding in the corner.

570
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:36,712
Who knows what that darn family
is cooking up right now?

571
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,716
Come on! You can do this!

572
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,761
See?

573
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,514
Even before you get homeâ€¦

574
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,237
What's going on?

575
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,115
You've got some nerve showing up here.

576
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,161
Look who's talking.

577
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:14,417
Guess who's been watching Kang Mi-na
the most closely so far.

578
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,420
It's me, Han Sung-woon's lover.

579
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,839
Over the past decade,

580
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:23,884
I've been closely following
every single thing you do.

581
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,970
As a news anchor
with more than a decade's experience,

582
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:30,141
I've become quite an expert
when it comes to speech.

583
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:33,894
Similarly built people
tend to have similar voices.

584
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:38,691
But every person
has a unique way of speaking.

585
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,776
You can never fake that.

586
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,195
I've been thinking about it,

587
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,781
and the person I talked to in the garage

588
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,116
was definitely not Kang Mi-na.

589
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:52,246
Deny it if you can.

590
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,420
What are you doing right now?
You should know better than this.

591
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,464
What about you?

592
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:04,258
Are you also being fooled by her

593
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,385
or are you fooling everyone with her?

594
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,680
That's enough.

595
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,684
Glad you're here.

596
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,978
No one would feel more betrayed than you.

597
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,731
You're such a bad judge of character.

598
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,316
You're right.

599
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,234
I've totally misjudged you.

600
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,363
Do you think I can't tell

601
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,031
whether my wife is real

602
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,991
when I eat and sleep with her every day?

603
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:33,245
Your false hope
must be making you delusional.

604
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,457
Stop talking nonsense.
You don't even have any evidence.

605
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,251
Hey, I am the proof.

606
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,961
Then I am the proof

607
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,339
of your indecent private life
for the past decade.

608
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:46,884
If I disclose what I know,
whose reputation will be hurt?

609
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,599
-Go inside, honey.
-What?

610
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:54,767
You can go too, Mr. No.

611
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,644
I'll head in after this woman leaves.

612
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,870
That fool.

613
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,457
He doesn't even know whether or not
he's living with his real wife.

614
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,959
Look at him taking my side.

615
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,795
All for the sake of business.

616
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:29,635
If you want to keep your job
as a news anchor, you'd better watch out.

617
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:32,138
If you try to mess with my wife
one more time,

618
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,141
I'll go public with our relationship
and take you down.

619
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,696
Come on. You must be tired.

620
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,990
-Do you have to leave early again?
-Yes.

621
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,284
-Really? What time?
-Now.

622
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,077
Bye.

623
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,582
That arrogant littleâ€¦

624
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,467
MEDICINE

625
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,471
CHO YEON-JU

626
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,432
Cho Yeon-ju?

627
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,565
That stupid girl.

628
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,401
How dare she try to hold me back?

629
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,450
Is Mi-na not home yet?

630
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,620
She's very busy these days.

631
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,413
She won't be home until late.

632
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,958
You're asking every five minutes.

633
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,585
Clearly, you're anxious.

634
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,587
What are you talking about?

635
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,422
Just because I'm home all the time,

636
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,216
it doesn't mean
I don't know what's going on.

637
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,093
That's right.

638
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,513
Those who like to spend
but can't earn a single penny

639
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,015
are always more in tune
with what's going on.

640
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:01,769
Don't pick on Mi-na
for no reason, Sung-hye.

641
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,731
Are you saying I picked on her
when she did nothing wrong?

642
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,652
You tell us, Ms. Kim.

643
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,654
Is there really nothing wrong with Mi-na?

644
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,572
I don't know.

645
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,538
Ms. Kim, I know that
you're older than all of us,

646
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:24,542
but you seem to have forgotten
the fact that you're hired help.

647
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,801
-Ma'am.
-What is it?

648
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:38,389
Remember that day in 2001,
when it was pouring outside?

649
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,224
What happened when you overdosed

650
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,934
on sleeping pills
and fainted in the bathroom?

651
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:46,021
No one cared about me
and didn't even know that I had fainted,

652
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:50,150
but you broke open the door
and rushed me to the hospital.

653
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,903
Thanks to you, I am still alive.

654
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:54,613
Sung-mi.

655
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,782
You must remember the 2006 World Cup.

656
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,327
The time when I lied
to my parents and went out?

657
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,832
Had you not tailed me,
I would've been kidnapped by those freaks.

658
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:06,917
And Ms. Heo.

659
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,503
Do you remember the late summer of 2014?

660
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,590
You still have the underwear I got
from the daughter-in-law

661
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,091
of the Roil Group family, right?

662
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,051
Yes, of course.

663
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,345
The one who gave birth to four sons.

664
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,431
Thanks to her underwear,
I conceived Sun-woo.

665
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,474
But it's been useless ever since then.

666
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:28,063
Ms. Han Sung-hye,
shall I talk about you too?

667
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:42,911
Now, please get out if you're done eating.

668
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,166
Mi-na.

669
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:56,383
Mi-na.

670
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,678
I rarely see you these days.

671
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:02,389
You've been asking for me
since earlier. What's up?

672
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,059
Earlier? When?

673
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,604
Did you not ask for me?

674
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,315
Anyway, what's up?

675
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,108
You have entrusted Seung-wook

676
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,778
with the full authority
to handle the merger,

677
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,988
but he's now requesting a reinspection.

678
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:22,993
Right. He's more of an expert than I am,
and I'm very busy at the moment.

679
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:27,498
He's going overboard
because of what happened in the past.

680
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,918
Can you meet him and try to caution him?

681
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,336
No, I can't.

682
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:33,921
What?

683
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,801
Hey, I don't believe the rumors.

684
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:41,637
Just let him know when you see him
for work-related stuff.

685
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,347
I have no reason to see him again.

686
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,601
Mi-na, are you really going
to be like this?

687
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,770
What are you doing?

688
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,316
-Spare me a minute.
-Sure.

689
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,735
Not you.

690
00:44:58,737 --> 00:44:59,905
You.

691
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:11,959
What on earth did you do
that Yumin is demanding a reinspection?

692
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,045
Dad, are you sure
you've talked with the chief prosecutor?

693
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:17,172
Because they're not stepping in,

694
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,633
we may have to agree to do
this useless reinspection.

695
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:22,928
What? Like I said,
I already spoke with the chief prosecutor.

696
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:26,265
Do you expect me to plead
with a mere prosecutor?

697
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:30,227
You talked as though
you'd take over Yumin Hotel in no time.

698
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:35,941
You brought this upon yourself.
Can't you do your job better?

699
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,701
You've been coming home every day.

700
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,494
What are you up to this time?

701
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,872
I'm not like you.

702
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,957
Not everything I do has a hidden agenda.

703
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:54,877
Sung-hye.

704
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,631
Usually, those in my position

705
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,509
would compete against their sister
to inherit the family company.

706
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,887
But I've never done that

707
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,556
because I'm very objective
when it comes to myself.

708
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,684
You should learn to see yourself
more objectively too.

709
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,352
Thanks to me,

710
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,771
people think you're more capable
than you actually are.

711
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:15,981
Am I wrong?

712
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,403
Now that Mi-na's situation has changed,
you're finally showing your true colors.

713
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:25,824
That's an asset too, right?
It's something you can't do.

714
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,243
Soâ€¦

715
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,914
stop looking down on me

716
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,207
whenever you see me.

717
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:45,427
Everyone is treating me like this
because of that darn hotel?

718
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:03,320
I'm just waiting for the perfect timing

719
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,113
to catch all the bad guys at once.

720
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,617
Who are the bad guys?

721
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,329
Chief, don't you know how I am?

722
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,373
Whistle-blowing isn't really my thing.

723
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:17,918
You can't fire a gun
without knowing where the bullet is going.

724
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,461
What if the wrong person gets shot?

725
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:28,720
So what? Is she planning
to stab me in the back?

726
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,517
Lee Bong-sik's been caught,
so it should be all over the news.

727
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,726
How come it's so quiet?

728
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,953
Can I really just sit back and do nothing?

729
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:08,927
My children are busy listing excuses
whenever anything happens.

730
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,389
And those prosecutors just become arrogant

731
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,142
when I go out of my way
to treat them well.

732
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:16,852
Goodness.

733
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,207
Hello?

734
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:41,877
Yes. I understand.

735
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:48,383
Detention centers aren't graves.

736
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:53,055
Why do they always try
to bury their crimes here?

737
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,848
Darn it.

738
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:59,770
PROVIDING A FUTURE IN WHICH
ORDER AND HUMAN RIGHTS COEXIST

739
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,817
Errand boy.

740
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,656
My stomach hurts.

741
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,950
Get me a laxative.

742
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,535
Bring me all of it.

743
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,036
All of it?

744
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,996
My stomach hurts too much.

745
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,540
I want to go to the hospital.

746
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,918
They usually give us medicine
and tell us to ride it out.

747
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:06,670
But my stomach hurts too much.

748
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,839
I want to see a doctor.

749
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:09,881
Okay.

750
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,592
Thanks.

751
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,948
I took so many already.
Why am I not feeling it yet?

752
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,870
I should be going like mad by now.

753
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,558
What's wrong?

754
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,769
-Hey.
-Stop it.

755
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,065
Hey.

756
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:12,110
Help me!

757
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,820
-Hey.
-Help me!

758
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:18,658
What did you eat?

759
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,452
-Hey.
-What did you eat?

760
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:23,705
Hey! Hey, 3678! Wake up!

761
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,165
Hey.

762
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:28,126
-What did he eat?
-What's wrong with him?

763
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,117
I think I ate somethingâ€¦

764
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,597
Help!

765
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:29,896
Let go of me! Help!

766
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,745
Today's the deadline.

767
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,164
Are the documents for reinspection
not ready yet?

768
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,585
Wait a few minutes. They'll be here soon.

769
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,109
Radio it in.

770
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:19,237
Lee Bong-sik, who had committed
a large art con and fled

771
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:22,240
three years ago, was arrested recently.

772
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:25,368
However, Lee, who was being held
in a detention center,

773
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:28,288
committed suicide and has died.

774
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,332
In his pocket

775
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:32,626
was a list of what appears to be clients

776
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:33,960
from three years ago.

777
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:38,798
The list included people
of high class and status,

778
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:43,053
including Chairman K, who was recently
summoned by a prosecutors' office.

779
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,180
Police are questioning why this listâ€¦

780
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:46,431
Oh, dear.

781
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:49,225
Doesn't she mean Chairman Kang Mi-na?

782
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:53,063
This isn't the time for you to be hereâ€¦

783
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,331
This is absurd.

784
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,917
When I questioned him,
he showed no suicidal tendencies.

785
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,086
When you brought Lee Bong-sik in,

786
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,296
what happened in the interrogation room?

787
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,464
What?

788
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:22,050
What did you do
after turning off the camera?

789
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,094
Did you coerce him?

790
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:27,597
Why didn't you leave any records
of the interrogation?

791
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,641
What did you two talk about?

792
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:31,476
Is that why he died?

793
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:32,978
-Chief!
-What?

794
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,107
What, can't I yell?

795
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,569
What are you doing
in front of all these people?

796
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:43,279
I'm sorry.

797
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,410
I meanâ€¦

798
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:53,123
He wrote a suicide note
and hanged himself.

799
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:56,251
It's not like he leaves behind any family.

800
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,045
He wanted to pay the price for his crime

801
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,296
and die.

802
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,465
That suicide note is suspicious.

803
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,592
He died as soon as
he was sent to solitary.

804
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,469
It was clearly not a suicide.

805
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,597
-We need an autopsy.
-Hey.

806
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,809
Don't you get me?

807
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:16,187
So what if it wasn't a suicide?

808
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:20,191
Don't make things worse.

809
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:21,985
Bury it.

810
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,211
Okay.

811
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:47,218
-Is Ms. Cho Yeon-ju out?
-Do you have an appointment?

812
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:49,554
No.

813
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,097
I don't think she'll come back today.

814
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,079
I knew you'd be here.

815
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:16,414
You always come here
when you feel cornered.

816
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,335
You annoyingly smart punk.

817
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,545
Is there anything you don't know?

818
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:25,173
You made me this way.

819
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:29,427
You never call anyone for help,
so I became a master at finding you.

820
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,845
Yu-jun.

821
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,973
Just until yesterday, I thought

822
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:39,229
the universe was on my side
and let me catch Lee Bong-sik.

823
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,272
I was excited about going to Chief

824
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,232
and saying

825
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:46,861
"You colluded with Hanju
and let Lee Bong-sik go, right?"

826
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,613
And following up with

827
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:51,616
"Where is that hit-and-run killer
that you let go a long time ago?

828
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:55,411
The one who killed my grandma?"

829
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:59,874
And I was excited
about investigating her case.

830
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:06,005
How could this happen in just one day?

831
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,759
Was that why

832
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,761
you had been after Lee Bong-sik?

833
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:16,015
This is no time to drink.

834
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,476
If the list gets out,

835
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,146
you may have to summon
and investigate Kang Mi-na.

836
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:22,897
What will you do?

837
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,482
What else?

838
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,943
I'll ask the questions
and I'll answer them.

839
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,069
How easy is that?

840
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:32,031
Stop drinking.

841
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,701
Don't you need to go home tonight?

842
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:37,078
What if you slip and make a mistake?

843
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,663
A mistake?

844
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:41,458
Hey, who cares if I make one mistake?

845
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,711
I worked my tail off
to become a prosecutor

846
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,796
and slaved away at Seopyung

847
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,466
and jumped through hoops
to get to Seoul Central.

848
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,217
While digging into Chief's corruption,

849
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,846
I finally caught the big fish,
Lee Bong-sik.

850
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:58,683
And where should I begin now?

851
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,186
Do you even know how I feel?

852
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,397
I'm back to square one.

853
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,024
Do you know how that feels?

854
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:09,027
Of course not.

855
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:13,698
I may actually know how that feels.

856
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,660
That's what I do with you all the time.

857
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,415
Hey, not again.

858
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:25,043
You've done enough.

859
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:40,433
Gosh, you must have
high standards for women.

860
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,685
That means you're really smart.

861
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:48,399
You can never drink with me again.

862
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,902
Never in your lifeâ€¦

863
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,780
We'll just work together.

864
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:58,785
Let's drink.

865
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:02,247
Cheers.

866
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:12,131
Since I never drink with you,

867
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,884
did you decide to show up
when I'm drinking?

868
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,011
I guess there's not much to do
at the Central these days.

869
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,514
You obviously have too much time.

870
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:22,267
That's why you come
all the way here and talk nonsense.

871
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,395
This is not okay.

872
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:30,608
Hello? Is this Seoul Central DPO?

873
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,111
Let me talk to the chief!

874
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:37,115
Why are the prosecutors
slacking off these days?

875
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,961
Do you still have feelings for me?

876
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:54,507
Ma'am, I need a glass.

877
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,933
What is he talking about?
The call cannot be completed.

878
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:38,968
I have no feelings for you.

879
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:42,305
Feelings change all the time.

880
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,349
They can even disappear.

881
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:48,645
So I stopped

882
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:51,981
having any feelings for you long ago.

883
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,321
To me,

884
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:00,615
you're a habit now.

885
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,201
A habit.

886
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:10,541
A habit

887
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,545
becomes a part of you. It never goes away.

888
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,936
If you know how I feel,

889
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,313
can you hold my hand?

890
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:25,783
I'm getting too good at this.

891
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:32,206
Just by looking at your face,
I know you're turning me down.

892
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:38,421
Still, you're becoming
more and more rational.

893
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:43,217
Before, you asked me to give you a hug
if I was going to turn you down.

894
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,305
I knew holding hands
wouldn't be too much to ask.

895
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:49,640
You slapped me in the face
when I asked for a hug.

896
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,810
Still, I slapped you with my left hand.

897
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,945
Asking someone out in a way
that makes the person uncomfortable

898
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,073
doesn't feel right.

899
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:11,704
That's why I waited.

900
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:16,083
When I saw you with Mr. Han at Seopyung,

901
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:18,252
I realized something.

902
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:24,175
That I might lose you for good.

903
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:27,845
Yu-jun.

904
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:31,891
I think you should go home.

905
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:37,688
It doesn't feel right

906
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,775
drinking and whining
with someone I just turned down.

907
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:44,153
It would only be okay in Hollywood.

908
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:08,970
You never give me a chance, do you?

909
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,474
Don't drink too much and go home.

910
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:22,233
-Bye.
-See you.

911
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:34,078
Gosh, I really have no one to call now.

912
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:42,837
This is why drinking alone is nice.

913
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,672
Whatever happens tonight,

914
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:47,717
no one will know anything
as long as I forget everything.

915
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:53,014
Ride your guitar like a motorcycle

916
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:57,351
Ride your guitar like a motorcycle

917
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:01,856
Ride your guitar like a motorcycle

918
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:05,818
Play your motorcycle like a guitar

919
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:07,862
Is this it?

920
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:10,448
Or this?

921
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,117
There it is!

922
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,343
I need to get in.

923
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:33,471
But the door won't open.

924
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:36,724
Maybe this isn't my place.

925
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:38,601
That's right.

926
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:41,062
I'm supposed to go to Kang Mi-na's house.

927
01:05:43,564 --> 01:05:45,816
Father! Mother!

928
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,152
Husband! Sisters-in-law!

929
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:51,489
Open the door for me! Open it!

930
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:55,451
Why won't they open the door?

931
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,666
I live in two different places,

932
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,752
have two different phones,

933
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,713
and have two different jobs.

934
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:12,969
Where am I supposed to go?

935
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:18,349
SEND SOS MESSAGES

936
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:19,558
ADD RECIPIENT

937
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:22,687
I'll come to your side right away
if something happens.

938
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,541
SOS MESSAGE BEING SENT

939
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:51,882
SOS MESSAGE

940
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:53,259
KANG MI-NA, SOS! I NEED HELP!

941
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:01,559
Yeon-ju!

942
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:03,769
Yeon-ju!

943
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,439
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

944
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:09,900
Hey, what are you doing here?

945
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:11,402
How did you find me?

946
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,780
I want to go have another drink with you.

947
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,616
-Let's go for a drink.
-Let me help you up.

948
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,410
-Let's go!
-Easy.

949
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:21,871
Your place is here.

950
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:25,249
That's right. This is my place.

951
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:30,546
Don't look! I said, don't look!

952
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:32,423
I won't. Go ahead.

953
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:35,342
Ding dong.

954
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,392
Darn it. What's wrong with my hand?

955
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,436
You. Do it right.

956
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:46,562
Okay.

957
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,108
I'll press it for you
since you need to go in.

958
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:55,988
No! How dare you ask me for the code?

959
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,408
An Yu-jun presses it on his own
and goes in as he pleases.

960
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:00,785
What's the big deal?

961
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:02,912
You have a point.

962
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:07,458
Gosh. Okay. Fine.

963
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:13,464
Guess my door code

964
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:14,548
My code

965
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:24,225
Okay. Let's see how many tries it takes.

966
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:29,438
-Is it your birthday?
-My birthday?

967
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:34,068
Like my birthday is so special.

968
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:37,822
It's not like anyone's ever celebrated it.

969
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:43,911
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

970
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:46,580
We should celebrate. Come here.

971
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:51,877
Thenâ€¦ Is it

972
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,379
an ex-boyfriend's birthday?

973
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:56,882
Wrong. An ex-boyfriend? Give me a break.

974
01:08:56,966 --> 01:09:00,010
How could someone from the ghetto like me

975
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:03,013
pass the bar exam with a boyfriend?

976
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:05,599
If I went out with a boyfriend and stuff,

977
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:08,435
how could I get revenge? Seriously.

978
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:11,105
That's good.

979
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:14,817
You'll never guess it.

980
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:19,655
It's the date I must never forget
for the rest of my life.

981
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:22,825
It's something in here

982
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,663
that I can never ever forget.

983
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:37,923
This is my grandmother.

984
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:41,760
The day she passed away
is the same as your birthday.

985
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,516
CHOI SEUNG-OK, 16 SEPT 1939 - 2 OCT 2007

986
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,886
How did we get inside?

987
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:25,888
Because I entered the code.

988
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:28,641
How did you know the code?
I didn't tell you.

989
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:30,184
I have my ways.

990
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:32,394
-That's incredible.
-Careful.

991
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:34,897
-Sit here.
-I am flabbergasted.

992
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,941
Howâ€¦ Gosh.

993
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:13,644
What are you doing here? Get out.

994
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:17,856
Why are you like this alone?

995
01:11:18,565 --> 01:11:19,483
Where's An Yu-jun?

996
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:21,568
Yu-jun?

997
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:24,154
Why would he be here?

998
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:26,156
I sent him home earlier.

999
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:28,993
-You sent him home?
-Of course.

1000
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,454
That punk came when I didn't ask him to

1001
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:34,832
and kept saying stupid things.

1002
01:11:34,915 --> 01:11:39,336
I'm very strict about setting boundaries.

1003
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:41,880
You should go too.

1004
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:45,509
Get out of my face. Go.

1005
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:52,308
I won't go.

1006
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:54,560
What?

1007
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:57,396
I won't go.

1008
01:11:57,896 --> 01:11:59,898
I came because you asked me to.

1009
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:04,570
Why are you telling me to go?

1010
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:08,615
I won't leave because I'm told to,
or let people take things from me.

1011
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,535
That is why I came to Korea.

1012
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:18,292
Whose daughter you are, whom you resemble,

1013
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:21,211
who likes youâ€¦

1014
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:23,547
None of that matters to me.

1015
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,886
I'm going to go for what I want
and do what I want to do.

1016
01:12:29,553 --> 01:12:31,347
I won't let anyone take from me again.

1017
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:43,961
EPILOGUE

1018
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:53,470
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA PASSPORT

1019
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:56,432
Please remove your sunglasses.

1020
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:12,072
There is a rumor

1021
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:14,032
that the list of art clients

1022
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,701
found in Lee Bong-sik's pocket

1023
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:18,328
includes Yumin Group's chairman,
Kang Mi-na,

1024
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:20,789
who caused a disturbance
with her reckless driving

1025
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:23,167
not too long ago.

1026
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,751
The public sentiment toward her

1027
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:27,337
was very negative due to this incident.

1028
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,089
It still is.

1029
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:32,468
Chairman Kang Mi-na is remaining silent.

1030
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:34,511
What are your thoughts?

1031
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:37,473
It was all over the news
three years ago as well.

1032
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:40,767
Once Lee Bong-sik was arrestedâ€¦

1033
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:45,856
I've lost my mind.

1034
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:48,442
It's okay. I'm used to
not remembering things.

1035
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:51,403
I can handle it.

1036
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:54,698
-Maybe Lee Bong-sik's death shook her.
-What's wrong with her?

1037
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:57,367
All of this happened because of you.

1038
01:14:57,451 --> 01:15:00,787
I'm not asking you for consent.
I'm just relaying a message.

1039
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:05,542
We'll close Lee Bong-sik's matter
with Kang Mi-na then call it even. Okay?

1040
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:09,213
Don't tell me anything.
I'll have to relay it if you do.

1041
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:13,091
Someone told me you were
capable of ditching Sung-hye

1042
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,635
and joining hands with me.

1043
01:15:14,718 --> 01:15:17,721
Should I tell you why the two of you

1044
01:15:17,804 --> 01:15:19,306
can't get Chairman Kang Mi-na?
