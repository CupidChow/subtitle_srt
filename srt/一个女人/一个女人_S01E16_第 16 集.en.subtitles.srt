1
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,126
Why is she coming here?

2
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,861
Darn it.

3
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,748
HANJU HOTEL

4
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,047
There's more.

5
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,115
Hand all of them over to the police.

6
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:14,801
INAUGURATION FOR CHAIRMAN HAN SUNG-HYE

7
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,978
I'll keep it short.

8
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,939
This is the beginning of the new Hanju

9
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,108
that I've always dreamed of.

10
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,918
Why was Seung-wook in there?

11
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,880
I couldn't find any excuse
to kick him out.

12
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,172
What about the others?

13
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,009
The two trespassers
have been taken by the police.

14
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,220
But Cho Yeon-ju wasn't caught in the act,

15
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,389
and the prosecutor
from Seopyung was here too.

16
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,727
You can go ahead.

17
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,734
Since when do you have to be guilty
to be arrested?

18
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,780
Why don't you let her off for today?

19
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,825
The prosecutor is being demoted.

20
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,454
All this will be over in a few days.

21
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,166
All this will be over in a few days?

22
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,211
In a few days,
will Cho Yeon-ju not exist in the world?

23
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,642
What was Mr. No doing in that car?

24
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,894
He planned this with us
from the beginning.

25
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,229
Why is he doing this?

26
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,273
Was this his plan all along?

27
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,942
Has he been fooling us all?

28
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:57,028
I don't know. I'm sure he had a reason.

29
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,321
A reason?

30
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,906
Like what? In this situation?

31
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,910
We only have Jung Do-woo left now.

32
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,162
He won't open his mouth.

33
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,081
He claims that he acted on his own.

34
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,752
Since your uncles have been taken away,
I'll go and check on Mi-na

35
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,212
in the hospital.

36
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,381
-What about you?
-Don't ask.

37
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,799
I don't trust anyone right now.

38
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,177
One of us may be a traitor too.

39
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,728
It must have been traumatic.

40
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,105
I guess.

41
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,243
I'm Kim Kyung-sin.
You know who I am, right?

42
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,869
Yes, ma'am.

43
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,122
May I see Jung Do-woo's resume

44
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,332
from when he first started?

45
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:59,299
Is there no hope for her to recover?

46
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,469
There isn't much we can do now.

47
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,224
However, we found something unusual.

48
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,937
What…

49
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,940
The person you have reached…

50
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,403
The person you have reached…

51
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,782
The person you have reached…

52
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,037
-Hello?
-Awesome. He picked up.

53
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,709
Stop calling, will you?

54
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,586
How can I answer your call right away

55
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,004
in this situation?

56
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,715
I was too frustrated. So? What's going on?

57
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,968
Tell Seung-wook that I'm sorry.

58
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,387
Whatever. Let's meet.

59
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,223
No. I can't meet you right now.
I don't trust you.

60
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,642
But it's not like I can not meet you.

61
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,519
I had my reasons.

62
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,897
I'll tell you the details in person.

63
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,274
Is it really safe for me to meet you?

64
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,610
You won't do anything funny?

65
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,571
I'm not a villain.

66
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,782
If I were going to be a spy,

67
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,493
I wouldn't have been openly
by Han Sung-hye's side.

68
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,222
Must we meet somewhere so loud?

69
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,307
Don't you watch the movies?

70
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,101
If you go somewhere quiet

71
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,478
to discuss important matters,
someone always listens in.

72
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:39,065
You need to go somewhere loud
and look like you're just chatting.

73
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,192
Then no one will care
about our conversation.

74
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:44,362
And even if they bug us here,
they won't be able to hear well.

75
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,406
Plus, I don't trust you enough

76
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,242
to meet alone in a remote place.

77
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,327
Seriously.

78
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,871
So? What's going on?

79
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,915
The thing is…

80
00:06:56,707 --> 00:07:00,336
When Seung-wook's father passed away,
I already knew about that ledger.

81
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,005
If I had told President Han,

82
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,633
he may not have gone to the factory.

83
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,843
Oh, my gosh.

84
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,344
How could you keep that from us

85
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,138
all this time?

86
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,848
People can never talk about

87
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,016
their deepest, darkest sins.

88
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,435
That's human nature.

89
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,687
Even still. You were so close.

90
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,856
Show some loyalty.

91
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,984
Loyalty? Sure, loyalty's good.

92
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,404
But would being loyal
get me one million won a month?

93
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,158
My father has been in the hospital
for over 20 years now.

94
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,161
Loyalty is a luxury
for people like me who can't afford it.

95
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,374
Regardless, I guess
there are no secrets in this world.

96
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,294
Han Sung-hye used that to threaten me.

97
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:44,422
That was why I had no choice.

98
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,882
Seriously.

99
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,971
So? What will you do now?

100
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,640
What do you want me to do?

101
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,768
Come on. Even still, this is wrong.

102
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,770
Do you plan to be a conglomerate's gofer?

103
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,608
You can just start your own law practice.

104
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,860
You are so clueless.

105
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,445
It's not like I was a minister.

106
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,280
I won't go to a large law firm.

107
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,824
Do you know how much money
I have to send my family?

108
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,911
You still don't get it.

109
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,829
What?

110
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,915
What's wrong with being
a conglomerate's gofer?

111
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,708
I told you. I have to find a way

112
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,920
to survive over there
if I get ousted here.

113
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,756
You know how gangsters are.

114
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,675
Even a minion from a gang

115
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,720
will take the leader's head
when he betrays them.

116
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,766
I can't go by myself without a gift.

117
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,525
What…

118
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:47,944
What?

119
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,655
Did you…

120
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,618
drug me?

121
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,784
That jerk. How strong a drug did he use?

122
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,787
Right?

123
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,957
I said I wanted to kill you myself,

124
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,459
and he drugged you just enough
so you wouldn't die.

125
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,505
Look here, Chairman Han Sung-hye.

126
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,675
My biggest strength

127
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,303
is one-on-one interrogations
while we're alone.

128
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,973
Whether I made deals, lied, or screamed,

129
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,100
I always got

130
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:04,020
the suspects to say what I wanted.

131
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,231
So? Are you saying you'll interrogate me?

132
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,360
No. Today, I'll just make a request.

133
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,405
Turn yourself in.

134
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,783
I heard the recording of you
from when you killed Han Kang-sik

135
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,827
and hit my grandmother

136
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,662
with your car.

137
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,166
It was an accident.

138
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,086
You must think you're still a prosecutor.

139
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,547
So what if I turn myself in?

140
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,550
The law sides with the powerful anyway.

141
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,969
No one knew back then either

142
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,220
that I killed them.

143
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,643
If Ryu Seung-duk

144
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,812
hadn't looked the other way
in exchange for promotions,

145
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,939
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

146
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,525
Turn yourself in.

147
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,155
For trying to run over and kill
the real Kang Mi-na,

148
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,909
for killing Lee Bong-sik,
whom I risked everything to catch,

149
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,120
and for killing Jang and his wife
in the reservoir too.

150
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:08,000
Just admit it all and turn yourself in.

151
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,297
Why should I?

152
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,299
Do you have proof?

153
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,179
Of course not.
All I did was give the orders.

154
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:25,059
That is why you're begging me
to turn myself in.

155
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,856
All of them

156
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:35,111
passed on nicely
without me getting blood on my hands.

157
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,780
So will you and the real Mi-na

158
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,741
very soon.

159
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:44,662
How many people

160
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,709
are you admitting to killing
by murder-for-hire?

161
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,591
What?

162
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:03,222
If you use wealth or power
to induce or consent to murder,

163
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,058
you get the death penalty, life,
or at least five years in jail.

164
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,979
I told you. I always get my answer.

165
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,565
Did you think

166
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,859
I was just a pawn on your chessboard?

167
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,783
Do you know

168
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,785
how to attack such conglomerates?

169
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,497
Their weakness is something

170
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,833
people who think they succeeded

171
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,501
all on their own have.

172
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,005
Faith that they are always right.

173
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,885
That's what you have to attack.

174
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:47,766
Are you telling me to do
as Han Sung-hye said and betray you?

175
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,896
This is great. He's totally a perfect fit.

176
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:55,274
I know that was how I've lived
because I was desperate,

177
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:59,737
but don't treat me like a louse
who flips back and forth like a pancake.

178
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,406
Come on. Okay.

179
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,159
You're as pure as a lotus

180
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:08,829
that bloomed in the mud. Happy?

181
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,289
Darn it.

182
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,958
I can't force you if you refuse.

183
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,920
I told you before, right?

184
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,881
You should use a pawn to capture the king.

185
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,717
No one puts their guard up
against a powerless pawn.

186
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,969
So it's easy to flip sides
whenever you want.

187
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:25,971
So, you'll do it?

188
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,766
Why do you always throw a tantrum

189
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,476
when you know you'll do it?

190
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,978
Try working at a company for 30 years.

191
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,772
It's not easy to say yes right away.

192
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,109
Seriously.

193
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:44,949
Once Han Sung-hye gets Mr. No
in the palm of her hand, I'll be next.

194
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:49,620
She'll think I'll keep annoying her
as I did during her inauguration.

195
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,497
She'll try to get rid of me at all costs.

196
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,374
Do you think she'll trust me?

197
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,626
You have to give her something big.

198
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,712
Give her the originals
of all the evidence that we have.

199
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,549
And if she says she'll kill me,
make it happen.

200
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,133
No.

201
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,678
We can't use you as collateral
to take such a gamble.

202
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,137
Don't worry.

203
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,390
As long as we get her to sit
at that gambling table,

204
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,642
I can get her to confess.

205
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,812
Even if we get her to confess,
how will we have her locked up?

206
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,275
When you find bugs in rice,

207
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,028
you have to dry the rice in the sun.

208
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,738
Then the bugs that were hiding

209
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,407
inside the dark, damp rice jar

210
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,033
will crawl out.

211
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:29,827
My gosh.

212
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,704
So you mean we should publicly

213
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,497
humiliate her in broad daylight.

214
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,124
You made it sound very graceful.

215
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,212
Public humiliation?

216
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,925
Like you said,

217
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,511
the law in this country
usually sides with those with power.

218
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,931
But once in a blue moon,
it sides with the powerless.

219
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,434
It happens when the issue is publicized.

220
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,688
Are you going crazy?
What is this gibberish?

221
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,565
This is what I always say to those

222
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,567
who have suffered such injustice.

223
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,944
"If you think someone with power
is going to hit you,

224
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,614
make sure
there is a security camera around."

225
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,283
If they barely manage to fight back

226
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,285
after getting beaten up
with no one around,

227
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,121
they'll have no way to prove it

228
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,164
when those with power

229
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,582
also decide to press charges.

230
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,462
I didn't do anything today.

231
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,632
You brought this upon yourself
by acting recklessly.

232
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,053
That thing up there encourages bad people

233
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,722
to let their guard down and be reckless.

234
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,738
-My gosh.
-Unbelievable!

235
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,865
-Han Sung-hye!
-I can't believe this.

236
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,659
-This is crazy.
-How could she do this?

237
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,785
-Did you see it?
-No way.

238
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,329
Han Sung-hye acted like

239
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,081
she was kind and generous,

240
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,832
but she was human trash after all.

241
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,167
This man, Ryu Seung-duk,

242
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,503
is the chief prosecutor
of the Central Prosecutors' Office.

243
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,505
We, "Mr. Law Teacher,"

244
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,799
checked the statute of limitations
as quickly as we could.

245
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,259
And it doesn't look like
Ryu Seung-duk can be charged

246
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,220
as the statute of limitations has expired.

247
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,513
MR. LAW TEACHER, LIVE

248
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,806
Does this make sense to you?

249
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,225
-It's insane!
-I can't believe this.

250
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,851
-How could he be let off?
-Seriously.

251
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:18,936
-This is wrong!
-The corruption…

252
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,359
This world is so unfair!

253
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,738
-Unbelievable.
-This is so wrong.

254
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,366
How could this happen?

255
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,372
Everything you just said.

256
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,708
It was all live-streamed,

257
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,418
from the very beginning.

258
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,138
MR. LAW TEACHER

259
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:57,891
LIVE, MR. LAW TEACHER

260
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,270
HAN SUNG-HYE IS SO TWO-FACED

261
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,771
ARE THE RICH ABOVE THE LAW?

262
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,129
My gosh. How strong a drug did he use?

263
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,977
I told you

264
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,022
that I wouldn't let you
get away with it twice.

265
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,660
Are you all right?

266
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,544
There are cameras here,
so let's get out of here first.

267
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,117
-My gosh!
-What are they doing?

268
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,202
We should change our channel's name.

269
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,954
-Justice prevails!
-"Ms. Love Teacher."

270
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,664
They look so cute together.

271
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:44,790
Can someone give me a hug?

272
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,834
-Hug me!
-This is what I'm talking about!

273
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,669
-I want to be in love too!
-This is it!

274
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,504
ARREST THE CHIEF PROSECUTOR!

275
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,047
LOCK THEM ALL UP!

276
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,298
DID YOU HAVE FUN WITH HANJU'S MONEY?

277
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,099
CHIEF RYU SEUNG-DUK

278
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,187
It's me, honey.

279
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,064
I won't be home for a few days.

280
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,859
And they might conduct
a search and seizure of our house,

281
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,319
so take all the valuables
and go somewhere safe.

282
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,864
Go stay with your family or friends!

283
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,408
You've been showing off our money
to lots of people!

284
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,662
Hey.

285
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,665
If Internal Affairs investigates me now,
they'll see all my transactions

286
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,750
and call logs. I'll be dead meat then.

287
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,004
Hey. When they wanted to investigate you,
I stopped them, you know.

288
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,047
So you need to save me this time.

289
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:34,965
Hey, please…

290
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,342
Hello? Hey!

291
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:40,888
Darn it.

292
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,696
What have the prosecution

293
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,240
and this country

294
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,036
ever done for me?

295
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,332
I want to go back!

296
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,974
You know, when you're so angry,

297
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,478
you say things that aren't even true.

298
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,024
That woman kept talking complete nonsense.

299
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,323
What are you all doing?

300
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,034
Must I keep blabbering on?

301
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,329
The conversation was live-streamed

302
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,622
without your consent,

303
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,874
so they'll certainly have trouble

304
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,876
using it as evidence in court.

305
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,712
We can also say it's a deepfake,

306
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,923
saying it was manipulated
and that it's fake news.

307
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,676
All the live stream videos
have been taken down.

308
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,761
It's not like it was on the news,

309
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,304
so please don't worry.

310
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,140
And you're in possession
of all the evidence now.

311
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,274
Here's the Lee Bong-sik list.
I brought back the wiretapping device too.

312
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,985
And the files on the corruption.

313
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,194
I brought them all back.

314
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,989
You two are too much.

315
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,825
I'm the oldest here,
but you two keep bossing me around.

316
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,536
Do you know how much I struggled
to install those webcams

317
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,330
or whatever they're called
on the basement ceiling?

318
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,082
It's not like I've been doing nothing.

319
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,208
First off,

320
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,461
I was the one who brought
all the streamers.

321
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,963
And I had to go to the hospitals…

322
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,215
Same here.
It's not like I've been doing nothing.

323
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,175
How strong a drug did you use?

324
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,635
My head still hurts.

325
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,556
Exactly. You didn't have to actually
drug her water, you know.

326
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,807
My point exactly.

327
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,519
She is the one who said
it had to look real.

328
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,856
I only said that because
I thought you'd put nothing in the water

329
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,858
because you care about me so much.

330
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:01,611
Did it really have to be that realistic?

331
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,281
Gosh, you looked at me
with that evil smirk on your face.

332
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,283
When I think about that,
I still get chills.

333
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,410
You told me that I had to be a good actor

334
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,829
because someone would be listening in.

335
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,040
And did you really have to

336
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,166
say things like that?

337
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,084
"A conglomerate's gofer?"

338
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,002
"Gofer?"

339
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,088
Also, why did you call me 100 times?

340
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,841
And then you got
all angry when I answered.

341
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,801
At the inauguration ceremony,

342
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,720
were you supposed to get out of her car?

343
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,472
No, right?

344
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,349
So of course, I was surprised
when I saw you get out of that car.

345
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:35,145
You let all your emotions show
on your face.

346
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,230
So how was I supposed
to trust your acting?

347
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:40,275
I needed you to be really surprised
for Han Sung-hye to believe it.

348
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,861
I told you that he must have
had his reasons.

349
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,488
My goodness.

350
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,406
What reason?

351
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,496
The man who turned himself in

352
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,414
for the incident 14 years ago.

353
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,085
Why don't we dump it all on him?

354
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,469
When I was told to "go get some rest,"

355
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,304
that was my cue.

356
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,182
Kang Mi-na, Lee Bong-sik,

357
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,935
Jang Seok-ho and his wife,
and the director of Haebyeol Gallery.

358
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,562
Do you admit to killing
or attempting to kill them

359
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,606
and that Chairman Han Sung-hye
ordered you to do it?

360
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,399
That's correct.

361
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,652
And the incident 14 years ago.

362
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,404
That was also her.

363
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,283
Yes.

364
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,328
Why are you suddenly

365
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:35,122
changing your statement?

366
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,920
Your sister

367
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,257
has been in the hospital
for a long time, right?

368
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,302
I heard she underwent surgery
when she was young

369
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,179
with the help of Chairman Han Sung-hye.

370
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:53,890
That's correct.

371
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,017
What would you have done

372
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,311
had there been a way for her

373
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,064
to be fully cured?

374
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,443
I would've made it happen, at all costs.

375
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,952
It's the resume of Jung Do-woo,
a former employee of Hanju Security.

376
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:17,372
He lost his parents at a young age
and has a younger sister,

377
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,041
who had acute kidney failure
and underwent surgery

378
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,626
as soon as he joined the company.

379
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,797
Which was paid for by Han Sung-hye.

380
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,925
Han Sung-hye? Why?

381
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,720
She took over Hanju Fashion
at a young age.

382
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,013
And she must have wanted

383
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,140
to be seen as responsible.

384
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,102
She supposedly hired him for that reason.

385
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,608
So she's been helping his sister

386
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,818
financially all these years?

387
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,989
Something's strange.

388
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,658
What is it?

389
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:57,245
She could have cured
her kidney condition if she wanted.

390
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,332
She's had many chances
to get a kidney transplant.

391
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,834
But the guardian said no.

392
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,337
Did Mr. Jung say no?

393
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,256
We were told to contact Ms. Han

394
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,549
about those things.

395
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,468
And she's the one who said no.

396
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:14,596
That's why the patient's condition
continued to deteriorate.

397
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,061
Since you knew her weaknesses,

398
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,938
she kept you working for her

399
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,524
by taking your sister's life hostage.

400
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,533
I asked why you were changing
your statement all of a sudden.

401
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,788
Because I feel

402
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,499
this is unfair.

403
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,222
Here. We have breaking news.

404
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,600
You get to deliver
such interesting news on your last day.

405
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,740
I heard Han Sung-hye spread rumors

406
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,660
about you and his brother
to get rid of you

407
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,704
and you're being fired because of that.

408
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:21,955
So what?

409
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,541
Are you here to see how I'm doing?

410
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:25,625
No.

411
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,420
Even though
you've brought this upon yourself,

412
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,964
you must've worked hard so far.

413
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,342
I thought you might want to
fulfill your duties

414
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,137
as a news anchor for once
before you leave.

415
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,522
Let's get started.

416
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,483
Hold on.

417
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,864
Yes, I understand.

418
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,701
We won't report any news about Hanju.

419
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,495
They're threatening
to withdraw all their ads.

420
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,247
All right, here we go.

421
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,500
Three, two, one.

422
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,294
Cue.

423
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,004
Here's today's first story.

424
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,049
Breaking news.

425
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,926
This evening,
Chairman Han Sung-hye's misdeeds

426
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,554
were broadcast live and created an uproar.

427
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,473
-What is she saying?
-What?

428
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,725
-Why is she doing that?
-What's wrong with her?

429
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,436
Hey! Are you out of your mind?

430
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,063
Hey!

431
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,277
For those of you
who missed the live broadcast,

432
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,822
SBC had prepared an in-depth report,

433
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,867
but Hanju Group forced us to cancel it,

434
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,163
threatening to withdraw
their advertisements.

435
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:49,417
As a news anchor whose duty
is to report the truth, I apologize.

436
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,758
There must be a reason

437
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,843
why they stopped us.

438
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,472
-Is she drunk?
-Moving on.

439
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:05,058
The government recently…

440
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,060
Is Sung-hye out of her mind?

441
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,187
Does she want the company so badly?

442
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,147
She's just insane.

443
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,484
We didn't know anything.

444
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,947
-Mom.
-If we get involved with her now,

445
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,573
it'll be the end of us.

446
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,993
Do you want us all to go down together?

447
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,872
Don't answer her calls.

448
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,095
Will you be attending

449
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,555
the pre-arrest questioning?

450
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,973
I won't.

451
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,684
These days, if you don't,

452
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,060
it can be interpreted

453
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,646
that you have no objection
to being arrested.

454
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,440
Don't make me repeat myself.

455
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,525
I'm not attending it.

456
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,402
Yes, ma'am.

457
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,004
Sir, this is Chairman Han Sung-hye.

458
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,301
I see. When should I call you then?

459
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,596
Okay.

460
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,986
Minister, this is Chairman Han Sung-hye…

461
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,382
It's that obnoxious woman.

462
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,428
Hello, Chairman Han.

463
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,555
Mr. Ryu.

464
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,517
Regarding the recent matter…

465
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,185
I'm glad you called.

466
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,187
Can you help me?

467
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:18,024
I'm sure you have connections
in the Assembly and the administration.

468
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,360
I can't be the only person
having your back.

469
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,403
You hire those people's children

470
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,198
and offer them
huge severance payments, don't you?

471
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,825
Recently…

472
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:33,373
What an obnoxious woman.

473
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,280
-He's coming out!
-Here he comes!

474
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,615
-He's here!
-He's coming out!

475
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,951
You prosecuted almost everyone
in Hanju Group

476
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,619
for their crimes and corruption.

477
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,162
Are you ready to go all the way?

478
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,790
You also prosecuted gangsters
who have worked for Hanju Group.

479
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,252
What's the reason you declared war
against both sides?

480
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,713
I'm not sure
if I understand your question.

481
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,549
Do you have any personal goals
as a prosecutor?

482
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,928
I didn't prosecute them
to achieve my personal goals.

483
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,139
I prosecuted them
because they committed crimes.

484
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:32,849
Isn't that what

485
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,101
a prosecutor is supposed to do?

486
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,648
-Sir!
-Wait!

487
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,192
-Sir!
-Is it true…

488
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,777
-How do you feel?
-Sir!

489
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,599
You and I

490
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,268
seem to be in the same situation.

491
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,278
Oh, my. Are you crying?

492
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,157
Look at those eyebags.

493
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,117
Didn't you get any sleep last night?

494
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,453
Don't be ridiculous.

495
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,704
I slept well.

496
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,248
I heard you announced
your resignation yesterday

497
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,918
but it wasn't accepted
because of the public rage.

498
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,172
I'm being investigated by my subordinates,

499
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,549
and I know more about the law

500
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,177
than you all do.

501
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,554
That would only make you more scared.

502
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,474
Is this really necessary?

503
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,560
Must you put me behind bars?

504
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,814
It's not like
I killed a person or anything.

505
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,232
I just…

506
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,609
I just turned a blind eye, that's all.

507
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,070
I've never seen anyone
who passed the bar exam

508
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,114
admit their wrongdoing

509
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,283
without me having to go this far.

510
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:17,578
That's an overgeneralization.

511
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,122
See? You're not admitting it.

512
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,915
Cho Yeon-ju!

513
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:25,128
Do you think I can't climb back up?

514
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,381
You'll see me again someday.

515
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,717
I don't care.

516
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,177
I'm not interested

517
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,721
in the end of the wicked.

518
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:36,764
Goodbye.

519
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,520
Hello? What's up?

520
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,523
Mi-na woke up.

521
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,449
Thanks to
my stellar deduction skills and memory,

522
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,744
I passed the bar, became a prosecutor

523
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,163
and overcame all the obstacles

524
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,664
that were laid before me.

525
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,545
I can't possibly pretend to be Kang Mi-na
in my sleep too.

526
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:53,549
Was Kang Mi-na graceful even in her sleep?

527
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,718
Well…

528
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,013
You're two years older than her, right?

529
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,225
I unlocked it by entering today's date.

530
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:03,768
Your birthday.

531
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,148
Mi-na!

532
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,611
He'll be fine.

533
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,448
Seung-wook is tougher than he looks.

534
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:21,285
But at this very moment,

535
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,162
I resent my stellar memory

536
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,622
and deduction skills.

537
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,042
Why are you being a loser
and remembering all of that?

538
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:32,380
Stop deducing what happened, will you?

539
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,382
Seriously.

540
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,508
Darn it.

541
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,151
Let's go in.

542
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,403
She really wants to meet you.

543
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:58,322
Okay. But…

544
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,617
Maybe you should go in first.

545
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,120
Just me?

546
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,455
Why? What about you?

547
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,915
Well…

548
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,419
It's been a while
since you've seen each other.

549
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,296
I'm sure you have things to talk about

550
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:16,257
and things must seem very complicated.

551
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,396
People are very simple.

552
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:33,232
When you truly like someone,
it's never complicated.

553
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:37,737
Let's go in.

554
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,410
Come on.

555
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,978
It's nice to meet you, Yeon-ju.

556
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,493
Let me formally introduce myself.

557
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,827
I'm Kang Mi-na.

558
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,039
Yes. It's nice to meet you.

559
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,503
You too. It's been a while.

560
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,630
What happened?

561
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,716
I don't know.

562
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,927
When I woke up,

563
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,763
everything was back in its place.

564
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,519
How do we

565
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,313
look so alike?

566
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,065
Tell me about it.

567
00:37:56,565 --> 00:38:00,152
I asked my dad over and over again

568
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,697
and he kept saying
he wished I were the daughter

569
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,573
of a conglomerate owner.

570
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,742
So my mom really must have had me.

571
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,744
I heard my aunt

572
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,997
went into the delivery room

573
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,625
and watched my mom give birth to me.

574
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:18,504
She took me immediately after I was born
to run a paternity test.

575
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,090
Gosh. That aunt, seriously.

576
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,552
But anyway…

577
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:29,223
I'm sorry for pretending to be you.
It wasn't intentional at first.

578
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:33,311
I'm the one who owes you an apology.

579
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,772
That happened to you

580
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,774
because Sung-hye was trying to kill me.

581
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,236
I thought she'd just frame me

582
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,446
for being a drug addict

583
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,114
and send me to a mental hospital.

584
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:46,907
I was naive.

585
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,702
It wasn't your fault. You didn't know.

586
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,998
Had you known the plane would crash,
you wouldn't have fled.

587
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,709
Had I not fled back then,

588
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,419
I would've been killed

589
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,422
right after the plane crash.

590
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,466
I'm alive right now

591
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,092
thanks to the both of you.

592
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:09,096
Why didn't you take the tablet with you?

593
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,058
At first, I wanted to meet Seung-wook
somewhere abroad

594
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,893
and give it to you.

595
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,771
All I could do was flee,

596
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,689
but I wanted someone,

597
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,400
anyone, to destroy Hanju.

598
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:26,238
But I changed my mind

599
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,615
just before I ran away.

600
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,575
Why?

601
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,869
When your life has hit rock bottom,

602
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,538
you end up thinking about

603
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,416
other people's lives.

604
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:43,255
I didn't want to use his life

605
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,217
for myself any longer.

606
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,512
I want to apologize

607
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,140
to him more than anyone.

608
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,147
When I returned to Korea

609
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,109
and saw you living as me with my face,

610
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:08,030
I realized I had been a coward

611
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,615
all those years.

612
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,159
That was why

613
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,996
I decided to find Sung-hye's weaknesses.

614
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:32,471
Although most of my life has been painful,

615
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:37,351
there were nice gifts now and then.

616
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:42,606
I had you two, for instance.

617
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:47,153
I'm very sorry and grateful

618
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,406
for you both.

619
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:59,206
Anyway, what were you saying
we don't know yet about Sung-hye?

620
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,459
Well…

621
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,336
Every member of Hanju

622
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,880
is being judged by the law

623
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,381
for their respective deeds.

624
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,217
Except for my mother-in-law.

625
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,635
That's right.

626
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,973
She may have harassed her daughter-in-law,
but she didn't break any laws.

627
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,434
What I mentioned about Sung-hye

628
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,561
will hurt my mother-in-law

629
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,105
more than anything,

630
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,150
so I want to tell her personally.

631
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,986
Since I need to

632
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,614
take revenge for myself too.

633
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,400
I heard you were in a coma.

634
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,611
You just never die, do you?

635
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,157
How could you show your face here?

636
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,786
Are you here to taunt me
and see how I'm doing here alone?

637
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,871
You haven't changed.

638
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,959
Your daughter almost killed me
several times,

639
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,711
but you won't even apologize.

640
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,966
So? Did you die?

641
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,842
No, you didn't.

642
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:38,180
Now, you can live however you want.

643
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,767
Stop being arrogant.

644
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,519
Do you think the world is yours now?

645
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,313
Didn't you plan to hide

646
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,439
behind that new face

647
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,275
because you were afraid of us?

648
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,027
Do you think I'm hiding

649
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,406
just because I changed my face?

650
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,135
So what?

651
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,678
What do you want?

652
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,681
I came here to tell you something,

653
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,516
so I'll leave as soon as I'm done.

654
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,102
Like you said,

655
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,729
I was blessed with a long life,

656
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,398
so I have survived
a number of life-threatening incidents.

657
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,191
But why did your eldest son

658
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,777
die like that?

659
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,073
Just when Father was about to

660
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,993
promote him to vice chairman

661
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:44,997
instead of Han Sung-hye.

662
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,834
What are you trying to say?

663
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:56,300
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

664
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,101
What did you put in my water?

665
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,438
Did my sister put you up to this?

666
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:11,482
You see,

667
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,902
I'm not like Sung-chan.
I won't let my guard down.

668
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,446
I won't let her get to me.

669
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,616
Never.

670
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,161
Sung-chan went to volunteer

671
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,664
at an animal shelter with Sung-hye

672
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,667
and died of an asthma attack.

673
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,378
You don't even want to set foot
in an animal shelter

674
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,004
ever since that happened,

675
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,215
so I always went there alone.

676
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,469
I found out that the dog shampoo

677
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,721
she had donated that day

678
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,891
contained an ingredient
that was lethal to asthma patients.

679
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,772
If he'd had his inhaler,

680
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,691
which he always carried around with him,

681
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,861
he could have lived.

682
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,571
But it just happened to

683
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,615
disappear that day.

684
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:07,579
Ask your younger son where it was.

685
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,207
He knew all along,

686
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:14,336
but he's been keeping it to himself
because he was afraid of his sister.

687
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,259
I just want to live quietly.

688
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,303
I don't want to end up like Sung-chan.

689
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,894
I wanted to get a confession
out of Sung-hye.

690
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,021
But given the situation,

691
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,316
it'd be pointless to get her convicted

692
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,360
of one more crime,

693
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,488
so I figured
I should just tell you personally.

694
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:43,949
Shut your mouth.

695
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:46,326
Get out at once!

696
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,744
You won't go to jail

697
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:50,831
for being a toxic mother-in-law.

698
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:51,999
However,

699
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,751
your daughter killed your eldest son,

700
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,463
who was your most beloved child,

701
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,506
and your younger son

702
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,134
has kept his mouth shut
even though he knew all about it.

703
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:06,305
Just remember that

704
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,516
and spend the rest of your life

705
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,019
in the jail you've built for yourself.

706
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,000
HANJU HOTEL

707
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,126
HANJU GROUP
EMERGENCY MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS

708
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,419
We are here to discuss

709
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,297
the dismissal of the owner family.

710
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,550
I will now announce the voting results.

711
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,556
HANJU GROUP
EMERGENCY MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS

712
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,600
Here. Am I too late?

713
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:39,106
We need the approval of
at least two-thirds of the shareholders.

714
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,275
But as you can see,
it didn't reach that number.

715
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,569
Hence, this proposal has been rejected.

716
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,113
What? Those of you who are against it.

717
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,197
Are you crazy?

718
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,701
How could we trust them
to run the company properly?

719
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,955
Does one have to be ethical
to run a company successfully?

720
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,164
They're unrelated.

721
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,377
I apologize.

722
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:05,632
I'm sorry I'm late. May we have a revote?

723
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,634
-Who is she?
-Who's that woman?

724
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:09,761
Who are you?

725
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,525
Ms. Kim has that much power?

726
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:26,361
She got the director title for a reason.

727
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,364
My grandfather gave her
only valuable stocks,

728
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,617
so I'm sure she can exercise
a lot of influence.

729
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,494
It's true that late bloomers

730
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,121
are more enthusiastic.

731
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:38,415
She used to say
she wanted to always remain neutral.

732
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,208
Must she make it so obvious

733
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,543
which side she's on?

734
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:47,049
Hanju's shareholders' meeting
took place earlier today.

735
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,009
After a revoting process,
which took hours,

736
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,470
the company has announced
that 67.1 percent voted in agreement

737
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,597
of the dismissal
and 32.9 percent voted against it

738
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,016
and that Chairman Han Young-sik's
family have been dismissed.

739
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,017
CONGLOMERATE OUSTED BY SHAREHOLDERS

740
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,520
This makes Chairman Han Young-sik and
his family the first conglomerate family

741
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,189
to be ousted by shareholders.

742
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:06,026
The arrest warrant for Han Sung-hye
has finally been issued,

743
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,320
and the police plan to arrest her soon.

744
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:11,031
The Seoul Central District Court
issued the arrest warrant

745
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:16,119
based on sufficient evidence against her
and a reasonable flight risk.

746
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,752
CHAIRMAN HAN SUNG-HYE

747
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,348
Early this morning, Chairman Han Sung-hye,

748
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:21,184
who had been missing
since the announcement of her arrest,

749
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,603
was found dead by a reservoir
in Gyeonggi Province.

750
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,606
The body had already been decomposed
when it was found,

751
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,277
but the clothes and accessories
Chairman Han was wearing

752
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,071
when she went missing
were all found on the body.

753
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,660
Hanju Group held a board meeting
and appointed Han Seung-wook,

754
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,788
the son of Han Kang-sik,
as the group's new leader.

755
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:45,709
The late CEO Han Kang-sik
is now the group's honorary chairman.

756
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,878
Hanju has released a statement
expressing condolences

757
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:51,131
on the passing of Chairman Han Sung-hye,
and has canceled the inauguration

758
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,257
and all other events.

759
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,478
My gosh. I guess you're going to Vietnam.

760
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:50,273
Do you want to learn a Vietnamese idiom?

761
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:56,279
In Korean,

762
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,949
"A long tail is bound to be seen."

763
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,036
How did you know…

764
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,413
I know people like you very well.

765
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:08,875
True cowards
can't take their own lives. Why?

766
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,418
Because death terrifies them.

767
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,255
I examined the corpse very carefully.

768
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,257
The clothes, shoes, watch

769
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,925
and rings were all yours,

770
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,260
but the underwear.

771
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,679
I could tell it wasn't yours

772
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:23,265
because I used to hand-wash
all your underwear for you.

773
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,017
How dare you try to fake a suicide

774
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,769
and get away with it?

775
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,772
How many times must I tell you?

776
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,440
Just turn yourself in.

777
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,620
Darn it.

778
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,247
I was going to kindly let you

779
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,582
keep that elegant front.

780
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:49,624
Too bad.

781
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:22,782
Darn it.

782
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,053
HAN KANG-SIK

783
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:46,348
Han Sung-hye must have believed
that everyone is afraid of

784
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:51,811
admitting and apologizing for
their past wrongdoings.

785
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,898
She doesn't understand that

786
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,399
not everyone is like her.

787
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:00,528
She must have thought

788
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:03,239
you were keeping everything from me.

789
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,575
It wasn't easy for me to tell you.

790
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,829
But everyone makes mistakes.

791
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,290
You just have to try
not to repeat the same mistakes.

792
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,212
I feel like I've finally paid off my debt.

793
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:18,505
I feel relieved.

794
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,718
Hey, Seung-wook.

795
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:27,681
Yes?

796
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,643
Since I've quit my job

797
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:33,144
and paid off my debt,

798
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,939
just think of me as your friend.

799
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,317
I want to take it easy now.

800
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,986
And stop asking me for rides.

801
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,740
I'll get going. You have company, right?

802
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,367
Yes.

803
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,622
Goodness.

804
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:03,258
CHOI SEUNG-OK

805
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:16,479
How do you feel?

806
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:22,485
I feel like I've just finished a sprint

807
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,989
and now I have to run a marathon.

808
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,784
In which direction should I run?

809
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,411
Where do I belong?

810
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,829
I ask myself those questions.

811
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,165
You wonder where you belong?

812
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,917
You once said to me

813
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,503
that you didn't want to

814
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,338
sit there wondering

815
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,883
how your stock price would crash

816
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:48,261
whenever something happened.

817
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,765
So I thought about it too.

818
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:55,643
About what kind of life I wanted to live.

819
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:58,104
But I couldn't figure it out.

820
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:02,692
For a long time,
I only lived to achieve my goals

821
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,195
and take revenge.

822
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,906
Now that everything's over,

823
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,159
I really don't know
what to do with my life.

824
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,289
Let me know when you figure it out.

825
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,919
You must have found

826
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:22,587
what you want to do.

827
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,591
I'll be waiting for you.

828
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:33,807
TAMNA FISH MARKET

829
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:37,393
-Look at this.
-Who sent it?

830
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:39,854
The owner?

831
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:43,733
Oh, my.

832
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:46,736
I did hear your sashimi
was extremely fresh.

833
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,655
And you opened your second restaurant.

834
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,079
Stop being angry with me already.

835
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:59,082
How could you still be so upset
about being taken by the police?

836
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:00,166
Hey!

837
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:04,337
Do you think that's what this is about?

838
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:07,090
You didn't tell us you were pretending.

839
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:08,925
-Please…
-Stop talking to me.

840
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:11,427
We're busy answering
franchising inquiries.

841
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,346
What?

842
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:15,306
Don't be like that.

843
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,975
Right, Pil-kyu?

844
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:18,476
I knew you'd be on my side.

845
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,602
Where's my dad?

846
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:21,020
I'm not going to tell you.

847
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,480
Never ever!

848
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:25,066
CONGRATULATIONS ON OPENING
YOUR SECOND RESTAURANT!

849
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,527
-Hey, you're here.
-Yes.

850
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,821
If you opened a new restaurant,

851
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:31,906
you should hand out flyers or something.

852
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,284
The flowers aren't enough
to attract customers.

853
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:38,830
How can you be more behind than me
when I've been in prison for ten years?

854
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,749
Who attracts customers
with flyers these days?

855
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,126
What you have to do is

856
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,712
give away coupons on apps
and advertise on social media.

857
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:50,425
We're already fully booked for today.

858
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,728
Why did you open a restaurant
right after being released?

859
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,354
You could have rested more.

860
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:07,192
Pil-kyu says you can get wrist pain
from working with knives.

861
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,610
Take it regularly.

862
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:10,069
You should have asked

863
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,446
what my role here is

864
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:12,947
before buying this.

865
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:14,866
I never used knives

866
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:16,201
even when I was in a gang.

867
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,619
So why would I now?

868
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:19,954
I hired someone to do that.

869
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,998
Then I'll take it back.

870
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,042
Well, it doesn't mean

871
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,337
I want you to take it back.

872
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,798
Maybe I'll get joint pain
from counting all the money.

873
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:37,055
Drink slowly.

874
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:43,186
I guess I don't have to worry about you.

875
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:49,150
Are you leaving now?

876
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,402
Yes.

877
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:57,951
All right.

878
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:01,913
Yeon-ju.

879
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:04,874
If you're going to say
something cheesy, don't.

880
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,209
Just don't say anything.

881
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:12,006
I was going to ask for a napkin.
It got all over my hands.

882
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:14,467
I see.

883
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,473
I'll be going.

884
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,565
Take care.

885
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:31,526
I will.

886
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:10,940
Goodbye for real.

887
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:38,635
Gosh, I'm stressed out.

888
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,762
I keep being told to step down.

889
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:45,224
Can you explain why you pick on me

890
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:48,686
at every shareholders' meeting?

891
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,939
Have I ever pocketed any money?

892
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:55,026
Why do you insist on
hiring a professional manager?

893
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,989
That's because you've been establishing

894
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:02,325
an excessive amount of funds.

895
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,452
That's why the shareholders

896
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:09,248
suspect you of money laundering.

897
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:20,343
Gosh, I wish I could
smack her in the head.

898
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:21,803
Nothing gets past her.

899
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,558
How does she know about money laundering?

900
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:31,187
Just when I barely managed
to get rid of the fake one,

901
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:32,313
the real one showed up.

902
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:37,110
And she's just as difficult to deal with.

903
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:39,737
But is she really her?

904
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:43,032
I'm doomed.

905
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,451
Gosh!

906
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:48,788
BRIQUETTE DONATION
TO SHARE LOVE AND WARMTH

907
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:55,378
I just don't understand.

908
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,922
Isn't all this just for show?

909
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:01,592
We should just pay more taxes.

910
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,387
What difference does it make
if we deliver these briquettes?

911
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:07,932
What's even more difficult
to understand is you.

912
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,685
Why did you come back to us?

913
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,813
Even at my parents' house,

914
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,315
no one welcomed me.

915
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:19,485
The final straw was them
looking down on Sun-woo

916
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:23,448
just because he was a daughter's child.

917
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:25,533
We know the real reason.

918
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:28,953
You thought Seung-wook
would swallow Hanju up whole,

919
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:31,164
but since he hired
a management specialist,

920
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:35,960
you figured Sun-woo
may get a chance after all.

921
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:40,923
If you're so smart,
stop being lazy and work hard.

922
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,468
Father says convictions

923
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:45,136
for financial crimes aren't a flaw

924
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:46,971
and plans to make a comeback

925
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:50,224
when he gets out,
and is gnashing his teeth.

926
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,935
We should help him.

927
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,563
He's being way too excessive.

928
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:01,944
Anyway,

929
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:05,156
why did Mother change so drastically?

930
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:08,910
My gosh. She has no energy at all.

931
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:19,796
Ninety-one.

932
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:21,923
Ninety-two.

933
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,133
Ninety-three.

934
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,135
Ninety-four.

935
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,597
Ninety-five.

936
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:32,225
Ninety-six.

937
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,561
Ninety-seven.

938
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,522
Ninety-eight.

939
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,690
Ninety-nine.

940
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,235
One hundred.

941
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:50,076
I will not fall.

942
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:52,453
I will not fall.

943
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:54,956
I will not fall.

944
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,669
How dare you punks…

945
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,671
How dare you?

946
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:10,179
How many times must I tell you?

947
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,056
I'm not interested at all

948
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:14,100
in the end of the wicked.

949
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:17,353
Who cares if they do squats
or take body profile pictures?

950
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:19,647
Don't tell me about things like that.

951
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:23,234
I know you started your own practice,

952
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:25,194
but did you have to
spread rumors everywhere?

953
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:29,365
Word-of-mouth advertising
is the most effective.

954
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:32,869
Anyway, now that your father
is out and established,

955
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:35,037
you must feel relieved.

956
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,163
I am.

957
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,958
So actually, I came to say bye.

958
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,671
Are you finally going?

959
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:46,048
Yes.

960
01:04:46,924 --> 01:04:48,301
I tried doing this and that

961
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:49,969
to find my place in this world,

962
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:52,388
but it doesn't matter

963
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:54,140
where I am or what I do.

964
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,642
If I'm with the person I love,
that is where I belong.

965
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,570
Are you really okay

966
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:09,697
with someone else living here?

967
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,616
That's right, I am.

968
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:15,077
Or why don't you move in? You punk.

969
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:17,038
What? You're being demoted?

970
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:21,584
You went straight to Central District.
I'm very proud of you.

971
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,587
Anyway, I got to live for cheap in Seoul,

972
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:27,256
which is notorious for high rent
thanks to you.

973
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,885
Thank you for never raising my rent.

974
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:36,432
Well… Thank you for everything too.

975
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:38,267
What's wrong with you?

976
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:41,187
I didn't do anything for you.

977
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,314
You always came late or not at all

978
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:44,857
because you forgot

979
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:45,983
I was waiting.

980
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:48,402
So…

981
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:51,822
I studied all the time

982
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,324
while waiting for you.

983
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:56,619
That was why I did well at the institute.

984
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:58,454
And…

985
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:04,669
I was grateful
that you never felt bad toward me.

986
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:09,256
I was able to act normally with you
thanks to that.

987
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:18,766
I feel like

988
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:22,061
it's really goodbye now.

989
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:43,332
Yes. Someone once said

990
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,168
that even if your life is tough,

991
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:49,463
you meet someone
who is like a gift once in a blue moon.

992
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:54,135
I think you were my gift, Yu-jun.

993
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:56,345
Take care of yourself.

994
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:15,531
LOS ANGELES, USA

995
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,369
My life had been filled with endless days

996
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:45,663
of dreaming of being somewhere else.

997
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:49,083
But when I looked back,

998
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,919
I realized that what I truly missed

999
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:54,713
were the moments that had passed.

1000
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:57,550
Although I wanted to be

1001
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:59,176
very different from who I was,

1002
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:02,763
I was able to do everything because I was

1003
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,557
the most like myself.

1004
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:06,934
When we don't lose ourselves,

1005
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:10,187
regardless of whom we're living as,

1006
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,815
we are capable of doing anything.

1007
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:33,127
EPILOGUE

1008
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:38,382
This is the first thing you wanted to do

1009
01:09:38,465 --> 01:09:40,009
after passing the bar in the US?

1010
01:09:40,634 --> 01:09:42,803
They don't have jokbaengi there.

1011
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:45,347
We can fly back right after we eat, okay?

1012
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:48,601
There were so many jerks in the US

1013
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,186
who tested my patience.

1014
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:52,688
They're dead now. Just you wait.

1015
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:57,359
CONGRATULATIONS CHO YEON-JU
BECOMES LICENCED US ATTORNEY

1016
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:00,863
Did you call Mr. No?

1017
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:03,616
He asked when we were coming
every single day.

1018
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:06,493
So that was why he asked.

1019
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:12,041
Ms. Cho.

1020
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:13,500
Where are you going?

1021
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:15,419
Seriously.

1022
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:17,713
What is this?

1023
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,049
It's jokbaengi.

1024
01:10:20,132 --> 01:10:22,468
You brought this stinky food
all the way here?

1025
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,178
I know.

1026
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:25,679
I brought this stinky food

1027
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,348
and timed it with your arrival…

1028
01:10:29,516 --> 01:10:32,478
Stop ordering me around.

1029
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:35,272
I don't know anyone else in Korea.

1030
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:38,025
-Let me see.
-Get it yourself next time.

1031
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:39,443
Shall we just eat it here?

1032
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:41,612
Where do you want to eat?

1033
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:27,950
MOTORCYCLE GUITAR RIDE

1034
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:32,162
Let's ride a motorcycle on a guitar

1035
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:38,877
Let's ride a guitar on a motorcycle

1036
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,838
Let's ride

1037
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,758
Let's ride a snail

1038
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,593
On a watermelon

1039
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:48,262
Let's ride the light

1040
01:11:48,345 --> 01:11:49,847
On a quail

1041
01:11:57,688 --> 01:11:59,315
With a balloon

1042
01:12:02,943 --> 01:12:05,070
Let's give it a hug

1043
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:06,780
Let's hug a wardrobe

1044
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:09,199
With a pine caterpillar

1045
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:18,083
Just as you imagine

1046
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,209
Cyber

1047
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:27,051
Cyber

1048
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:49,740
One, two.

1049
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:52,451
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING ONE THE WOMAN
