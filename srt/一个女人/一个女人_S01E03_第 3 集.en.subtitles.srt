"And a person's enemies
will be those of his own household."

2
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,340
A PERSON'S ENEMIES
WILL BE THOSE OF HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD

3
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,968
My prayer has been answered today.

4
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,553
Hallelujah, damn it.

5
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,472
Hey!

6
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,644
You think I'm a joke?

7
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,189
Why do you keep throwing it just at me?

8
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,900
Mi-na, he was just being
a little mischievous--

9
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:10,111
Right, but why just me?
Why is he only doing this to me?

10
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,656
Honey, he's just a kid.
Try to understand and sit down.

11
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,116
Let go!

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,453
"Understand?" You mean
I should just keep my mouth shut.

13
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,496
Be quiet!

14
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,123
SERVICE FOR LATE CHAIRMAN HAN HYUNG-MO

15
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,087
Is this a shouting match?

16
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,923
Are we at a gambling joint or something?

17
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:33,176
Why did you suddenly shout?
You startled me!

18
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,391
How crude of you.

19
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,353
Just what I'd expect from someone
born out of wedlock.

20
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:45,146
Oh, dear Lord.

21
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,817
Gosh, it's disgusting
that someone thinks that way in 2021.

22
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,403
Aren't you ashamed to say that out loud?
Are we in the 19th century or what?

23
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,823
Why are you making such a big deal
out of nothing?

24
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,241
Watch what you say, will you?

25
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,576
Really? Sure, I can do that.

26
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,620
You scumbag. You're the worst.

27
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,996
A mama's boy, a papa's boy.

28
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,540
Will you please shut your mouth?

29
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,707
Happy now?

30
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,709
Seriously, what's your problem?

31
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,171
What? Did you hit me in the past?

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,926
No.

33
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,514
-Mi-na.
-What? Don't mind me.

34
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,267
I can say that much. What's wrong with it?

35
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,186
-Mi-na.
-Let go!

36
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,813
-Goodness.
-Mi-na.

37
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,024
Treating your in-laws this way is like
spitting on your own face. So stop.

38
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,694
Exactly. Let me spit on my own face.
Why do you care?

39
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,737
It's not like
I'm spitting in others' faces.

40
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,197
Darn it!

41
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,242
SERVICE FOR LATE CHAIRMAN HAN HYUNG-MO

42
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,786
Don't you dare mess with me!
Do you know who I am?

43
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,206
Who am I?

44
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,710
Who am I?

45
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,279
Can't you see? No matter what we do,

46
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,865
I'm sure word has already
spread everywhere.

47
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,452
Today's incident may become a problem
at the shareholders' meeting.

48
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,661
Oh, my. Does that mean

49
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,789
she can get kicked out
even if we don't do anything?

50
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,251
How many times do I have to tell you
it's better to keep her with us?

51
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,090
It doesn't matter
what the other shareholders think

52
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,927
as long as the major shareholders
support Mi-na.

53
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,845
That's right. We're tracking them down,

54
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,390
but one of them is in South America
and can't be reached at the moment.

55
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,267
So we're trying to reach the other one.

56
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,228
Keep contacting the major shareholders.

57
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,606
Let's see how things go
until the shareholders' meeting.

58
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,192
Darn it.

59
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,279
By the way,

60
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,700
could Mi-na's memories be back?

61
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:07,288
If this is about us talking
behind her back in English and French,

62
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,832
don't you think she's overreacting?

63
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,460
So what if her memories are back?

64
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,589
This is because all of you spoiled her.

65
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,883
Imagine if she gets her company
with that temper.

66
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,843
She won't listen to us.

67
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,430
I'm glad she got her memories back.

68
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,432
My patience has reached its limit.

69
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,268
I'm going to be mean to her now.

70
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:32,438
Still, shouldn't we wait
until the shareholders' meeting?

71
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,692
From what I saw earlier,

72
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,278
she may yank out your hair
if you're mean to her.

73
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,863
Why couldn't you keep your mouths shut?

74
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,783
She didn't seem that fond of you, either.

75
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,702
She was yelling at you too.

76
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:50,164
You seem to be excited.

77
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,876
It did feel a bit cathartic earlier.

78
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,838
Are you taking her side?

79
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,674
Does that matter?

80
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:04,345
It's not like me taking someone's side
has any effect at all in Hanju.

81
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,650
I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

82
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:24,240
Are you one of those people
with traditional values?

83
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,993
Are you here to lecture me?

84
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,414
Fine.

85
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,416
I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.

86
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,127
But isn't it understandable?
You heard what they said.

87
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,921
Also, people can get
emotionally unstable after--

88
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,256
Who on earth…

89
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,258
are you?

90
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,344
-What?
-Who are you?

91
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,182
What are you doing here?

92
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,019
Where's the real Mi-na?

93
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,277
The real Mi-na?
Are you saying I'm not Mi-na?

94
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,698
Do you really not remember anything?

95
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,784
How many times must I tell you?

96
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:15,833
The facts after the accident
are recorded in detail.

97
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:20,713
It would be difficult
for her to fake amnesia.

98
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,050
The issue is whether or not she is aware.

99
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,302
That's right.

100
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:30,681
If she doesn't know,
she's a victim as well.

101
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,143
Who knows what Hanju will do
if you make an issue of it now?

102
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,104
They may use her for the inheritance.

103
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,772
Above all else--

104
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,650
They may find the real Mi-na
and do something to her.

105
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,068
Exactly.

106
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,905
Since they can absorb Yumin Group
in its entirety,

107
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,532
I wouldn't put it past them.

108
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,743
Let's keep an eye on them for now.

109
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,170
I apologize.

110
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,757
You were so different
from the Mi-na I knew that I was confused.

111
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,800
My gosh.

112
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:09,137
After talking down to me,
you suddenly decided to speak politely?

113
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,680
But…

114
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,724
You're the strange one.

115
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,436
You said I'm so different
from the Mi-na you know?

116
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,729
This isn't the proper attitude
of a cousin-in-law

117
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,565
who just arrived from the US.

118
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,945
Who are you?

119
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,366
Did we have a relationship?

120
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,369
Were we…

121
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,081
having an affair?

122
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,961
Once again, my apologies.

123
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,629
Wait a second.

124
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,339
You can't just go.

125
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,342
You can't say everything you want,
say sorry, and then go.

126
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,887
What do you want then?

127
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,931
Did you bring a car?

128
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,600
What?

129
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,612
How did you get there without a car?

130
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:11,365
Coming from the woman
with no car or money for cab fare.

131
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,659
It's not that I don't have money
for a taxi ride.

132
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,077
My money is in my bag,

133
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,623
my bag is in the car,
and the car left without me.

134
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,793
What will you do now?

135
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,545
What do you mean?

136
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,173
They probably don't know
that I overheard them,

137
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:30,176
so I'll have to see
how much they lie to me.

138
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,386
Once I get my inheritance,

139
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,721
you're all dead.

140
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,848
Are you sure you can get it?

141
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,518
What do you mean?

142
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,770
Management rights
aren't something you inherit.

143
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,439
You must be appointed by the shareholders.

144
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,815
Everyone who was there today

145
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,151
was probably a shareholder
or personally knows one.

146
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,654
They must've told others by now

147
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,490
that Yumin Group's heiress
has a psychological problem--

148
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,534
How could you say that?

149
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,119
Are you saying
I have a psychological problem?

150
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,874
You heard them. That family is the one
with a psychological problem.

151
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,626
Even if people think it's strange,

152
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,796
if it's the norm in their circle,
it is normal.

153
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,717
Anyway, the shareholders will hear
the rumor and call a meeting

154
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,511
and they may vote to dismiss you.

155
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:17,640
Since they can't let a crazy woman do
as she wishes with their money.

156
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,933
My gosh.

157
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,769
They'll kick me out
for saying the right things?

158
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,688
Exactly. I know you're angry,

159
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,357
but you shouldn't become enemies
with the Hanju family.

160
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,402
They're the ones who will shield you
until the meeting.

161
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,280
Can I trust you?

162
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,657
That's up to you.

163
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:40,329
Are you thinking you won't be responsible
since you told me to do as I wish?

164
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,622
Is that it?

165
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,792
What do you want from me?

166
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,670
Imagine why I've become this way.

167
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,631
I don't know whether someone
is telling the truth or lying,

168
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:55,261
whether they're a friend or an enemy,
or whether to laugh or glare at them.

169
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,951
Why did you get off?
You should take that home.

170
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,705
Do you not have enough money?

171
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,249
I have enough money…

172
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,918
and something to say.

173
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,670
What now?

174
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,505
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,428
For making a joke earlier
when you said you lost your memory.

176
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,475
I think at times
that if you lose your memory,

177
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,518
maybe you can be freed from the past…

178
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,438
and start over.

179
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:52,443
That was why I responded so flippantly
when you said that.

180
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,029
I got out to apologize for that.

181
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,116
Go in.

182
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,883
How dare you come home
after humiliating the family?

183
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,595
If you were going to hurt your head,
you should've become paraplegic.

184
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,598
Why don't you go jump into a car again?

185
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,600
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,773
Is that all?

187
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,776
Since I'm trying to filter my words,

188
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,653
I have nothing to say.

189
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,988
I can finally understand you, Mother.

190
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,408
Why you say everything you want.

191
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,993
What did you just say?

192
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,872
And here I thought
she was back to her old self.

193
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,541
Anyway, Mi-na,

194
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,584
you were too harsh on Sun-woo.

195
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,504
How could you do that to a child
in front of all those people?

196
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,340
Do you look down on him
because I raise him alone?

197
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:00,803
What if he becomes traumatized?

198
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,807
I'm worried as is

199
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,520
about how well I can raise him alone.

200
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,650
It's not like I have a role model.

201
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:18,195
I stress about it every single day.

202
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,531
I see.

203
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,116
Don't stress so much.

204
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,493
Look to Mother as an example.

205
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,288
What?

206
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,664
"Just don't be like her."

207
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:31,000
That will be plenty.

208
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,795
Right? That's more like it.

209
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,591
No, Mother.

210
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,218
I'm not saying she's right.

211
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,889
I was excessive today.

212
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,015
I'll go to my room now.

213
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,899
She needs to be discouraged.

214
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,861
Why is she still so confident?

215
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:03,240
At least she is being submissive.

216
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:07,578
You call that being submissive?
She's dissing people indirectly.

217
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,166
Gosh.

218
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,127
I was too submissive.

219
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,672
That is really not my style.

220
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,469
I'm sorry.

221
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,680
For making a joke earlier
when you said you lost your memory.

222
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,683
What's his deal?
I had forgotten all about it.

223
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,230
Gosh.

224
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,440
Why do my legs hurt so much?

225
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,734
They're so sore.

226
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,113
This is why they hurt.

227
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,368
They can't be new.

228
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,119
Why did they cut my feet?

229
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,760
They're slightly too small.

230
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,390
Whether it's a good thing or not,
she lost her memory.

231
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,810
She forgot everything we did to her,
so just don't be mean.

232
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,811
Why is that so hard?

233
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:19,358
It means I knew all about
what they were up to.

234
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,235
It's only memories

235
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,238
from before a certain point in time
that have been lost.

236
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,615
Her memories may be gone,
but not her emotions.

237
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,664
Actually, I didn't even have
any emotions left.

238
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,750
I was all empty inside
when I was dealing with everyone.

239
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,802
It was much worse. They watched you
like a hawk 24 hours a day.

240
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,264
You had to wear
only what she chose for you.

241
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,308
You have it easy now.

242
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,435
This is them being nice to you.

243
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,357
Then I bet I didn't hide anything here.

244
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,005
Nice car!

245
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,381
Look at this beauty.

246
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,051
Oh, my.

247
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,231
This car drives so smoothly!

248
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,074
Amazing. Look at that corner reverse.

249
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,159
I was a good driver on top of everything?

250
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,370
My goodness.

251
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,629
Yes, of course.

252
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:07,341
Anyone living in the modern age
needs this to multitask.

253
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,642
What? Whose car is that?

254
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,064
I told you.
I couldn't pick up in that situation.

255
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,817
I can't believe you came here.
What if someone sees you?

256
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,694
Who? Your wife?

257
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:31,323
I see. Are you worried about upsetting her
now that her situation has changed?

258
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,993
It's true that
my wife's situation has changed,

259
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,577
but you've changed too.

260
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,039
We've been together long enough.
Don't be such a nagger.

261
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,252
Just leave. I'll call you later, okay?

262
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,461
Get going. Go.

263
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,505
It's you!

264
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,134
-Darn it. We've been busted.
-Nice car.

265
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,635
I knew this would happen.

266
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,680
Darn it. Move over.

267
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,683
What are you doing here?

268
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,106
Long time no see.

269
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,775
I heard about all the unfortunate events.

270
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,485
Looks like you've recovered quickly.

271
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,237
Who are you?

272
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,949
Well, let's go inside.

273
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,660
Are you pretending not to know me?

274
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,916
Well, you do look very familiar.

275
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,460
The news!

276
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,045
You must've seen her on the news.

277
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,963
She's Park So-yi, SBC's news anchor.

278
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,300
What are you trying to pull here?

279
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,303
Should I tell you who I am?

280
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,598
Your husband and I have been
seeing each other since before--

281
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,724
My goodness.

282
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,935
-There's no need to bring that up.
-What?

283
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,275
Well, she is…

284
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,027
I mean…

285
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,488
Well, it's not a pleasant story anyway.

286
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:53,947
I see.

287
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,909
So you two had an affair,
and I knew about it?

288
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,621
And she has the nerve to come here?

289
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:02,539
Yes.

290
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,917
I'm not just a good driver.

291
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,044
I'm very patient too.

292
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,214
I hated it when you did nothing
but watched us like a pervert.

293
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,841
But now you're being sarcastic,
and I hate this too.

294
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,718
Enough, okay?

295
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,429
If I raise my voice,
you'll be embarrassed.

296
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,764
"Embarrassed"?

297
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,183
Since when does the wife

298
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,894
have to be embarrassed
when the husband cheats on her?

299
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:28,232
You're awfully disrespectful
for a news anchor.

300
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,525
"Disrespectful"?

301
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,652
How many times have I told you?

302
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,863
I've never been disrespectful to you.

303
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,449
I always made sure he went home to sleep.

304
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,159
That's what makes me angry.

305
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,994
All he does at home is sleep.

306
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,788
He's useless! Is this a hotel or what?

307
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,165
That's enough. Let's go inside, okay?

308
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,125
Let go!

309
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,043
You only touch me when you do this.

310
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,298
What the…

311
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,510
I'll stand in the middle.

312
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,347
Look.

313
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,725
What are we competing for?

314
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:08,021
This man, who's all confused
and doesn't even know whose side to take?

315
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,316
I don't want to be involved
in this useless fight.

316
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,319
You two can make out
or break up all you want.

317
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,237
I don't care.

318
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,783
But do not set foot
in this house ever again. Got it?

319
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,458
Is your wife on something?

320
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,668
What's with her?

321
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,004
I wonder too.

322
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,673
Her face is not expressionless for once.

323
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,051
But I have no idea what she's thinking.

324
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,511
What?

325
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,638
I need to find out.

326
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,349
-Hey, go home.
-Wait…

327
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:53,025
Unbelievable. How dare she come here?

328
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,162
Your room is the other way.

329
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,456
What? Do you have amnesia too?

330
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,501
Come on. I didn't ask her to come by.
She barged in all of a sudden.

331
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:16,465
She drove in so smoothly.
Obviously, she's been here many times.

332
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,637
You're worse than her for making her
sneak into someone else's garage.

333
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,096
You're such a jerk.

334
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,600
Fine.

335
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,645
If calling me a jerk
makes you feel better, go for it.

336
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,356
Goodness. Look at you
blaming me for calling you a jerk

337
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,858
when you were the one
who did all sorts of bad stuff.

338
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,320
You're incredibly clever
when it comes to things like this.

339
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,864
Okay, fine. I heard you.

340
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,826
Can you please stop talking back
when something bothers you?

341
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,413
The more people notice
how much you've changed,

342
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,374
the more suspicious the shareholders get.

343
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,751
Don't act like you care about me.

344
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,545
I mean it.

345
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,838
You mean it?

346
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,592
Hey, they even made a movie
about a criminal's true feelings.

347
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,720
I don't care about your true feelings.

348
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,848
I have to wake up at 4:00 a.m.
and make grilled deodeok

349
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,601
which your father is craving,
so I have to go to bed.

350
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,478
Would you please get out now?

351
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,065
Okay.

352
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,447
"Good night," my foot.

353
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,173
I guess the next unit is empty.

354
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:49,683
The interior construction took a while.
It's finally presentable now.

355
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,769
The layout is different for every unit.

356
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:56,481
This is the largest unit.

357
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,568
But will you really be okay here?

358
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,820
What's wrong with this unit?

359
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,698
I came back to Korea
to invest in social enterprises.

360
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,575
To me, this is like a palace.

361
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,249
Hello.

362
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,754
Boss.

363
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,467
The ones who went to the prosecution
are all small fries,

364
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,052
so you don't need to worry.

365
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,095
They will get nothing out of them.

366
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,305
What about that girl?

367
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,891
I think she only knows
the leader of the World Cup Gang.

368
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,726
The underlings don't know who she is.

369
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,729
We're searching
the entire downtown area right now.

370
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:39,524
Who is this woman?
She vanished without a trace.

371
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,361
Where is she hiding
that you can't even find her?

372
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,696
We're sorry.

373
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,198
Seopyung is not a big city.

374
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,866
Is it?

375
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,163
How could she look just like her?

376
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,539
I still can't believe it.

377
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,917
What will you do now?

378
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,752
First, I should find the real Mi-na.

379
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,464
Please check the ER
at every hospital in the country.

380
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,801
So do you plan to look for her
without letting Hanju know?

381
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,178
We must find Mi-na first.

382
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:11,139
You said yourself
that we don't know what Hanju will do

383
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,725
if they found out
that she's not the real Kang Mi-na.

384
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,894
We must find her first no matter what.

385
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,901
Isn't he supposed to be the first
to get to work as the chairman?

386
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,194
What's taking him so long?

387
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:27,823
The security guard
will take over the company at this rate.

388
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:28,907
Goodness.

389
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,628
Did you hear that there will be

390
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,755
an extraordinary
shareholders' meeting today?

391
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,798
No, Father.

392
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,843
As you know,
I've been cooking all morning.

393
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,679
How could you be standing around
in the kitchen now?

394
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,931
If you had requested a piece of toast

395
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,100
instead of nine different dishes
for breakfast,

396
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:58,019
I wouldn't have had to stand around
in the kitchen.

397
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,479
It's such a shame.

398
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,359
Still no word
from the major shareholders yet?

399
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,569
No.

400
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:09,614
They called the meeting so urgently.
I don't think it's going to be easy.

401
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:14,828
Don't make a fool of yourself
and humiliate the entire family.

402
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,079
Just stay home.

403
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,415
Father!

404
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,086
Why don't you have
some deodeok before you leave?

405
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:27,299
I peeled and pounded it myself.

406
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,427
You should have pounded it more!

407
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,389
Gosh!

408
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,309
Serves you right.

409
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:40,228
Go make some juice
so we can drink it after breakfast.

410
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,231
Mom, you should stop.

411
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,357
What?

412
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:48,153
Compared to how I usually treat her,
I'm being an angel.

413
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,911
What about your breakfast?

414
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:01,791
Hey, be grateful
that I'm telling you to make juice.

415
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,376
If I wanted to be really mean,

416
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,504
I would've told you
to make sujeonggwa instead.

417
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,173
Mom, stop.

418
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,550
What? What's gotten into you?

419
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,344
I have something to say to Mi-na.

420
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:15,931
Mi-na, it's about the day
you got hit by that car.

421
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,892
I had told you to pick up my shoes,

422
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,269
and you never even went there.

423
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,147
Since you're not going
to the shareholders' meeting,

424
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,775
can you pick up my shoes
at the department store?

425
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,612
Before that,

426
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,031
get me some more soup.

427
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:45,210
Things are finally back to normal.

428
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,638
I should be grateful? Why?

429
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,224
What did I do wrong?

430
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,102
I'm a daughter-in-law, not a slave.

431
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,521
Why is everyone bossing me around?

432
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,939
Gosh.

433
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:08,483
We have to wash the curtains today.

434
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,526
Speed up.

435
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,611
Seriously? The curtains?

436
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,407
Ms. Kim, you heard them back there, right?

437
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,535
Hearing there will be
a shareholders' meeting about me,

438
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,495
they changed their attitudes completely.

439
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,622
Imagine it's decided at the meeting

440
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:26,001
that I don't get the management rights
and shares and I'm left with nothing.

441
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,504
What will they put me through
starting tomorrow?

442
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:34,509
Can't you go easy on me just today?

443
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,057
All right.

444
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,226
I'll take care of the curtains.

445
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,108
What? She didn't deny it.

446
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,943
I'm even more scared now.

447
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,529
Am I really doomed?

448
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,574
Darn it.

449
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,287
Gosh, seriously.

450
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,538
This is good.

451
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,332
What do I do?

452
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,672
Good morning.

453
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,679
She's on leave.

454
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,681
She hasn't come back yet.

455
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,350
Okay.

456
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,728
People keep asking for Ms. Cho.

457
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,647
Isn't she supposed to be back today?

458
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,732
I know.

459
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,568
She may have been taking bribes,
but she's been diligent.

460
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:36,571
Right. She's been
taking bribes diligently.

461
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,157
Good morning.

462
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,283
Hello.

463
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,036
Isn't Ms. Cho here yet?

464
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:47,749
What is it? Is something wrong?

465
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,628
She's been absent since yesterday
without extending her leave.

466
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,546
-Have you called her?
-Her phone is off.

467
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:57,759
Is she enjoying her vacation too much?

468
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,345
If you get hold of her,
tell her to call me.

469
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,846
Yes, sir.

470
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,517
See you.

471
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,479
Shouldn't we tell him?

472
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:13,191
That Division Two took away
the Hanju Group bribery case?

473
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:16,027
It seems like they're going to issue
a summons right away.

474
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,571
What if we tell him

475
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,740
and Ms. Cho throws a fit
when she gets back?

476
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,828
Where is she? What is she doing?

477
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,746
Does she even know this is an emergency?

478
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:28,998
The phone is turned off.

479
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,375
It's still turned off.

480
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:35,964
This is an emergency.

481
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,809
I'm so tired after waking up
at 4 a.m. every day.

482
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,785
I'll die of sleep deprivation
before anything can happen.

483
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:09,831
Ms. Kim.

484
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:11,708
Please go ahead.

485
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,838
Do you know what's four in the morning,
two in the afternoon, and three at night?

486
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,842
It's the number of meals
I prepared yesterday.

487
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,845
Four in the morning,
two in the afternoon, and three at night.

488
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,349
Why can't they just eat
all at the same time?

489
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,645
I'm constantly sleep-deprived,

490
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,356
I do all the housework myself,
and my husband is cheating on me.

491
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,484
I can't stand it anymore.

492
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,736
I'm going to that shareholders' meeting.

493
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:44,324
I'll prove my sanity there
and get my inheritance.

494
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:50,038
I refuse to be a puppet
who obediently does what she's told.

495
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,959
Don't forget to pick up
Sung-mi's shoes on your way back.

496
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,503
Yes, ma'am!

497
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,470
Trang.

498
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,266
Knife skills are supposed to be
muscle memory.

499
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,611
Honey.

500
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,989
I'm on your side.

501
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,201
If you really are,

502
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:31,162
why don't you eat
at the same time as everyone else?

503
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,206
You sleep during mealtime

504
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,458
and only show up
after I've put everything away.

505
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,502
Then I have to set the table
all over again.

506
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,422
Do you really have
to chew me out like that?

507
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,467
Let me remind you of one more thing.

508
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,845
You and I are the same types.

509
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,806
You wouldn't have married me
if I hadn't been an heir.

510
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,307
What are you saying?

511
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,768
Good luck at the meeting.

512
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,700
What's this car?

513
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,369
I bought it yesterday.

514
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:14,497
Our foundation started delivering
coal briquettes to people in need.

515
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:18,042
But the alleys where they live
were too narrow for my car.

516
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,086
So I'm using this for volunteer work only.

517
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,337
You're so fussy.

518
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,630
Wait a second.

519
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,050
-Are you going to work?
-Yes.

520
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,011
I'm trying to be there
at least twice a week.

521
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,138
Times have changed.

522
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,640
Somebody might raise an issue.

523
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:37,186
Why? Do people feel deprived
because I can slack off?

524
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,646
What can I do?

525
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,692
I was born with everything
except diligence.

526
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,736
Lucky you.

527
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,195
You didn't know?

528
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,453
Is she out of her mind?

529
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,545
Why bother to come home
and make dinner for those skanks?

530
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,715
If the meeting goes south,
I should just jump into the Han River.

531
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,176
Wait. Can I swim?

532
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:14,140
I'll pass the shareholders' meeting
no matter what.

533
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,817
Did the prime minister decide
to stay at Yumin Hotel in the end?

534
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,653
It seems so.

535
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,948
It's the same person and the same
work ethic. Isn't it strange?

536
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,116
I manage to make our department store,

537
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,786
distribution company,
and construction company number one.

538
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,497
So why I can't make our hotel number one?

539
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,584
The hotel industry is pretty conservative.

540
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:45,463
Do you think I don't know that?

541
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,882
I'm sorry, ma'am.

542
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,553
In the recent car accident,
why did you sue the driver for damages?

543
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,014
When we receive criticism
over matters like this,

544
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,600
it eventually hurts our image.

545
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,186
The PR team was so preoccupied
with covering up the fact

546
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:03,314
that the victim was Ms. Kang
that they failed to think about

547
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,442
the driver's situation
and just followed protocol.

548
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,238
Thanks to that,
all the criticism falls on me.

549
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,158
I'm the evil, cold-hearted one who
demanded money from an epilepsy patient

550
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,452
who had a seizure
because he couldn't afford his meds.

551
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,787
I'm sorry, ma'am.

552
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,666
When is my next meeting?

553
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,084
You don't have any today.

554
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,587
Wasn't the duty-free shop meeting today?

555
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,465
Well, due to the investigation,

556
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,843
we may not get the permit
to open a duty-free shop.

557
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,597
What do you mean? It has been resolved.

558
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,391
Another summons came.

559
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,561
The chairman's office
has notified us to wait.

560
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,939
Then let's go to the hospital.

561
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,276
If the Epilepsy Association
gives interviews

562
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:52,238
saying we're branding patients,
people will keep talking about this.

563
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,323
So donate a decent amount
to the association.

564
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,200
Yes, ma'am.

565
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,829
Don't give so little
that we get cursed out and make me faint

566
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,623
while watching the news at home again.

567
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,500
Yes, ma'am.

568
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,674
Don't you know how sensitive she is
about these things?

569
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,552
Add in the articles that she cares
about low-income households

570
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,138
and highly values the welfare system.

571
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:31,486
Madam. Welcome.

572
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:35,323
I heard my sister-in-law
ordered something.

573
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,324
Yes, she did.

574
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,951
Thank you for always coming in person.

575
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,496
Our shop is very grateful

576
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,956
for Hanju Group's attitude
of noblesse oblige.

577
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,417
So I was a gopher.

578
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,087
Pardon? What…

579
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,463
Nothing. Please go get it.

580
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,215
Okay.

581
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,182
You're a quick one.

582
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,141
And you get us.

583
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,603
Give her some tips too.

584
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,899
Hello there, Prosecutor.

585
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,026
Funny seeing you here.

586
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,570
Wasn't that a great tip?

587
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,073
Did you hit the jackpot with it already?

588
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,991
Do you know me?

589
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,535
I almost didn't recognize you.

590
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:24,914
I guess things are going well for you.

591
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,834
Who am I?

592
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:30,461
Who am I?

593
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,008
Right.

594
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,095
I made a mistake.

595
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,806
You look so much like someone I know.

596
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,100
I mistook you for someone else.

597
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,101
Sorry about that.

598
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,272
-No. Wait. Hold on.
-Madam.

599
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,314
Here.

600
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,567
Right.

601
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,695
Do you know him?

602
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,697
No, I think I mistook him
for someone else.

603
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,243
Did he just call me a prosecutor?

604
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,203
He's clearly a nouveau riche con artist.

605
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,414
I'm Hanju's daughter-in-law.

606
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,915
What kind of a life did I lead?

607
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,340
He wasn't taking his epilepsy medicine.

608
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,553
I found out later
that it was to save money.

609
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:26,058
We had a store but it failed
and we closed it a while back.

610
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,187
Seok-ho.

611
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,355
How could you cause such a big accident

612
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,399
because you were trying to save
a few bucks?

613
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,068
You even hit a person with your car.

614
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,364
The victim wasn't hurt too badly.

615
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,659
But it's unfortunate that the car
veered in that direction.

616
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,036
I know.

617
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,289
I'm so sorry for the damage
it caused the hotel.

618
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,499
That's why I'm here.

619
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,377
You don't need to worry about it.

620
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,881
He's lying here like this

621
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,551
and the entire burden will fall on you.

622
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:03,471
It just isn't right
to ask you to compensate us.

623
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:06,390
Then…

624
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,393
It's the hardest right now for you
as you nurse your husband.

625
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:13,773
I know because my grandfather was ill
for a very long time.

626
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,986
Hire a caretaker with this.

627
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,280
You should get some rest.

628
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,157
And…

629
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,203
you need to take care of yourself too.

630
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,830
My gosh.

631
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,833
I never knew there were people high up
who were so kind.

632
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,085
Thank you.

633
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,713
What do you mean, "high up?"

634
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,592
Actually, we had to cancel
all of our insurance policies,

635
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,511
so we have no money coming in

636
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,098
and I was worried about
how to reimburse the hotel.

637
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,435
I wanted to just die.

638
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,437
Thank you.

639
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,439
Thank you.

640
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,534
Wet wipes.

641
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,299
Why are there still so many
negative comments?

642
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,134
Did I throw water on someone's face

643
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,428
or assault someone
after paying them for it?

644
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,096
Don't you get it?

645
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,515
Everyone is always ready
to pounce on people like me

646
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,642
to drag us down
if we make one little mistake.

647
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,936
Even my father.

648
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,604
I'm sorry.

649
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:40,484
How long must I do everything myself?

650
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,158
Your memory isn't something

651
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,493
you can get back quickly
just because you want to.

652
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:51,954
I see.

653
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,042
Did you remember anything else
when you went home?

654
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,503
No. Everything felt unfamiliar.

655
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,758
Simply put, in your situation,

656
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,093
the memories themselves were not damaged.

657
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,013
There's a problem in the process
of bringing up those memories.

658
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,057
You will recover.

659
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,309
The problem is how long it'll take.

660
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:18,314
Trying to live without your memories

661
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,692
can be stressful
even if you're unaware of it.

662
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,112
So let's relax while you're here.

663
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,322
Okay.

664
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,669
Do you remember anything?

665
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:46,884
If I remember the past,
do I just talk about it to you?

666
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:52,348
This isn't hypnosis or anything like that.

667
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,318
Are you close to my mother-in-law?

668
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,072
Definitely not.

669
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:11,534
I have a duty
to maintain patient confidentiality.

670
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,828
Don't worry. Relax.

671
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:18,541
Try to remember the past.

672
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,467
How was it before you woke up
in the hospital?

673
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,896
Grandma.

674
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,317
Grandma.

675
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,127
Let's go back further

676
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,129
rather than remembering recent memories.

677
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,132
Try to remember your mom and dad

678
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:10,217
from your childhood.

679
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,484
What do you remember?

680
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,196
I think he's my father.

681
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,032
But I can't remember.

682
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:35,868
It hurts.

683
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,162
How do you feel?

684
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,663
What emotions do you feel?

685
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,298
Don't try too hard to remember
if it's difficult.

686
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,717
Your father was the chairman
of a large corporation,

687
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,428
so he may have been very strict.

688
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,558
If it will cause more stress
to try to remember,

689
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,437
it is better not to push it.
Let's wait for it to come back on its own.

690
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,398
Okay.

691
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,361
You may not have any symptoms as of now,

692
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:11,695
but if your head hurts

693
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,448
or you get very nauseous or queasy,

694
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,033
come to the hospital right away.

695
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:21,914
It may help to go back
to the scene of the accident,

696
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,751
but given your current state,

697
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,294
I don't recommend it right now.

698
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,047
The scene of the accident?

699
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:36,720
There was no woman
brought to any ER in the country

700
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:40,432
on that day who matches
Kang Mi-na's description.

701
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:44,353
I looked into it just in case

702
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:49,358
Chairman Kang Jang-soo
had other illegitimate children.

703
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,194
But just around the time
Kang Mi-na showed up,

704
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,405
his wife, with her temper,

705
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,408
didn't just tie it off,

706
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:58,826
she burned it real good.

707
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,371
So it can never recover.

708
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,500
She went through
his entire past back then,

709
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:09,044
so I'd say it's safe to assume

710
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,797
that there are
no other illegitimate children.

711
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,426
I see.

712
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:19,763
She just looks so much like her,
which is pretty fascinating.

713
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,808
Let's go to the site
where the accident occurred.

714
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,896
Does he think
I'm his secretary or something?

715
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,483
You want me to tag along, right?

716
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:37,740
Let's see. 7, 43…

717
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,033
Hey, look.

718
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,743
The business keeps us busy enough.

719
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:44,455
Let's stop helping Yeon-ju
and cleaning up the mess for her.

720
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:49,126
When she shows up,
let's tell her that we're out.

721
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,419
You know,

722
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,463
true gangsters don't make a move

723
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,632
just because someone asks them for help.

724
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,343
We're not true gangsters.

725
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:58,469
Good point.

726
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:01,430
Anyway, we can only tell her
if she shows up.

727
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,600
-The situation looks quite serious.
-Why?

728
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:07,144
I called the Prosecutors' Office,

729
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:10,314
but she wasn't there
when she was supposed to return yesterday.

730
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,108
Something must've happened.

731
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,361
It's time to make a move.

732
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:23,994
What?

733
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,163
She works with those losers?

734
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,249
Apparently, she's been seen here
a few times.

735
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,960
We might find something
once we start digging.

736
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,420
They may look like losers,

737
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,589
but maybe they were
hotshots in their prime.

738
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,342
Anyway, call the guys right away
if they make a move.

739
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,426
Will do.

740
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:49,269
He drove at 80km per hour
and crashed into this spot here.

741
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:53,524
I'll stand here.

742
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,859
Can you drive in all the way here?

743
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,499
Well…

744
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,461
If he came from over there
and crashed into this spot,

745
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,131
he had to have turned the wheel
somewhere over there.

746
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,550
Someone with epilepsy

747
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:24,346
who supposedly drove straight unconscious
turned the wheel?

748
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,432
It is strange,

749
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:29,518
but what exactly
are you trying to find out?

750
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,688
Maybe it was done on purpose.

751
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,732
-Why?
-That I'll have to find out.

752
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,610
Who was the target?

753
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:41,655
Was it that woman or Kang Mi-na?

754
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,410
Anyway, since this already happened,

755
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:49,788
the fake Mi-na must inherit everything
no matter what.

756
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,039
What?

757
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:55,627
If someone was after the real Mi-na,
this is the only way we can protect her.

758
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,672
The more important she becomes,
the harder it'll be to hurt her.

759
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:02,676
Didn't you say you had to meet with her?

760
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:05,179
Then shouldn't we find her first?

761
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,389
I'm trying to do both at the same time.

762
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,893
There are two ways
to find someone in the dark.

763
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:14,271
Either shine a light
on the person you're trying to find,

764
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,733
or shine a light on yourself
so that person can find you.

765
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:27,701
Excuse us for a moment.

766
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,624
I guess you're going
to the Yumin shareholders' meeting.

767
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:36,793
I have to say,
you have such good foresight.

768
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:40,797
I always wondered why you'd kept
your shares in our in-laws' company.

769
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:44,134
Practically all conglomerates
are connected through marriage.

770
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,970
Stop getting on my nerves.
Just get your hair done and leave.

771
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:50,724
I heard some rumors
when I was at the sauna earlier.

772
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:55,187
About the shareholders' meeting
at Mi-na's family's company,

773
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:59,983
I heard it's being held unexpectedly
because her aunt pushed for it.

774
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:05,447
Apparently, it's because
of what someone did last night.

775
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,410
Did you want to stomp on her
to put her back in her place?

776
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,870
Or she'll gain too much power

777
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,373
if you just leave her be,
so you want to keep her in check?

778
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,209
What are you talking about?

779
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,546
Stop acting like you're a nice person.

780
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:21,922
You're the nastiest one here.

781
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:26,218
You acted like you cared about her
and used her like crazy.

782
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:29,221
Even the day of the accident,
you sent her there

783
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,723
so you could dump it all on her
if things went south.

784
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,644
Why are you telling me all this?

785
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:38,480
Don't get the wrong idea.

786
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:42,192
I can be mean,
but I don't want to be your enemy.

787
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:46,446
I know I can't beat you,
so I should at least side with you.

788
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:48,782
You'll side with me?

789
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,452
Don't think we can share
Hanju Group together.

790
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,205
Hanju is like one big chunk of gold.

791
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:59,626
If anyone snatches it from me,
I'll cut off the person's hand.

792
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,108
The memories of the day of the accident.

793
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:26,486
According to the official schedule,

794
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:40,709
I, Kang Mi-na, left the hotel
after the auction.

795
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:45,339
Then how come I didn't get into my car?

796
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,469
Why was I standing here?

797
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,639
And why did I end up
getting hit by another car?

798
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:01,021
The culprit always returns
to the scene of the crime.

799
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,814
What's with her though?

800
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,691
-What do you mean?
-What is she wearing?

801
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,318
Is she still on a stakeout?

802
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,112
My gosh, it's already…

803
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,742
Time seems to fly by
only when I'm not doing chores.

804
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:16,828
Yes. This shareholders' meeting
must go well

805
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,538
for me to have more free time.

806
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,294
Hey.

807
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,965
What happened?

808
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,344
-Do I know you?
-What? What's with you?

809
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,887
We don't have time to crack jokes.

810
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:40,394
Everyone who claims to know me
looks like a scumbag.

811
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,776
What? What is going on?

812
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:58,995
My, look who's here.

813
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,039
It's been a while, missy.

814
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,960
-Who are you?
-Don't act like you don't know us.

815
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:08,130
Don't you remember
throwing flying kicks at us?

816
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:13,969
What is going on?

817
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,638
Did they tail us?

818
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,809
My eyesight is getting worse
due to old age.

819
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:23,854
Missy, we still have to finish
our conversation.

820
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:27,649
I'm in a rush to attend
a very important meeting.

821
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,693
You don't want to pull a trick here.

822
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:32,738
Let's talk when I'm back, okay?

823
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:33,989
Are you kidding me?

824
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,335
At that moment, I just knew

825
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:51,006
that there is no way I am Kang Mi-na.

826
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,936
She is my niece,

827
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,814
but I'm not sure if she can be
the head of the company

828
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,317
because of all the unsavory rumors
about her.

829
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,403
Rumor has it that she suffered

830
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,697
a serious brain injury
due to a car accident

831
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:19,993
and that she's been acting strange
because she's lost her sanity,

832
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:22,954
so we must find out whether or not
the rumors are true.

833
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,294
She has amnesia,

834
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:32,255
so in a way,
she's like a dementia patient.

835
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,674
Are you sure…

836
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:39,429
you want to leave Yumin in her hands?

837
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,267
From what I've heard,

838
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,854
she's currently dealing
with some serious memory problems.

839
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,942
Knowing that, how could we
entrust her with Yumin Group?

840
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:59,908
I believe receiving treatment
should be her priority now.

841
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,619
I wanted to hear
what she had to say today,

842
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,246
but she's not here yet.

843
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,915
Maybe this is her answer.

844
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,975
Why are you doing this to me?
Do you know me?

845
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,309
No! How should I know…

846
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,690
Why are you doing this to me?
And why am I such a good fighter?

847
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,656
Why are you doing this to me?
Do you know me? Tell me!

848
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,910
Yeon-ju.

849
00:52:57,465 --> 00:53:00,260
My father founded Yumin Group,

850
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:03,471
and my brother dedicated his life
to growing the company.

851
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:08,894
The future of the Yumin family
depends on us.

852
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:13,398
I ask all of you
to make this decision carefully.

853
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:18,987
Under Article 4, Clause 1
of the Shareholders' Meeting Rules,

854
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,363
let's take a vote

855
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,741
on whether Ms. Kang Mi-na
should inherit the group.

856
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,296
What?

857
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,089
One of the two major shareholders

858
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,467
who hold 32 percent
of Yumin Group is Alex Chang,

859
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,177
also known as Han Seung-wook.

860
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,596
The other is his stepfather.

861
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,514
He married Mr. Han's mother.

862
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:49,392
Mr. Han Seung-wook is currently in Korea.

863
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:57,692
Is he coming to the shareholders' meeting?

864
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,827
I'm shining a light on myself
to make them come to us.

865
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:11,456
If anyone knows about the real Kang Mi-na,

866
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,334
they'll get in touch with Yumin,

867
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,835
not Hanju.

868
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:50,829
I'm sorry I'm late.

869
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,664
I'm Alex from Prix Fund.

870
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,961
The other shareholder is my stepfather.

871
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:02,716
He is abroad at the moment
and has transferred all his rights to me.

872
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:11,766
But you got there on your own.
No one handed it over to you.

873
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,769
Keep it up. Do your best.

874
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:23,778
My stepfather and I
own 32 percent of Yumin Electronics,

875
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,905
which is the holding company
of Yumin Group.

876
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,951
Put that together with 22 percent, which
Ms. Kang has automatically inherited,

877
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:31,953
and it's a majority.

878
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:37,417
I believe Ms. Kang has the capacity

879
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,004
to lead Yumin Group
and is the rightful heiress.

880
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:43,673
I support…

881
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:46,885
her succession to the group.

882
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,771
Some of you seem to be against the idea,

883
00:55:58,772 --> 00:55:59,898
but what can you do?

884
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,192
Hating someone doesn't give you power.

885
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,694
Who votes for someone they don't like?

886
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,279
Everyone votes for who they like.

887
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:32,972
Are you okay?

888
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,270
Who are you? Who am I?

889
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:40,897
Why am I so good at fighting?

890
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,857
You're the heiress to the Nammoon Gang.

891
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,567
Of course you're good at fighting.

892
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:46,069
The Nammoon Gang?

893
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,034
What?

894
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,869
Why does this come so naturally to me?

895
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,038
Am I really a gangster or something?

896
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:24,691
The more people notice
how much you've changed,

897
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,401
the more suspicious the shareholders get.

898
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:29,195
That Yumin Group's heiress
has a psychological problem…

899
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:32,240
Don't make a fool of yourself
and humiliate the entire family.

900
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,918
-Gosh.
-Get up.

901
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:45,044
Darn it.

902
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,177
He didn't show up at Grandpa's funeral,

903
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,305
and I heard he got a job in the US,

904
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,015
so I must've let my guard down.

905
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,727
His stepfather,
who married Auntie a few years back,

906
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,021
has been abroad for a long time.

907
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:06,065
Auntie passed away last month.

908
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,485
-In the US?
-Yes.

909
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,280
At least she lived comfortably
in her later years.

910
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:16,576
Anyway, why did he have to show up
at the meeting and support Mi-na?

911
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,954
We'll have to find out.

912
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:25,084
Tell him to come over.
Let's have dinner together or something.

913
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:28,755
Also, about Mi-na…

914
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,341
After the recent incident,

915
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:34,552
is she revealing her true colors?

916
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,179
It's bothering me too.

917
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:41,267
I don't think she's going to continue
to be our puppet.

918
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,354
The shareholders won't just sit back.

919
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:47,065
When they corner her,

920
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:49,692
we'll have to make her think
we're helping her.

921
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,612
Yes. Except for her aunt,

922
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,031
all the other shareholders are
on her maternal side.

923
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:57,867
They won't hand over control so easily.

924
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:01,120
Even if she got lucky
and passed the shareholders' meeting,

925
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:04,415
she'll have to give in to me in the end.

926
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:15,969
What? Who am I?

927
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,387
Why am I so good at fighting?

928
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,389
You're the heiress to the Nammoon Gang.

929
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,057
Of course you're good at fighting.

930
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:26,271
I'm still baffled by the fact
that I'm not Kang Mi-na.

931
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,772
And now I'm a gangster?

932
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:30,775
Hold on.

933
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:35,029
Am I in a situation
like Jun Ji-hyun in Assassination?

934
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:35,947
Did my twin sister

935
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,575
grow up in a rich family
whereas I grew up in the gutter?

936
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,495
Who cares?

937
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,707
I don't have parents.
How am I going to prove it?

938
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:50,336
INCOMING CALL
SELFISH JERK

939
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,797
-What?
-I said I'm on your side, right?

940
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,799
Never forget that.

941
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:56,217
What are you talking about?

942
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:59,387
I heard you passed
the shareholders' meeting.

943
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:02,473
Where are you anyway?
Why didn't you go to the meeting?

944
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,683
What?

945
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,894
Honey?

946
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:10,189
I'm not Kang Mi-na.

947
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:13,526
Why did they decide
without asking my opinion?

948
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:16,279
Wait a second.

949
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:17,655
If I'm not Kang Mi-na,

950
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:20,158
what about all my rude behavior so far?

951
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:26,789
"Understand?" You mean
I should just keep my mouth shut.

952
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:27,790
Be quiet!

953
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,584
Is this a shouting match?

954
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,127
Are we at a gambling joint or something?

955
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,588
Why did you suddenly shout?
You startled me!

956
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:36,758
Mi-na. Treating your in-laws this way

957
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,760
is like spitting
on your own face. So stop.

958
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:39,886
Darn it!

959
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:44,098
Oh, no.

960
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:47,226
Hold on.

961
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,646
It's not like I said something wrong.

962
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,357
I doubt I'll be found dead somewhere
or anything.

963
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,443
After that, who cares?
Her parents and siblings are dead.

964
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:59,572
Even if something happens to her
in this house, no one will care.

965
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:04,077
They might really kill me.

966
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,372
What do I do?

967
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:11,918
Okay.

968
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:15,463
From now on, I'll do my best

969
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:17,757
to pretend to be Kang Mi-na.

970
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:24,222
I'll try to be elegant
as if I've been rich all my life.

971
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:42,490
-Welcome home.
-Hi.

972
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:46,327
Didn't you hear Father tell you
to stay home this morning?

973
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,747
You fell into a huge fortune,

974
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:52,417
so you won't listen to anything
your in-laws say anymore.

975
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:53,960
Mother.

976
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:57,213
What? Can't I even say that?

977
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:59,674
Must I watch what I say like a celebrity?

978
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:00,758
Am I wrong?

979
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:04,053
You should say where you're going
if you're going out.

980
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,055
How dare you show your emotions?

981
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,725
How dare you show others
how your situation has changed?

982
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:10,309
Don't talk back to her.

983
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:13,813
It isn't all yours yet.
And even if it is, I won't bat an eye.

984
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:18,276
But my temper
won't let me stay quiet and not talk back.

985
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:22,029
Just don't listen to her.

986
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:25,450
Think about something else.
Keep subtracting 7 from 100.

987
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:29,537
So, 93, 86…

988
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,873
Even girls from good families
bow their heads

989
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:33,291
in front of their in-laws--

990
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:36,419
Next is 79.

991
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:39,046
Then 72.

992
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,301
What's wrong with her eyes?

993
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:46,763
You'll kill someone with those eyes.

994
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:49,974
Now, it's 65, then 58.

995
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:55,521
-What did you say, Mother?
-Oh, my gosh.

996
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,315
This girl is out of control.

997
01:02:57,398 --> 01:02:59,525
Hey! Do you want to get kicked out?

998
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,153
Do you know what happens
when you sue a rich family for divorce?

999
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:05,198
If we go to court,
we must calculate the assets to split,

1000
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,909
so they'll track the sources
of your son's undisclosed income

1001
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:08,993
separate from his stock

1002
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:11,621
and his salary as an executive
of Hanju Department Store.

1003
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:12,997
Why am I saying this?

1004
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,169
You must've thought about it
over and over again.

1005
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:20,963
That's why it's just pouring out
as soon as I mentioned "divorce".

1006
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,507
-That's not true.
-My son what?

1007
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:24,675
Source of income what?

1008
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:29,096
Mother, that's not it.

1009
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,306
It's a misunderstanding…

1010
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:34,185
-Mi-na. Did you have to say that?
-What?

1011
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:42,610
It was Mother's attitude,
which was why you were angry.

1012
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,362
I totally understand.

1013
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,405
But…

1014
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:54,539
Why do I keep glaring?
Why do I keep saying weird things?

1015
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:58,125
Darn it. What is in this head of mine?

1016
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:00,545
I'm back.

1017
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:03,840
Stop acting.

1018
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,716
Get ready and come in.

1019
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:07,718
It didn't work.

1020
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:10,555
Darn it.

1021
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:19,730
Ms. Kim.

1022
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:21,399
I'm sure you've heard.

1023
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:23,276
I'm no longer a homebody.

1024
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,736
I'm the CEO of a group.

1025
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,781
How long must I wash cockles for?

1026
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:34,954
Ms. Kim, how long do I have to wash these?

1027
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:40,042
Until you swear you will never eat
spicy cockles ever again.

1028
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,377
It didn't work.

1029
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:46,007
They always eat like it's a feast.

1030
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,633
Why are we making so much food?

1031
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:50,720
The older uncle's son is coming over.

1032
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:53,931
I guess that would make him
your cousin-in-law.

1033
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:57,143
-The one that came from the US?
-Yes.

1034
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,812
Why are we going out of our way for him?

1035
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,690
This is a lot even for someone
who saved your life.

1036
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:06,277
I don't know the details, but I hear
he helped this family a lot today.

1037
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,653
He did?

1038
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:11,699
How much of a loser must you be
to receive help from a guy like him?

1039
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:19,957
Hello?

1040
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:21,918
It's Auntie.

1041
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,755
Hello, Auntie.

1042
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:27,924
To what do I owe the pleasure, Auntie?

1043
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:31,719
-Let's meet. I need to talk to you.
-What?

1044
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:33,304
Come out right now?

1045
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,765
Of course, I will.

1046
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:39,143
Who cares about dinner
when my aunt wants to see me?

1047
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:41,979
What's wrong with her?

1048
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:44,982
Hey. Listen to me, will you?

1049
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,984
Yes. Come to our hotel.

1050
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,611
I'll rush right over and wait.

1051
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,071
What?

1052
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:51,822
Right now?

1053
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:54,158
No. Wait up.

1054
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:57,286
Gosh. You can take your time. Of course.

1055
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,830
Oh, no. I need to finish
washing the cockles. Oh, dear.

1056
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:01,874
Yes, that's right.

1057
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:06,003
You need to be born with a cunning brain.

1058
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:09,548
Can it get that developed
after hurting your head?

1059
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,889
Wait. Hold on.

1060
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,436
-Turn the car around.
-Yes, ma'am.

1061
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:25,231
She's in really bad shape.

1062
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:53,384
Help me.

1063
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,138
One word from you, Uncle,

1064
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:58,889
and it'll be over.

1065
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:03,602
You can save my mother's brother

1066
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,479
and my mom's entire family.

1067
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:08,899
Why must I save your family?

1068
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:13,029
Think of what your dad did to our company.

1069
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:15,781
What's to say
your mom's family won't do it again?

1070
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:18,284
This is what your grandfather
wants as well.

1071
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:22,663
Just as you got on your knees
to protect your family,

1072
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:25,416
I must protect my family.

1073
01:07:57,073 --> 01:08:00,076
Did you seriously get
all decked out for dinner?

1074
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:01,368
Why aren't you going in?

1075
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:04,914
Where are you going? You didn't come
to the shareholders' meeting.

1076
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:06,540
How did you know I didn't go?

1077
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:08,084
What?

1078
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:11,212
Well, because…

1079
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:12,963
Are you following me?

1080
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,342
Come to think of it…

1081
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:19,762
Sure, you could be
at Grandfather's remembrance service.

1082
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:22,515
But you eavesdropped
on this family with me.

1083
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,767
And you know I didn't go
to the shareholders' meeting.

1084
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:29,230
Now you know my in-laws walk all over me,
you think you can do the same?

1085
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:30,773
-That's not it.
-Are you

1086
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:33,943
following me around hoping you can
con me into giving you something?

1087
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:37,196
If so, don't bother. I'm no pushover.

1088
01:08:57,341 --> 01:08:58,759
So?

1089
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:02,304
What exactly do you want to do in Korea?

1090
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:06,183
I want to support a company
that wants to better the world.

1091
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:08,227
I've created a few
non-profit organizations too.

1092
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:12,481
I heard about the shareholders' meeting.

1093
01:09:13,023 --> 01:09:16,026
People only do things for themselves.

1094
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:19,947
If they appear to be doing something
for someone else,

1095
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:23,075
it's because that someone
will bring them profit somehow.

1096
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:28,038
What is your real reason
for coming to Korea?

1097
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,417
You must feel guilty.

1098
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,002
What are you after?

1099
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,796
Now that you have a solid supporter,

1100
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,925
you want to own Sung-woon's wife
and reclaim the company?

1101
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,970
You say "reclaim".

1102
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:44,930
Does that mean it was originally mine?

1103
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:50,227
You've become much more audacious.

1104
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,522
Before, you couldn't even come inside

1105
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:55,524
and begged on your knees
in the front yard.

1106
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,444
I have no reason not to be.

1107
01:09:59,236 --> 01:10:02,823
Because I'm not as powerless
as Mother and I were back then.

1108
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:06,952
You seem to be mistaken.

1109
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:11,248
Your mom didn't leave
because she was powerless

1110
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:13,751
but because she had decided
to handle it herself.

1111
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:18,422
Try it. Do what you want.

1112
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,007
I'll watch.

1113
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:22,051
I will.

1114
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:24,511
Keep watching.

1115
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:27,014
See if this rain is a passing shower

1116
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:30,100
or a typhoon
that will wipe everything away.

1117
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:51,080
EPILOGUE

1118
01:11:35,582 --> 01:11:38,085
I'm Alex from Prix Fund.

1119
01:11:38,168 --> 01:11:41,005
I believe Ms. Kang has the capacity
to lead Yumin Group

1120
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:43,549
and is the rightful heiress.

1121
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:47,636
I support her succession to the group.

1122
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:03,152
But you got there on your own.
No one handed it over to you.

1123
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:06,447
Keep it up. Do your best.

1124
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,176
Are you sure this space was disinfected?

1125
01:13:09,259 --> 01:13:10,219
Yes, ma'am.

1126
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:14,014
Why hit a person at my hotel
of all places?

1127
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:15,516
And with that filthy car.

1128
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,060
The accident wasn't supposed
to happen here,

1129
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:20,771
so when Ms. Kang Mi-na suddenly showed up,

1130
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:22,064
he got flustered.

1131
01:13:22,856 --> 01:13:26,068
He can't even do one thing right
and won't die.

1132
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:30,072
Those poor rats are awfully stupid
but always live so long.

1133
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:34,451
Do I really have to take care
of their hospital bills?

1134
01:13:38,705 --> 01:13:40,541
Mi-na is incredibly lucky.

1135
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:45,629
She didn't die, yet she remembers nothing.

1136
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:49,383
Keep a watchful eye on her.

1137
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:50,968
Yes, ma'am.

1138
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:57,433
-What is this?
-The official biography of Kang Mi-na.

1139
01:13:57,516 --> 01:14:01,311
"Mother had decided to handle it herself."

1140
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:02,271
What could this mean?

1141
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:04,690
That woman is like our weapon.

1142
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:06,191
We should keep her
so we can use her when we need.

1143
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:07,693
Who's the one closest to Ms. Cho?

1144
01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:09,820
Tell them to go to her home.

1145
01:14:09,903 --> 01:14:11,071
What if I get arrested

1146
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:13,282
for impersonating Kang Mi-na
when I'm actually a gangster?

1147
01:14:13,365 --> 01:14:15,367
One moment I'm fine,
the next I'm totally out of my mind.

1148
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:19,204
Why must she climb her way up
and make me drag her down?

1149
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:23,584
I'll step on you on my way up
and show you what a speck of dust can do!
