1
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,915
Apparently, the test revealed

2
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,836
an extremely important fact
that couldn't be overlooked.

3
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,757
So I'd like to ask Chairman Kang
for an explanation here

4
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,425
and hold her responsible.

5
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:55,764
To prevent any suspicion
of tampering with the results,

6
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,891
I'll open the envelope here.

7
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,610
STR ANALYSIS AND PATERNITY TEST RESULTS

8
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:12,906
I know you're all busy.
I'll go straight to the important part.

9
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,703
"An analysis of 15 DNA markers

10
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,372
of Kang Jang-soo and Kang Mi-na reveals

11
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:27,170
that they share 14 out of 15 alleles…"

12
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,218
Well…

13
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,262
Give me a second.

14
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,266
What are you waiting for? Read on.

15
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,476
Okay.

16
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,817
"Based on the amount of DNA
shared between the two,

17
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,653
the probability of paternity

18
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:58,118
is 99.9999%."

19
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,245
MATCH

20
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,289
99.9999 PERCENT

21
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,167
I'm Chairman Kang Jang-soo's
biological child?

22
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,966
What did you just say?

23
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,845
Why?

24
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:27,313
Why must I give you an explanation
and be held responsible?

25
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,692
I've been dogged
by these rumors all my life.

26
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,902
This is just too much!

27
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:42,871
Well…

28
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,498
What I mean is…

29
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,043
Collecting biological samples
without written consent

30
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,880
from the test subject is against
the Personal Information Protection Act.

31
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,594
It's regrettable that Hanju Group provided
my DNA samples without my consent.

32
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,392
But I'll have to calm myself down.

33
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,646
I have an important announcement
to make myself too.

34
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,774
I, Kang Mi-na,

35
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,904
will step down as Yumin Group's chairman.

36
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,239
-What?
-Is she serious?

37
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,909
-That's so sudden.
-Unbelievable.

38
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:21,951
I became the chairman

39
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,370
without enough preparation
and have had many difficulties.

40
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:28,458
I also feel responsible for being
the subject of these negative rumors.

41
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,837
From now on, the group will be run
by professional managers.

42
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,049
Also, all my shares and rights
will be transferred

43
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,676
to the major shareholder
of Yumin Group's holding company,

44
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,848
Mr. Han Seung-wook.

45
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,852
That's absurd!

46
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,608
I think you should move out of that house.

47
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,653
Are you telling me
to quit pretending to be Kang Mi-na?

48
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,780
Will you be able to face her family?

49
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,617
If I'd known,
I would've stolen a few handbags.

50
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,245
What will happen to the company then?

51
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,496
She'll have to quit.

52
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:11,084
The chairman position wouldn't have suited
the real Mi-na either.

53
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,962
She could announce it
at the shareholders' meeting.

54
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,215
I thank all the shareholders

55
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,550
for trusting me so far.

56
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,391
YUMIN ELECTRONICS
GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS

57
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,779
What on earth just happened?

58
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,407
Why am I Chairman Kang's biological child?

59
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,534
Maybe someone tampered with the results.

60
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,785
Who…

61
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,787
Who would've done that?

62
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,706
The envelope was opened
in front of everyone.

63
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,749
About the samples…

64
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,085
They must've gotten them
from Chairman Han's house, right?

65
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,920
Maybe they accidentally collected

66
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,922
the real Kang Mi-na's DNA.

67
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,302
I doubt that I could ever get so lucky.

68
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,680
If not, there's no way
to explain the results.

69
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,639
I know.

70
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,935
Could they be putting on an act
as part of their scheme?

71
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:15,106
But they seemed to be
just as shocked as we were.

72
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,901
-Gosh.
-How strange.

73
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,612
Ms. Kang.

74
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,994
There must have been a mistake.

75
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,997
But at least it'll affect
our stock prices favorably--

76
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,081
Ms. Han.

77
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,917
-Yes?
-By any chance,

78
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,379
have you been thinking of me
as your rival?

79
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,717
Did you come up with this scheme
to get rid of me?

80
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,262
-It's not like that.
-You're lying.

81
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,847
Do you think you can fool me?

82
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,724
Was your goal

83
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,559
to attack me, Kang Eun-hwa,

84
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,853
publicly all along?

85
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,772
Then you succeeded.

86
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,649
The reporters you brought in
have already published articles.

87
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,195
The internet is blowing up.
What will happen to my position in Yumin?

88
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,571
You…

89
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,658
Was my existence
such a huge threat to you?

90
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:11,496
Is that why you've been so friendly to me?

91
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,789
Were you scared of me?

92
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,415
Get your hand off me!

93
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,005
CHAIRMAN KANG'S SUDDEN RESIGNATION

94
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,508
LEAVES PUBLIC WONDERING
THE OBVIOUS PATERNITY TEST RESULTS

95
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,302
Boy, this is humiliating.

96
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,262
So they are biologically related?

97
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,389
Mi-na even publicly criticized Hanju Group

98
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,767
for providing her DNA samples
without her consent.

99
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,812
People are already suspecting
that you two are separated.

100
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,315
She has no respect for her in-laws.

101
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,400
Which of you provided her hair sample?

102
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,861
-Was it you?
-No way.

103
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,988
-Was it you then?
-No.

104
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,408
What's that look on your face? Was it you?

105
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,618
No, it wasn't.

106
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,329
Then what did Sung-hye mean earlier?

107
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,914
It must have been her.

108
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,834
That's why she said that.

109
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,460
By the way,

110
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,629
how could Mi-na's ovaries become healthier

111
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,589
after her brain injury?

112
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,718
Does the brain affect fertility?

113
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,263
-She lied.
-What?

114
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,307
Just look at what she's done.
She can lie about anything.

115
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,102
She probably made that up
to make you stop bothering her.

116
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,146
My goodness.

117
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:24,652
Hold on. Since Mi-na did step down,

118
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,906
does that mean Sung-hye won?

119
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,617
She did,

120
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,162
although Mi-na let her win.

121
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,165
You two made fools of yourselves.

122
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,916
Shame on you.

123
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,427
What were you cooking up with Yumin Group?

124
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,140
I thought it would benefit Hanju Group
as well to clear up the matter.

125
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,766
You did it for Hanju Group?

126
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,312
You're like a cat
bringing dead mice to its owner.

127
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:03,483
You fell for fake news and did something
that wouldn't help anyone.

128
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,611
My, this is humiliating.

129
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,865
Just when I was thinking
Sung-woon was coming to his senses.

130
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,452
Don't do anything stupid again.

131
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,288
What you're attacking is my company.

132
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,796
HANJU HOTEL

133
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,089
Can we talk for a minute?

134
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,387
How could you make such a decision
without asking me?

135
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,683
I don't see why I should ask your opinion

136
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,977
regarding my position at Yumin Group.

137
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,983
Then what will happen
to your relationship with my family?

138
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,403
You don't need me in your house
anymore anyway, do you?

139
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,197
I've lost all my rights in Yumin now.

140
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,742
Everything you've been planning
to do with me,

141
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,327
you can do with Mr. Han.

142
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,873
I don't want you to be my enemy.

143
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,044
You're valuable to me.

144
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,505
Valuable?

145
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,801
I did a bad job of raising my children.

146
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,136
I know times have changed,

147
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,472
but my daughters-in-law
are my children too.

148
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,601
I wanted to think of you
as my newly-gained child.

149
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,980
You can always
take back your announcement, can't you?

150
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,315
Seung-wook belongs to Hanju Group
in some sense too.

151
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,112
You talk about your children

152
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:34,365
as if they were your possessions.

153
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,783
If you did a bad job of raising them,

154
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,327
do you think you can replace them
with new ones?

155
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:43,374
Did you think I'd be grateful
that you think of me as your own child?

156
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,003
I couldn't be more relieved
that I'm not one of your children.

157
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,380
I'll get going now.

158
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,606
Are you sure
you didn't mess up the test results?

159
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,816
I handed them over
as soon as I received them.

160
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,652
Are you saying
you didn't do anything wrong?

161
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:15,406
Then whose fault is it?

162
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:30,046
Director, the team is ready to update you
regarding the hosting of the APEC summit.

163
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,923
-Postpone it.
-Yes, ma'am.

164
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,383
Right.

165
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,594
In case they misunderstand,

166
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,096
I'm just having a hard time
controlling my emotions today.

167
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,222
Yes, ma'am.

168
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,517
You're always under a lot of stress,
so you need to let it out.

169
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,937
I've learned from
many people of similar status.

170
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:51,150
Many people are given
what they have as a birthright,

171
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,653
but you always have to work for it.

172
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,447
So I've always thought
you must be under a lot of stress.

173
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,449
You may go.

174
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,825
I was out of line.

175
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,129
Find out what happened.

176
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,590
Right now.

177
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:15,925
Yes, ma'am.

178
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,098
HANJU, ARSON, HIT-AND-RUN

179
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,892
CHAIRMAN HAN, CHIEF PROSECUTOR RYU

180
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:28,104
Now, I can go back to being
Prosecutor Cho Yeon-ju,

181
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:33,526
set up this investigation headquarters,
and investigate as much as I want, right?

182
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,655
Why is that headquarters here
instead of in your own home?

183
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:41,158
You said you didn't want
strange guys coming to my place.

184
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,203
Then what? Should I set it up
in the Prosecutors' Office lobby?

185
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,372
Okay.

186
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,748
CHAIRMAN HAN

187
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,501
What happened with testing Chairman Han?

188
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:54,296
Ms. Kim said she was with my uncle

189
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,006
that day and time.

190
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,383
Ms. Kim?

191
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,845
She even kept my identity a secret.

192
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,805
But she proved
Chairman Han's alibi to be true?

193
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,349
I don't think
she wants to take either side.

194
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,475
I don't know.

195
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,271
Not taking either side
doesn't mean she's just.

196
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,939
Maybe

197
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,109
she's like a silent bat.

198
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,403
She wouldn't make things up though.

199
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,072
Regardless, if she's not on either side,

200
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,615
it means she's not on our side.

201
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,703
I don't think we can trust that alibi.

202
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,873
Still, he has a witness.

203
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:32,042
You hit a red light
as soon as you started the investigation.

204
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,669
It doesn't matter.

205
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,421
We can just turn left.

206
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,922
To Ryu Seung-duk.

207
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,849
Who's he?

208
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,517
Say hi.

209
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,769
He's my head investigator

210
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,772
and Chief Prosecutor Ryu's spy.

211
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,318
His spy.

212
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,535
Suspects never commit only one crime.

213
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,955
People who beat others up lie.

214
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,916
Liars steal.

215
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,503
So, if they didn't order an autopsy,

216
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,922
there's a good chance
they did something else bad.

217
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,011
The thing with running red lights is,

218
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,888
you don't do it just once.

219
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,516
What do you mean?

220
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,267
Terrible drivers

221
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,103
run red lights habitually.

222
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,272
It's strange

223
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,776
to run a red only selectively

224
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,736
to follow my car.

225
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,122
Darn it. It's following us.

226
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,423
261 CH 9876

227
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,260
145 W 4728

228
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,971
145 W 4728.

229
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,639
-Look up the license plate.
-Okay.

230
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,432
145 W 4728.

231
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,786
Darn it.

232
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,542
I think there's another one.

233
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,581
Mr. Park?

234
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,376
What are you doing here?

235
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,004
Well…

236
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,297
He said

237
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,675
to find out what you were doing
after calling in sick.

238
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,762
That was why I kept sending you signs.

239
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,932
That the higher-ups are watching you
for having a poor work attitude.

240
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,982
Are you saying
your chief prosecutor had you tailed?

241
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,817
That's right.

242
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,444
That was why Mr. Park,

243
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,488
had been acting as a spy for him,

244
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,448
not knowing know
I was investigating a case.

245
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,950
I wasn't a spy.

246
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:54,286
I only told him when you came in
and when you left.

247
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,080
That's what a spy does.

248
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,124
This was the first time I followed you.

249
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,211
He suddenly told me
to find out where you were.

250
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,923
I called Mr. An's office,
and they said he'd left to meet you,

251
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,883
so I took a few pictures. That was all.

252
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,135
Regardless, these little things

253
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,930
can't heal the pain
that you've caused in my heart.

254
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,517
You know that, right?

255
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,144
You saw how I caught
Lee Bong-sik the other time

256
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,021
when I personally investigated.

257
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,524
I have a big case this time too.

258
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,568
I understand, ma'am.

259
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,028
You only sent Chief

260
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,406
the pictures that I saw, right?

261
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,991
That's right.

262
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,702
You may go.

263
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:45,295
It wasn't like he won the title
of chief prosecutor in poker.

264
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,588
I underestimated him.

265
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,675
Then who was in the car
that was following you?

266
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,390
The car that was following us
was registered

267
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,643
to the nightclub run by Samgeori Gang.

268
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,688
Those punks are definitely Hanju's muscle.

269
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,482
I'll look into them.

270
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,234
No. You stay out of it now.

271
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,610
Now? Why?

272
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,739
There may be no distinction
between legal and illegal anymore.

273
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:15,492
I've crossed the line all the time anyway.

274
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,995
So I'll deal with that.

275
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,289
But I can't request that of you too.

276
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,542
You've never broken a law
in your entire life.

277
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,919
What's wrong with you?

278
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,839
I made a U-turn on yellow
just this morning.

279
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,218
I think Yeon-ju is right.

280
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,263
I don't want you to be harmed
because of this either.

281
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,431
Like how?

282
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,144
I've never thought
about gaining or losing anything.

283
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,104
Especially if it involved you.

284
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:49,234
I'll take care of that myself,
so don't worry about it.

285
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,914
CHIEF RYU SEUNG-DUK

286
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:05,125
So? Are you saying
he went to do something illegal?

287
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,712
Kids these days have quick hands.

288
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,092
What is this?

289
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,260
Isn't this you?

290
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,428
I'm not sure.

291
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,346
You little…

292
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,014
What are you playing at here?

293
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,309
Take a good look.

294
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,020
Ms. Cho!

295
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,815
Why did you do it?

296
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,442
Did Cho Yeon-ju put you up to it?

297
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,987
I would never accept such a request.

298
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,497
Okay, it's here.

299
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,541
I just have to send a text to this number.

300
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,583
Yes.

301
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,215
INSTALL THE APP AND GET A FREE COUPON!

302
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,010
Kiddo, you're just a junior prosecutor.

303
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,679
Do you think this organization is a joke?

304
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,056
I'm the chief prosecutor, you know.

305
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:06,186
Do you want your family and relatives
to be turned upside down?

306
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:11,692
If you behave recklessly,
you might destroy your entire family.

307
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,237
Stop here. Got it?

308
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,698
Answer me.

309
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:27,166
Why you little…

310
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,713
Hey. Don't you know who I am?

311
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:36,091
I am the Seoul Central
District Prosecutors' Office.

312
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,093
Everything I bury remains buried.

313
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,178
Understood?

314
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,848
Snoop around all you want.

315
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,684
Do you think things will go your way?

316
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,153
It has been installed.

317
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,447
You guys are all dead now.

318
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,908
I can hear everything.

319
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,328
That's not why we're doing this.

320
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,705
We're okay if they don't.

321
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,040
What?

322
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,419
So you're going to keep playing this game?

323
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,553
Answer this.

324
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,390
When you summoned Chairman Kang Mi-na,

325
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,310
who was the person that came?

326
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,854
Kang Mi-na

327
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,441
or Cho Yeon-ju?

328
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,285
What do you mean, sir?

329
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,705
So you'll keep playing dumb?

330
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,459
Then let me tell you what's going on.

331
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,628
Cho Yeon-ju.

332
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,299
She's pretending that she is Kang Mi-na.

333
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,471
Sorry? That's impersonation, isn't it?

334
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,390
We should indict her at once.

335
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,392
Wait.

336
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,769
When did you find out?

337
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,188
How come you've kept this to yourself?

338
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,439
Well, I…

339
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,109
I only found out recently.

340
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,361
Then I'll let Hanju know
and have her indicted now.

341
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,863
Wait, hang on.

342
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,455
What are you going to do?

343
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,082
I'm so close,

344
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,295
but I don't have solid evidence
at the moment.

345
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,434
You little punk…

346
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:59,234
Why do I have to report
these things to you anyway?

347
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,448
Know your place. I got this.

348
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,158
One more thing.

349
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,162
Everything you're working on
with Cho Yeon-ju at the moment.

350
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,080
Take your hands off them.

351
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,875
If you don't, you're dead meat too.

352
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,212
Where's my phone?

353
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,716
You little…

354
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:29,181
It's a habit you develop as a prosecutor.
Not making a move without solid evidence.

355
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,725
He'll just sit on it
and do nothing about it

356
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,727
until he's pushed to the edge of a cliff.

357
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,992
Well, she called in sick,

358
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,620
so she should be walking around
as the rich lady, Kang Mi-na.

359
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,998
Why is she out and about as a prosecutor,

360
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,460
digging into the case I'm involved in?

361
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:02,005
CHIEF RYU SEUNG-DUK

362
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,805
Hey, did you find anything?

363
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,474
An Yu-jun's family is too clean.

364
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,643
Forget tax evasion.
I couldn't find any dirt on them.

365
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,478
Let me just tell you this.

366
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,523
His grandfather received a medal
for being an exemplary taxpayer.

367
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,317
What? What about his mother's side?

368
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,694
His mother's side of the family
received a trophy

369
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:28,073
on Taxpayers' Day last year
for paying over 100 billion won in taxes.

370
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:28,990
Okay.

371
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,330
I can't even find any dirt
on this punk's family.

372
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,460
My uncle will keep a watchful eye on him

373
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,921
and call me
when he's about to make a move.

374
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:44,840
All right.

375
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,968
It looks like we're ready to prove
that Han Young Sik's alibi is false.

376
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,678
I've got something to do.

377
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,180
What is it?

378
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,474
Now that you no longer
have to impersonate Kang Mi-na,

379
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,059
I want to quit my job at Hanju.

380
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,689
If you want
your father's cases to be retried,

381
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,816
you'll need an attorney.

382
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,153
But you only have prosecutors around.

383
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,781
Mr. No.

384
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,533
Don't worry.

385
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,619
It's fine.
My kids have all grown up now anyway.

386
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,329
No, it's not that.

387
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,415
I always beat you when we argue.

388
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,709
-Can we really trust you?
-Come on!

389
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,587
In movies, you see attorneys
talking their heads off.

390
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,507
But in a real trial,
everything is submitted in writing.

391
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,803
Attorneys who talk a lot in court
are amateurs.

392
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,307
And you won't find anyone
who knows more about Hanju than I do.

393
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,601
But you've worked for Hanju
for many years.

394
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:41,021
Will you be okay with going public
with their corrupt deeds?

395
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,899
As you know, you could face

396
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,569
a criminal penalty for disclosing
confidential info without their consent.

397
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,321
Right, I'm aware.

398
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:52,616
But it rarely results in a jail sentence.

399
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,620
However, I shouldn't continue
to work as a lawyer

400
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,788
because it does go against
the code of ethics.

401
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:02,375
So I'll quit that too,
once everything is over.

402
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,462
Will you really be okay?

403
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,796
Yes, of course.

404
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:10,800
I was one of
Chairman Han Kang-sik's closest aides.

405
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,845
I should've quit years ago.
I've always felt guilty about it.

406
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,890
The guilt has grown over the years,
and I can't take it anymore.

407
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,266
It's time I set things right.

408
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,778
Well, I'm only bringing this up because

409
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,821
you and Yeon-ju have finally made up.

410
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:35,533
We haven't fully reconciled yet.
We're just beginning to patch things up.

411
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,993
Either way.

412
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:42,666
I've kept this to myself
because I didn't want to worry you.

413
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,376
But I think it's quite serious.

414
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,211
What do you mean?

415
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,422
It's about Yeon-ju. She's acting strange.

416
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,427
We couldn't reach her for a while,
so we looked everywhere for her.

417
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:58,265
She said she couldn't contact us
because she had lost her memory.

418
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,185
We have no idea where she's been
or what she's been up to.

419
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,230
And she's been asking us to tail people.

420
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,691
She keeps doing things
that she never used to do.

421
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,651
Pil-kyu is like her private detective now.

422
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,487
He spends all day
doing what he used to do in the gang.

423
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,699
Our business was doing so well,
but we can't even work now. Darn it.

424
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,409
You fools.

425
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,912
How is it that I know more
when I'm stuck behind bars?

426
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:22,622
What?

427
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,250
She's trying to get me out.

428
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,377
To prove my innocence.

429
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,546
What? Are you saying…

430
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,300
you didn't start the fire?

431
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,510
You've been visiting me
for the past 10 years,

432
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,220
and yet you're so clueless.

433
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,932
Just do as she says.

434
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,602
You see, there's more.

435
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,271
The biggest problem is that

436
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,356
she's such a bad judge of character.

437
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,776
She's seeing a loser
who lives in a rental apartment.

438
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,321
The tall guy with big eyes?

439
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,323
Are you talking about that guy?

440
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,742
Right, you must know him too.

441
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,744
I heard he was here.

442
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:04,164
You see, being poor is okay.

443
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:07,334
But he's such a snob.

444
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,546
That's why I can't approve of him,
as Yeon-ju's uncle.

445
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,008
You fools really know nothing.

446
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,509
What? What do you mean?

447
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:22,515
All he does is follow Yeon-ju around,
so he probably doesn't have a job.

448
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,768
He doesn't need to work

449
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,728
because he's a rich heir.

450
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,688
What? As if.

451
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,899
He does nothing all day.

452
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,609
He's clearly jobless.

453
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,444
Why would he work when he's that rich?

454
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,655
His money is growing
even when he's doing nothing.

455
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,325
He's rich?

456
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,746
That guy is rich?

457
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,833
Just go and do as Yeon-ju says.

458
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,461
My goodness.

459
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,802
See?

460
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,513
She can't come home
because she has something to hide.

461
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,432
You know, I would never
just rely on groundless rumors.

462
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,937
Is that still the biggest problem for you?
Whether or not she's a fake?

463
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,980
What's more important than that?

464
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,900
The biggest problem for me is that

465
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:16,903
you didn't tell me right away
when you found out.

466
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,906
What else did you do behind my back?

467
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,742
Tell me now, before it turns into
another problem.

468
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,830
You're talking as if
all I do is cause trouble.

469
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,998
-What?
-You don't remember

470
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,751
any of the successful things I started
without telling you.

471
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,796
You mercilessly hound me like this
when I make one little mistake.

472
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,966
So how could I discuss things with you
every single time?

473
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,845
Are you saying you'll continue
to do things and just notify me?

474
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,140
Then how can I trust you
and put you in charge?

475
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,768
What more can I do to earn your trust?

476
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,146
What more must I prove

477
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,231
to be in charge?

478
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,482
Don't twist the facts.

479
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,068
What about all the things
I've given you so far?

480
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,071
The hotel?

481
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,575
It was a card
you had to ditch in a losing battle.

482
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,411
Was Hanju Hotel even treated

483
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,872
as a proper subsidiary
before I took it on?

484
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:12,500
Have you ever put me in charge
of any of the key subsidiaries?

485
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,337
I've been successfully running
the companies that you abandoned.

486
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,923
But to you, I'm still just someone

487
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,593
you can't fully trust.

488
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,389
If you know that,

489
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,767
step away from the hotel
for the time being.

490
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,190
Okay.

491
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,820
COLD WATER

492
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:47,368
Instead of dragging myself
to deal with my in-laws after work,

493
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,789
I'm going to relax
in the comfort of my own home.

494
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,129
Even this water tastes sweet.

495
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:02,050
This is paradise even if I have
nothing else to drink but water.

496
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,976
What's up? Did something happen?

497
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,564
-No, nothing happened.
-Then why… Why are you here at this hour?

498
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,441
I can come over whenever I want now.

499
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:19,567
Am I wrong?

500
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,277
You're right.

501
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,781
We no longer have to worry about
what others might say.

502
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:28,868
We can meet up anywhere,
and we can kiss. It's not cheating.

503
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,206
I'm not saying I want a kiss now though.

504
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,085
Here.

505
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,963
It's jokbaengi!

506
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,382
I figured you had nothing to eat at home.

507
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:45,218
Also, you once told me
that when you hurt a muscle,

508
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,886
you need to eat stuff like this.

509
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,346
A muscle?

510
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,850
Someone told me
that our hearts are actually muscles.

511
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,228
We need to train them
so they can recover quickly.

512
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,523
You didn't say it,
but you must've been hurt

513
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,316
by the things that happened today.

514
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,824
Well, shall we start?

515
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,620
It looks delicious.

516
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,790
-Open the door!
-What's this noise?

517
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,876
It must be another apartment.

518
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,549
Hey, come out!

519
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:35,184
Come out! I know you're in there.

520
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,644
Open the door!

521
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,479
Come out!

522
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,690
What is he doing here?

523
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,319
Is he here to see you?

524
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,613
Forget it.

525
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,115
I'm sure he'll leave if no one answers.

526
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,241
Come back inside.

527
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,418
Come out!

528
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,505
Hold on.

529
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:08,092
I know you're in there.
Are you hiding something in there?

530
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,930
Is that why you're not coming out?

531
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:15,391
Come out before I call emergency services!

532
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,436
How dare he drag
emergency services into this?

533
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,357
What if he really breaks in?

534
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,318
The investigation headquarters
and everything is still in there.

535
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,738
Come out right now!

536
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:32,283
Gosh. Go hide then.

537
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,409
Okay.

538
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,246
What's going on?

539
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,585
What? I thought you lived here.

540
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,923
Unit 1501, no?

541
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:50,051
You got it wrong. Leave now.

542
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,096
Hey.

543
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,766
Just a second.

544
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,811
Where do you think you're going?

545
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,857
Is this your place?

546
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,195
You have peculiar taste.

547
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,831
You like this stuff?

548
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,040
What do you need?

549
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,210
Where is she?

550
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,505
Is she hiding in your apartment?

551
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,007
What are you talking about?

552
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,217
Do you want to be arrested
for trespassing?

553
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,136
Your acting is great.

554
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,389
I know you hid her away.

555
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,059
What did you do
to the paternity test results?

556
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,645
Did you have her get plastic surgery
to look like Mi-na

557
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,188
and plant her in my family?

558
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,983
And she gave you
all of Yumin Group's money.

559
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,651
Is that why you came here?

560
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,320
To tell me about your absurd imagination?

561
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,447
Why am I here?

562
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,334
Let me be a part of the game

563
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,253
that you started.

564
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:09,881
What?

565
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:13,426
I knew she wasn't Kang Mi-na
from the beginning.

566
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,178
But I kept my mouth shut.

567
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,180
Considering what happened,

568
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,806
you should team up with me.

569
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,892
She doesn't have to move back in.

570
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,810
I just want her to remain married to me.

571
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,023
If you knew that she wasn't your wife,

572
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,942
did you ever bother to look for your wife?

573
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,069
I did.

574
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:34,238
You did? What were you going to do
when you found her?

575
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,866
She wasn't happy living with me either.

576
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,202
If she never shows up,
it'll be a win-win for both of us.

577
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,288
Don't look at me like that.

578
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,624
What do you know about my family?

579
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,793
Do you realize what you did to me today?

580
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:47,835
Why should I care?

581
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:53,049
After what happened today,
the stock prices already plummeted.

582
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,259
My father got rid of my sister,
and I survived.

583
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,262
Do you think that's because of me? No.

584
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,806
It's because of that woman.

585
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,934
There's only one reason
my father keeps people around him.

586
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,393
It's when they're valuable.

587
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,146
Kang Mi-na hasn't
abandoned me officially yet.

588
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,607
And the shares are still hers.
That's why he kept me.

589
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,735
But if I don't bring her back,
I'll be abandoned too.

590
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,739
That much, I can handle.

591
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,909
But if I'm left alone at Hanju Hotel
without her shares,

592
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:23,079
my sister will come after me
before my father abandons me.

593
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:26,290
I need her. Team up with me.

594
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,127
Does your family put shares before people?

595
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:34,215
Then again, you're capable of doing
horrible things to people for money.

596
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,469
You came back

597
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,471
for money too.

598
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,599
-What?
-Stop pretending.

599
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,518
Do you think you're any better than us?

600
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,813
If what you lost
had been some mom-and-pop store,

601
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,106
would you have returned?

602
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,316
We're all the same.

603
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,777
That's how people like us live.

604
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,196
Stop pretending you're any different!

605
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:02,493
Aren't you jealous?

606
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,203
What?

607
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,247
I think you're jealous of me.

608
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,708
Isn't that why you're losing your temper?

609
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,424
You're still so obnoxious.

610
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,803
I'm leaving now.

611
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,639
Give it some thought.

612
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,020
Save me.

613
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:53,002
I wish my words were
as effective as yours.

614
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,629
Was that effective?

615
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:58,341
He left right away,
although he completely ruined the mood.

616
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:03,721
By the way,
are all guys with strong sisters like him?

617
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,890
Why is he so afraid of Sung-hye?

618
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:09,852
There was always
something scary about her.

619
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,855
Since he's close to her,
he may have sensed it even more.

620
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,316
Like what?

621
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:20,947
When she was little,
she had a dog that she really loved.

622
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,325
But later, she developed an allergy
and couldn't keep the dog.

623
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,327
So what did she do?

624
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:30,289
She had the dog put down.

625
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,999
She did it herself.

626
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,264
Just when I was thinking
Sung-woon was coming to his senses.

627
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,391
Don't do anything stupid again.

628
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,768
What you're attacking is my company.

629
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,647
I shouldn't have followed him.

630
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,693
I did a bad job of raising my children.

631
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,530
I wanted to think of you
as my newly-gained child.

632
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:07,243
Why can't Hanju Group be mine?

633
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:11,122
Are you saying you'll continue
to do things and just notify me?

634
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,457
Then how can I trust you
and put you in charge?

635
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,127
I've been trying so hard for nothing.

636
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,423
I begged for something
that was never going to be mine.

637
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,802
At Yumin Electronics
shareholders' meeting held today,

638
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,596
Chairman Kang Mi-na
announced her resignation.

639
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,308
She had been the chairman
since the former chairman Kang

640
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:34,103
and his family passed away
in an airplane crash.

641
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,396
At the time…

642
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,856
The easiest way

643
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:41,277
to make everything mine would be
if everyone else disappears.

644
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,572
But at today's shareholders' meeting,

645
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,450
Chairman Kang announced
that she was stepping down

646
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,035
for personal reasons--

647
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,499
Father seemed tired.

648
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,670
I think he needs rest.

649
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,967
The prosecutor at Seoul Central DPO
that Father has been working on.

650
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,137
I want to meet him.

651
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,853
How was your weekend?

652
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,104
-It was good, sir.
-Great.

653
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,443
I don't recognize these numbers.

654
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,696
Why did I get so many texts?

655
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:30,576
What? Why is everyone canceling
their appointments with me?

656
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:45,716
CHIEF PROSECUTOR SUSPECTED OF
RECEIVING MONEY FROM SUSPECT OVER 14 YEARS

657
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,428
What is this?

658
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,640
CHIEF PROSECUTOR SUSPECTED OF
RECEIVING MONEY FROM SUSPECT OVER 14 YEARS

659
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,151
There's plenty of corruption.

660
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,486
Take your pick.

661
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:08,864
You're the best!

662
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,951
-You're the best.
-You're the best.

663
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,250
You left this yesterday.

664
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,879
This shouldn't get leaked, you know.

665
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,673
I kept it safe for you, sir.

666
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,760
He wrote down every time
anyone took him out

667
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,388
and took pictures of everything,

668
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,557
including the cash
and bank checks he received.

669
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:39,061
All of our media companies
will refuse to air or publish this.

670
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:42,022
The French media company
that my father bought

671
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,774
recently opened a Korean branch.

672
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:47,319
I doubt they have relationships
with domestic corporations yet.

673
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,073
Why that…

674
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,161
Darn it.

675
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,498
Hey. What's wrong with you?

676
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,833
Why are you doing this?

677
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,295
-What is it?
-Look at this.

678
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,173
This is spreading lies and defamation.

679
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,133
Why are you saying that to me?

680
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,343
You're the only one
who knows about all of this!

681
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,847
Know what?

682
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,892
You just said it was
spreading lies and defamation.

683
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,022
Why you jerk…

684
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,902
You used to be desperate
to come under my wing.

685
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,197
I took you in and looked after you
although you had nothing.

686
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,616
How dare you betray me like this?

687
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,618
Are you sure you doted on me?

688
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,162
You were only going to use me.

689
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,956
Since I had no money or connections,

690
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,418
you could use and dump
this smart junior prosecutor.

691
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:51,634
Hey.

692
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,721
Is this about your father?

693
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,646
Did you take on
that strange two-in-one role

694
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,689
and do this to me because of your father?

695
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,611
Hey. Your father confessed.

696
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,656
I admit I was negligent
with my investigation.

697
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,491
But he confessed.

698
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:20,371
What do you want?
Do you want to catch the real perp?

699
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,122
Then you shouldn't do this to me.

700
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:26,043
What is your real reason
for doing this to me?

701
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,213
What I want…

702
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,677
is to create a just society.

703
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,555
What?

704
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:45,354
Hey. Do you think doing this to me

705
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,690
will create a just society?

706
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:48,857
At least

707
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,860
they'll stop and think
that they may end up like you

708
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,154
if they take a bribe.

709
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:57,950
You…

710
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,710
When a person is cornered
on the edge of a cliff,

711
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,838
there is only one way to survive.

712
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,299
Jump to the cliff on the other side.

713
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,051
We have to see where he jumps.

714
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,898
What?

715
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,699
At this rate,

716
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,745
my career here is over.

717
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:58,218
Sure. This is nothing.

718
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,097
I can just resign before I'm disciplined.

719
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:04,808
Someone of my caliber

720
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,645
can go into politics somewhere.

721
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,814
I'm candidate six, Ryu Seung-duk.

722
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,192
I'm candidate six, Ryu Seung-duk.

723
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:16,570
Candidate six.

724
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,281
I'm candidate six, Ryu Seung-duk.

725
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,282
Seriously.

726
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:24,995
INNOCENT! HONEST WORKER!

727
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,791
Darn it.

728
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:31,210
I never had to work my head before.

729
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,590
Should I start a private practice
and rake in the dough?

730
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,637
No. That will only last so long.

731
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,476
I'll have to beg Hanju.

732
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,237
CHIEF PROSECUTOR SUSPECTED OF
RECEIVING MONEY FROM SUSPECT OVER 14 YEARS

733
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,578
Don't connect the Central District's
chief prosecutor if he calls.

734
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:07,788
Yes, sir.

735
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:13,043
The person you have reached…

736
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,962
This old man isn't picking up.

737
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,103
Hello?

738
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,314
I'm afraid he can't talk right now.
He's in a meeting.

739
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,899
I know he can.

740
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,402
I'm sorry, but he really can't speak
on the phone at the moment.

741
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:39,611
Hey!

742
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:43,115
He left the office
and got in the car to go somewhere.

743
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,159
Give him the phone.

744
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,203
Sir.

745
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,706
If you keep doing this,
we'll have no choice--

746
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:53,500
No. Tell Chairman Han
that if he keeps doing this,

747
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,419
we may both burn together.

748
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,136
Chief Prosecutor.

749
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:07,097
You're tied to all sorts of corruption.

750
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,850
You can't call me like this right now.

751
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,269
Mr. Chairman,
there is something you need to know.

752
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:15,439
Your second daughter-in-law
is an imposter.

753
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,109
I guess that's the rumor.

754
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:22,196
It's not just a rumor, it's a fact.

755
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,364
And she's my junior prosecutor.

756
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,617
I don't know why, but they look identical.

757
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:31,038
I'm sure she infiltrated your house
because she was after something.

758
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,040
Look here.

759
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,958
Stop talking nonsense.

760
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:38,545
I know it sounds like nonsense,
but it's the truth.

761
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,590
Remember the Hanju factory case
in Seopyung 14 years ago?

762
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,010
She's that the arsonist's daughter.

763
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,179
So, are you saying

764
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,264
that the arsonist's daughter

765
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,016
became a prosecutor

766
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:53,352
and infiltrated our home
as my daughter-in-law?

767
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:54,478
That's right.

768
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,855
Then where is my real daughter-in-law?

769
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,065
Well…

770
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,317
I don't know…

771
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,653
-Do you have any proof?
-Proof?

772
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:05,364
I was in the middle
of looking for that proof

773
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,157
when this urgent matter arose.

774
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,243
You're the chief prosecutor,

775
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,828
but you're swept away
by fake news and whatnot.

776
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:17,584
I've misjudged you.
Don't contact me for the time being.

777
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,961
Wait. Mr. Chairman. Hold on.

778
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,047
You shouldn't do this to me.

779
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:26,510
Your biggest corrupt deeds
that I have files on

780
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,345
weren't even disclosed yet.

781
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:29,846
What do you mean?

782
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,848
Lee Bong-sik.

783
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,102
Didn't you do that to him?

784
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,605
Are you trying to blame me
for things I didn't do?

785
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:42,067
Didn't you end up causing this
by trying to kiss up to me more?

786
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:46,697
You're between a rock and a hard place
because of the way you've lived.

787
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,866
Why are you trying to
drag me down with you?

788
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,286
You'll keep playing dumb?

789
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,583
There's no use playing dumb.

790
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:01,503
Looks like Lee Bong-sik's case
and cases from 14 years ago,

791
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:04,464
which made Hanju what it is today,

792
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,884
will all be dug up.

793
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:08,969
To be blunt,

794
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,638
is there still evidence remaining
from such an old case?

795
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,557
What if there is?

796
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,726
What?

797
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,477
What if I have it?

798
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,398
That's right.

799
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:24,985
Fool.

800
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:27,613
Why would you keep that?

801
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,239
We would end up burning together.

802
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,575
Then let's burn together. Fine.

803
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:33,952
But even if we do die together,

804
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,163
whose crime do you think is bigger?

805
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,665
Who will be hurt more?

806
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,585
I can simply start a private practice.

807
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,920
What about you?
And your family related to the case?

808
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,130
What about Hanju Group?

809
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:47,924
You should think hard about it.

810
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,886
The case from 14 years ago

811
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,931
is my most reliable
insurance policy right now.

812
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:59,978
Do you think I joined hands with Hanju
without preparing that much?

813
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,105
Also, if you've decided

814
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,609
to whack me or something
because of that evidence,

815
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,569
you should reconsider.

816
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,238
If anything happens to me,

817
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:14,076
the evidence that is in the safest place,

818
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,746
that only the person I trust most
knows about,

819
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:22,000
will be exposed to the world.

820
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,755
I can guarantee you that.

821
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:45,691
The chief prosecutor that father
has been bribing is in trouble now?

822
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:48,485
Yes, ma'am. What should we do
about the appointment today?

823
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:51,196
My father is the most shrewd businessman
in the country,

824
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,156
so he'll try to cut all ties with him.

825
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,785
-We'll proceed as planned.
-Understood, ma'am.

826
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,912
-And…
-What?

827
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:02,624
You asked me to look into
a woman named Cho Yeon-ju.

828
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:10,716
You know, Cho Yeon-ju.

829
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,884
No wonder the name sounded so familiar.

830
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:16,138
There was one female prosecutor who
investigated all the gangs in Seopyung.

831
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:18,014
Her name was Cho Yeon-ju.

832
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,642
I wasn't even a foot soldier then,
so I've never met her.

833
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:21,893
But I remember the name.

834
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,522
What? A prosecutor?

835
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,358
That is absurd.

836
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,246
DIRECTOR HAN SUNG-HYE

837
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:45,751
CHO YEON-JU

838
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,335
Cho Yeon-ju.

839
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:26,124
CHIEF RYU SEUNG-DUK

840
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,547
If anything happens to me,

841
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,884
the evidence that is in the safest place,

842
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:39,346
that only the person I trust most
knows about,

843
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,850
will be exposed to the world.

844
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,480
Yes, of course.

845
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:52,567
I've finally found
the safest place to shelter.

846
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,110
PENDING APPROVAL

847
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,196
Yes, that's right.

848
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,032
Let's go play golf together sometime soon.

849
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:01,618
But you're too good.

850
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,078
I'm no match for you.

851
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:07,165
Do you know what I learned
from suspicious death cases?

852
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,001
Let's say you have dirt on someone.

853
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:13,421
Then put it in the most obvious place
so it'll be revealed

854
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,173
when something happens to you. Why?

855
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:17,926
You can't be the only one that goes down.

856
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,429
You are truly wise, sir.

857
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,640
You're amazing.

858
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,519
Chairman Han Young-sik.

859
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:31,064
You're doomed now.

860
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:18,278
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR PROMOTION

861
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,960
Thanks for coming
all the way here from Seopyung.

862
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,631
Now that we'll be working together
in the same office,

863
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,258
-I can drop the honorifics, right?
-Yes. Of course, sir.

864
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,302
Do you play golf?

865
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,471
-Golf?
-Well, you're tall.

866
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,473
You should be able
to hit the ball very far.

867
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,808
-Gosh, no.
-You have to be careful though.

868
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,977
Don't be so obvious
about letting others pay for you.

869
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,312
Put it on my credit card first.

870
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,731
Then let them make a bet
and take all their money.

871
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:58,401
Who would be crazy enough
to take a prosecutor's money?

872
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:04,532
When I was on my way
to a golf course in Incheon the other day,

873
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:08,203
it was so foggy
that I couldn't see farther than 30m.

874
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,423
He keeps

875
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,842
carrying this clock around?

876
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:29,057
CHIEF RYU SEUNG-DUK

877
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:45,740
My gosh.

878
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,869
I didn't expect to see you here.

879
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,205
Please take a seat.

880
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,176
That makes no sense.

881
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,220
During your entire time at Yumin,

882
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:10,265
how could you not have known
that she had decided to step down?

883
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:11,433
To tell you the truth,

884
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,935
I knew.

885
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:17,313
What? Then why did you keep
such an important matter from me?

886
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:19,983
Well, I'm not from
the Supreme Prosecutors' Office,

887
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,653
which is probably
why I couldn't act fast enough.

888
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:25,655
My apologies, sir.

889
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:27,699
That said…

890
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:30,577
Here's my resignation letter.

891
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,494
RESIGNATION LETTER

892
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:35,165
I've already submitted it on the intranet,

893
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,293
but handing it in personally
would be the polite thing to do.

894
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:40,795
This is too sudden. What is this about?

895
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:43,131
When your values
don't align with your employer's,

896
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,302
I should leave since I'm a mere employee.

897
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,554
I should've done this years ago.

898
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:02,192
What if Kang Mi-na is hiding on purpose?

899
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,818
What are you talking about?

900
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:07,697
Someone's hiding? Who? Where?

901
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,200
Your second daughter-in-law
is an imposter.

902
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:14,162
I'm sure she infiltrated your house
because she was after something.

903
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,207
She can't come home
because she has something to hide.

904
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,459
You know, I would never
just rely on groundless rumors.

905
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:31,304
CHAIRMAN HAN YOUNG-SIK

906
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,230
You seem to be in a bit of a predicament.

907
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:45,568
It helps you filter out
some people from your life

908
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:48,196
by showing you
who is really on your side and who's not.

909
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:53,243
I'd like to take this as an opportunity
to show you that I'm on your side.

910
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,577
In this line of work,

911
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:59,624
they say there's always a reason
when someone shows you generosity.

912
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,128
You and my father go back a long way.

913
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:06,548
And whatever you do,
you always make sure you have insurance.

914
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:11,052
I bet you have
a lot of intel on my father.

915
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:15,723
It doesn't look like
you can stay in your post anyway.

916
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:20,603
Go public with everything
you have on my father.

917
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,982
Are you suggesting
I stab your father in the back?

918
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,361
What will I gain from it?

919
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:32,699
If you don't do anything,
you'll just be a prosecutor-turned-lawyer.

920
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,534
But if you get my father arrested…

921
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,203
and when things die down after his arrest,

922
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,873
I'll make you Hanju's
non-executive director.

923
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,083
What do you say?

924
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:57,474
Lee Bong-sik must've
messed with you, not your father.

925
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,102
What are you talking about?

926
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,565
You don't seem to know

927
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,318
what it is that I have on Hanju Group.

928
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,404
It's my father's problem anyway,

929
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,947
so I don't care what it is.

930
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,408
The first time he turned to me

931
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,452
for help 14 years ago…

932
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:18,411
It was about you.

933
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,538
It had nothing to do with his business.

934
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,709
You caused a car accident
when you visited Seopyung that day.

935
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:26,336
Have you forgotten all about it?

936
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:28,171
Someone died, you know.

937
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,596
That's totally irrelevant.

938
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,473
There's no evidence left anyway.

939
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:41,559
You know I always make sure
I have insurance.

940
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,730
Do you think I made a deal with Hanju

941
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:48,942
without any insurance?

942
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:51,903
Are you saying

943
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:55,073
it has something to do with me?

944
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,283
Well,

945
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,494
I wouldn't have brought it up otherwise.

946
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:03,706
Why do you think your father abandoned me?

947
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,959
If I reveal that evidence,

948
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:09,671
the respectable Chairman Han
would apologize

949
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:12,674
for not raising his child properly,

950
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:15,260
crying and begging,

951
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,596
to save himself.

952
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:26,312
Some old woman died in a car accident.
No one would care.

953
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,023
That might be the case,

954
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:32,110
but there are many people
who can benefit from it.

955
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,822
Once your father finds out
you're trying to stab him in the back,

956
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,240
he won't sit back.

957
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:40,952
Also, here at Seoul DPO,

958
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:44,539
there's a prosecutor
who holds a grudge against Hanju Group.

959
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:48,167
What can one prosecutor possibly do?

960
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,920
She's more than that.

961
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:55,383
She's the daughter of the man
who set the Hanju factory on fire.

962
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,051
Strangely,

963
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,846
she's the spitting image
of Hanju Group's daughter-in-law.

964
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:04,475
Are you talking about
Prosecutor Cho Yeon-ju?

965
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:06,769
You knew?

966
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:13,651
Well, let's make a deal here.

967
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:18,573
I'll have Chairman Han Young-sik arrested.

968
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,533
I want you…

969
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,538
to get rid of Cho Yeon-ju.

970
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,251
Is this another insurance of yours?

971
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,170
Barely.

972
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,256
It's not even a crime.

973
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,341
It's just customary.

974
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:38,509
I'm sure you know.

975
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:52,774
Let's discuss the details
the next time we meet.

976
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:16,255
Hello?

977
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:19,592
You couldn't reach me all morning?

978
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:22,095
What? The article?

979
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:27,058
When things are going well for someone,

980
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:30,895
there are always people
who try to drag them down.

981
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:32,689
Those losers.

982
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:36,401
I'm tired of working in public office.

983
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:38,611
I was going to quit
sooner or later anyway.

984
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:39,946
Of course.

985
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:42,198
There are many places that want me.

986
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:45,910
All right. Bye.

987
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:16,065
Some old woman died in a car accident.
No one would care.

988
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,709
Grandma!

989
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:37,378
Grandma!

990
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:40,423
Help!

991
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:42,508
Grandma.

992
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:44,385
Help!

993
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:56,939
Was it all Han Sung-hye's doing?

994
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:28,554
Ms. Kang forgot this.

995
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,016
I thought I should give it to you.

996
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:34,769
You can reach her, right?

997
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:36,979
Yes.

998
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:40,775
For a long time,

999
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:44,362
Ms. Kang seemed to be trying to swallow
a fishbone stuck in her throat.

1000
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:46,697
I always felt sorry for her.

1001
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,451
Anyway, everything turned out well
in the end.

1002
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:52,912
I know that you're aware

1003
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:54,747
that she's not Kang Mi-na.

1004
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:58,334
Her DNA sample…

1005
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,795
Were you involved?

1006
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,339
Her sample?

1007
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:05,842
I don't know what you're talking about.

1008
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:07,927
No?

1009
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,388
No matter what you're talking about,
it wasn't me.

1010
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:12,431
Is that why you wanted to see me?

1011
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,350
That's not it.

1012
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,687
Don't take anyone's side.

1013
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:19,897
Don't get involved in anything.

1014
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,525
I came here to tell you that.

1015
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:26,821
My uncle keeps you close to him
because you're valuable to him.

1016
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:30,449
At the church, as soon as he was cornered,
he got you involved.

1017
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:32,285
But that means

1018
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,830
he'll abandon you
when you stop being valuable.

1019
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,834
I think you should quit your job.

1020
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,963
You two make me feel ashamed.

1021
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:45,339
Who do you mean?

1022
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:48,968
The late Chairman Han Kang-sik and you.

1023
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:51,470
Your father always put me first too.

1024
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:55,641
He told me to stop running errands
for Chairman Han Young-sik.

1025
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:57,059
I see.

1026
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:01,856
I've submitted
resignation letters many times.

1027
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:04,233
But they were all rejected.

1028
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,904
As you said, I'm still valuable to him.

1029
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:13,618
I used to run errands
for Chairman Han Young-sik.

1030
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:18,456
When he forgot his stuff
in your grandfather's room,

1031
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:20,708
I'd bring it to his office.

1032
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:25,963
A pen, a wallet, things like that.

1033
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:33,888
I only found out later
that they had bugs on them.

1034
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:38,976
I know for a fact

1035
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:40,895
that Chairman Han Young-sik

1036
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:45,608
wasn't at the factory
when your father passed away.

1037
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:51,405
Director Han Sung-hye was.

1038
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:47,878
Are you still busy?

1039
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,465
You don't have to play
two roles anymore, do you?

1040
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:53,300
Have we met?

1041
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:55,636
That's funny.

1042
01:06:56,512 --> 01:07:00,057
I'll tell everyone what you've been up to.

1043
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:02,018
That's what I want to say to you.

1044
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,729
Have you completely lost your mind?

1045
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,857
Have you already forgotten everything?

1046
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:12,069
No, my mind has never been clearer.

1047
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:17,867
Just what exactly did you do that night?

1048
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,661
On your way out of the factory,

1049
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:24,248
you hit my grandma with your car

1050
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:25,583
and killed her.

1051
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:36,886
It did feel like I had hit something.

1052
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,805
It was a person, was it?

1053
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,141
What?

1054
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:51,150
You're so dead. I'll make you pay.

1055
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:54,945
I can't wait to see

1056
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:59,033
what one prosecutor can do
against a conglomerate.

1057
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:03,120
I'll show you what one prosecutor can do

1058
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:05,164
when she sets her mind to it.

1059
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,208
Wait and see.

1060
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:10,669
This can't be the only bad thing
you've done in your life.

1061
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:15,591
Indiscriminately targeted investigations,
excessive investigations,

1062
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:19,303
sting operations, searches and seizures,
publications of suspected crimes…

1063
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:21,430
I'll stretch my authority as far as I can

1064
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:24,475
to destroy you.

1065
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,979
I understand
why the prosecution needs reform.

1066
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:32,316
Do you know what a conglomerate is?

1067
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,779
I have never once
lost to lowlifes like you.

1068
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:38,781
Because you only fight battles you'll win.

1069
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:41,534
You don't even start
if you know that you'll lose the fight.

1070
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:47,206
You see, I've done it all.

1071
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:49,416
Even when everyone thinks I'll lose,

1072
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,211
I keep at it until I win.

1073
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,048
Go ahead
and do everything you can with money.

1074
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:57,508
The law

1075
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,927
will be my weapon.

1076
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:28,706
EPILOGUE

1077
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:31,667
Just what exactly did you do that night?

1078
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,627
On your way out of the factory,

1079
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:35,796
you hit my grandma with your car

1080
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,590
and killed her.

1081
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:04,116
Hey.

1082
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:07,870
-Father.
-Yes, what is it?

1083
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:09,955
I just

1084
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:12,374
hit someone with my car.

1085
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,877
You need to get this sorted out for me.

1086
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:23,469
You did? Where?

1087
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:25,930
Near the Hanju Fashion factory.

1088
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:28,182
I heard Uncle was there

1089
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:29,600
because of the ledger.

1090
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:31,477
That's why I was headed there.

1091
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:36,440
But…

1092
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:40,611
it looks like the factory is on fire.

1093
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,907
Uncle is there now.

1094
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:49,411
The factory is surrounded
by smoke and blazing flames.

1095
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:53,958
At the moment, we do not know
how many are dead or injured.

1096
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:55,876
Is he dead?

1097
01:10:57,169 --> 01:10:58,754
I don't know.

1098
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:01,215
The person is not moving.

1099
01:11:01,298 --> 01:11:02,591
No.

1100
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,843
Not the person you hit.

1101
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:07,429
I'm talking about your uncle.

1102
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:19,525
That's what you want to know?

1103
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:26,991
It's…

1104
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:31,453
a big fire.

1105
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:37,459
It won't be easy to get out unscathed.

1106
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:16,248
Are you doing this
to take me down with you?

1107
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:20,044
Why would I go down with you?
Hanju needs to save me.

1108
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:23,047
Why is it that lowlives
are always so aggressive?

1109
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:25,215
They want to reevaluate
your qualifications.

1110
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:27,843
You know you'll be fired
if you're deemed unfit for the job.

1111
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:29,803
You didn't know until just now,

1112
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:32,723
but now you know. I'm here on his behalf.

1113
01:12:32,806 --> 01:12:35,809
Do you think a conglomerate
will look after a mere chief prosecutor?

1114
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:37,144
Can't you see?

1115
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:39,980
You and that crazy prosecutor are doomed.

1116
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:42,274
So, maybe we should go after
the most important answer.

1117
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:43,942
Find Kang Mi-na.
