1
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,210
Hello?

2
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,212
It's Auntie.

3
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,716
Hello, Auntie.

4
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,177
To what do I owe the pleasure, Auntie?

5
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,597
-Let's meet. I need to talk to you.
-What?

6
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,557
Come out right now?

7
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,809
Of course, I will.

8
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,396
Who cares about dinner
when my aunt wants to see me?

9
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,232
What's wrong with her?

10
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,235
Hey. Listen to me, will you?

11
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,446
Yes. Come to our hotel.

12
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,364
I'll rush right over and wait.

13
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,242
What? Right now?

14
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,369
No. Wait up.

15
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,539
Gosh. You can take your time. Of course.

16
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,167
Oh, no. I need to finish
washing the cockles. Oh, dear.

17
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,377
Yes, that's right.

18
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,760
There are a ton of dishes to wash today.

19
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:38,223
I can't go home
until the others finish doing the dishes.

20
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,393
I'm sure catching up with Auntie

21
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,437
will kill some time.

22
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,149
Gosh, that's cold.

23
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,734
Auntie!

24
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,031
You're full of energy.

25
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,574
That's unlike you.

26
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,369
Usually, I have no energy whatsoever.

27
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,620
Have a seat.

28
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,459
I figured you'd hear this
sooner or later anyway.

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,838
There seemed to be some people
gossiping about your head injury,

30
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,423
so I brought up the matter
at the shareholders' meeting.

31
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,676
Please don't take it personally.

32
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,052
You did?

33
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,972
In the end, the largest shareholder
showed up and supported you,

34
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,557
and everything was fine.

35
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,976
How did you win him over?

36
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:24,894
What do you mean?

37
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,814
He's your husband's cousin, right?

38
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,440
Who?

39
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,652
I mean the major shareholder
of Yumin Electronics from the US.

40
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,445
Your husband's cousin.

41
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,824
Is the major shareholder from the US

42
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,951
my husband's cousin?

43
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,667
Exactly. That's right.

44
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,211
And the person who owes him a favor

45
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,297
is…

46
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,134
You. He basically saved your life.

47
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,760
Unbelievable.

48
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,971
Anyway, my point is,

49
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:04,225
to people like us,
family ties are all about

50
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:09,147
real estate, shares,
and financial transactions.

51
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:13,026
What have you received
from your family so far?

52
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,695
Well…

53
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,198
-I…
-Of course, you can't say anything.

54
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,825
Because you've received nothing.

55
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,953
That's exactly your position
in your family.

56
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,791
In your family, you've been
no more than a speck of dust.

57
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,670
I want you to remember your position
in Yumin Group at all times.

58
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,007
Do you understand what I mean?

59
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,231
Why did you help me hide?

60
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,359
Were you hoping
to benefit from it later on?

61
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,485
That's not it.

62
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,779
Are you following me around
hoping you can con me

63
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,114
into giving you something?
If so, don't bother.

64
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,095
Hello.

65
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:27,976
I heard you're a major shareholder
of my parents' company.

66
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,852
I must have shocked you earlier.

67
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,772
You know I hurt my head.

68
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:36,109
One moment I'm fine,
the next I'm totally out of my mind.

69
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,411
I'm sorry, okay?

70
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:50,081
I made a few mistakes
because of a misunderstanding.

71
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,459
Why couldn't you tell me sooner?

72
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,087
I'm not the boasting type.

73
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,132
Also, you never gave me
a chance to tell you.

74
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,636
Will you give me a chance to speak now?

75
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,763
Sure.

76
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,478
I came over partly to give you this.

77
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:14,981
What's this?

78
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,483
The official biography of Kang Mi-na,

79
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,403
the personal information of the directors
of Yumin Electronics,

80
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:24,657
Yumin Group's holding company,
and the basic facts about Yumin Group

81
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,826
that you must know.

82
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,371
Memorize this as best you can

83
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,249
to convince the directors
that amnesia never happened

84
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,503
and all the rumors were only caused
by temporary symptoms following trauma.

85
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:39,839
Why?

86
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,924
Just because you won control
over the company

87
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,177
doesn't mean people will
actually listen to you.

88
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,138
Who knows if you'll sell the company off

89
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,933
after pocketing all you can
or if you'll replace all the directors?

90
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,603
They won't back down so easily.

91
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,354
What I mean is,

92
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,899
why are you giving this to me?

93
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,695
You said your family didn't
really care about you.

94
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,073
Aren't you a member of this family too?

95
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,910
-Well, I'm not sure.
-I know.

96
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,080
Someone told me that
family ties are all about

97
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,332
real estate, shares,
and financial transactions.

98
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,586
You don't own anything in this family.
Does that mean you're not a family member?

99
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,423
Right now,
you and I own property together.

100
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,093
Maybe that makes us family.

101
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,846
I guess you're right.

102
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,182
Then I'll take this gladly.

103
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:32,850
Hold on.

104
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,061
I forgot to say something important.

105
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:37,980
You seem to suspect

106
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,399
that I'm only helping you
to benefit from it later.

107
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,528
But my uncle forced me to show up today.

108
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,947
Come on. It was all a misunderstanding.

109
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,532
-Let it go, will you?
-Also,

110
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,702
as you can see, even though I can
pull off formal attire perfectly,

111
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:55,081
I usually prefer more casual clothes.

112
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,417
And even then, I dress
in the retro-futurism style,

113
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:02,088
which was a huge hit
at London Fashion Week last season.

114
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,257
Okay, I get it.

115
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,885
All my life, I've refrained from
bragging about my wealth

116
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,428
and tried to stay humble.

117
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:13,516
That must have given you the wrong idea.
Even when choosing where to live,

118
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,310
I wanted a place
that was not too extravagant,

119
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,439
although my apartment is
the largest in the building.

120
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,524
I also don't enjoy driving…

121
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,317
Humble, my foot.

122
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,073
If you'll excuse me.

123
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,248
WITNESS SUMMONS

124
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,251
I got a summons. What's going on?

125
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,088
I thought we were finished.
I can't believe this is still going on.

126
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,548
Why isn't it over yet?

127
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,884
Well…

128
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,096
The prosecutor in charge
is on leave at the moment.

129
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,224
So? You don't even know what happened?

130
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,059
DEPUTY CHIEF PROSECUTOR,
RYU SEUNG-DUK

131
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,187
Of course, I do.

132
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,065
Something came up,
so I can't tell that prosecutor.

133
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,358
Didn't you say

134
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,153
that prosecutor was the ace
in your office?

135
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,905
You can't take what I give

136
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,116
and then turn around and betray me.

137
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,162
I didn't betray you.

138
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,705
Please calm down.

139
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,000
I told you. Something came up.

140
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,044
Like what?

141
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:26,589
Did they go missing
while on vacation or something?

142
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,549
Of course, not.

143
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,343
Give me some time.

144
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,261
I'll figure it out somehow.

145
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,268
That old man and his temper.

146
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,690
What is going on with you, Yeon-ju?

147
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,194
The phone is turned off.

148
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,403
Please leave a message…

149
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,702
Did she really go missing or something?

150
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:09,215
"Mother had decided to handle it herself."

151
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,758
What could this mean?

152
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:14,303
He probably said that
to cover up what he did.

153
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,598
I say this out of concern for you.

154
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,518
Are you sure you're okay with
digging up the past

155
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,353
like this?

156
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,855
It's not like I can't guess

157
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:28,025
-what kind of a life you've had, but…
-You can…

158
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,152
guess?

159
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,784
What kind of a life do you think I've had?

160
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,838
YEAR 2011, LOS ANGELES, CA, USA

161
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:56,470
My mom and I practically fled to the US
and pretty much lived in hiding.

162
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,568
I only found out that my grandfather

163
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:14,113
had been sick and passed away
through the newspaper.

164
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,387
There's something you need to know

165
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,891
about what happened that day in 2007.

166
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,271
I heard about Mi-na's engagement
to Sung-woon after I had left Korea.

167
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,440
So I thought what Mi-na wanted to tell me

168
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,567
was just an excuse for that
and ignored her.

169
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,368
It was the day of my mom's funeral.

170
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,999
NO HAK-TAE

171
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:49,917
SENT MESSAGE

172
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,421
Thank you for your kindness until now.

173
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:57,466
We will never return to Korea.

174
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,636
Because it is obvious that Han Young-sik

175
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:04,140
will do to Seung-wook
what he did to his dad.

176
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,852
He'll fabricate everything
and push him to his death.

177
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,273
But I realized this
after I saw that message.

178
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,358
My mother

179
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,987
knew my father had been framed,

180
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,449
but she went to the US for me.

181
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,704
And that event in 2007
that Mi-na had mentioned

182
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,582
may have been about my father.

183
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:35,921
I made up my mind

184
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,549
to return

185
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,971
and put everything back to the way it was.

186
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,273
I must find Mi-na
and find out about that day.

187
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:59,904
Then why don't you report her missing?

188
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,492
And send her fill-in back
to where she came from.

189
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,910
Where is that?

190
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,953
That's a problem too.

191
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,122
Furthermore,

192
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,125
that woman may become
a weakness for Hanju.

193
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,585
She is like our weapon.

194
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,921
We should keep her
so we can use her when we need.

195
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,966
Then I'll recommend
meeting Prosecutor Cho Yeon-ju

196
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,054
from Central District Prosecutors' Office
whom I had contacted before.

197
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,437
She's supposed to return

198
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,147
from leave this week.

199
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,985
She must be on a really long trip.

200
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,445
The phone is turned off.

201
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,073
-Please leave a message…
-I still can't get through.

202
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,751
What if I get arrested
for impersonating Kang Mi-na

203
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,878
when I'm actually a gangster?

204
00:13:58,921 --> 00:13:59,755
No.

205
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,840
You can't go to jail
just for impersonation.

206
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,928
However, the moment I become
the head of this group,

207
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,180
I can enjoy the benefits of its fortune.

208
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,641
That would make me guilty of fraud,

209
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:14,144
and I could be imprisoned for up to
10 years and fined up to 20 million won.

210
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,397
And why does that just roll off my tongue?

211
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,900
Did I go in and out of jail

212
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,319
when I was a gangster?

213
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,029
No.

214
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,949
Kang Mi-na could have been
from a rich family

215
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,742
and a gangster at the same time.

216
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,078
That's right.

217
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,761
FINGERPRINT DOESN'T MATCH

218
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,934
FINGERPRINT DOESN'T MATCH

219
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:58,856
FINGERPRINT DOESN'T MATCH

220
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,279
PLEASE TRY AGAIN AFTER 29 SECONDS

221
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,489
Darn it. It's clear now.

222
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,326
If I'm not Kang Mi-na,

223
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,621
where is she right now?

224
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,625
That scared me.

225
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,669
Where was he until now?

226
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,632
So you two had an affair,
and I knew about it?

227
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,425
I always made sure he went home to sleep.

228
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,428
That's what makes me angry.
All he does at home is sleep.

229
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,554
He's useless!

230
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,139
Is this a hotel or what?

231
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:37,102
Why did I get so upset about
someone else's husband having an affair?

232
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:43,943
In your family,
you've been no more than a speck of dust.

233
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,445
That's exactly your position
in your family.

234
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,574
KANG MI-NA'S HISTORY

235
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,915
AUGUST 24, YEAR 2004
YUMIN GROUP'S SECOND SON'S GRADUATION

236
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:13,222
Even if it is someone else's life,
I should live it right.

237
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,476
I won't get caught

238
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,937
and I'll return this life back to you

239
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,231
after I upgrade it.

240
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,409
What are you talking about?

241
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,452
You're her investigator.

242
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,914
You should have
her emergency contact information.

243
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,001
She's never taken a day off
or been unreachable before.

244
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,293
Still.

245
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,838
How can you give a case back
when she isn't here?

246
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,298
Mr. Lee came himself and asked for it.

247
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,220
Where is she?

248
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,184
So can't you think of
anywhere she could be?

249
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,353
I'm not sure,

250
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,982
but she got a tip
that Lee Bong-sik was back

251
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,901
and said she may go on a stakeout
during her time off.

252
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,069
What?

253
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,203
Who's the one closest to Ms. Cho?

254
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,330
Tell them to go to her home.

255
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,541
What? Just go into her home?

256
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,043
Why you…

257
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,421
What's there to stop a prosecutor
from entering a place?

258
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,049
I'll get them a warrant.
Tell them to go right now!

259
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:34,344
You people.
She has been unreachable for days.

260
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,055
Aren't you worried?

261
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,349
Earn your salaries, will you?

262
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:43,020
SEOPYUNG DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

263
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:48,025
Sir, about Samgeori Gang…

264
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,151
Yes?

265
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,696
I don't think
they just sneak people to Vietnam.

266
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,116
-Why?
-They say drugs are involved.

267
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,119
They're suddenly saying
they'll give us something big

268
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,913
in return for letting them go.

269
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,832
And by the sound of it,

270
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,794
looks like things will get
quite complicated.

271
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,129
Who did they rat out?

272
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:10,881
Hold on.

273
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,761
Yes, just a moment.

274
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,054
PROSECUTOR AN YU-JUN

275
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,598
Mr. An, it's
the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

276
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,114
How long have these been here for?

277
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,535
May I help you?

278
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,373
I live in this unit. Do you live here?

279
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,416
I know the person who lives in the unit.

280
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,921
Is that…

281
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,799
Oh, this.

282
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,635
I was just checking the expiry date.

283
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,514
You can have it.
It'll go bad if it stays out here anyway.

284
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,974
No, what do you take me for?

285
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,561
Yes, sir.

286
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,188
Right. I'm in front of her place now.

287
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,023
Yes.

288
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,402
-Be on your way, won't you?
-Right, okay.

289
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,616
Yes, sir.

290
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,327
Right.

291
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,329
Got it.

292
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,915
Will do.

293
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,253
Her place looked clean and tidy.

294
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,298
But she left her prosecutor ID
and even her phone at home.

295
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,091
Her car is still in the parking lot.

296
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,802
The security camera by the entrance
isn't working properly,

297
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,345
so I couldn't check the footage.

298
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,390
How long has she been gone for?

299
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:46,560
There are no security cameras
in the hallway due to privacy concerns.

300
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,812
There was a pile of milk cartons
delivered to her place,

301
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,273
but it looked like her neighbor
had been taking them.

302
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,401
Darn it. Are they beggars?
Why take someone else's milk…

303
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:01,867
-Where do her parents live?
-From what I know, she has no family.

304
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,538
But before she went on leave,
she did mention that

305
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,874
-she had to investigate something.
-Lee Bong-sik?

306
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,542
You knew?

307
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,380
Who else knows about it?

308
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,761
I don't think she told anyone else.
She kept asking me for help in secret.

309
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,650
Thank you. Have a good day.

310
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,236
-Thank you.
-Young-chul. Can you watch the counter?

311
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,404
-Sure.
-Gosh, seriously.

312
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,990
What did I tell you?

313
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,368
She totally betrayed us.

314
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,370
It's not that she can't pick up her phone.

315
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,248
I bet she changed her number
and has moved.

316
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,501
Don't you think it's odd though?

317
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,794
What's odd?

318
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,964
Think about the time
you were stabbed years ago.

319
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,758
When you stab someone you know,
you can't help but hesitate

320
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:00,968
even for just a second.

321
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,469
How do you know?

322
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,555
As a human,
you can't help but think for a moment,

323
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,391
and it shows in your eyes.

324
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,769
But when Yeon-ju
was throwing punches at me,

325
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,773
she did not hesitate at all.

326
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,026
Yeon-ju.

327
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,821
Are you okay?

328
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,037
Are you saying

329
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,958
she's not even treating us as humans?

330
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,167
Well…

331
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,211
Is that what's going on?

332
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,339
That is not right.

333
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,842
We helped her get to where she is today.

334
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,054
Uncles, you ran this far away?

335
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,223
We did not run away.

336
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,309
We've been released from prison.

337
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,768
We heard

338
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,438
you've been failing the bar exam
for several years,

339
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,982
so we came to help.

340
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,943
How exactly are you going to help me
pass the bar exam?

341
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,486
-Don't be ridiculous.
-Yeon-ju.

342
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,031
In our cell, there was a jerk
who got three years

343
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,074
for installing spy cams in dorms
for bar exam takers.

344
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,117
It's disgusting.

345
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,077
Anyway, he told us

346
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,662
that to pass the second round,

347
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,122
you must be well-versed

348
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,874
in recent precedents

349
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,043
and know how to apply them.

350
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,419
And that being said…

351
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,258
UNITE AND FIGHT

352
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,350
I was asked to sell a stolen celadon vase
from the Goryeo period.

353
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,643
But instead of selling it,

354
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,063
I used it as collateral.
That's why I went to jail.

355
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,024
A crime of negligence
caused by storing a stolen good?

356
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,693
Or is it embezzlement?

357
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,696
After committing the murder,
I left the body at the scene

358
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,573
and fled so the body wouldn't be found.

359
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:47,699
Hold on.

360
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,910
Were you convicted of concealment

361
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,286
of a human corpse or not?

362
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,163
I used to grow green onions.

363
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,915
I sold the entire field,

364
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:58,043
and they plowed the whole thing.

365
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,214
Petty scumbags.

366
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,093
Our family collapsed after Boss left,

367
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,386
and you wanted us
to become an invincible gang

368
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,472
with a prosecutor who's got our back.

369
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,057
You fool.

370
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,101
That was my big picture.

371
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,603
Right. We approached her
with the big picture in mind.

372
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,523
But regardless, we helped her out so much.

373
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:23,693
Still, we shouldn't have
buried her like that.

374
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,321
Darn it.

375
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,532
My bar exam has nothing to do with you.

376
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,367
Why are you doing this to me?

377
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,285
Gosh, you're so loud.

378
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,037
Look.

379
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,373
You can't get out
until you memorize everything.

380
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,500
It'll take forever!

381
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,460
Get me out of here!

382
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:47,217
Even if she's been holding a grudge
over it, she can't betray us like this.

383
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,470
And she passed the exam
because we made her memorize everything.

384
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,390
I can't stop thinking
about how strange this situation is.

385
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,226
Hey, stop thinking
and go deliver the orders.

386
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,394
We keep getting orders.

387
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,437
Are you going to sit here and ignore them?

388
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,240
Today, I am here for some kickbacks.

389
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,783
You could even say I tailed you.

390
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,245
I'm the major shareholder. Nothing matters
more than appointing a chairman.

391
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,163
Okay, I heard you.

392
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:19,040
I'm sure you weren't able
to memorize everything last night,

393
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,042
so try not to talk too much.

394
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,128
That man with the glasses
in front of the elevator.

395
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,963
Hwang Man-geun,
the CEO of Yumin Electronics.

396
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,299
Joined the company in 1988
as one of the special recruits,

397
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,176
and climbed the ladder
until getting demoted

398
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,052
for his wrong predictions
about smartphones.

399
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,513
Then he regained his feet,
becoming the last one to be appointed

400
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,182
an executive among his peers.

401
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,850
The annex was built two years ago.

402
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,978
The skywalk on the 14th floor
leads you to the chairman's office.

403
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,063
I memorized the floor plan too.

404
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,065
Do you want to know
where the cafeteria is?

405
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,194
Anything else? Do you want to know
the subsidiary capital structure?

406
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,779
You memorized that all?

407
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,782
For some reason,
I'm really used to memorizing stuff.

408
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,701
If I didn't memorize anything,

409
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,953
I feel as though
I'd be buried up to my neck.

410
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,914
Feeling desperate to memorize it all

411
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,081
as fast as I could…

412
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,251
-My gosh.
-I'm relieved.

413
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:07,172
But don't use strong expressions
during the meeting.

414
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:10,217
Be vague so you can avoid problems
down the road.

415
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,969
-And that temper of yours--
-Hey, look.

416
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:17,641
As you know, I've lived
with memory loss for a few days.

417
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,977
And I think I'm actually
quite perceptive and smart.

418
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,812
The doctor told me

419
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,940
that all my knowledge is still intact.

420
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,400
I just can't put it to use at the moment.

421
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,946
I'm much smarter than you think I am.

422
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,030
I'm sure of it.

423
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:33,907
What?

424
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,618
Who are you? Do you know me?

425
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,497
Are you disappointed that
I'm not a fool without my memories?

426
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,666
I may have lost my memory,

427
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:45,043
but I'm not an idiot, so stop nagging me.

428
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,879
I know what's going on,
so I won't ruin things like an idiot.

429
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,132
I'll do my best to look like Kang Mi-na.

430
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:55,178
I mean, the Kang Mi-na
before the memory loss.

431
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,097
All right.

432
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,057
Good luck.

433
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:02,686
Thanks, I guess?

434
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,942
I didn't tell him to leave.
I just wanted to say that I got this.

435
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,285
You say you and Ms. Cho are close,
so I'll tell you what's going on.

436
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,870
The lobbying case involving Hanju
and the tax commissioner.

437
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,914
It was handed over to Ms. Cho
from Division Two,

438
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,292
but they got the case back
because she's gone AWOL.

439
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:30,380
The thing is, she could've collected tons
of kickbacks had she taken the case.

440
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,840
Why would she go AWOL

441
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,925
when such a huge case
was handed over to her?

442
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,135
It's so strange.

443
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,012
It is strange, indeed.

444
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,847
Let's be honest.

445
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,974
She's like a loyal dog
to those with power.

446
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,060
She'd never miss an opportunity like this.

447
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,355
Something must have happened.

448
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,358
A loyal dog to those with power?

449
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,861
No, she's not a dog.

450
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,113
If I must compare her to an animal…

451
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,408
Don't worry too much.

452
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,493
I watch those with power

453
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,995
like a meerkat would.

454
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,372
-A meerkat?
-I always observe the kingpins.

455
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,876
I'd carefully observe everyone
and identify the one

456
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,253
with the most power
and side with that person.

457
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,172
Must you do all that to collect kickbacks?

458
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,299
If I don't,
will it be returned to society?

459
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,801
Someone will take the money anyway.
So why just leave it?

460
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,220
You'll never understand
because you were born rich.

461
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,515
You know, I want millions and billions.

462
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,559
Not in my probiotics,

463
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,227
but in cash.

464
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,812
That's the kind of life I want.

465
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,069
Maybe she's found a new backer.

466
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,989
You know,
she never disobeys her higher-ups.

467
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,491
Something must've happened.

468
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,203
Should I do some more digging
into Lee Bong-sik?

469
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,163
No, don't.

470
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,793
Don't dig up that old case.

471
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,294
Ask around her closest ones,

472
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,880
and report to me
as soon as you hear from her, okay?

473
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,050
Yes, sir.

474
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,977
She's going after Lee Bong-sik,

475
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,146
so I can't even report her missing.

476
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,367
There's another thing
Deputy Chief doesn't know.

477
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,209
I think the domestic violence case

478
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:35,130
should go to someone
who has worked on many similar cases.

479
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,465
You take it.

480
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,884
-Me?
-What? Is there a problem?

481
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,555
I can't work on domestic violence
and sexual violence cases forever.

482
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:48,351
Can't I help out
on the real estate fraud case?

483
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,644
Hey!

484
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,065
These cases are the ABCs

485
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,109
of the Criminal Department,

486
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,527
not fraud cases.

487
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,946
What do the ABCs mean? The basics.

488
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,031
And I need you to take charge
of the basics.

489
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:05,285
You're an expert, aren't you? I trust you.

490
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,084
Where is he?

491
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,138
PUSHOVER 3

492
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,731
Leave the chores
to the prosecutor in charge of the ABCs.

493
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,442
Take the important cases
so you can enter the Special Department.

494
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,485
Thank you, sir.

495
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,157
What brings you here?

496
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,200
I'm disappointed, sir.

497
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,951
What do you mean?

498
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,205
You're disappointing in general,

499
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:55,251
but what disappoints me the most
is that I'm not even Pushover One or Two.

500
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,461
Why am I Pushover Three?

501
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,215
No matter how hard I work,

502
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,885
I'll never be Pushover One or Two.
I'll always be Pushover Three.

503
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:07,847
Pushover Three! That's my position.
All I'll ever do are chores.

504
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,269
CHIEF PROSECUTOR, HONG SUNG-CHANG

505
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:16,981
That's when Prosecutor Cho Yeon-ju
decided to stop being a pushover.

506
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,945
The world looked down on those
without money or connections.

507
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:26,199
Yeon-ju was full of spite
and determined to get to the top.

508
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:30,036
She's not loyal to the higher-ups.

509
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,832
She wants to get higher than them.

510
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,350
Shall we get started?

511
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,978
As you all know, today's main agenda

512
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,480
is the appointment of the new chairman
of Yumin Group.

513
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,192
And I heard a horrible rumor
at the recent shareholders' meeting.

514
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:06,364
That Ms. Kang hurt her head in an accident
and loses her mind occasionally.

515
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,493
The chairman's health
directly affects the stock prices.

516
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,662
Can she really manage the group properly?

517
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,748
It's true that I was temporarily unwell

518
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,001
right after the accident,
but I'm fine now.

519
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,003
Let's say you didn't hurt your head.

520
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,046
But what difference does it make?

521
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,799
You married right after
graduating from a Korean college

522
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,010
and you've been a housewife ever since.

523
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:29,721
Recently, a chairman
gave his housewife daughter

524
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:33,141
a CEO position,
and she almost bankrupted the company.

525
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,018
I'm reminded of that.

526
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,729
A woman like her can destroy
a company in no time.

527
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:42,442
You've never studied abroad
or studied business.

528
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,237
You can only get lucky so many times,
don't you think?

529
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:50,199
Let's face it,
you're not even a legitimate heir.

530
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,785
Considering your background and education,

531
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,996
why don't you just import a bakery chain?

532
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,249
Speaking of which,

533
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:02,337
she and my wife's sister
aren't even blood-related.

534
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,090
Who knows whether someone related to her
will show up out of nowhere?

535
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,301
That'll be a headache.

536
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,094
Stop scaring her.

537
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,763
I'm sure she gets what we mean.

538
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,933
As long as the company is run
by the board,

539
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,602
it won't matter much who the chairman is.

540
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,145
Don't you agree?

541
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,817
This feels strangely familiar.

542
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,282
No matter how hard I work,

543
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,077
I'll never be Pushover One or Two.

544
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,371
Pushover Three! That's my position.

545
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,457
I'm an heiress who is a lovechild
that happened to survive alone.

546
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,544
No matter how hard I work,
they're never going to accept me.

547
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,717
So you're basically telling me
to be Yumin Group's pushover,

548
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,303
who does all the work
and bears the brunt of everything.

549
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,977
This is why I can never control my temper.

550
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,106
Listen, CFO Oh Ki-young of Yumin Chemical,

551
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,066
who is also my aunt's first son.

552
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,611
Did you say my head injury
would affect the stock prices?

553
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:12,615
Would you explain why your stocks
fell by 27 percent since the last quarter

554
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,492
when you didn't even hurt your head?

555
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:17,745
Hey! At least we're in the black.

556
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,790
Are you proud of making 10,000 won
after investing 10 million won?

557
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,417
Next!

558
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,004
CEO Seo Hyun-gu of Yumin Insurance,
who is also my mother's youngest brother.

559
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,089
You pestered your mother
to give you Yumin Chemical,

560
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,717
but got Yumin Insurance
because of your gambling scandal.

561
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,762
Are you trying to sell insurance here?
Stop instigating anxiety.

562
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,640
That company went bankrupt
not because the CEO was a housewife

563
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,643
but because it was run
based on family ties, not competence.

564
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:41,936
Next, Auntie.

565
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,106
Isn't it Yumin Pharmaceuticals
that got lucky?

566
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,859
What failed as a treatment
for arteriosclerosis

567
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:51,112
suddenly brought success as
a treatment for erectile dysfunction.

568
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:55,616
You know the role of luck in life
better than anyone.

569
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,161
But you can't stand it
when anyone else gets lucky?

570
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,123
Next, CEO Choi Tae-seok of Yumin Foods,

571
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,375
who is the first husband
of my late eldest aunt.

572
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,462
Are you even blood-related to my mother?

573
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:11,007
Next! CEO Heo Nam-guk
of Yumin Distribution,

574
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,342
who is the second husband
of my late eldest aunt.

575
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,011
I'll just skip you.

576
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,973
If you continue to shamelessly express
your prejudiced opinions,

577
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,768
soon no one will want to
talk to you anymore.

578
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,936
Then you'll naturally fall behind anyway.

579
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,147
-"Fall behind?"
-Hey!

580
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,274
Stop already!

581
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:31,444
You're only here because
you're the chairman's family member.

582
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:34,655
You should be grateful for our kindness.

583
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,699
It's not our duty to show kindness!

584
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,159
I'm glad you said that.

585
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,788
It's not my duty to be nice to you either.

586
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,750
So appoint me chairman
while I'm still being nice.

587
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,795
None of you got where you are today
because of your competence.

588
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,464
My father, Chairman Kang Jang-soo,
got you places to live,

589
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,926
got you out of prison, and made you CEOs.

590
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,678
Think carefully. You have only one chance.

591
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,932
Will you trust a bunch of fools
who can't do anything without my dad

592
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:05,144
or will you trust me,
who is his legitimate daughter?

593
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,818
A speck of dust?

594
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,946
I'll step on you on my way up

595
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,490
and show you what a speck of dust can do!

596
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:28,501
Director.

597
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,213
-What brings you here?
-You're early.

598
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,257
Of course. By the way,

599
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,552
I heard there would be an audition
for the current affairs debate show.

600
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,303
How did you find out?

601
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,848
It was supposed to be confidential.

602
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:42,849
Sorry?

603
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,644
Of course I should know.
I heard from the other news anchors.

604
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:50,189
Gosh, why do they have such big mouths?

605
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,233
I wanted someone new.

606
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,735
Keep up the good work.

607
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,366
We have breaking news. Have a look.

608
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,046
Did you play golf today too?

609
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,507
How many days a week do you work?

610
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,134
If I work too much,

611
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,136
I won't have time to spend money.

612
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,139
What's the point of hiring smart people?

613
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,183
I want them to do all the work for me.

614
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,810
You should try harder

615
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,103
to work less.

616
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,647
That way, the company will do much better.

617
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,983
I don't need it to do much better.

618
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,652
My goals are small.

619
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,863
If I can't increase
what I inherited threefold,

620
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,240
I'll at least try
not to decrease it to one-third.

621
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,825
Too bad.

622
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,286
You're about to increase
what you have by 13 times.

623
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,955
-Since the crash,
-What do you mean?

624
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,374
Yumin Group has been in great shock.

625
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,252
But today the directors unanimously agreed

626
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,379
to appoint Ms. Kang Mi-na
as the new chairman.

627
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:58,007
She will be the youngest person to lead

628
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,009
-Hey.
-one of the top 20 companies…

629
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,720
Do you think Sung-hye will
try to keep me under control?

630
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,847
Why would she?

631
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:08,267
Mi-na's only weakness at this point
seems to be that she's married to you.

632
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,727
Why you little…

633
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:14,565
I'm sure there are many people
getting restless right now.

634
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,986
Following the sudden passing
of Chairman Kang Jang-soo,

635
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,114
an emergency board meeting was held
to appoint Ms. Kang Mi-na…

636
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,496
What's with that outfit?

637
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,749
There was a charity marathon
at the Han River today

638
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,876
to raise funds for a children's hospital.

639
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,295
It was sponsored by Hanju Foundation.

640
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,798
For every kilometer you run,
100,000 won is donated.

641
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,717
After starting that useless foundation
to increase your shares,

642
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,594
you're creating those useless events?

643
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,930
If you want to build a hospital,
ask your parents.

644
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,265
Why go to all this trouble?

645
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,350
I didn't go there just for money.

646
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,518
The mayor came,

647
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,812
and there were cameras too.

648
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,231
I thought it'd be good for publicity.

649
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,900
If I don't try to get attention,
how would anyone know

650
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,695
whose daughter-in-law I am
when I don't even have a husband?

651
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:04,073
I'm doing this so that people
don't look down on Sun-woo.

652
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,995
Fine. Go out and make connections.

653
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,498
So that you don't play second fiddle
to Chairman Kang Mi-na.

654
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,049
Yumin Group has overcome
this difficult stage

655
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,093
of choosing a successor.

656
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:30,474
Many say Chairman Kang Mi-na's position
in Hanju Group will rise significantly.

657
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,644
-Chairman Kang…
-Look at her.

658
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,940
I'm fine playing second fiddle to her,

659
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,485
but I will not condone

660
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,279
Sun-woo playing second fiddle.

661
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,292
CHAIRMAN KANG MI-NA TO ANNOUNCE
THE FUTURE DIRECTION OF YUMIN GROUP

662
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,467
CHAIRMAN KANG MI-NA EXPRESSES
DESIRE FOR A FAIR MANAGEMENT

663
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:16,020
We're ready. Both the painting and me.

664
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,606
You're coming soon, right?

665
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,485
I'm here.

666
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:31,452
It took me a while
because I had to lose a tail.

667
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,037
What?

668
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,664
I can get out though, right?

669
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:39,168
Come on. Don't you worry.

670
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,087
She got run over while running after me

671
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,381
and died on the spot.

672
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,516
She fled from this country on a boat.

673
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,144
What's going on here?

674
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,069
Why must she climb her way up

675
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,113
and make me drag her down?

676
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:10,908
How did it go?

677
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,619
They'll raid soon.

678
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:29,468
I never said I was leaving.
Maybe she doesn't know that I'm waiting.

679
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,097
Stop. You can't go up there.

680
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,641
-Stop it.
-Stop them.

681
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,602
I'm Prosecutor An from Seopyung District.

682
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,356
-Yes. Just a minute. You can't go up.
-But we have to.

683
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,985
The suspect is a flight risk,
so let me confirm first.

684
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:48,821
You must be a little dense.

685
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:51,824
-We must speak with our legal department.
-I understood.

686
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,118
Call the legal department
and let me talk to them.

687
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,703
You should know better.

688
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,163
Give it a rest.

689
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,999
If you barge in like this,
you may regret it later.

690
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,208
Even if you do go up,

691
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,419
you'll have to leave right away.

692
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,379
That's fine, but I need to at least go up.

693
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,424
I appreciate your concern,
but I can't give it a rest.

694
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,970
Go ahead. I'll speak with
the legal department and then go up.

695
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,638
-No, you can't go.
-Stop them.

696
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,307
-Stop them!
-You can't go!

697
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,224
Stop them.

698
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,438
Whatever.

699
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,357
Regardless, I'm the chairman now.

700
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,987
It's a good thing for Kang Mi-na.

701
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,073
You can't go in there. Seriously.

702
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,035
Ms. Kang Mi-na.

703
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,037
I'm an investigator
from Seopyung District.

704
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,956
We received a tip
that you used illegal drugs.

705
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,126
-Come with us.
-Drugs?

706
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,420
-Me?
-Do you deny it?

707
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,548
I wouldn't know.

708
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,175
I see. Come with us.

709
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:52,968
Wait.

710
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,141
Laws of Criminal Procedure
Article 199, Section 1.

711
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,645
What did I just say?

712
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,691
They won't bring a warrant
unless they catch you in the act.

713
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,278
As per the laws of criminal procedure,

714
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,114
an investigator needs a suspect's consent…

715
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,744
What are you talking about? Come with us.

716
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,204
Wait a second.

717
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,124
A warrant. Do you have a warrant?

718
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,711
I can't go. Whether or not a suspect

719
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,381
submits to questioning
is purely voluntary at their will.

720
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:34,218
Only when such will is clearly proven

721
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,178
can an investigator…

722
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,933
What's wrong with her?

723
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,101
Hey, Ms. Kang.

724
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,394
Ms. Kang. Are you okay?

725
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:47,022
No. I'm not Kang Mi-na.

726
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,820
Where are you from?

727
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,781
This is an illegal arrest
if you take her against her will.

728
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,992
-Who are you?
-I need to talk to her.

729
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,454
Where's Mr. An?

730
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:03,998
Are you okay?

731
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,458
Yes.

732
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,421
Don't worry. You can go.

733
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,591
If this is a trap for Mi-na,
you won't fall into it.

734
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:17,052
I know. Since I'm not Kang Mi-na.

735
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,472
You knew?

736
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,435
You knew

737
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,645
too?

738
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:32,776
Ms. Kang.

739
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,364
I'm from Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

740
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,282
Come with us.

741
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,585
Hey. How many times
are you going to repeat…

742
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,297
Hello?

743
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,092
Why did they hang up on me?

744
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,305
What happened?

745
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:04,642
While their legal department was stalling,

746
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,268
they called Seoul Central.

747
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,103
We were had.

748
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:24,286
All of the higher-ups went to dinner

749
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,664
and said we should shield her.

750
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:30,793
She gave her hair sample willingly,
which means she has nothing to hide.

751
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,795
We will release her anyway.

752
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,172
We'll just kill time
until we get the lab results.

753
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,467
Hey. You go in.

754
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,678
-Me?
-Yes.

755
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,307
My head was pounding earlier.

756
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,353
I thought she only stayed home.

757
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,105
What was she doing?

758
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,315
Drugs?

759
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,652
Where did she get that?

760
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,780
Good, you're here.

761
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,535
Have a seat.

762
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,495
That's my seat. You need to sit here.

763
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,373
My bad.

764
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:17,005
Seopyung District Prosecutors' Office

765
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,383
received a tip that you took drugs.

766
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:22,094
We're running a test on your urine sample

767
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,096
and we sent your hair sample to NFS.

768
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,390
We'll have to wait for the results, but…

769
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,684
Is it just for use and not distribution?

770
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,102
Pardon?

771
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,229
That's right.

772
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,314
The law punishes distributors

773
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,108
more harshly than users.

774
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:38,861
So if my lab results come back clear,
I should be fine.

775
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,073
I think the distributor gave my name

776
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,700
to save themselves.

777
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,035
That's what's strange.

778
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,831
Seopyung arrested peons from a drug ring
and they suddenly gave a statement

779
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,000
that Hanju Group's daughter-in-law

780
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,586
was in the group that bought their drugs.

781
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:59,339
They barged into the chairman's office
based purely on their statements?

782
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,718
I think they were confident
that you were using.

783
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,303
That's not the important part.

784
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:09,725
The drug, meth, was provided
in plastic bags, 0.5g in each.

785
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:12,561
Then celebrities
and the children of conglomerates

786
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:16,648
would put the meth
in three single-use syringes,

787
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,443
mix it with water,
and shoot it up on their arms.

788
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:22,154
That's very detailed.

789
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:24,948
Why is he giving her a report?

790
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:29,077
These are the drug ring members.
Do you recognize them?

791
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,580
Naturally, I don't remember.

792
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,707
-I see.
-"I see?"

793
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:37,002
Is that all?

794
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,421
If I don't remember,
shove evidence in my face.

795
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,715
But they didn't send us the evidence.

796
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:43,800
Then what? You won't receive them?

797
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,219
You need to demand it.

798
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:48,013
Will you confiscate my phone and tablet?

799
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:50,015
That would be
a violation of your human rights.

800
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:51,517
And you weren't even charged.

801
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,935
Seriously.

802
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:54,895
Listen, okay?

803
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:58,690
When you question a suspect,
you need to blindside them.

804
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,484
How will you blindside me

805
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,486
doing everything step by step?

806
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,571
Obviously, you're planning to let me go.

807
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,783
This is why people say
prosecutors always do a clumsy job!

808
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:09,868
Take another look.

809
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,245
Then we'll have to arrest you.

810
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:17,042
We shouldn't underestimate
the new chairman of Yumin.

811
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:20,963
But why is it
that I feel like I've seen her before?

812
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,839
Take another look!

813
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,801
Where could you have seen
the Hanju family's daughter-in-law?

814
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:32,474
Look at these civil servants.
They're always so clumsy.

815
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,893
Clearly, they don't really want
to investigate this.

816
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,812
But if they do a forensic analysis,

817
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:39,731
getting into Kang Mi-na's tablet PC
will be no problem at all.

818
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,946
Gosh. Do they not even have
any instant coffee?

819
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,615
It's here.

820
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,700
It's right here.

821
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,953
Yes, I had a feeling that it'd be here.

822
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,913
My gosh.

823
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,667
I didn't see you for a while,
so I was wondering what's up.

824
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,085
Who knew I'd see you here?

825
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,253
Me?

826
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:03,755
Did you think I wouldn't know
because of the makeup?

827
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,757
You'll pay off your tab, right?

828
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:09,469
You always have pork bone soup
once every three days,

829
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,263
so I was wondering what was going on.

830
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:12,472
I'll see you at the restaurant.

831
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,682
JUSTICE PORK BONE SOUP

832
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,392
Prosecutor! Over here!

833
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,313
I don't like coming in here
to drop off your order.

834
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,523
I'm making a special exception
for you today.

835
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,942
Nice to meet you.

836
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,485
I'm Hanju's head of legal.

837
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,612
The chairman contacted

838
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:30,198
Yumin's legal team and sent me.

839
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:34,494
From now on, all your legal matters
will be handled by Hanju's legal team.

840
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,205
I can't believe
Yumin Group agreed to it so easily.

841
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,915
Who'd say no when the chairman

842
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,751
of Hanju stepped in himself?

843
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,502
They had no choice.

844
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:45,589
-Anyway, let's go.
-Go where?

845
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:48,842
Your urine test came back negative,
so you can leave.

846
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:53,221
The NFS's in-depth analysis
will take about three weeks.

847
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,265
But your test came back clean,

848
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,768
so it's unlikely
that they'll find something.

849
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,686
Okay, let's go.

850
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:07,903
They just let her go?

851
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,780
I heard her test came back negative.

852
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:13,784
But the hair test can detect it
up to six months after drug use.

853
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,827
Maybe Yumin manipulated
the results somehow.

854
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,996
Well, I don't think it's possible

855
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,790
to manipulate the results.

856
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:23,418
Then what? Are you saying
she's a different person?

857
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:27,714
What have you been mixing
her painkillers with?

858
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,929
Before they took her to Seopyung,

859
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:36,223
I managed to contact
the Central District Office.

860
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:39,059
And the test came back fine,
so everything's been sorted out.

861
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,144
Why are you so angry?

862
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,063
If there was a problem,

863
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,606
things wouldn't be okay now.

864
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,778
From the summons
from the Central District Office

865
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:52,906
to the prosecutors barging in
to arrest my daughter-in-law.

866
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:55,283
Since when were we your punching bag?

867
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:58,995
I promised you
that I will sort it all out,

868
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,540
so please trust me.

869
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,041
Trust what? The promise

870
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,626
or the person who made it?

871
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,336
I don't trust anyone.

872
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,963
I only trust promises.

873
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,006
I know that we go back a long way,

874
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,801
but if you fail to keep your promise,
we won't let it slide.

875
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,473
We go back a long way? As if.

876
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,436
Now, he's just bogging me down.

877
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:27,983
I must say, the chairman was impatient

878
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:31,903
because those at Yumin
can't find out about your condition.

879
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,447
My condition? What do you mean?

880
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,449
The drug test came back negative.

881
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,367
There's nothing wrong with me.

882
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,870
You can be honest with me.

883
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,788
I signed a six-page NDA and swore

884
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,374
that I'd never tell anyone
about your amnesia.

885
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,752
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

886
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:52,841
Hold on. Six pages, seriously?

887
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:55,719
I'm just an employee, you know.

888
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:58,805
If it gets out,
Hanju will have more to lose.

889
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:02,392
In case I tell someone
about your condition.

890
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,437
In case it gets out because of me
even if I don't tell anyone.

891
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,149
In case I tell someone
and the company benefits from it.

892
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:12,402
In case it just gets out
and the company benefits from it.

893
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:15,113
There were a number of scenarios.

894
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:18,366
And I'd have to pay a huge penalty
no matter which scenario,

895
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,661
so you don't need to worry
about it getting out

896
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,038
because of me.

897
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,549
You were waiting all this time?

898
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:35,717
What happened?

899
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,973
The drug dealer must've given
Kang Mi-na's name to them.

900
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:45,352
I must say, she's incredibly lucky.

901
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:48,897
I made her the chairman of the company
and even passed the drug test for her.

902
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,316
Now, if I can just pass
the bar exam for her…

903
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,110
What?

904
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:57,364
How did you know
that you're not Kang Mi-na?

905
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:01,034
-That's…
-When did you find out?

906
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,578
Have you known all along,
since the accident?

907
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,330
No, I really didn't know.

908
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,500
I just started doubting it
at the shareholders' meeting.

909
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,503
Weren't you the one who got me
appointed chairman of the company?

910
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,839
Hold on.

911
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:17,759
When did you find out
that I'm not Kang Mi-na?

912
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,679
You knew, and you still helped me
at the shareholders' meeting?

913
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:22,055
What happened was,

914
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:25,892
she already knew
that she was not Kang Mi-na.

915
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,937
And you let her find out that you know

916
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,356
that she's not Kang Mi-na.

917
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,025
What? You knew too?

918
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:39,322
You sure signed a six-page NDA.

919
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,825
You're such a good actor.

920
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:46,746
So what will you do? It's not like
we can hide her somewhere now.

921
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,081
What are you talking about?

922
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:49,875
Hide me? Do you even know who I am?

923
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,918
-Who are you?
-Me?

924
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,920
I'm…

925
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,132
Maybe I'm the Yumin chairman's

926
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,258
secret lovechild.

927
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,427
I mean, I look so much like his daughter.

928
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,596
You are not.

929
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,723
We've already done extensive research.

930
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:05,765
Are you sure?

931
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:08,810
Darn it.

932
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,937
I suppose you were hoping

933
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,982
you'd actually be a rich heiress.

934
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,233
No, I wasn't!

935
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:18,612
Then what are you thinking?

936
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,156
We were just trying to gauge the situation

937
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,866
while looking for the real Mi-na.

938
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,952
But knowing her personality,

939
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,746
I doubt she won't get caught

940
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:30,874
until we find the real Ms. Kang Mi-na.

941
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,918
-Gosh.
-Look.

942
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,002
All this time,

943
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:36,463
I've been managing to keep it to myself

944
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,714
and not get caught.

945
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:38,965
But,

946
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,259
why can't you disclose

947
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,136
that I'm not Kang Mi-na?

948
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,392
Look at this.

949
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,686
You two are certainly up to something.

950
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:55,065
You got me appointed as the chairman
fully knowing that I'm a fake.

951
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,943
And why did you sign the six-page NDA,

952
00:53:58,026 --> 00:54:01,196
swearing that you won't tell anyone
about Kang Mi-na's amnesia?

953
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,908
About your accident.

954
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:08,370
We have reasons to believe
that it was done deliberately.

955
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,748
What? Who was the target?

956
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:12,874
Me or Kang Mi-na?

957
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,042
That we don't know.

958
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,419
But someone sent in a tip,

959
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,213
claiming that Kang Mi-na used drugs,

960
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:20,423
so it's highly likely
that she was the target.

961
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:23,969
My goodness. You folks are scary people.

962
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:25,220
Why tell me this now?

963
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:27,764
Then I have no reason
to live as Kang Mi-na.

964
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:30,558
I'm asking you to keep it up
just until we find her.

965
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:33,645
Why must I risk my life and do that?
I'd rather just tell everyone.

966
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,981
Do you want to go to jail
for impersonating her?

967
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,983
Do you think Hanju will just let you off?

968
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,693
Says the one who breached the NDA.

969
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:42,153
Don't talk like this doesn't concern you.

970
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,488
You think I'll just stay quiet?

971
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:46,449
I'll say you were in on it too
as my joint offenders.

972
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,159
Look at you using fancy legal terms.

973
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:51,413
You may get in huge trouble
before you can even do that.

974
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:52,956
Darn it.

975
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:56,084
Then let's find this woman
as quickly as possible.

976
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:58,962
I don't want to be dragged
into another accident or drug case.

977
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,762
She looks just like Mi-na
but is nothing like her.

978
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:10,807
Let's go.

979
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,685
You can drive, right?

980
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:14,936
Since I'm already here,

981
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,647
I'd like to meet Prosecutor Cho Yeon-ju.

982
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:27,365
PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE
PROSECUTOR CHO YEON-JU

983
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:37,834
Looks like it's a hot mess here
these days.

984
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,879
It's still early. I can't believe
everyone left already.

985
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:43,131
May I help you?

986
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:48,053
Hello. I'm here to see
Prosecutor Cho Yeon-ju.

987
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:50,847
I see. The thing is…

988
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:52,974
DEPUTY CHIEF PROSECUTOR,
RYU SEUNG-DUK

989
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,521
Hey. Any word from An Yu-jun yet?

990
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,732
No, sir. Nothing yet.

991
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,276
I don't think she told anyone else.

992
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,945
She kept asking me for help in secret.

993
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,865
Should I do some more digging
into Lee Bong-sik?

994
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,661
What is this punk up to?

995
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:21,127
-Hey, report Ms. Cho missing now.
-Sorry?

996
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,629
I must track her down

997
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,130
and find out what she's up to.

998
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:32,889
Does that mean Kang Mi-na

999
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,307
actually did drugs?

1000
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:35,892
Think about it.

1001
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,603
They'd never rely on a tip
without solid evidence

1002
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:41,397
and barge into the office
of the chairman of a conglomerate.

1003
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,525
What kind of crazy prosecutor
would do that?

1004
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:47,487
Gosh, where is this woman?

1005
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,614
There must be a way
we can retrace her steps

1006
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,574
on the day of the accident.

1007
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:54,452
By any chance, was there a tablet PC
synced to Mi-na's phone?

1008
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,037
There is.

1009
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:59,666
But it's locked with a fingerprint
and a six-digit code.

1010
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,000
So there is?

1011
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,045
Then you should find a way to unlock it.
What have you been doing?

1012
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,089
What have I been doing?

1013
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:08,675
I did housework all morning,
memorized all the information

1014
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:11,803
about strangers you gave me,
and was interrogated by the prosecution.

1015
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,472
What about you?

1016
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,891
All you ever do is boss me around.

1017
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,059
You're annoying.

1018
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,437
I've been doing this and that.

1019
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,939
This and that? What this and that?

1020
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:25,859
You mean embroidering your jacket?

1021
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,652
If someone ran me over on purpose,

1022
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:30,947
shouldn't you find out
what that was for immediately?

1023
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,908
I was going to
right after the board meeting.

1024
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,910
The driver is unconscious anyway.

1025
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:38,830
You didn't even attend the meeting.
Why wait until the meeting is over?

1026
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:41,166
You could have started
asking around at least.

1027
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:43,710
See? You're obviously slacking off.

1028
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:44,919
Why should I be trying

1029
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:47,630
to unlock the tablet,
trying every possible six-digit code?

1030
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,716
I'd rather use that energy
to believe I'm Kang Mi-na.

1031
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,092
If you can't even unlock her tablet,

1032
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:53,470
how much longer do you think
you can pretend?

1033
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,472
Also, do you think I'll sit back?

1034
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,891
Do you think I'll sit back then?

1035
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,978
I'll reveal that you've been cooking up
a scheme using the fake Kang Mi-na.

1036
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,688
I won't go down alone.

1037
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:06,399
If you want us all
to go down together, go ahead.

1038
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,442
Goodness.

1039
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,861
Gosh, how did I end up in this mess?

1040
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:11,237
That's what I want to say.

1041
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,048
Anyway, it's in your best interest
to cooperate.

1042
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:32,675
Once Mi-na is found,

1043
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:35,553
I'll make sure you can go back
to your normal life.

1044
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,430
How can I trust you?

1045
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,350
You must have forgotten
because I'm driving you around.

1046
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:43,436
But I'm the largest shareholder
of your company.

1047
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,813
It'll be a cakewalk for me.

1048
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,857
Oh, that's right.

1049
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,609
You know I hurt my head.

1050
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,861
You should understand.
I keep forgetting things.

1051
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:54,781
You only say that when you're in trouble.

1052
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,787
After being summoned,

1053
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,498
that woman yelled at the prosecutors
and lectured them.

1054
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:06,209
The reporter who's there
told everyone in the newsroom.

1055
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,585
What's with your wife?

1056
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,879
How could she change
so completely overnight?

1057
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:12,090
-Tell me what's going on.
-That woman…

1058
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:16,553
Is she…

1059
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:25,979
Come on. You're with me too.

1060
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,066
She's smiling.

1061
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:34,279
This is unbelievable. She's married.

1062
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:39,450
Hey!

1063
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:41,828
I mean, honey!

1064
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:46,833
I can't believe you.

1065
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,877
Your wife was framed
and summoned by the prosecution

1066
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,588
and jumped through hoops to escape.

1067
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,631
And did you just get out of that car?

1068
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:56,759
It's not like that.
She showed up without--

1069
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:57,969
Forget it.

1070
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,847
What about you? You…

1071
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,223
I'm not done yet.

1072
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,314
Seung-wook.

1073
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,483
Why are you suddenly hovering around her?

1074
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:15,945
Make up your mind.

1075
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,115
Do you really want her
or do you just hate to lose her

1076
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,491
to someone else?

1077
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:22,910
Watch what you say.

1078
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:29,626
I mean, why should I?

1079
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,086
I'm not scared of anything anymore.

1080
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,505
Don't you think that's something
only those who don't have

1081
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:35,757
anyone to please can say?

1082
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:37,759
Like me.

1083
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,428
-What?
-You're not one of them.

1084
01:00:58,696 --> 01:00:59,822
Mi-na.

1085
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:03,785
Was it Seung-wook who drove you home?

1086
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,037
I mean the largest shareholder

1087
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,498
who supported you.

1088
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:10,625
Is everyone in this family

1089
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,835
a surveillance camera or what?

1090
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:15,296
After I got married,

1091
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,882
I felt uncomfortable seeing a guy alone,

1092
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,258
whoever he was.

1093
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,845
I'm not pointing the finger at you though.

1094
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,473
These days, being easy
can be your asset too.

1095
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:28,309
-What?
-Go inside.

1096
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:30,770
Father and Mother are waiting.

1097
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,064
Okay.

1098
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:45,868
Great job.

1099
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:50,498
Getting summoned by the prosecution
over such a disgusting scandal.

1100
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:51,916
Be quiet.

1101
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,046
I heard that you taught

1102
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,465
the prosecutors a lesson.

1103
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:02,093
Considering the way you've been

1104
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:03,845
dealing with things, I say you pass.

1105
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:06,389
But keep your guard up, okay?

1106
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:09,851
Father, it's not like I submitted
an application to you or anything.

1107
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:12,270
Who gives you the right
to decide if I pass?

1108
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:15,606
If you must decide, decide you'll
hold morning meetings at the hotel.

1109
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,233
Then I won't have to prepare breakfast.

1110
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,571
Anyway, you start working tomorrow.

1111
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:24,574
Take a break from housework
for the time being. Go get some rest.

1112
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:27,869
What? I was just saying.

1113
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:30,329
Father, thank you.

1114
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:38,421
Who will do all the housework then?
You said we can't hire any people.

1115
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,339
Surely Jae-hee can take over.

1116
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,968
Father, with the foundation

1117
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:46,471
and all the charity work, I'm quite busy.

1118
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:49,182
All you do is spend money anyway.

1119
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:54,020
Does he have a soft spot for Mi-na now?

1120
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:56,606
Unbelievable.

1121
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:02,153
The pecking order seems to change
every minute.

1122
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:06,407
You should've been nicer to Mi-na.

1123
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,743
You're one to talk.

1124
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:09,994
Me?

1125
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:13,539
I tend to be mean to people I like.

1126
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,751
Why you little…

1127
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:33,100
If someone ran me over on purpose,

1128
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:36,437
shouldn't you find out
what that was for immediately?

1129
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,689
You could have started
asking around at least.

1130
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,566
Asking around?

1131
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,318
Asking around?

1132
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:45,988
Who's bossing whom around now?

1133
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,866
Does she think I'll do
everything she tells me to do?

1134
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:49,867
Gosh.

1135
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:00,378
I can't believe she's doing this to me.

1136
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:05,007
WARD 92

1137
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,391
-Will he be okay?
-Of course.

1138
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,481
Is Mr. Jang Seok-ho here?

1139
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:22,483
What do you need?

1140
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:26,112
It's about the Hanju Hotel car accident.

1141
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:29,699
Are you a reporter?

1142
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:31,409
We have nothing to say.

1143
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:33,244
If you want to know something,

1144
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:35,329
ask the Hanju Hotel PR team.

1145
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:37,290
Were they here?

1146
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:39,500
Please leave.

1147
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:54,432
Which newspaper are you from?

1148
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:56,684
I'm a reporter from Powerpoint.

1149
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:58,352
She's one stubborn lady.

1150
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:02,231
It's all thanks to the reporters
who criticized Han Sung-hye

1151
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:06,027
they didn't have to compensate the hotel
and even got money from the hotel.

1152
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,946
But since people from Hanju came by,
she's kept her mouth shut.

1153
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:11,741
What did you ask her?

1154
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:15,578
About the daughter-in-law of Hanju.
She's never been in the press,

1155
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:17,330
so there's no information about her.

1156
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,290
That's why I came all the way here.

1157
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:22,084
What can that lady possibly know?

1158
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,295
Once she says a word,

1159
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:25,922
it's my job to flesh it out.

1160
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:30,801
But just how much did Hanju pay her
to keep her mouth so tightly shut?

1161
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:33,304
I feel bad for her husband.

1162
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,431
Thanks to him,
she'll be living comfortably.

1163
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:40,353
People say they hate conglomerates,
but they love to gossip about them.

1164
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:44,398
But these days, there have been
too many articles about their power abuse.

1165
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:47,234
It's harder and harder
to get people's attention.

1166
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:49,487
From what company are you anyway?

1167
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,072
Have you found out anything?

1168
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:52,782
Why don't we help each other?

1169
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,167
Is it an English newspaper?

1170
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:10,049
Ask me anything.

1171
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:13,135
You said people love to gossip
about conglomerates.

1172
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:14,845
Well…

1173
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:16,764
If you want information,
show some manners.

1174
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:20,309
An individual's portrait rights
and bodily integrity come before

1175
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:21,811
the press's right to report.

1176
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:24,063
By the way, may I ask why you're here?

1177
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,400
Write whatever you can come up with.

1178
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:31,612
But if you write about what happened
without the source's permission,

1179
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:33,197
I'll bring charges immediately.

1180
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,076
You may leave.

1181
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:39,036
Okay.

1182
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,725
She slapped my back with such conviction.

1183
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,184
My gosh.

1184
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:05,396
You always have pork bone soup
once every three days,

1185
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:07,481
so I was wondering what was going on.

1186
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:10,109
According to her,

1187
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:11,819
I love pork bone soup

1188
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:15,197
and run a huge tab.

1189
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:16,949
Prosecutor! Over here!

1190
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:22,121
Someone called me something similar once.

1191
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:24,790
Hello there, Prosecutor.

1192
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,500
Funny seeing you here.

1193
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:29,420
Wasn't that a great tip?
Did you hit the jackpot with it?

1194
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:32,798
Yes, that con artist.

1195
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,843
So he really meant…

1196
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:38,262
I am a prosecutor?

1197
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:41,932
Wait a second. I'm extremely smart,

1198
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:43,476
quick-witted,

1199
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:46,437
and familiar with the law.

1200
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,022
I know someone in the Prosecutors' Office,

1201
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:51,192
and someone even called me "Prosecutor."

1202
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:53,778
Does that mean…

1203
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:11,087
EPILOGUE

1204
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:20,971
My goodness.

1205
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:23,432
PLEASE TRY AGAIN AFTER 29 SECONDS

1206
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,060
It's clear now.

1207
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:31,273
If I'm not Kang Mi-na,

1208
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:34,443
where is she right now?

1209
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:27,246
Anyway, I look forward to working
with you, Mr. Double Agent.

1210
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:28,372
Are you sure you can't reach Yeon-ju?

1211
01:09:28,455 --> 01:09:30,416
I saw Ms. Cho yesterday too.

1212
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:32,209
What kind of mischief is she up to now?

1213
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:34,962
No one seems to know
about her personal life.

1214
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:36,922
What if Kang Mi-na is hiding on purpose?

1215
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,008
Let's see how Mi-na
handles things this time.

1216
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:41,677
They must look down on me
because I'm a young woman.

1217
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,263
Your charisma is incredible.

1218
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:47,391
Why do I have to clean up
after Kang Mi-na every time?

1219
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:49,518
I seem to keep thinking of you as Mi-na.

1220
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:52,271
Since it's already happened,
why don't you make a fresh start?
