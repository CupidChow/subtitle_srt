1
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,415
Everything makes sense now.

2
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,127
The Mi-na I liked

3
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,172
was the person I talked to that night.

4
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,634
But I'm not

5
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,471
that Kang Mi-na anymore.

6
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,767
Who I am,

7
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,311
whose daughter I am…

8
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,439
Are you sure none of that matters to you?

9
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,193
I'm not that boy anymore either.

10
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,738
When you get to really know someone,

11
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,575
the person often turns out to be
different from what you imagined.

12
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,660
Also,

13
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,788
that's when

14
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,042
true love begins.

15
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,623
Maybe this place is too exposed.

16
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,543
The Hanju Hotel garage is famous for it.

17
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,627
What?

18
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,338
It's pretty remote and dark,

19
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,590
so it's popular

20
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,842
with people dating secretly.

21
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,013
You probably can't see it
through those tinted windows,

22
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,848
but in these cars…

23
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,933
Anyway, they are all busy.

24
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,936
They wouldn't care
what's happening outside.

25
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,564
Even if they did, it's not like
our relationship is inappropriate.

26
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,234
But it is, in other people's eyes.

27
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,653
Right, I'm Kang Mi-na.

28
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,573
And you're my cousin-in-law.

29
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,618
This is definitely inappropriate.

30
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,662
-Where's your car?
-Over there.

31
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,709
Mr. No. How did you know I was here?

32
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,503
I told you Mr. Han
was probably still at the hotel,

33
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,672
and you rushed out.

34
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:38,426
You basically told me
where you were going.

35
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,139
So this is what happened.

36
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,602
What do you mean? Did you see something?

37
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,355
No, I didn't. I just got here.

38
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,232
Then what did you mean?

39
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,984
I'm not blind.

40
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,569
Just look at his face.

41
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,905
If you'd been dating for a month,
he wouldn't look like that.

42
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:00,823
You two obviously just…

43
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,911
Let's all go in one car.

44
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,269
Still,

45
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,896
how could you give up your shares
without saying anything to me?

46
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,107
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,903
But without his swift decision,
things wouldn't have settled down.

48
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,282
He must be more upset than anyone
about losing his shares.

49
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,491
Leave him alone.

50
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,246
That's enough. I'm fine.

51
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,540
He was going too far.

52
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,457
Hold on.

53
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,669
Should I hand over
some of Mi-na's shares to you?

54
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,087
What do you think?

55
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,965
That might get you in trouble.

56
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,883
Don't worry.

57
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,428
I'm already in deep trouble anyway.

58
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,889
A little more burden
won't make any difference.

59
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,145
Even with your shares put together,
you're not a majority shareholder.

60
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,605
There's no point
in exchanging your shares.

61
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,066
There's a more urgent matter than this.

62
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,321
The PR team just reported to me

63
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,741
that there were rumors going around
about Chairman Kang Mi-na.

64
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,577
What rumors?

65
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:32,749
"Chairman Kang Mi-na
of Yumin Group is fake."

66
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,169
"Someone else is impersonating her."

67
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:42,050
I never imagined you would be the person
who spread this rumor first.

68
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,136
There's no need
to waste your energy playing dumb.

69
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,930
These days, you can easily find out
where a rumor started.

70
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,015
I…

71
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,976
didn't make that up.
I have reason to believe so.

72
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,730
What I want to know is how you feel.

73
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,275
I heard that my brother dumped you.

74
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:04,989
Are you attacking his wife
because you still have feelings for him?

75
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,535
No way.

76
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,788
I want to rip him to pieces.

77
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,667
Excuse my language.

78
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,129
He was, of course,
the first person I told this to.

79
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,839
But he said

80
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,925
if I said things like this ever again,

81
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,052
he'd ruin my career
and have me ostracized.

82
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,096
He did?

83
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:32,016
He is soaring high right now
thanks to his wife.

84
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,768
But I'm telling you

85
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,312
that his wife is a fake.

86
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,606
You don't need to convince me.

87
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,982
In other words,

88
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,236
there is another person
who feels the same way

89
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,279
I do.

90
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:02,046
We need to find a way to get out naturally
before the rumors spread.

91
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,055
Hey…

92
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,852
What's up? You didn't say you were coming.

93
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,604
Since when did I call first?

94
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,065
What's this? Is it acceptable

95
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,276
for a strange man to know your code

96
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,944
and come in as he pleases?

97
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,863
A strange man?

98
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,031
He's not a man.

99
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,783
He's like a brother.

100
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,745
If he's "like" a brother,
it means he isn't your brother.

101
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,998
I guess you let just anyone come.

102
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,669
Where Mr. Han has no women
anywhere in his vicinity.

103
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,339
No wonder.

104
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,467
No wonder your place is never clean.

105
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,469
Look at all that dust.

106
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:54,474
I go to Mr. Han's apartment all the time,
but it's spotless.

107
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,434
Mr. No.

108
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,187
I'm about to get very offended right now.

109
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,730
What are you getting at?

110
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:04,275
You're not trying to say
he's too good for me, are you?

111
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,612
My gosh.

112
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,072
He's agreeing by remaining silent.

113
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,741
How could you?

114
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,701
We've grown so close.

115
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,661
Being close is one thing.

116
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,039
Thinking he's too good for you is another.

117
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,791
I'm a prosecutor. I'm a professional.

118
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,793
What's so great about that?

119
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,879
I was a prosecutor too.

120
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,757
Three out of four here are prosecutors.

121
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,011
I have some stuff
to work out with Yu-jun today,

122
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,679
so please leave us.

123
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,806
I'll come over once I'm done.

124
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,770
What are you working out at this hour?

125
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,190
Let's do as she says.

126
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,108
Come on.

127
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,446
-At this late hour?
-Come on.

128
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,585
I think she wants to talk about me.

129
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,128
It'll be okay, right?

130
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,549
I'll drive Yeon-ju over,
so you can go home.

131
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,680
-What?
-Don't be stupid and get jealous.

132
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,306
Just be good to her.

133
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,267
I'll do the nagging.

134
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,270
Keep that look in your eyes.

135
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:26,691
Don't get lax
just because time passes, okay?

136
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,527
Imagine how hard it must be.

137
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,905
She has to play two characters,
get revenge, and date.

138
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,283
People are attacking from all sides.

139
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,494
Be good to her.

140
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,009
I don't know if it's safe for us
to be together like this.

141
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,387
What if someone barges in like last time?

142
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,640
Even if they do, you may yell at them now.

143
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,602
Is that right?

144
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,438
To be honest,

145
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,232
when I heard that Yumin shares
were going to Chairman Han,

146
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,734
I wondered if that was right.

147
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,445
But I signed the papers
because I have faith in you.

148
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,572
But what happened?

149
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,782
That was unexpected. The hotel.

150
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,285
Sung-woon?

151
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,580
Our father said
we can't let him waste his life forever

152
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,498
and to teach him the business.

153
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,751
-That's it, right?
-Of course.

154
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:32,381
That's why I want to set things straight
considering the position he's in,

155
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,842
but weird rumors keep circulating.

156
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,510
That is why I need your help.

157
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,846
With what?

158
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,684
There are rumors spreading
that Mi-na is an imposter.

159
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,020
That's a little too serious.

160
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:51,317
So I'd like to get a DNA test done.

VOLUNTEER EVENT FOR ANIMAL SHELTER

162
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,170
Gosh. Congratulations, Chief Prosecutor.

163
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:15,049
I can kiss drinking in public goodbye.

164
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,176
I have to be cautious. You know that.

165
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,719
I know.

166
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,805
I'll serve your junior prosecutors well.

167
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,435
May I call the prosecutor I met that day?

168
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,104
What? Who?

169
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,357
The female prosecutor that I met
while I was serving time.

170
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,777
She looked like we would get along.
She seemed to like designer goods.

171
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,197
-Who? Do you mean Cho?
-Yes.

172
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,826
When I saw her briefly on the outside,
I almost made a mistake.

173
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,204
I'd like to meet her and apologize.

174
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,330
Hold on.

175
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,249
Where did you see her?

176
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,085
At a designer mall.
She was decked out in designer goods.

177
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,505
When was that?

178
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,550
The day we played Japan in football.

00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,148
Don't get me started.

181
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,608
My plan was to go fishing
on an island and take it easy.

182
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,611
But I ended up falling into the sea
and was bedridden for days.

183
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,447
I lost everything including my phone.

184
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,074
And there was no reception
on that entire island.

185
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,451
That's why I couldn't call you.

186
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,705
She fell into the sea while on vacation,

187
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,458
but she was at a designer mall?

188
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,464
Pull out soon.
More people in the Prosecutors' Office

189
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,132
will catch on.

190
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,884
I plan to.

191
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,929
I'm going to move out as soon as I find
Chief's connection to Hanju.

192
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:47,266
They silenced everyone
in the detention center.

193
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,560
It's impossible to find out what happened.

194
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,230
According to my mole in the Samgeori Gang,

195
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,400
Lee Bong-sik wasn't close enough to anyone
to give them the list.

196
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,863
He was an infamous gambler,
so everyone cut ties with him.

197
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,745
I came to talk about that today.

198
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,916
I guess I shouldn't just come in
even if I have business to discuss.

199
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,003
But, Yeon-ju.

200
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,547
It wasn't like

201
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,967
you and Seung-wook did stuff
because you were drunk, right?

202
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:26,222
You know I hate people who do things
just because they are drunk.

203
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,808
That's the excuse
murderers and rapists give.

204
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,685
I see.

205
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,687
It's just so sudden, that's why.

206
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:39,485
Then… Is everything resolved
regarding your respective fathers?

207
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,320
Yu-jun.

208
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,114
I like Seung-wook.

209
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,661
As you noted, things are very complicated

210
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,913
and nothing has been resolved.

211
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,207
We'll have to do that one by one.

212
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,879
My bad. I overreacted.

213
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,549
Although that's my pet peeve.

214
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,594
Okay. Let's not call
for personal reasons anymore.

215
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,847
-Bye.
-Bye.

216
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:16,605
Did you put away the gold toad
and watches used for bribery

217
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,482
that I brought last time?

218
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,359
-No.
-See?

219
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,194
They are in your dressing room.

220
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,823
You wouldn't have opened it for a year
if I hadn't told you.

221
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,242
-Put it somewhere safe.
-Okay, I will.

222
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,037
Okay, then. Bye.

223
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,462
Also, don't fall behind
on maintenance payments.

224
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,840
They'll cut you off
if you're late three months.

225
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,551
Or do you want to set up
automatic payments?

226
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,846
You never paid before I nagged you
after seeing the warning notices.

227
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,558
The condensation by the balcony
needs to be addressed before winter.

228
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,185
-The hard water stains in the toilet--
-Yu-jun.

229
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,898
Go home. Stop going overboard.

230
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,276
Okay, I will.

231
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,652
I won't go overboard.

232
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,996
-Bye.
-Later.

233
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,459
I haven't located Ms. Kang Mi-na yet.

234
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,420
However, it looks like someone else

235
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,797
is also searching for her now.

236
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:28,260
Not Yumin Group, but someone else?

237
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,803
Also, I heard something strange

238
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,680
when I went because of the flash drive.

239
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,859
So many boats will take people
just on a personal basis,

240
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,445
so it's easy
to sneak people out of the country.

241
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,739
Hey. Look into it.

242
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,992
-Focus on dealers that arrange boat rides.
-Yes, Boss.

243
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,954
She's pretty.

244
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,330
This woman.

245
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,707
What?

246
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,751
Isn't that her? Your wrist.

247
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,424
You're right.

248
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,386
What do you mean?

249
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,013
They say Ms. Kang Mi-na

250
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,015
fights very well.

251
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,186
What stupidity is that?

252
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,229
Where are you now?

253
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,690
They said she looked
like a woman they knew,

254
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,109
so I came to the address they gave me.

255
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,569
Get back here now.

256
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,947
How dare you take off
without even telling me?

257
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,866
You should've sent someone
to fill in for you if you were going

258
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,159
to be gone for this long.

259
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,829
Yes, ma'am. My apologies.

260
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,891
TAMNA FISH MARKET

261
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,019
You said you had to stop by somewhere.

262
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,396
-This was it?
-Yes, why?

263
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,732
Then I shouldn't go in empty-handed.

264
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,483
You go ahead.

265
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,572
-Over here!
-Can we order?

266
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,449
-Yes. Just a moment, please.
-Can we get another serving?

267
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,701
-Sure! Hey, another serving.
-Got it.

268
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,244
Okay, at 10 p.m.

269
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,662
-Uncle!
-A table for four, got it.

270
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,705
-Uncle.
-All right, thank you.

271
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,541
-What would you like?
-Uncle!

272
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,585
What? Hey, when did you get here?

273
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:28,088
-Clearly, he didn't hear me at all.
-I can wrap up soon, so wait just a bit.

274
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,466
It's 38,000 won. The soup is on the house.

275
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,968
There are so many customers.

276
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,346
Good for you
that your business is doing so well.

277
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:44,229
So you're not her real uncles?

278
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,608
What? Did you lie to him that you were?

279
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,568
I swear.

280
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,989
I never actually said
that we were your real uncles.

281
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,701
-Hey, am I wrong?
-No, you're right.

282
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,369
Come on. He obviously bought those,

283
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,121
-thinking you were my real uncles.
-No.

284
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,039
Right.

285
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,749
Try this.

286
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,793
You have to use knives all the time here,

287
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,377
-My goodness.
-so your wrists must hurt.

288
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,131
Gosh, you two are such pigs.

289
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,676
By the way, what were you saying earlier?

290
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,595
About Lee Bong-sik.

291
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,973
We believe that Samgeori Gang
had something to do with his death.

292
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,185
So I'm here to ask you
to do some fieldwork for me.

293
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,979
Hey, now that you've regained your memory,

294
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,649
did you forget everything you did
when you had amnesia?

295
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,234
Is that how it works?

296
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,612
Hey, don't you remember
Samgeori Gang totally knocking us out?

297
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,240
They didn't knock me out.

298
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,742
And I'm not asking you
to go fight with them.

299
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:43,413
You see, Lee Bong-sik returned to Korea
because he blew all his money on gambling.

300
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,834
Even after he returned,
he practically lived at gambling dens.

301
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:50,712
And you know gamblers very well.

302
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,465
Hey! That's all in the past.

303
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,551
We quit long ago.

304
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,719
Right, thank goodness you quit.

305
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,096
Think about it.

306
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,973
Your chances of winning are so slim.

307
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,267
-How could you bet all your money--
-Hey!

308
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,895
Every gambler knows
that the chances are slim.

309
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,605
You see, when you gamble,

310
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,067
you bet on hope.

311
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,988
Okay. Keep that word, "hope",
etched on your heart

312
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:19,116
and continue to help me
dig into the Lee Bong-sik case.

313
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,951
But as you can see,

314
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,037
our business is doing very well now.

315
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:28,041
If we have to tail someone 24-7--

316
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,627
Right. I will compensate you

317
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,712
for your loss.

318
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,214
-You'll compensate us?
-Yes.

319
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,467
Look at you bluffing again
as if you're rich or something.

320
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,178
Just worry about your rent.

321
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,182
Why did you say that?

322
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,333
Honey.

323
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,460
Seok-ho.

324
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,589
My gosh.

325
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,426
Doctor!

326
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,685
So your uncles
have been helping you in that manner.

327
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,771
Chasing Lee Bong-sik with you.

328
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:34,524
I ran into them at the hospital by chance
the day my grandmother passed away.

329
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,570
They said the gang had disbanded,
and the members went their separate ways.

330
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:42,324
They came to the emergency room
and recognized me and my grandmother.

331
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,953
But last time,

332
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,121
-they told me that your father--
-Hey.

333
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,626
I understand that you keep bringing him up

334
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,753
because he was deeply involved
in your father's death,

335
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,464
but the Kang Myung-guk I know

336
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,758
is certainly capable
of setting a fire out of rage,

337
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,802
and he only cares about himself.

338
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,804
Most importantly,

339
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,430
he has nothing to do with me.

340
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,519
All right.

341
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,190
Are you disappointed
because I'm so ruthless?

342
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,904
"I can't let myself get emotional."

343
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,740
"I can't be sad. I must always be
cool-headed and objective."

344
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,076
You trained yourself to be like this.

345
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,084
Like I said, when you're in love,

346
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,877
you're not disappointed easily.

347
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,256
Love? Come on.

348
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:48,557
I feel bad that
you have to go back to this house.

349
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,602
A while back, I told you

350
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,563
that I was used to crises like this.

351
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:59,026
Now that I've regained my memory,
I know that it really is true.

352
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,069
This is nothing.

353
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,198
Bye.

354
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:27,137
Thank you for persuading them
to cancel the summons.

355
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,514
I didn't think it could be done
with some shares.

356
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,017
Well…

357
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,270
The point is, whose shares?

358
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:38,857
Lee Bong-sik got caught with a list
that could harm Hanju's reputation,

359
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,859
and when the list
was about to be revealed,

360
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,903
Lee Bong-sik suddenly died.

361
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:46,323
And rumor has it
that Kang Mi-na's name is on the list.

362
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,366
It's all over now.

363
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,911
Why must you keep bringing it up?
What are you trying to say?

364
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,829
Father, you must have

365
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,332
some serious connections
in the prosecution.

366
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,585
I was working on it too
through a prosecutor I know,

367
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,755
but it was very hard
to get the other prosecutors on board.

368
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,218
We see prosecutors getting involved
in conglomerates' family feuds

369
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,385
all the time,

370
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:12,432
but do they think
prosecutors are some errand boys?

371
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:19,356
Anyhow, thanks to the merger,
you and I are in the same boat now.

372
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,734
Isn't it a waste of time
to manage the prosecutors separately?

373
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,113
Let's share our connections

374
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,364
in the prosecution.

375
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,203
The prosecutors these days
are very arrogant.

376
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,913
It's time we shook things up.

377
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:38,208
That's right!
Prosecutors are awfully arrogant.

378
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,836
When they have a meeting,
not a single one of them

379
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,755
puts the chair back
when the meeting is over.

380
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,175
It sounds like
you know a lot about prosecutors.

381
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,261
I know them very well.

382
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,039
Weird rumors keep circulating.

383
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,169
There are rumors spreading
that Mi-na is an imposter.

384
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,882
So I'd like to get a DNA test done.

385
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,479
What are you doing here?

386
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,825
We got rid of the housekeepers
after your accident,

387
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,328
so the house is untidy.

388
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,913
I'm just checking if this room is clean.

389
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,915
Do you expect me to believe that?

390
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,000
Why are you so prickly to me?

391
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,002
It goes both ways.

392
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,713
What are you two doing here?

393
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,092
She came into my room when I wasn't here.

394
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,304
-Why are you here?
-What's with you both?

395
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,515
Is there something in this room
that I shouldn't see?

396
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,560
If you need to talk to her,
talk to me directly instead.

397
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,438
Try not to converse with Sung-hye.

398
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,109
Every man in this family
seems to be in love with you.

399
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,696
-Sorry?
-When I asked you about Seung-wook,

400
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,407
you talked as though
you would never see him again.

401
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,327
But he gave up his shares to help you out,

402
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,872
and you have Sung-woon
wrapped around your little finger.

403
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,834
They are at your beck and call.
How did you make it happen?

404
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,003
You were not like this before.

405
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,422
-Sung-hye.
-You're right.

406
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,092
In the past,
I was just a chairman's daughter like you.

407
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,302
But now, I am the chairman.

408
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,720
That is my secret.

409
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:02,310
Those who are truly mature
can keep their emotions in check.

410
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,437
But these days,

411
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:07,315
people blurt out whatever they want to say
and bluff about it.

412
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,150
It's a crude trend, I must say.

413
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,623
Did your sister just say I was vulgar?

414
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,834
Gosh.

415
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,586
Seriously.

416
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,505
Wasn't my timing perfect?

417
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,758
Where have you been, by the way?

418
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,678
I came straight home after the ceremony
and waited for you.

419
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,431
Since when are you so interested
in where I've been?

420
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,516
You really have no interest in me, do you?

421
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,019
I've been interested in that
for a while now.

422
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,980
Don't be like that, honey.

423
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,316
I've dated many married women,

424
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:52,277
and not many of them
stay in their marriages because of love.

425
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,738
You seem to understand women so well.

426
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,283
Don't look down on me so much.

427
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,745
You and I are in the same boat now.

428
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,831
It's true that I became
the co-CEO thanks to you,

429
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:08,626
but you also have to stay with me
to keep both Yumin and Hanju.

430
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,172
-What?
-Did you see Seung-wook again?

431
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:14,841
It's fine.

432
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,552
No matter what you do

433
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,305
and who you are,

434
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,099
I'm never going to divorce you.

435
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,561
What do you mean by that?

436
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,234
I know

437
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,445
you're not Kang Mi-na.

438
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,785
What? Did you think

439
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:45,372
I protected you from So-yi and my sister

440
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:48,375
because I believed you were Kang Mi-na?

441
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,552
Knowing your real name and age
is enough for me.

442
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,889
I didn't want to know more than that
about the real Mi-na anyway.

443
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,517
I don't care who you are.

444
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,602
Who you are right now
is good enough for me.

445
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,272
You don't care who I am?

446
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,441
Why do you and your siblings
keep saying that?

447
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,693
Are you saying

448
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,113
I have to keep pretending to be Mi-na

449
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,989
for you to keep your position?

450
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,157
Exactly.

451
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:24,536
But what if I, who isn't Kang Mi-na,

452
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,454
don't need my position?

453
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,584
As soon as I reveal
that I'm not Kang Mi-na,

454
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,962
you'll lose your position
right away, right?

455
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,133
So the person who needs me
in this position the most

456
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,385
isn't me, but you.

457
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,638
And you wouldn't want anything
to happen to me

458
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,475
because you're not capable
of protecting your wife's inheritance.

459
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,601
So from now on,

460
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,062
keep your mouth shut and protect me

461
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,107
not for my sake, but for your own good,

462
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,734
if you want to keep your position.

463
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,668
Gosh, that was nerve-racking.

464
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,755
I really need to get out
of this house soon.

465
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,841
The anxiety is eating away at me.

466
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:28,099
Didn't you say
he wasn't likely to wake up?

467
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,225
I'm sorry, ma'am.

468
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,480
Why didn't you take care of it sooner?

469
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,524
Get to it.

470
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,509
HANJU HOSPITAL

471
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:07,514
How could they call you
as soon as he woke up?

472
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,098
The last time I was here,

473
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,435
I figured that his treatment
must be costly.

474
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,730
So I've been helping them financially
through Yumin.

475
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,733
And I asked them to call me
as soon as something happens.

476
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,693
I can't believe Han Sung-hye, that woman.

477
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:23,238
While she was bragging
about the money she gave them,

478
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,323
you were the one
who was really helping them.

479
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,326
That's very kind of you.

480
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,371
It's no big deal.

481
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,705
Then again,

482
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,041
it might not be a big deal
for rich people.

483
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,626
Let's go.

484
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:40,129
The thing is,
I've been here since last night.

485
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,215
I even watched the doctors
examine the patient.

486
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,676
And when they said he could have
a conversation, I called you.

487
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,761
I was here all night.

488
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,847
Oh, no. You must be tired.

489
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,444
Do you remember me?

490
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,780
You ran me over with your car.

491
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,115
Ma'am.

492
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,285
What happened?

493
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,788
Why did you do that
when I was just standing there?

494
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:18,835
-I don't remember well.
-I've been there.

495
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,504
Don't think you can
smooth things over using your amnesia.

496
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:25,592
Your call history shows
that you called someone at Hanju.

497
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,431
I was struggling financially,

498
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,225
so I was calling around

499
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,312
to ask all the people
I used to know for help.

500
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,481
Luckily, someone at Hanju agreed
to lend me money

501
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,567
and called me to Hanju Hotel.

502
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,654
But when I was leaving the garage
to meet that person,

503
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,616
I went into a seizure.

504
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,952
How did you know that person?

505
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:56,205
We met when I worked
at Hanju factory long ago.

506
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,334
Hanju is behind everything that happened.

507
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,003
Ma'am, please forgive him.

508
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:06,257
When he was working there,
someone set fire to the factory.

509
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:10,178
After that accident,
his epilepsy got worse.

510
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:13,514
If he doesn't take his medicine,
he goes into a seizure anytime.

511
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,156
He's lying.

512
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:38,247
If he came from over there
and crashed into this spot,

513
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,792
he would've had to have turned the wheel
somewhere over there.

514
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,044
Someone with epilepsy

515
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,131
who supposedly drove straight unconscious
turned the wheel?

516
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:51,427
I think so too. He's definitely lying.

517
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,096
Why does he have to say

518
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:56,641
his condition got worse
after the factory fire?

519
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,435
It makes me feel bad.

520
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,405
This is strange.
Yu-jun usually never misses my calls.

521
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,698
No way.

522
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,826
Is he not picking up
thinking it's a personal call?

523
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,121
I was just going to ask
for the case files for the fire.

524
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,456
Gosh, unbelievable.

525
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,917
He didn't have to make
the boundary so clear.

526
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,302
Yu-jun and I go back a long way.

527
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,889
Every time something happens,
I automatically call him.

528
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,392
Okay. That's understandable.

529
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,520
But since we first met at the hospital,

530
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:46,649
haven't we known each other longer?

531
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,985
What?

532
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,987
Are you being jealous?

533
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,198
You don't have to worry about Yu-jun.

534
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,616
I know him well.

535
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,453
You saw how he didn't even pick up.
He's like that.

536
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,495
All right.

537
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,997
My goodness, you're jealous.

538
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,755
Mr. An?

539
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,549
-Mr. An!
-Yes?

540
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,886
Your phone.

541
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,446
I'm leaving early.

542
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,239
See you.

543
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:42,371
He only just got here. What's with him?

544
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:59,013
Hello, this is Jang Seok-ho.

545
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,767
I'd like to speak to Mr. Jung Do-woo.

546
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,899
What are we all doing here
so early in the morning?

547
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:13,194
At a time like this,
it's best to stay out as much as you can.

548
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:17,281
If you run into one of those three at home
and make a slip of the tongue,

549
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,785
it can turn the tables
and things can get awkward.

550
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,745
I'm still on Sung-hye's side.

551
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,248
I'll pretend she's a stock I bought.

552
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:28,584
The price has gone down a bit,
but I'm sure it'll rise back up.

553
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:31,838
Sung-mi.

554
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:35,591
When it comes to stocks,
selling at the right time is key.

555
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,427
I'm going to stay on Mi-na's side.

556
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,223
Don't you think
it's time for you to sell that stock?

557
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,517
I know you trust Mi-na,

558
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,019
but she's in the same boat
with Sung-woon now.

559
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,939
How could you talk that way
about your own brother?

560
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,732
Aren't you even worried about him?

561
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:56,696
I'd never worry about him
unless he's dying.

562
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,283
What about you, Mother?

563
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,578
What do you think will happen
to Sung-woon and Mi-na?

564
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,205
Sung-woon,
who always messes everything up,

565
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,667
and Mi-na, who can save every situation,
are on the same side?

566
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,337
It's impossible to predict.

567
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,966
So whose side are you on, Mother?

568
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:22,805
I wouldn't have to worry about this
if Sun-woo's dad were alive.

569
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:36,694
They got a famous designer
from Europe or somewhere to make this.

570
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,529
It really is nice.

571
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,198
Yes, isn't it?

572
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,034
Everything looks like artwork.

573
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,787
I hear everyone's
praising Mi-na like crazy

574
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,374
for her great eye
in choosing that designer.

575
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,840
I have only two daughters-in-law,

576
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:02,136
and one is annoying,
and the other is irritating.

577
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:10,770
You know Mom gets angry
if you mention him.

578
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,313
Ever since he died,

579
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,608
it doesn't matter to you
who takes over the company.

580
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,571
His death anniversary is coming up
but no one cares.

581
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,115
You're all so mean, that's why.

582
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,411
Anyway,

583
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,164
between being annoying and irritating,

584
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,416
isn't it better to be annoying?

585
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:40,841
Ma'am, she will serve you from now on
whenever I'm not around.

586
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,762
-I'm Kim Eun-jung.
-HR recommended her.

587
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:48,224
They reviewed her experiences and skills
including hotel work experience--

588
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,850
I don't need her personal details.

589
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,395
Did you notify Mr. Han Sung-woon
of the meeting this morning?

590
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:53,646
Yes. Yesterday.

591
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,109
Then why is he not here yet?

592
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,449
Serve her well.

593
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,626
The person you have reached…

594
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,877
He won't even pick up.

595
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,508
You're not a CEO
just because you give a speech.

596
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:26,762
Perhaps he's golfing as usual.

597
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,431
I'll find out.

598
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,811
-Gosh.
-What's taking so long?

599
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,272
Should we just begin?

600
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:42,194
We can't do that.
It's our first meeting as co-CEOs.

601
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,196
Let's give him a few more minutes.

602
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,001
Chief?

603
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,173
-Did you do it right?
-Yes, sir.

604
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,052
But this seems like surveillance.

605
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,683
My man.

606
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,854
If I'm monitoring Yeon-ju's daily life
and investigating her personal life…

607
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,647
Yes, it's surveillance.

608
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,942
But even you can see
something isn't right with her.

609
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,527
Is something wrong or not?

610
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,946
-Yes or no?
-Yes. But--

611
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,115
That's why, as her supervisor,

612
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,951
I want to report hourly
on her comings and goings during the day.

613
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,078
Is that so wrong?

614
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,497
No.

615
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,256
Darn it. Can't you write any bigger?

616
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,426
CHO YEON-JU

617
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,720
Why did she go in and out so much?

618
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:59,063
CHO YEON-JU

619
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,531
Two identical faces.

620
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,160
They've never appeared
in two different places.

621
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,371
CHAIRMAN KANG MI-NA'S SCHEDULE

622
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:16,747
CHO YEON-JU

623
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,707
Not even once.

624
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,754
Do you know who I am?

625
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,424
Do you know who I really am?

626
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,427
But who did she say she was?

627
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,554
Chairman Kang Mi-na of Hanju Group?

628
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,098
Why is she Chairman Kang Mi-na?

629
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,853
I thought she was talking nonsense
because she was drunk.

630
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:46,152
Should I tell you why the two of you

631
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:47,903
can't get Chairman Kang Mi-na?

632
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,114
It's because you…

633
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,951
received a car from Hanju.

634
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,876
Are you the only prosecutor here?

635
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,586
I'm also a prosecutor.

636
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,756
I, Ryu Seung-duk, was called a hound dog

637
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,301
when I was an entry-level prosecutor.

638
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,889
I'm positive they are one and the same.

639
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,852
But who's playing both characters?

640
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,440
Kang Mi-na or Cho Yeon-ju?

641
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,987
Gosh. Madam Prosecutor. To be honest,

642
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:34,200
all I did was steal a measly 170,000 won.

643
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,784
That's all.

644
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,704
Isn't it excessive to make me come
to the Prosecutors' Office?

645
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,165
A measly 170,000 won?

646
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:44,668
Hey, you. Is 170,000 won not money?

647
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,378
Darn it.

648
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,839
This stupid company.

649
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,092
-Sorry, but I need to take this.
-Sure. Go ahead.

650
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:54,595
Hello?

651
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,848
I didn't get to give it to you
this morning because I had to rush.

652
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,600
Go ahead.

653
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,061
Listen.

654
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,564
How could we be satisfied
with only 1.7 billion in annual sales?

655
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,775
Do you know
how much money went into it already?

656
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,276
Invest five billion won again.

657
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,906
How can you run a business if you're
timid about five billion? It's 5, not 15.

658
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,491
Just do it.

659
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:20,996
Anyway, so many people struggle
because they don't have 1.7 billion…

660
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,039
No. 17 billion…

661
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:28,379
No. 170,000 won is a lot of money.

662
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:29,964
What?

663
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,465
What are you talking about?

664
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:32,967
Me?

665
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,971
Anyway, you show no remorse,
so let's stop here for today.

666
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,223
Go on.

667
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,601
That's it?

668
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,855
-Mr. Park.
-Yes?

669
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,149
How many minor theft cases
for 1.7 billion--

670
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,903
I mean, for 170,000 won, is this already?

671
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,114
What's wrong with the case distributions?

672
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,575
Do I need to cause a scene?

673
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,369
I thought they were delivered
to the wrong office at first.

674
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,162
But

675
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,831
to be honest,

676
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,749
you leave your desk several times a day.

677
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,459
You know you're acting different.

678
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,713
That's why you're being punished
from way up above

679
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:15,259
and being assigned cases like this.

680
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,011
That's what we think, at least.

681
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:21,974
Connecting calls and making things up
when people ask for you while you're out

682
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,517
is quite difficult.

683
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,269
Up above?

684
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:30,107
You're telling me
to take it up with Chief myself, right?

685
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,400
Fine!

686
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,821
That wasn't it Ms. Cho!

687
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:39,700
That wasn't what we meant.
We meant to stop stepping away so much.

688
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,411
She only hears what she wants.

689
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,164
Chief!

690
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:48,125
Darn it. Don't you know how to knock?

691
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,418
How could you do this?

692
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:52,379
I hear you're the one
assigning me petty crimes.

693
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,715
I'm not a newbie.
Why am I getting those cases?

694
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:58,802
Hold on. I have a frozen shoulder.
I can't lower it.

695
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,429
The doctor said to avoid stress.

696
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,848
What? Assigning what?

697
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:07,311
Did you do it right
when I gave you a big case?

698
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,979
I took everything else off of your docket

699
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,898
and said to summon Kang Mi-na,
did you listen?

700
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,316
Come sit here. Let's talk.

701
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:14,318
I'm not going to sit! I can't.

702
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,070
Let's talk!

703
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,698
Must I tell you
about my embarrassing illnesses?

704
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,701
That's right! I have hemorrhoids!

705
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,828
The doctor said not to sit.

706
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,420
Darn it. You do as you please
with an important case.

707
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,922
You won't do petty crimes.

708
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,591
Is this place a vending machine
from which you can choose

709
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,677
which cases you want?

710
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,263
You should be reprimanded
for what happened to Lee Bong-sik.

711
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,516
You should be grateful I gave you work.

712
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,726
How dare you barge
into the chief prosecutor's office

713
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,396
and order me to sit?
Some with hemorrhoids, at that.

714
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:53,565
Do you want to be suspended?

715
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:56,151
No. I can't investigate then.

716
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,612
-Get out.
-Fine.

717
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:08,789
My arm is so sore.

718
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,380
Hallelujah!

719
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,028
Why is she so obsessed with Lee Bong-sik?

720
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:44,116
Gosh, that temper…

721
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:47,244
I'm 100 percent sure
that she is Cho Yeon-ju. Yes!

722
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:49,496
There's no way Kang Mi-na
can imitate that nasty temper.

723
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:52,958
I'm sure of it.

724
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,669
Cho Yeon-ju is playing
both characters now.

725
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:06,054
Then where is Kang Mi-na?

726
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,101
Hey, it's me.

727
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,396
We should have
Ms. Cho's identity assurance statement

728
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,315
from the time she was appointed.

729
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,441
Can you send it up?

730
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:29,369
Isn't he a devoted Buddhist?

731
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,413
What's with the "Hallelujah"?

732
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,958
And why is he so angry with me?

733
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,711
He wants to do whatever it takes
to pressure me.

734
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:42,591
I'm like the epitome of Hammurabi's Code.

735
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,968
An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth!

736
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,470
I should start pressuring

737
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,306
the chief prosecutor too,

738
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,350
but what are my uncles up to?

739
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,104
What's up?

740
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,482
What?

741
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:01,985
I've been staking out the gambling joint
Lee Bong-sik used to frequent.

742
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:09,743
Let me join you guys.

743
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,620
You're a new face.

744
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,331
I lived abroad for years.
It's my first time here.

745
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:36,645
Cheer up.

746
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:41,108
In the beginning, I let them win.
Then I won here and there.

747
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,527
Then naturally,
I met people who knew Lee Bong-sik.

748
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:47,656
I let them win a few times,
so we chatted after the games.

749
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:50,284
Apparently,
Lee Bong-sik bluffed like crazy

750
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:53,328
about pawning something big
at the pawnshop across the street.

751
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,872
He said it was way better

752
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,125
than all the profitable crypto coins
in the market now,

753
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,042
gloating over it.

754
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,464
You're playing cards there now? How?

755
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,967
When we were at Seoul Central,

756
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,428
our entire team went to
a gambling den. Remember?

757
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:12,723
You guys made me go in there as bait
because I was the youngest.

758
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,141
You taught me how to do this.

759
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,729
But you should hurry.

760
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:22,941
Looks like someone in Samgeori Gang
is also after this flash drive.

761
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,321
So you've been there this whole time?
Is that why I couldn't reach you?

762
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,698
Don't overreact. It's no biggie.

763
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,783
I had to do some legwork anyway.

764
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:32,701
I have to go.

765
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:38,040
Says the guy who totally went overboard.

766
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,087
It's me, Uncle.

767
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,423
Go to the pawnshop
in front of the gambling joint.

768
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:48,175
I think the flash drive is there.

769
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,469
I'll be there shortly too. Okay.

770
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:28,298
Darn it. How will we tell her
that someone's already took it?

771
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,592
She said it was connected
to the Samgeori Gang.

772
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,594
Could it have been one of their boys?

773
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:35,055
In any case, you should call her.

774
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,557
Why do you always make me do these things?

775
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,934
For goodness' sake.

776
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,728
Wait.

777
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,898
That man. Didn't we see him
at the gambling joint last night?

778
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,942
Is he one of the Samgeori boys?

779
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:50,278
It'll be a two-on-one fight.

780
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,697
What do you say?

781
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:56,159
We cannot give away
Yeon-ju's name or what she does.

782
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,411
Of course, we won't.

783
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,012
Mr. Jang Seok-ho.

784
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,976
Is he getting an injection?

785
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:47,252
My, look who's here.

786
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:49,296
It's been a while, missy.

787
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,549
Apparently,
Lee Bong-sik bluffed like crazy

788
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:55,343
about pawning something big
at the pawnshop across the street.

789
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:58,096
He said it was way better
than all the profitable crypto coins.

790
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,599
"Better than all
the profitable crypto coins?"

791
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:07,773
Hey!

792
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,032
Goodness, you startled me.

793
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:19,785
Who told you to collect that flash drive?

794
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:21,328
What?

795
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,872
Hey, bird head. Have you lost your mind?

796
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,124
Who are you? Take that off, will you?

797
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,422
Darn it!

798
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:34,966
Hey!

799
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,013
Yes, what is it?

800
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:41,848
Did you take the flash drive?

801
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,684
Who are you guys?

802
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,983
Look at those long limbs.
He won't be an easy one to beat.

803
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,235
A prosecutor

804
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,695
at the Central District Office sent us.

805
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,366
A prosecutor
at the Central District Office?

806
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,995
That's right. Prosecutor C…

807
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:11,211
I'm Prosecutor An from the Seopyung.
Who sent you?

808
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,463
Cho…

809
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,605
Mom, can a chicken fly?

810
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,566
No, chickens can't fly.

811
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,076
Darn it!

812
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,549
Who are you? Take this off.

813
00:52:58,508 --> 00:52:59,676
Take it off!

814
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,766
It hurts. Let go!

815
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,686
No, my arm!

816
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,855
My arm! You little…

817
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:31,416
Darn it.

818
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,579
That's okay. What can you do?

819
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,457
I'll look into how
Samgeori Gang is connected.

820
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,877
So? Where are you going now?

821
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,338
They took the flash drive.

822
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,966
But Seung-wook found something else too,
so I'm on my way there.

823
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:22,175
Let's talk later.

824
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:24,219
Be careful. Bye.

825
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:31,851
So you passed the bar exam
in the same year as Yeon-ju?

826
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,811
Yes.

827
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:37,190
This is just a case
Yeon-ju is pursuing personally.

828
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:39,109
And it's extremely dangerous too.

829
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,946
Are you really just helping her
as a colleague?

830
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:45,991
What's going on between you two?

831
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:48,743
We're just friends.

832
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,080
Just friends?

833
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:56,501
Why would you ask
such an unimportant question?

834
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:58,294
What? What's important then?

835
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,840
The destination in Seopyung
that you just typed in

836
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:06,469
doesn't seem to be an official residence,
but an expensive apartment.

837
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,347
Do you own it?

838
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,516
My mother does.

839
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,353
Your mother?

840
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:20,608
-By the way…
-What is it?

841
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:23,111
I stayed up all night last night.
Is it okay if I take a nap?

842
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,071
Sure.

843
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:34,039
Isn't this guy a bit better?

844
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,332
I mean, than the guy who rents.

845
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,377
His family seems wealthy.

846
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,296
He has a nice job and is younger.

847
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:43,465
His background isn't important.

848
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:45,133
Then?

849
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,260
What's important is how Yeon-ju feels.

850
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,766
You idiot. Drive carefully.

851
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,100
Goodness.

852
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:57,562
We don't want to wake up Prosecutor An.

853
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:07,322
Hanju Hospital refused to give any help.
No CCTV footage, nothing.

854
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:10,492
The police said it'd be nearly impossible
to catch the culprit.

855
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:13,661
Luckily, Mr. Jang took the syringe.

856
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,205
What was in it?

857
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:16,956
A lethal dose of thallium.

858
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,335
It's a toxic element.

859
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,962
When injected with a lethal dose,
the person remains healthy

860
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,590
for a couple of weeks,
only to die a seemingly sudden death.

861
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,807
What you said was right.

862
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:37,018
You persuaded me
to go into hiding from the beginning.

863
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:38,686
I was an idiot.

864
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,438
I'm sorry.

865
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,858
I'm relieved that you're safe.

866
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,485
But what happened?

867
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,071
The person came to me

868
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:50,240
and gave me a task, promising a reward.

869
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,368
I was pressured for money,

870
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:55,995
so every penny counted.

871
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:02,043
I was told that you were going to appear
at the hotel that day.

872
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:08,007
I was supposed to wait for the cue
and crash into your car.

873
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:12,428
But then

874
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,597
without any cue,

875
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,100
you showed up out of nowhere.

876
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,691
I didn't want to mess up,
so I started the car anyway.

877
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:32,365
But I got nervous and went into a seizure.

878
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,869
But why did that person
ask you to do such a thing?

879
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,079
How did you two know each other?

880
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:40,957
After the fire at Hanju factory,

881
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,835
I was paid by that person
to give a false statement.

882
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,629
What false statement?

883
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:49,632
That I saw someone start a fire.

884
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:55,180
Because I got paid then,
I trusted that person this time too.

885
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,390
What did you say?

886
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,144
I do feel bad.

887
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,229
That day…

888
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:07,275
Fire!

889
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,735
Evacuate!

890
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:13,156
He went around knocking on every door
to wake people up.

891
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,950
That's how all the workers could evacuate.

892
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:24,000
I inhaled some smoke on my way out,

893
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,086
and the trauma worsened my epilepsy.

894
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:30,882
But without him, I would've died.

895
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:33,927
The thing is,

896
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,179
I wasn't the only one who lied.

897
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:38,264
That man admitted starting a fire himself.

898
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,360
The other guys managed to retrieve this,

899
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,948
but you failed to take care
of the man in the hospital?

900
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,534
I'm sorry.

901
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,750
Considering your hard work so far,
I shouldn't be too harsh.

902
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:09,003
Are you tired lately?

903
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,550
Would you like to take some time off?

904
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:23,101
Do you know what bothers me the most?

905
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,521
I never even thought about asking my dad

906
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,898
if he really started the fire.

907
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:34,028
I just assumed he was someone
who would do such a thing.

908
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:41,369
So I only asked him why he did that.

909
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:48,918
But if what that man said is true,
why did my dad never tell the truth?

910
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,379
Even if he didn't tell me,

911
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:54,465
he could've told someone else
at least once out of frustration.

912
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,217
So why…

913
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:08,938
Go and ask him again about what happened.

914
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:15,570
Why do you still barge into my life
and mess up everything?

915
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:17,447
Why?

916
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:20,992
You'll never see me again.

917
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,998
I can't.

918
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,042
Not after being so harsh.

919
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:30,668
I even said

920
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,755
he was never going to see me again.

921
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:39,052
Still, he didn't say anything
mean to you, did he?

922
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:43,181
Like I once said,

923
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:47,185
when you're in love,
you're not disappointed easily.

924
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:49,937
Let's see where this goes.

925
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,260
What brings you all the way here?

926
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,722
I'm sorry about this morning.

927
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:27,016
The meeting was scheduled way too early.

928
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,310
I won't miss it tomorrow.

929
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:31,437
There's no meeting tomorrow morning.

930
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,648
Did you cancel it for me?

931
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:34,857
You didn't have to.

932
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:39,195
I didn't cancel it because of this game
you're playing, so don't worry.

933
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:42,907
You'll get arrested tonight for drug use.

934
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:44,909
That's why.

935
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:49,831
What are you talking about?

936
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:52,083
Do you remember the drug I gave you?

937
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,502
The one you take when you can't sleep.

938
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,337
That drug is quite funny.

939
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,631
If you get tested for drugs
after taking it,

940
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,425
the test result turns out positive.

941
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,265
What?

942
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:09,934
Did you think I was just sitting by?

943
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:12,353
Drugs are no big deal.

944
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:15,398
Among people like us,
is there anyone who doesn't use them?

945
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,650
Maybe not.

946
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,153
And no one would go to prison for it.

947
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:21,904
But you will.

948
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:24,532
Because after the drug,

949
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:29,245
I'll reveal all the trashy videos of you
that I took to start rumors about you.

950
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:32,665
No one in the company
is on your side either.

951
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,960
While you missed today's meeting
to play a game with me,

952
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:40,631
I improved the conditions
for all the executives dramatically.

953
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:43,885
Also,

954
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,513
do you remember this?

955
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:55,438
You think Sung-chan is the only one
who'd end up like that?

956
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,525
Do you think Father will be on your side?

957
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,197
What? Because of your wife?

958
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:09,619
Hey, we both know that your wife is fake.

959
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:46,364
What are you doing here?

960
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:57,792
I know

961
01:03:58,626 --> 01:03:59,877
you're not Kang Mi-na.

962
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,216
Knowing your real name and age

963
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,844
is enough for me.

964
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,806
I didn't want to know more than that
about the real Mi-na anyway.

965
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:13,266
I don't care who you are.

966
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:16,060
Who you are right now
is good enough for me.

967
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:18,396
Are you saying
I have to keep pretending to be Mi-na

968
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:20,731
for you to keep your position?

969
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:21,983
Exactly.

970
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:24,944
But what if I, who isn't Kang Mi-na,

971
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:26,654
don't need my position?

972
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:38,124
You were always quick-witted
ever since you were a kid.

973
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:39,166
I knew all along

974
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,294
that you were not really a loser.

975
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:42,420
That it was an act.

976
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:46,591
You just didn't want
to end up like Sung-chan.

977
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:51,888
What's wrong with you?

978
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:54,599
-What do you want me to do?
-What else?

979
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:57,435
You should gather people
and publicly share

980
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:59,687
your wife's DNA test result.

981
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:15,953
You should've hidden it well till the end.

982
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:19,749
I would've let you be
as long as you didn't hurt me.

983
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:25,796
Okay. You don't have a choice anymore.

984
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:27,798
Tell me

985
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,468
everything you know about Mi-na.

986
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:33,638
Who is she?

987
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:39,518
CIVIL AFFAIRS OFFICE

988
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:45,566
PRESERVING LAW AND ORDER

989
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,913
That day. The day of Grandma's accident…

990
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:02,792
Did you set the factory on fire?

991
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:08,005
Were you the one

992
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:10,424
who started the fire?

993
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:23,980
No.

994
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:29,944
I didn't do it.

995
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:35,825
You didn't?

996
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:39,745
Then why didn't you say so?

997
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:44,208
Because I didn't believe you?

998
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:48,421
Because everyone assumed it was you?

999
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:54,218
It wasn't your fault.

1000
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:57,388
I…

1001
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:05,646
took money in exchange for saying

1002
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,358
I started the fire.

1003
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:12,028
You were paid?

1004
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:15,448
By whom? Who paid you?

1005
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,745
I didn't know who he was.

1006
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,622
He came to see me at the police station.

1007
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:29,211
He said he worked for Hanju.

1008
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:32,506
You took money from Hanju?

1009
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:34,842
Why?

1010
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,307
Was the money

1011
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,601
that paid for my food and education

1012
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:46,771
from Hanju?

1013
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:23,933
EPILOGUE

1014
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:27,895
You finally agreed to visitations.

1015
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:30,481
Why do you keep annoying me?

1016
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:32,566
Why do you keep sending me letters?

1017
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,819
I have a lot of time to kill.

1018
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:36,987
Why did you want to meet so badly?

1019
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:38,239
What is it?

1020
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:42,618
I just want to come by now and then.

1021
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:44,912
I have a lot of time to kill.

1022
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,128
I came to share good news today.

1023
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:55,297
Forget it. I've read the Bible,
the Tipitaka, the Quran…

1024
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,842
I've read all the good news in here.

1025
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,094
SUPER DADDY

1026
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:06,976
Then she got angry and just left.

1027
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:09,520
Although I was doing this
as I was told because I hurt my arm.

1028
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:12,940
She has her mom's temper.

1029
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:15,901
-Really?
-Yes.

1030
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:18,779
All the women in our family
are tough like that.

1031
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:22,283
Both my mother and Yeon-ju's mom.

1032
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:28,038
She became a prosecutor
to catch her grandma's hit-and-run killer.

1033
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:30,875
The prosecutor who covered it up

1034
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,169
seems to be connected to Hanju,

1035
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:35,254
so she's still gathering evidence.

1036
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:40,217
Would Hanju just let her do that?

1037
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:43,762
She has been fighting back well thus far.

1038
01:09:45,389 --> 01:09:48,475
You keep coming to see me
because you want me to tell you

1039
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:50,269
what happened that day, right?

1040
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,272
That's right.

1041
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:56,442
I really want to know. Not only for me,

1042
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:57,818
but for Yeon-ju's sake too.

1043
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,946
Does she know

1044
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:03,407
you've been coming to see me?

1045
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:07,745
No, not yet.

1046
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:12,917
Then tell her and come back.

1047
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:20,174
But if she finds out
I had been coming secretly,

1048
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,885
would she be disappointed in me?

1049
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,554
I'm not sure.

1050
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:30,309
It depends on how she feels.

1051
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:34,271
There's something my mother once told me.

1052
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:38,400
Even if a child makes a mistake,
when they reach out again,

1053
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:41,570
their parents will take
that hand immediately.

1054
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:44,657
Isn't that true?

1055
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:48,827
When we love someone,

1056
01:10:49,828 --> 01:10:53,040
we don't get disappointed
in them that readily.

1057
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,425
You don't have a choice anymore.

1058
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:06,303
Tell me everything you know about Mi-na.

1059
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:08,222
It's like term savings maturing.

1060
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:10,891
All of this happened in Seopyung.

1061
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:13,602
I am the Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

1062
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:16,647
Snoop around all you want.
Do you think things will go your way?

1063
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:19,900
I was told there was something
suspicious about your alibi.

1064
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:24,113
Didn't you visit the factory in Seopyung
the day he passed away?

1065
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:27,366
Cho Yeon-ju. I've heard that name before.

1066
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:30,869
She was the daughter
of the Hanju factory arsonist.
