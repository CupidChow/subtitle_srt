1
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,256
Who would believe me if I said

2
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,592
that I did nothing wrong?

3
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,761
Even my own daughter doesn't believe me.

4
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,562
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
EDM SYSTEM

5
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:06,024
CHO YEON-JU
LOG IN

6
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,735
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
EDM SYSTEM

7
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,989
Why do they want me
to request leave through this?

8
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,867
How can I guess the password
when I know nothing about myself?

9
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,913
All right. Here they are.

10
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,915
What's all that?

11
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,251
The case documents
you're assigned to this week.

12
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,379
While you extended your leave,
other prosecutors took your cases.

13
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,673
Now that you're back,
you're getting them back.

14
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,883
No way.

15
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,760
It'll take the whole day
just to read them.

16
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:37,096
I can't finish them within this week.
My gosh. What's this?

17
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,141
Five years for a rapist?

18
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,061
Then it'll be reduced to three years
when they announce the verdict.

19
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,814
Are they encouraging people
to rape more or what?

20
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,569
They're only fining him
when he's filthy rich?

21
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,946
It won't damage him at all.

22
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,531
Gosh.

23
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,908
How will they reflect on themselves?

24
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,369
It looks like the victim of that case

25
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,247
is related to Songseong Group.

26
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,791
Songseong Group? What about it?

27
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,752
You know the group very well.

28
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,505
I know Songseong Construction
which builds apartments.

29
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,756
What about that company?

30
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,679
They're not even the largest conglomerate.

31
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,222
What about this group?

32
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,060
So the rumor must be true.

33
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,437
I know. She thinks that the sentences

34
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,940
prosecutors decide
based on protocols are a problem.

35
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:33,236
She even disregarded Songseong Group.
Is she doing that to start a bloodbath?

36
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,405
Everyone's talking about it
on the messenger too.

37
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,074
Some say she should wait
until she takes leave

38
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,367
before she blows the whistle,

39
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,036
-and some say she shouldn't.
-What are you talking about?

40
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,330
What do you mean by a messenger?

41
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,460
WE TRUST OUR ONLY HOPE, CHO YEON-JU!

42
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,503
WILL IT BE POSSIBLE?

43
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,755
VOTE LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR WHISTLEBLOWING
YES, NO

44
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,132
I SUPPORT YOUR WHISTLEBLOWING!

45
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,550
WHAT GIVES MS. CHO THE RIGHT
TO REFORM THE PROSECUTION?

46
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,888
Why are they making their own assumptions

47
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,890
and voting on my leave of absence?

48
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,641
My life is at stake here,

49
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,643
and I need to save
the corrupt prosecution?

50
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:14,861
What is it?

51
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,989
Fish don't know
that they live in the water.

52
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:22,160
Prosecutors who are slaves of power
do not know what's right from wrong.

53
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,412
-Sorry?
-Nice to meet you.

54
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,624
We're the prosecutors who have been
in charge of minor cases

55
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,709
such as domestic violence
and sexual abuse.

56
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,337
We're Prosecutors Kook, Young, and Soo.

57
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,215
There's light and shadow
in Seoul Central DPO,

58
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,008
and we're the shadow.

59
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:41,679
We heard you were going to step up
and expose the corrupt prosecutors.

60
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,223
We're here to root for you.

61
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,600
We became prosecutors

62
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,685
without any connections.

63
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,520
We're the "dirt spoons."

64
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,273
My father ran an electric shop
all his life,

65
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,734
he lost his parents early in life,

66
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,861
and his parents

67
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,615
still farm on someone else's land.

68
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,245
Cheer up. We got your back.

69
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,621
We'll be your supporters.

70
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,456
Butâ€¦

71
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,045
discreetly like your shadow.

72
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,509
Sure. Thank you.

73
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,011
I'll call you when I need help.

74
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,431
Let's go.

75
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,649
I shouldn't come in their sight at all.

76
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:38,903
Darn it.

77
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,827
Mr. Park and Mr. Cha
have been covering for Ms. Cho,

78
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,289
but Ms. Cho is applying
for a leave of absence soon.

79
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,749
So you'll need to
cover for her a little longer.

80
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,836
Hey, we had to cover your cases because
you didn't tell anyone about your leave.

81
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,337
And now you're taking time off again?

82
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,382
You should've
just taken your leave earlier.

83
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:03,469
You used all your paid holidays,
and you're applying for leave again.

84
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,679
How rude is that?

85
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,596
Tell me about it.

86
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,600
People these days think
female prosecutors aren't competent,

87
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,312
but our department decided to embrace you.

88
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,564
And now you're stabbing us in the back.

89
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,442
I have some unavoidable reasons
to take this leave,

90
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,776
so I have nothing to say,

91
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,904
but why would you bring up
female prosecutors?

92
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,449
Then don't apply for a leave of absence.

93
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,993
Stop arguing about justice

94
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,287
when you can't even handle your own work.

95
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,747
Don't you agree?

96
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,373
Straighten out your life.

97
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,418
Aren't you being too harsh?

98
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,170
Am I not your senior?

99
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,755
What about my life?

100
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,215
Why straighten it?
I'm actually asking out of curiosity.

101
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,761
Well, you were my senior in college,

102
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,721
but I passed the bar exam before you did!

103
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,139
That's enough!

104
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,391
What a sight.

105
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,561
Because you keep tossing cases
to each other,

106
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,105
the cases got delayed.

107
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,858
Our department has the worst performance.

108
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:03,071
Then I'll be the one to be blamed.
Shall I take time off from work too?

109
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,782
Fine! We should all take time off.

110
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,826
Why is everyone going on
about my leave of absence?

111
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,329
How much work are we behind on
because of me?

112
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,456
Then will you be okay
with my leave of absence

113
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,749
when I finish all the work?

114
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,089
So you couldn't apply
for a leave of absence?

115
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:25,760
I mean, all the prosecutors
are swamped with a heavy workload.

116
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,303
This is a serious problem.

117
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,473
I was the top trainee
at the training institute,

118
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,475
so why did I choose
to become a prosecutor?

119
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,685
Their salaries are barely higher
than the minimum cost of living.

120
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,938
-What's so good about being a prosecutor?
-Let's see.

121
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,483
At least people don't look down on you,
and you can take out loans easily.

122
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,361
I became a prosecutor for that?

123
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,322
I guess you wanted to prosecute someone.

124
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,032
Don't worry.

125
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,618
I'll help you figure out your work
after I'm done today.

126
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,286
Okay. Thank you.

127
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,250
Gosh, I shouldn't have lost my temper.

128
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,044
I'm the center of attention.

129
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,672
How am I going to double as a chairman?

130
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,721
It's me. Is everything okay?

131
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,017
I guess something's up.
What is it this time?

132
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,061
It's a long story.

133
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,271
I'll tell you later.

134
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,190
Did you call to ask if I was doing okay?

135
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,109
I wanted to ask you a favor too.

136
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:28,448
I went to see the culprit
of the fire accident my father was in.

137
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,740
What?

138
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,785
The fire wasn't accidental but arson?

139
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,496
-That's right.
-I can't believe it.

140
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,622
So what did he say?

141
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,374
Is he regretting what he did?

142
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,710
-No.
-What a jerk.

143
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,754
But something felt off about him.

144
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,090
He talked as if it was someone else

145
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,800
that committed the crime.

146
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,845
Then he's even worse. Is he a psychopath?

147
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,889
Anyway, I wanted to look
into the case more,

148
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,266
so I want to see the case report.

149
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:58,644
-I heard only prosecutors had the access.
-I see.

150
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,731
-Where did you say the fire occurred?
-It was in Seopyung.

151
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,983
That's great. I'll ask Yu-jun.

152
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,776
I'm seeing him at home later anyway.

153
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,446
Why do you keep meeting him at home?

154
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,949
Mr. No and my car are there,
so I have to go there anyway.

155
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,453
Why did you tell Mr. No to wait there?

156
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,206
Well, I can't tell him to wait
in front of the prosecutors' office.

157
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,500
I don't want to brag
about my double life to everyone.

158
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,959
I'm agitated enough

159
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,420
without you adding to it, so hang up.

160
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,797
Hello? Hey.

161
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,135
Darn it.

162
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:37,391
CHIEF RYU SEUNG-DUK

163
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,769
What nonsense is that?

164
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,731
Use your connections
and smuggle me out of the country already.

165
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,692
I got tangled up with Hanju Group.

166
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,528
Things are looking bad.

167
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,655
Hold on.

168
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,032
Did you go to Hanju Group?

169
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,576
Are you out of your mind?

170
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,413
Who in Hanju Group?

171
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,958
Let's meet. I'll tell you in person.

172
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,546
All right. I'll see you there.

173
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,015
Why are there so manyâ€¦

174
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,850
Gosh!

175
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,102
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,483
Bong-sik.

177
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,485
Isn't that you, Bong-sik?

178
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,283
Are you okay?

179
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,546
Are you okay?

180
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,132
Sorry about that.

181
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,350
Isn't that Kang Mi-na's copycat?

182
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,328
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

183
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,787
PROSECUTOR CHO YEON-JU

184
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,626
They look the same?

185
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,922
Didn't anyone follow you around?

186
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,846
I can get out though, right?

187
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,514
Don't you worry.

188
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,684
She got run over while running after meâ€¦

189
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,275
She lost her memory due to the accident

190
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,904
and has no idea who she is.
That was why she was there.

191
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:00,201
Kang Mi-na may not be Kang Mi-na.

192
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,329
Shall we give you a chance?

193
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,538
Bring me evidence,

194
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,082
and I'll spare your life.

195
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,836
Okay.

196
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,641
Mr. No.

197
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,522
You're here.

198
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,276
Shouldn't you be
outside the prosecutors' office?

199
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,820
She says not to come.

200
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:39,990
She says people will see me
if I wait in my car out front.

201
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,493
She says she's at the center of attention.

202
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,454
What if she's in danger again?

203
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,666
Even if she doesn't ride with you,
you can still follow her

204
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,084
or something.

205
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,628
You're so mean.

206
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,088
What?

207
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,298
I'm the head of legal at Hanju.

208
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,843
I usually get driven around.

209
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,469
I've become a driver

210
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,929
after the last incident

211
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,597
and am following her around.

212
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,101
I took a nap out of exhaustion.
Don't you feel sorry for me?

213
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,812
What if people see me
following her in my car?

214
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,439
Don't you worry about me?

215
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,192
Of course, I worry about you too.

216
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,529
Sorry.

217
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,491
She should be here soon,
so I'll get out of your hair.

218
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,827
Is she almost done?

219
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,787
She usually finishes around now.

220
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:31,167
My shoulder is really sore
from driving so much.

221
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,169
Over here.

222
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,337
Will you squeeze right here?

223
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,047
Here.

224
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,265
My neck.

225
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,026
Where is this twerp?

226
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,153
Where did he go this time?

227
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,380
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

228
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,091
Who are you?

229
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,647
Who are you, jerk?

230
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,202
Darn it. I didn't want to do this.

231
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,997
Why must you turn me into a bad guy?

232
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,164
Darn it.

233
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,173
Who are you? Who sent you?

234
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,676
Darn it.

235
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,465
Are you okay?

236
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,342
I told you not to use that arm.

237
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,683
Did you think I'd let you attack me twice?

238
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,270
It was you. You cut my brake line.

239
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,568
Whose side are you on?

240
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,320
There's more to life

241
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,240
than my side and someone else's side.

242
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,952
Apologies if I was out of line.

243
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,247
Actually

244
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,292
there is an old security camera

245
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,170
that has been up
since before the garage was renovated.

246
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,635
The people here don't even know
that it's a camera.

247
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,972
The resolution isn't very high,

248
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,223
but it does function.

249
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,732
There are many times
when the person who really helps you

250
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,943
is neither on my side
nor someone else's side.

251
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,945
Because I believe

252
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,530
people's lives are more important

253
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,491
than money, power, and things like that.

254
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,784
Furthermore,

255
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,663
I don't want things like that

256
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,456
happening in this family anymore.

257
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,291
"Anymore"?

258
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,548
My gosh. How old is this camera?

259
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,550
There's nowhere to connect a cable.

260
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,093
Then we can't watch it?

261
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,679
Don't you worry.

262
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,556
My dad had an electronics store.

263
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:59,727
Luckily, I think I can connect
a TV to the AV port.

264
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,745
Why are there so many--

265
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,415
Are you okay?

266
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,396
Who sent you? Who are you?

267
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,316
Don't you know me?

268
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,154
You don't know who I am, do you?

269
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,456
What's going on?

270
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,582
POLICE

271
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,213
She's a prosecutor
from the Central District Office.

272
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,841
Hello, officers.

273
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,511
He's a suspect I arrested.

274
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,057
Are you all right, ma'am?

275
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,809
Yes, of course.

276
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,686
I always end up fighting like this
when arresting suspectsâ€¦

277
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,021
No, that's not it. Hereâ€¦

278
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,877
The huge scandal
that Ryu Seung-duk, our dear prosecutor,

279
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,754
missed immediately before we arrested him?

280
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,714
You asked me
to help with the Lee Bong-sik-gateâ€¦

281
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,175
I'll surprise him by catching him andâ€¦

282
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,433
Who are you?

283
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,104
Who am I?

284
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,526
Let's find out who's more fake.

285
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,071
It's just until she inherits
all of Yumin family's money.

286
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:20,033
I'll return this life back to you
after I upgrade it.

287
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,537
Or will you trust me,
who is his legitimate daughter?

288
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:35,257
And he went to check the ledger
at the Hanju Fashion factory.

289
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,633
And a fire broke out there.

290
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,393
Grandma!

291
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,896
Grandmaâ€¦

292
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,983
PROSECUTOR WITH TWO HEARTS

293
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,027
Wait just a little longer, Grandma.

294
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,494
Are you all right?

295
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,672
What? What is it?

296
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,469
Who are you?

297
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,097
I'm okay, so don't worry.

298
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,266
You scared me.

299
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,728
Are you okay? Any serious injuries?

300
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,855
That was just a little prank.
Don't make such a fuss.

301
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,649
This is no time for pranks.

302
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,068
Stop pretending you're Kang Mi-na.
You need to stop.

303
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,154
-By the way, where is Lee Bong-sik?
-Who?

304
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,200
That jerk from earlier. He's the one
I've been trying to track down.

305
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,452
On the day of the accident,
I got hit while chasing him.

306
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,996
Have you

307
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,416
regained your memory?

308
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,798
Seriously, where is this jerk?

309
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,260
-You can't go anywhere like that.
-Gosh, I'm totally fine.

310
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,427
This is nothing to me.

311
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,638
-I'm totally okay--
-I'm not okay with it!

312
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,932
Stop getting hurt!

313
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,605
Just wait until
you get your test results back, okay?

314
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,191
Wait until you find out
it's nothing serious.

315
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,317
Please.

316
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,778
You're persistent.

317
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,161
Are we good now? I knew it.

318
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,205
There isn't a single fracture in my skull.

319
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,915
I'm relieved. You're not hurt,

320
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,458
and you've regained your memory.

321
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,670
What about your family?
Is there anyone you should contact?

322
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,673
No.

323
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,968
If you have no family,

324
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,513
what about people you're close to? Anyone?

325
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,806
There's no one!

326
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,101
I'm sorry if I offended you.

327
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,272
By the way, is your arm okay?

328
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,693
Have you ever punched anyone
with that arm?

329
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,612
I work out a lot.

330
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,989
I have a six-pack.

331
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,449
Can you punch someone with it?

332
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,117
It's useless.

333
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,287
If you have no fat, you're more likely
to die from a stab wound.

334
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,497
Why did you suddenly show up?

335
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,082
Why were you wandering alone?

336
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,877
It's not like you ever cared about me
roaming around alone.

337
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,003
What's gotten into you?

338
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:21,298
It's not like you'll listen to me
if I tell you not to go around alone.

339
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,301
Who knows? Had you said that,
I might have listened to you.

340
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,678
Goodness. I won't blame you for my injury,

341
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,513
-so don't you worry.
-Okay!

342
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,060
I didn't expect you
to say "okay" right away.

343
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,395
Seriously though,
where's Lee Bong-sik now?

344
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,439
He's at the Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

345
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,940
Why did you take him there?

346
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,736
Because you'd get in trouble
if he said something stupid to the police.

347
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,197
Why are you in such a rush?

348
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,115
Until the lead prosecutor

349
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,576
on the case gets there,
they'll just leave him alone.

350
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,786
No.

351
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,538
Someone will come running
once they find out he's been caught.

352
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,123
Who?

353
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,709
My real target.

354
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,683
Is Yeon-ju on my side? Or is she my enemy?

355
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,979
I'm telling you. It was crazy.

356
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,400
That scumbag grabbed a brick

357
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,861
and smashed the top of her head with it.

358
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,696
But Ms. Cho got up right away

359
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,532
even though she was bleeding.

360
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,784
Then she started sprinting,
jumped into the air,

361
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,702
and gave him a good kick in the chest.

362
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,248
Finished.

363
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,168
Sir.

364
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,295
I didn't see you.

365
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,471
What's with all this fuss
over catching him?

366
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:55,100
This means I can't even
hide him away. Darn it.

367
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,522
I was investigating
that person's corrupt deeds.

368
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,609
Does that investigation matter more
than your well-being?

369
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,614
My reason is similar to yours.

370
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,579
Help! Please help us.

371
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,497
HANJU MEDICAL CENTER

372
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,542
Please. I don't even remember
how many hospitals I've been to.

373
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,460
Please don't kick us out.

374
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,590
I couldn't even find an ambulance,

375
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,550
let alone a bed.

376
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,512
Grandmaâ€¦

377
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,394
I'm sorry, Grandma. This is all my fault.

378
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,272
Grandmaâ€¦

379
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,357
Yeon-ju.

380
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,861
This is not your fault.

381
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,154
Grandmaâ€¦

382
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,239
I stepped in on my own accord.

383
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,742
You know,

384
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,245
nothing can be solely blamed

385
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,538
on one person.

386
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,833
I would've stepped inâ€¦

387
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,043
Grandma.

388
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,379
I still would have stepped in

389
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:10,425
even if you had tried to stop me.

390
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,844
Grandma.

391
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,763
You're suffering

392
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,182
and can't even do anything

393
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,393
because of us.

394
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,855
I don't want to see you live like this

395
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,275
for the rest of your life.

396
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,946
Grandma.

397
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,406
No, Grandma.

398
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,454
HANJU MEDICAL CENTER

399
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,167
-Sir.
-Goodness.

400
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,670
No one takes that road
except for the people

401
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,380
who work at the factory.

402
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,881
We don't even have a witness.

403
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,383
There is nothing we can do.

404
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,843
There must be some speed cameras

405
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:54,844
along the road.

406
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,764
The cameras in the area don't even work.

407
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,057
It's just for show.

408
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,143
You see, we're short-staffed
at the moment.

409
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,436
Just go home and wait.

410
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,438
We'll call you if anything turns up.

411
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,695
They had no intention
of investigating it to begin with.

412
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,655
Obviously, they never called me.

413
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,241
I told myself I was done

414
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,076
desperately begging others for help.

415
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:28,003
So I studied like crazy
and became a prosecutor.

416
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,048
To meet that person.

417
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,385
I was told a prosecutor
at the Seopyung Prosecutors' Office

418
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,054
stopped the police
from investigating the case.

419
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,896
The rumors that I took bribes
and did favors for those with power

420
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,482
to climb the ladder quickly led him to me,

421
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,318
so he suddenly came to see me one day.

422
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,282
You look familiar for some reason.

423
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,534
I heard you were
at the Central District Office.

424
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:03,079
Right. I've seen you
many times from afar, sir.

425
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,331
Is that so?

426
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,124
Right.

427
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,543
There are many junior prosecutors
who work under me.

428
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,711
Here.

429
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,589
I've heard so much about you.

430
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,215
Everyone says you're the most

431
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,009
capable prosecutor in Seopyung.

432
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,846
You see,

433
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,265
this won't be hard for you at all.

434
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,352
My acquaintance's son

435
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,896
hit someone with his car and ran away,

436
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,106
so he's in serious trouble now.

437
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:31,649
A hit-and-run?

438
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,194
It happens to quite a lot of rich kids.

439
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:37,030
There aren't many places in this country
where you can speed.

440
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,407
So they drive their sports cars
on empty roads andâ€¦

441
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,326
-Anyway, let's drink.
-Yes, sir.

442
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,167
But you see,

443
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,544
this is a good opportunity

444
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,837
for prosecutors like us.

445
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,675
Don't you want to return to Seoul?

446
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,677
You must feel cooped up here.

447
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,596
Right.

448
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:10,397
So I thought that must be
what happened with my grandma.

449
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:17,695
When you're lonely

450
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,213
You're the best!

451
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,257
That's right.

452
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,675
You're the best.

453
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,470
Gosh. You're the best too.

454
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,430
You're the best.

455
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:51,604
It turned out that he was a hyena
who cleaned up after Hanju Group.

456
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,190
Sing something else!

457
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,861
I don't know who hit my grandma,
but I'm certain

458
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,904
he was cleaning up after Hanju then too.

459
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,665
That must be why you contacted me,
the head of Hanju's legal team.

460
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,334
You wanted to sound me out
about Ryu Seung-duk

461
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,961
and Hanju's connection.

462
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,004
Yes.

463
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,758
And you called me to take her

464
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,301
to the Seoul Central DPO.

465
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,429
The doctor said she needed to be careful,

466
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,055
but she insisted on leaving.

467
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,224
You said you hated hospitals,

468
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,268
but you went to her side
at lightning speed.

469
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,395
I heard nothing from you since then,

470
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,606
but you only called me
to drive her to the DPO?

471
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,402
Well, I'd have driven her myself

472
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,862
if my arm was okay, butâ€¦

473
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,156
That's not what I'm talking about.

474
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,909
Then why didn't you call me
when you got hurt?

475
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,329
Who's been your guardian in Korea

476
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,831
ever since your father passed away?

477
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,333
It's always been me.

478
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,795
What if you'd been hit by a brick too?

479
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,047
And look what happened to your arm!

480
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,052
Are you hurt anywhere else?

481
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,554
No, I'm not.

482
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,515
I'm sorry.

483
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,435
Am I your chauffeur or something?

484
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,812
I can't do this anymore.

485
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:17,106
Who is the owner of car number 4774?

486
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,358
Pull out the car!

487
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,984
Coming.

488
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,903
Wait here. I'll bring the car.

489
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:28,326
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

490
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:31,037
It must be really inconvenient
with the arm injury.

491
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,747
You said you didn't care.

492
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,917
Then will you come to my place,
feed me, wash my hair

493
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,129
and help me shave like they do in movies?

494
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,299
You must've watched too many movies.

495
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,510
Sorry?

496
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,178
What were you imagining?

497
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,056
You can eat with your right hand
if your left arm is injured.

498
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,850
You can wash your hair with one hand.

499
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,434
You can even shave too.

500
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,275
-The car is here.
-Get in.

501
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,693
Okay!

502
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:04,571
Why would I imagine anything like that?

503
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,489
I wasn't imagining anything.

504
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,414
Hey.

505
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,208
Just keep your mouth shut.

506
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,960
I have valuable information toâ€¦

507
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,382
You threw a brick at a prosecutor
and were caught in the act.

508
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,467
You can't refute it
even if you get arrested.

509
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,053
-That's not it. I foundâ€¦
-You scum!

510
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,639
Don't say a word to anyone. Got it?

511
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,807
I'm telling youâ€¦

512
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,894
You're not supposed to be here.

513
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,772
Just stay in prison for the time being.

514
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,858
I'll take care of the rest later.

515
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,320
Seriously!
I have really valuable information!

516
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,072
My goodness, Chief Ryu!
You're here already?

517
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,450
Ms. Cho.

518
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,828
You must've gone through a lot
because of this jerk.

519
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,705
I finally caught him.

520
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,166
Right. That's great.

521
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,250
Good work.

522
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,753
Is your head okay?

523
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,504
Of course.

524
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,506
You jerk.

525
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,134
He was caught in the act.
What more is there to investigate?

526
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,761
Just transfer him to the detention center.

527
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,263
I can't do that.

528
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,099
I'm sure he has committed more crimes.

529
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,893
I'll go through everything

530
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:20,396
so that he'll have nothing more to hide.

531
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,941
You can leave him to me.
You should go home.

532
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,860
Okay, then.

533
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,488
Okay. Keep up the good work.

534
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,574
-That darn jerk.
-Salute.

535
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,935
You want to ask me
something they shouldn't hear about?

536
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,688
How deeply are you enmeshed in this?
Who are you?

537
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,647
What?

538
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,734
Did the chief tell you
to keep your mouth shut?

539
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,529
Then let me tell you who I am.

540
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:10,947
You know me.

541
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,325
I'm a prosecutor at Seoul Central DPO,
Cho Yeon-ju,

542
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,077
and the chairman of Yumin Group.

543
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,957
You must think I lost my memories

544
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,044
and can't tell who you are
or what you did.

545
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,714
That's too bad.

546
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,967
When you hit me with a brick,

547
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,677
my memories came back.

548
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:39,392
I'm good at many things, but among those,

549
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:42,437
I'm the best at choosing
whom to make connections with.

550
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,273
Speaking of which,

551
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,817
let me give you a piece of advice.

552
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,528
Who do you think
you should make connections with?

553
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,408
I'm the prosecutor in charge,

554
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,118
and I'm the chairman of Yumin,

555
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,870
the 20th largest conglomerate.

556
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:03,708
Which means I have
both power and money to bury you alive.

557
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:08,046
You made a deal
with the chief before, right?

558
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,006
Yes, you did!

559
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,884
If you make a statement regarding that,
I'll let you go.

560
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,637
You must be thinking
a mere prosecutor like me

561
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,514
must not have the power to let you go.

562
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,268
Hey, prosecutors
can make individual decisions.

563
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:25,188
No matter what the higher-ups say,
if I propose a long sentence

564
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,230
after indicting you,

565
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,482
you can never be freed

566
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,358
unless you're completely innocent.

567
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,402
But you've committed a couple of crimes.

568
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:35,990
And Chief Prosecutor Ryu Seung-duk
you must be thinking of.

569
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,160
Where do you think he went?

570
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,082
Every time I see this,

571
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,794
it looks so real.

572
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,178
A junior prosecutor

573
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,555
arrested Lee Bong-sik,

574
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,266
thinking that'd help me.

575
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,561
Things got a little complicated,

576
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:09,232
but I'll handle it soon.

577
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,610
But isn't he a con artist?

578
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,029
He should've been arrested
a long time ago.

579
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,073
Sorry?

580
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,117
If you let him go again,

581
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:23,287
you'll be in a pickle too.

582
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,633
Since he scammed people,

583
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,260
he should rot in prison.

584
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,719
Don't you agree?

585
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,267
Unlike then, you're Chief Prosecutor now.

586
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,687
So I'm sure you'll be able
to take my daughter's name off the list.

587
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,162
Prosecutors indict people all the time
so they know very well

588
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:07,874
how they'll be punished
if they commit a crime themselves.

589
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,959
That's why their scale is only this big.

590
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:13,087
I'm sure he's seeing the chairman of Hanju
and sucking up to him.

591
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,505
Think of the people at Hanju.

592
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,465
They didn't even pay you anything

593
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,259
just for letting you go.

594
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:21,679
Do you know how much they gained
because you didn't name them?

595
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,431
They shouldn't have done that.

596
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,683
Don't stick with petty people like them.

597
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:29,562
Join hands with me
and turn your life around.

598
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:33,232
How dare you try to fool me?

599
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,527
Bong-sik, use your head.

600
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,822
They let you go once,
but you're back clinging on to them.

601
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,532
They won't let you go again.

602
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,202
Fine. Take your time to think.

603
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,078
You must be anxious.

604
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,497
When people are given

605
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,958
only one of either money or power,

606
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,753
they're desperate
to have the other one too.

607
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,254
But when you have both,

608
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,589
you're much more at ease.

609
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:57,715
Just like me.

610
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,384
If you join hands with me,

611
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:04,430
I'll let you live in luxury in Vietnam
for the rest of your life.

612
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,268
-You want me to testify?
-That's right.

613
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,895
Finally, we're getting somewhere.

614
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,189
Where's the list?

615
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,899
The list of counterfeit art clients

616
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,401
that disappeared with you three years ago.

617
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,530
I can't give you that.

618
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:25,534
Come now.
Why can't you open your heart to me?

619
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,578
Do you have some childhood traumas?

620
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,247
You're breaking my heart.

621
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,916
Then let's talk
about something else first.

622
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,127
Where's the real Kang Mi-na?

623
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,548
What? The fact that someone

624
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,593
who has never met me before
knows that I'm not her

625
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,012
means you know
the real Kang Mi-na very well.

626
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,098
Did you think I was stupid?

627
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,352
The chief prosecutor doesn't know

628
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,271
whether she's an ally or a foe,

629
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,564
but this one

630
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,526
has him in the palm of her hand.

631
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:02,113
Exactly. So work with me.

632
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,364
Where's Kang Mi-na?

633
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,658
-I have no idea.
-Hey!

634
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,161
I don't know right now.

635
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,623
All I did was put her on a boat
heading to China.

636
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:21,215
They said Hanju's art purchases
would be made in her name,

637
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,552
so I assumed they had put
some airhead in charge.

638
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,429
I went to see her.

639
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,269
Taeryeong Group's madam

640
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:36,147
had bought this painting
directly from the artist.

641
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,317
She's selling it now
due to personal reasons.

642
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,610
This series is popular

643
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,112
not only among the wealthy,

644
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,697
but with people of high status

645
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,990
to use as special gifts.

646
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,201
It's a counterfeit.

647
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,456
-Pardon?
-Your watch. It's a counterfeit.

648
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,087
What do you mean?

649
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,089
Do you know why scams are bad?

650
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:09,138
Only desperate people fall for them.

651
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,810
At least you con wealthy people.

652
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,228
Maybe you're not as bad.

653
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,026
What luck.

654
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,946
This is the only time I can leave home.

655
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,157
And I happened to meet

656
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,868
a con artist here.

657
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:38,084
But that was not the case.
She offered me a deal.

658
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:44,757
She said she may be killed
if she stayed in Korea.

659
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,259
She said she'd buy a painting
for triple the price

660
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,929
if I got her out of the country.

661
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,265
She got on the boat.

662
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,850
She has a fake passport.

663
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,103
And she has tons of money.

664
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,563
So she probably went somewhere
once she got to China.

665
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,440
Is that the truth?

666
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,025
Believe me or not. Whatever.

667
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,194
I see.

668
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,658
Yes, that's right, Bong-sik.

669
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,578
If you knew I wasn't Kang Mi-na,

670
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,415
why did you try to kill me, you freak?

671
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,964
Because that person didn't care

672
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,340
who you were.

673
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,844
"That person?"

674
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:38,102
Kang Mi-na may not be Kang Mi-na.

675
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,646
Is that it?

676
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,108
I have that much information.

677
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,609
What I need is evidence.

678
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,736
Shall we give you a chance?

679
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,574
Bring me evidence,
and I'll spare your life.

680
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,165
If it's too hard to find evidence,

681
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,584
just kill her.

682
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,173
Her mere existence gets on my nerves.

683
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:09,967
Whether she's the real Kang Mi-na
or a fake Kang Mi-na

684
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,969
is irrelevant.

685
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,139
Because if you kill her,

686
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,932
the real Kang Mi-na can't return

687
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,893
even if she wants to.

688
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,980
You understand what I'm saying, right?

689
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,662
Director Han acted like

690
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,581
she was smarter than everyone,

691
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:43,167
but she let that loser con her.

692
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,085
She voluntarily jumped into the con.

693
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,755
But you're in trouble.

694
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,507
What?

695
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,176
You're in way over your head.

696
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,055
Everyone must be contemplating

697
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,515
what to do with you.

698
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,102
A merger?

699
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,355
That's the condition

700
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,190
for them to acquire Hanju Hotel.

701
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,026
We need to give Yumin a justification.

702
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,028
I asked for some timeâ€¦

703
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,696
Lee Bong-sik was arrested.

704
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,159
Word spread about his arrest already,

705
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,453
so we can't make it go away
like last time.

706
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:24,625
Your name is
on top of his list of clients.

707
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,795
The hotel business is all about image.

708
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,714
If I give you more time,
you'll only be criticized longer

709
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,258
and the hotel will suffer more losses

710
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:35,261
if it gets out
that you created a slush fund using art.

711
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,306
The chief prosecutor says
he can remove your name.

712
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,893
That's a good thing for Hanju
in the long run. Don't you agree?

713
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:47,356
We can get rid of a failing business
and get a profitable hotel for free.

714
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,234
This is so you.

715
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:54,488
You think only of yourself
whenever the opportunity arises.

716
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:59,451
Bottom line,
you want Yumin Hotel without its owner.

717
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,374
What about this?

718
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,503
You should thank the stars

719
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,714
that I was the one who caught you.

720
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,550
Give me the list and stay here
for the time being.

721
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:15,467
What do you mean?

722
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,636
-You said you'd release me!
-Hey.

723
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,431
If the woman who told you to kill me
regardless of who I was

724
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:23,559
finds out you're in here,
do you think she'll let you live?

725
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:26,020
You're the safest in here.

726
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:31,650
Don't worry about the detention center.
I have people everywhere in there.

727
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,194
You want me to trust prison guards?

728
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,571
Not prison guards.

729
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,323
They're everywhere in the slammer.

730
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,825
I won't let you get stabbed,
so just stay there.

731
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,497
Anywayâ€¦ What exactly are you?

732
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,043
Why don't you work with me
if you want to know?

733
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,837
You'll give me the list, right?

734
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,467
Darn it.

735
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,641
Yes. Lee Bong-sik.

736
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,811
Later. See you around. Bye.

737
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,611
Why were you waiting here?

738
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:20,824
Must you go to my uncle's home?

739
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,118
Did you wait to ask me that?

740
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,162
It's obvious, isn't it?

741
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:28,499
I've worked so hard to catch the tiger.

742
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:32,252
And what stroke of luck.
I realized I was in the tiger's den.

743
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,420
How can I leave?

744
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,926
-What?
-This is who you really are.

745
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,345
But what? You won't go anywhere alone
if I tell you not to?

746
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,391
Exactly. So don't tell me not to go there.

747
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,101
I won't.

748
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,435
Since I know how you feel.

749
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:50,729
Give me your phone.

750
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,981
-My phone? Why?
-Just give it to me.

751
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,406
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

752
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,365
SEND SOS MESSAGES TO, ADD RECIPIENT

753
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:03,951
HAN SEUNG-WOOK

754
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,828
COMPLETE

755
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,121
HAN SEUNG-WOOK HAS BEEN ADDED

756
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,081
I'll come to your side right away

757
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,416
if something happens.

758
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,717
Mr. No's waiting. You should go.

759
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,288
You can eat, shave and wash your hair

760
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,873
by yourself,

761
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,499
but not this.

762
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,844
About Kang Mi-naâ€¦

763
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,180
Lee Bong-sik said
he put her on a boat to China.

764
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,725
But he doesn't know where she is now.

765
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,479
I hope this information
helps you find her.

766
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,563
I'll be off, then.

767
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,475
Are you all right?

768
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,769
I went to see the culprit

769
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,395
of the fire accident my father was in.

770
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,649
The fire wasn't accidental but arson?

771
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,901
-That's right.
-So what did he say?

772
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,444
Is he regretting what he did?

773
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:03,862
No.

774
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:04,947
What a jerk.

775
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,414
You excitedly bluffed about

776
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,793
going into the tiger's den
to uncover all of Hanju's corrupt deeds.

777
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,211
Why are you sighing now?

778
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:22,005
Don't mind me.
I'm brimming with enthusiasm right now.

779
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,883
Seriously, both you and Mr. Han.

780
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,969
Is it because you two are still young?

781
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,681
I get that you're suspicious,
but there's no solid evidence.

782
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,516
What can you even do?

783
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,643
When did you say the accident took place?

784
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,730
Why aren't you saying anything?

785
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,399
Didn't you regain your memory?

786
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,526
Yes, I did.

787
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,653
I remember everything now, all of it.

788
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,660
What's wrong?
Did you just remember something important?

789
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:52,744
Yu-jun!

790
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,794
What's taking her so long?

791
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:06,174
Sorry, Yu-jun. Something has come up.

792
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,218
You should just go home.

793
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,262
Even with her amnesia,

794
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:12,306
she doesn't care about me at all.

795
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:16,518
Gosh.

796
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,232
I'm home.

797
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:24,985
My gosh.

798
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,820
I'm so excited and honored.

799
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,740
They say people drastically change
before they die.

800
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,199
You didn't even show up

801
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,368
the last time the family got together.

802
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,287
Why are you suddenly greeting us?

803
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:38,624
They say your in-laws ask for ten things
when you give them one thing.

804
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,417
What?

805
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,546
Nothing.
I just think I'm such a lucky girl.

806
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,923
Look at me receiving such a warm welcome.

807
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,720
Perfect timing. Take a seat.

808
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:52,929
Sure.

809
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:01,897
I wanted to discuss this with all of you.

810
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,983
I brought it up briefly the other day.

811
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,152
It's about Yumin Hotel.

812
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:10,614
What do you think about
merging it with Hanju Hotel

813
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,366
so we can grow the business?

814
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:17,788
Honey, is it okay to bring this up
in the absence of the hotel owner?

815
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,040
I already know about it.

816
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:26,296
We're a family after all,
so it is not cost-effective

817
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,673
to run two hotels.

818
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:31,051
Whoever is more capable can run the hotel.

819
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,470
You should think about it, Mi-na.

820
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:38,225
They say your in-laws keep giving you
things that you don't even want

821
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,311
and delude themselves
into thinking that they're generous.

822
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,774
What I mean is, I'm so lucky

823
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,401
that my in-laws aren't like that.

824
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:49,319
Mi-na, that's enough.

825
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:55,158
Now that the situation has changed,
are you revealing your true colors?

826
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,744
That's not it.

827
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,037
I'm finally myself again.

828
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,373
I have to, to survive in this household.

829
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:06,169
Did that car accident
not teach you a lesson?

830
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,672
Looks like you need
properly functioning brakes.

831
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,590
My brakes work just fine.

832
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,009
As long as someone doesn't touch them.

833
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,762
I think you're the one
who needs properly functioning brakes.

834
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:21,727
Anyway, thanks
for the merger and acquisition offer.

835
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,187
Improving Yumin's relationship with Hanju

836
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,273
will only help me,
in many different aspects.

837
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:40,954
Sung-woon.
Are you going to side with Mi-na?

838
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:43,957
Why are you asking me this question?

839
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,837
It looks like Mi-na is starting
to get the upper hand.

840
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:53,717
Without you joining hands with her,

841
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,011
I can't take her side.

842
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:59,556
Technically,
I'd have nothing to do with her

843
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,641
if it weren't for you.

844
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,226
We're practically strangers.

845
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:07,063
Goodness. Must you ask?

846
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:10,233
Of course, I have to side with her
since I'm her husband.

847
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:12,861
Excuse me.

848
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:16,990
It doesn't matter to them at all
whose side we're on.

849
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:21,995
When I told Sung-hye I'd take her side,
she flat out ignored me.

850
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:24,956
Maybe Sung-hye always ignored us

851
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,334
because she never thought of us
as her competition.

852
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,798
However, the situation has changed.

853
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:38,136
Where are you going?

854
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,763
Where do you think?

855
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,182
I should go see my wife.

856
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:52,818
What is Han Sung-hye thinking?

857
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,820
She worked hard
to grow her hotel business.

858
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,072
She'd never hand it over that easily.

859
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,076
Gosh.

860
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,960
Honey, Sung-hye is right.

861
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:12,796
You shouldn't overwork yourself
right after the accident.

862
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,256
I'm not overworked.

863
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,341
Come on. You must be tired.

864
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,552
-Do you have to leave early again?
-Yes, I do.

865
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:19,511
Really? What time?

866
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,890
Now. I'm heading out now.

867
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:28,186
Bye.

868
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,066
That arrogant littleâ€¦

869
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:47,038
I don't want things like that
happening in this family anymore.

870
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:48,957
"Anymore"?

871
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:53,837
Did it have something to do
with Mr. Han Seung-wook's father?

872
00:52:57,173 --> 00:53:02,304
If he hadn't passed away like that,
things would have been different.

873
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:13,231
Thanks to you,
I managed to catch the culprit.

874
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:14,983
Thank you.

875
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:19,487
Mr. Han Seung-wook was driving
when the accident occurred, wasn't he?

876
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,032
Is he okay?

877
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,200
He hurt his arm.

878
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:32,000
Well, if you don't mind,

879
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:35,086
would you please take this to him?

880
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,674
I wanted to give it to him
when he was here,

881
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,343
but he stormed out.

882
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:46,598
I hope he thinks of his father and
tries to take care of himself emotionally.

883
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:47,682
Pardon?

884
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:52,312
When you hate someone,
you end up becoming like that person.

885
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:56,399
And there are some things that

886
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:59,069
simply can't be undone.

887
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,281
You don't have to do it
if you're uncomfortable.

888
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,909
I have to talk to him
about something anyway.

889
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,410
I'll go drop it off.

890
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:28,723
I'm certain that Ms. Kim
truly cares for you.

891
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,475
How do you know?

892
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:34,145
You can't make seasoned cockles
for someone you don't care for.

893
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:37,983
You have to wash the cockles
over and over again

894
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:41,069
until you tell yourself
that you will never buy them again.

895
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:44,572
Look how many cockles there are.
Clearly, she's very fond of you.

896
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,784
Go on. Dig in.

897
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,537
Can you not eat with one hand?

898
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:54,082
It was my father's favorite dish.

899
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:56,710
This is my first time seeing it
since he passed away.

900
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,171
This is hard.

901
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,133
I suppose you and your father

902
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,801
were very close.

903
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:09,639
I still think of my father
every single day.

904
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,852
He must've been a wonderful father.

905
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,896
All kids think
they have the most wonderful father.

906
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:20,984
Even the arsonist who killed my fatherâ€¦

907
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:25,822
Even such a criminal
talked about his daughter.

908
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:36,124
Anyway, did you come all the way here
at this late hour just to drop this off?

909
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:39,878
No, I'm swamped with work
at the Prosecutors' Office.

910
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,796
I just dropped by on my way there.
Enjoy the food.

911
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,881
Wait.

912
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,384
Have you ever had a dog?

913
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:48,136
No. Why do you ask?

914
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:53,975
Like you said, I could wash my hair,
shave, and eat with one hand,

915
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:58,021
but there's something
I just can't figure out how to do.

916
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:04,944
Just think of it as drying a dog's hair.

917
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:08,281
I couldn't dry my hair with one hand.

918
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:10,325
Gosh, you're making such a fuss.

919
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,452
You could've just dried it off
with a towel.

920
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:15,288
Then it'd mess up my style.
I have straight hair, you see.

921
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,006
My father died on my birthday.

922
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:31,262
If he hadn't passed away like that,
things would've been different.

923
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:36,434
I'm curious where you'll be going back to.

924
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:37,685
Are you worried

925
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,562
I might be someone dangerous?

926
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:42,482
I'm worried you'll be in danger.

927
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:46,486
I'll come to your side right away
if something happens.

928
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:56,079
You don't have to dry that part.

929
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,249
Don't just dry that side. Gosh, it's hot!

930
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,960
It's hot!

931
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,599
My scalp almost got burned.

932
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:21,521
Sorry.

933
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:28,319
You didn't have to put
on a serious face and apologize.

934
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,039
I didn't know you were here.

935
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,624
Right.

936
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,751
I had so much work to do,

937
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,712
so I just dropped by
on my way to the office.

938
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,839
I came early to sleep here

939
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:50,091
because it's a hassle
to move during rush hour.

940
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:56,139
Mr. Han, they said you could remove
the cast. So why are you still wearing it?

941
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:04,647
Who said that?

942
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,691
Who else?

943
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,735
Your doctor told you so.

944
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,778
That you can wear it for a short while.

945
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,697
You could've removed it a long time ago.

946
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:14,991
Why are you still wearing it?

947
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:21,289
I should get going first.

948
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,339
Why did the atmosphere suddenly change
when I came in?

949
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,132
Did you two talk about me?

950
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:39,307
It looks like your hair is all dry.

951
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,692
Gosh, you scared me!
Why are you sleeping here?

952
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,569
Are you okay?

953
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:54,656
You look fine. I'm so relieved.

954
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,533
What's wrong with you?

955
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,786
When I checked the messenger earlier,

956
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,080
they said you got hit
in the head with a brick

957
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:04,541
so you did a fly kick
after turning in the air twice

958
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:05,833
and caught Lee Bong-sik.

959
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:07,919
Are you sure you're okay?

960
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:10,213
Why are they so nosy?

961
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:13,091
They were going crazy
about arresting a suspect

962
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:14,759
in a case from three years ago.

963
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:16,761
They blamed you for whistle-blowing,

964
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:19,722
but now they're going on about you
joining hands with the chief.

965
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,141
By the way,
how did you know it was Lee Bong-sik?

966
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:26,062
-Are you here to ask me that?
-Of course not.

967
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:27,730
I wanted to see if you were okay.

968
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,857
I thought you shouldn't make any mistakes

969
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:32,402
when everyone's attention
will be on you tomorrow.

970
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:35,488
I thought I should help you with your work
before going home.

971
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,156
I see, my dear Yu-jun.

972
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,616
I'm glad you're here.

973
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:40,702
You shouldn't leave early.

974
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:43,162
Could you separate them into cases

975
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,415
that need immediate attention
and further investigation?

976
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,751
For those that need immediate attention,
could you write up an indictment?

977
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,169
Isn't it easy and simple?

978
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,426
-What is it?
-Is your memory back?

979
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:57,885
-No.
-Yes, it is.

980
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:00,680
Why didn't you tell me?

981
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:03,933
I didn't have enough time
to share it with you.

982
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,270
Well, then maybe you can tell me
at the end of the year

983
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,188
when you are reminded of me.

984
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,232
Don't be so upset.

985
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,525
Yu-jun,

986
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,778
do you know what made me the saddest
after regaining my memories?

987
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,948
The first thing that popped up in my head
was that I dismissed

988
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,701
so many cases last month
that I need to indict

989
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,036
a certain amount of cases.

990
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:25,705
I wouldn't have come here at this hour

991
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,206
if things weren't this bad.

992
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,875
Are you going to the bathroom?

993
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,084
You'll be back, right?

994
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:31,586
I'm counting on you.

995
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:34,881
Gosh, that punk.

996
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:40,970
I know how hard you're trying
to size this up.

997
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,515
But it's a fixed fact
that you'll end up in prison.

998
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:50,688
I'll let you go
by suspending your sentence,

999
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,732
so just stay in prison for a while.

1000
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,400
That's all you have to say?

1001
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,444
What else do you want?

1002
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,449
My gosh. Look at this punk.

1003
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:05,119
Do you want to rot in prison?

1004
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:08,081
No, I mean

1005
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:10,917
are you letting me go

1006
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:13,294
with no strings attached?

1007
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,839
You should expose the list you have.

1008
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:18,800
Not as-is.

1009
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:21,928
Fix it a little.

1010
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:43,616
Gosh, Yeon-ju.
You keep making me worry about you.

1011
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,756
Someone must've stopped by.

1012
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:12,186
Han Sung-hye, that wench.
She asked to remove her name from the list

1013
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,813
and add Kang Mi-na's instead?

1014
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,733
Since Kang Mi-na
has already lost everyone's trust,

1015
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:19,610
she's trying to frame her
for the slush funds and the lobbying

1016
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:22,155
to make her leave
the negotiation table in the merger.

1017
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,950
The man with the list is in my pocket,
so what can she possibly do?

1018
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:29,370
Whether they merge the hotels or not,
it's none of your concern.

1019
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,373
It's not your position,
and you don't have the time for it.

1020
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:35,877
But I can't just leave them
to take someone's hotel for free.

1021
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,130
-What are you planning to do?
-I took measures already.

1022
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:40,798
Those darn conglomerates.

1023
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:43,092
They always pass on their companies

1024
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:46,137
to their kids that they must think
they're the owners of the companies.

1025
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:49,015
But the owners of listed companies
are stockholders.

1026
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:52,018
The largest stockholder among all of them.

1027
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:11,454
My brother used to say it's more efficient

1028
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:13,790
to expand business
through mergers and acquisitions.

1029
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:18,085
But is it okay
to discuss this with me already?

1030
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:21,380
We could've talked about it even earlier.

1031
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,508
I guess the list

1032
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:24,884
will be exposed after all.

1033
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:28,346
Come in.

1034
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:38,356
You must be in the middle
of something important.

1035
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,234
I don't need to introduce myself, right?
We've met before.

1036
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,527
Of course, I know who you are.

1037
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,029
During the last stockholders' meeting,

1038
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:47,281
you made a scene,
mentioning the right to vote.

1039
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:48,991
You're our largest stockholder.

1040
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:51,285
Why do I feel like you're on guard?

1041
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,120
I'm clearly on your side.

1042
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:54,080
Well, I don't know.

1043
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,249
I don't want to be on the same side

1044
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:59,001
with someone who has a problem
with his character.

1045
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:00,837
I don't know if you've heard of the rumor

1046
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,297
that involves you and my married niece.

1047
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,383
It's so filthy that

1048
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:07,635
I can't bring myself to say it myself.

1049
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,679
Are you talking about an affair?

1050
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,935
A mergers and acquisitions
proposal for Hanju Hotel.

1051
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,728
Why are you discussing this with her?

1052
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:22,567
It's as if you know something has happened
to Chairman Kang Mi-na.

1053
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,612
Seung-wook, what are you talking about?

1054
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,072
Discussing a takeover

1055
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:30,366
with someone from Hanju
behind the head of Yumin.

1056
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,702
Isn't that also an affair
in the business world?

1057
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,163
Why don't you shelve the proposal

1058
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,624
before I make an issue of it
during the stockholders' meeting?

1059
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:42,503
I guess there's been a misunderstanding.

1060
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:44,380
Let's not talk about affairs anymore.

1061
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:46,549
Sure, if that's what you want.

1062
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:48,718
But you know this, right?

1063
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:52,096
The right to vote that you love so much
only applies during an election.

1064
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:55,266
In an election, if you lose
by just one percent, you lose everything.

1065
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:56,893
But not in a company.

1066
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:01,314
Whether we lose or not,
we won't lose our shares

1067
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:03,190
that take up 40 percent of all stocks.

1068
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,484
I'll keep that in mind.

1069
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:14,952
No matter how many times
you remove or add a name on that list,

1070
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,747
it's up to me to reveal it.

1071
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:21,375
But whether someone's name is on it or not
has nothing to do with you.

1072
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:25,838
You got your memory back,
so why are you so concerned about them?

1073
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:30,635
Is it because of that man, Han Seung-wook?

1074
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,930
Why are you suddenly so serious?

1075
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:37,600
He must know you got your memory back.

1076
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:41,270
Then does he know this too?

1077
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,190
About his father's case
that he brought to meâ€¦

1078
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,150
Does he know who's behind it?

1079
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:52,448
What do you know about it?

1080
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,662
I found out
while looking into it this time.

1081
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:00,915
I thought it wouldn't do any good
to talk about it

1082
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:02,917
when you couldn't remember.

1083
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:05,628
It doesn't matter to me

1084
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:08,047
who your parents are.

1085
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:11,384
But it's different with him.

1086
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:16,180
Does he know this too?

1087
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:20,601
I haven't gotten a chance to tell him.

1088
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:22,186
What's holding you back?

1089
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:24,730
Are you worried that he'd be hurt?

1090
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:26,816
Or is it because

1091
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:28,734
you're thinking of something else?

1092
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:43,541
WARDEN'S OFFICE

1093
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:09,400
The prosecutor who wanted to see me

1094
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:12,028
was you?

1095
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:32,757
EPILOGUE

1096
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:38,596
I can wash my hair, shave,
and eat with one hand,

1097
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:41,182
but it's hard to cut meat.

1098
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:43,517
If you have time,
drop by and cut it for me.

1099
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,978
But your doctor said your arm was fine.

1100
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:50,066
I think Mr. No heard wrong.

1101
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:51,776
Just cut it with scissors.

1102
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:58,491
Why do you want me there again?

1103
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:01,994
I can wash my hair, shave
and eat with one hand,

1104
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:04,747
but I can't open a juice bottle.

1105
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:07,249
Gosh, how come
there aren't any other bottles?

1106
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,461
Could you drop by and open them for me?

1107
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,297
Hello?

1108
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:19,428
It's impossible to drive a nail alone.
You must come over and help me.

1109
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:20,596
Don't you think?

1110
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:22,515
Gosh, you can do that sometime later.

1111
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,812
Later?

1112
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:29,897
Gosh, she's smart.

1113
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:49,125
Isn't it considered cheating
to get involved now?

1114
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,417
I didn't know there were such rules.

1115
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:54,755
I'm just waiting for the perfect timing
to catch all the bad guys at once.

1116
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:56,465
Don't just protect him.

1117
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:59,176
Keep an eye on him
so that he doesn't do anything stupid.

1118
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:03,305
So stop looking down on me
whenever you see me.

1119
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:06,725
That fool.
How dare she try to hold me back?

1120
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:08,769
It's because of Prosecutor Cho, isn't it?

1121
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:09,770
What's your relationship with her?

1122
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:13,065
And I'm the daughter of Kang Myung-guk,
the arsonist.
