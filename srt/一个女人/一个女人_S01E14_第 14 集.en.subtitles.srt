1
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:42,125
I used to run errands
for Chairman Han Young-sik.

2
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,127
When he forgot his stuff

3
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,921
in your grandfather's room,

4
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,590
I'd bring it to his office.

5
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:54,012
A pen, a wallet, things like that.

6
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,613
Oh, my.

7
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:25,919
I only found out later
that they had bugs on them.

8
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,965
I know for a fact

9
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:35,261
that Chairman Han Young-sik
wasn't at the factory

10
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,639
when your father passed away.

11
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:43,603
Director Han Sung-hye was.

12
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,370
Are you still busy?

13
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,206
You don't have to play
two roles anymore, do you?

14
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,625
Have we met?

15
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,128
That's funny.

16
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,423
I'll tell everyone what you've been up to.

17
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,384
That's what I want to say to you.

18
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,178
Have you completely lost your mind?

19
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,181
Have you already forgotten everything?

20
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:24,394
No, my mind has never been clearer.

21
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:29,983
Just what exactly did you do that night?

22
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,944
On your way out of the factory,

23
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,489
you hit my grandma with your car

24
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,490
and killed her.

25
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,210
It did feel like I had hit something.

26
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,005
It was a person, was it?

27
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,340
What?

28
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,433
You're so dead. I'll make you pay.

29
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,312
I can't wait to see

30
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:11,649
what one prosecutor can do
against a conglomerate.

31
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,612
I'll show you what one prosecutor can do

32
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,614
when she sets her mind to it.

33
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,532
Wait and see.

34
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,161
This can't be the only bad thing
you've done in your life.

35
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,999
Indiscriminately targeted investigations,
excessive investigations,

36
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:31,628
sting operations, searches and seizures,
publications of suspected crimes…

37
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,880
I'll stretch my authority as far as I can

38
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,883
to destroy you.

39
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,471
I understand why
the prosecution needs reform.

40
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,225
Do you even know what a conglomerate is?

41
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,603
I have never once lost
to lowlifes like you.

42
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,022
Because you only fight battles
that you'll win.

43
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,858
You don't even start
if you know that you'll lose the fight.

44
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:58,238
You see, I've done it all.

45
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,698
Even when everyone thinks I'll lose,

46
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,409
I keep at it until I win.

47
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,205
Go ahead
and do everything you can with money.

48
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,708
The law will be my weapon.

49
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,716
Why is it that lowlives
are always so aggressive?

50
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,344
Deprivation is a scary thing.

51
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,763
And you even lost
to one of those poor lowlifes.

52
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:29,185
The person your father chose
wasn't you, but me.

53
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,105
What?

54
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,696
Yes, that's what the law does.

55
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,366
When I try to slap you with my right hand,
the law is supposed to stop that hand.

56
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,827
In that case…

57
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:55,295
I can always slap you with my left hand.
That's the law you're talking about.

58
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,548
Hey, you--

59
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,800
Ms. Cho, calm down.
Don't lose your temper.

60
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,719
What do you mean? She just slapped me!

61
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,970
Hey, where are you going?

62
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,888
Gosh, I can't believe her!

63
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,683
Oh, my goodness.

64
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,560
I haven't been slapped in a while.

65
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,646
Oh, my gosh!

66
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,565
-Hey!
-Ms. Cho!

67
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,781
Just what exactly did you do that night?

68
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,329
-Father.
-On your way out of the factory,

69
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,955
you hit my grandma with your car

70
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:33,791
and killed her.

71
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,891
How's the search for Kang Mi-na going?

72
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,894
There hasn't been much progress.

73
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,732
Can't we just assume
that she's dead already?

74
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,739
CHAIRMAN HAN

75
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:55,998
HAN SUNG-HYE

76
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,674
What took you so long?

77
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:09,971
The person who was at the factory
that night wasn't Chairman Han,

78
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,180
but Han Sung-hye.

79
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,352
What is this reaction?

80
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,856
She's the one
who hit my grandma with her car!

81
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,650
I know.

82
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,116
Director Han Sung-hye was at the factory.

83
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,789
How did you know that she was there?

84
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,249
Well…

85
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,837
I was on my way home

86
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,922
after running an errand

87
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,382
for Chairman Han.

88
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,271
The car was scrapped the next day.

89
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,355
27B 3258

90
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,192
I was aware that the police
were investigating what happened,

91
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,111
but I kept my mouth shut.

92
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,364
And I was never asked
to run such errands anymore.

93
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:16,287
Chairman Han Young-sik
probably doesn't know

94
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,789
that I was aware of the bugging.

95
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,377
Is that why she said…

96
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,465
Ms. Han Sung-hye,

97
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,633
shall I talk about you too?

98
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,599
I wonder what else Ms. Kim knows.

99
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,394
I wouldn't be surprised if she knew
the secret of the Bermuda Triangle.

100
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,272
Did you find out anything
by spying on your chief?

101
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,191
I did, and it's huge.

102
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,694
Han Sung-hye is doomed now.

103
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,531
Regarding her attempted murder
of Kang Mi-na,

104
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,407
Mr. Jang will testify.

105
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,201
Regarding her murder of Lee Bong-sik,

106
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,287
Yu-jun is investigating
with the help of Samgeori Gang.

107
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,332
We can reveal all her crimes at once soon.

108
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:09,966
Hi, Yu-jun.

109
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,927
Yeon-ju, do you know
what happened to Chairman Han?

110
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,972
From his bribery of the commissioner
of the National Tax Service

111
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,598
to his tax evasion and embezzlement,

112
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,767
everything came out,
and he's been arrested.

113
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,271
I got a call asking for
information about Kang Mi-na.

114
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,022
What? Already?

115
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,360
Do you admit to the charges?

116
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,654
-Step back.
-Any comments?

117
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,906
-Chairman Han!
-Give us a comment!

118
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,325
-Any comments at all?
-Coming through!

119
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,827
Move out of the way!

120
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,870
-Is the press release true?
-Chairman Han!

121
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,497
Give us a comment!

122
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,422
Oh, hello.

123
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,509
I haven't seen you here in a while.

124
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,052
You called me many times.

125
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,472
I couldn't pick up because I was busy.

126
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,225
Who handed over the information
about my company?

127
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,811
The former head of the legal team?

128
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,147
I already had enough information.

129
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,065
Are you doing this

130
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,609
to take me down with you?

131
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,777
Why would I go down with you?

132
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,946
Hanju needs to save me.

133
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,699
Then the least you could do
is save me this trip!

134
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,660
Do you think I'd let you live
after what you've done?

135
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,706
Do you still have no idea
what the situation is like?

136
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,629
The one who has
the final say in my survival

137
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,923
has changed already.

138
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,399
I'm sorry. I lost track after they came
for the search and seizure.

139
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,902
But no one has contacted me
about your visit, Ms. Han.

140
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,364
It's fine. This is an emergency,

141
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,908
so I'll take care of the tasks

142
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,618
that my father needed to.

143
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,119
Yes, ma'am.

144
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,581
Did you give them all of his phones?

145
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,916
He has a number of them.

146
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,752
No, ma'am. I kept it on me.

147
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,754
What's the passcode?

148
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,341
I'll contact the chairman first
before I let you know.

149
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,097
You didn't know until just now,

150
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,475
but now you know.

151
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,977
I'm here on his behalf.

152
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,940
So where's your respect?

153
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,609
I'm sorry.

154
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,992
Please clean up this room first.

155
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,786
Yes, ma'am.

156
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,542
The prosecution issued a warrant
against Hanju's Han Young-sik

157
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,795
for evading tens of billions of taxes
and malpractice.

158
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,048
Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office
issued this

159
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,676
because there was a possibility
of destroying evidence and fleeing--

160
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,428
These villains are now

161
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:04,140
destroying each other's lives
and bringing justice.

162
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,976
So what happened?

163
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,521
That sly chief prosecutor
is on Director Han Sung-hye's side now.

164
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,858
He dropped this huge thing as bait.

165
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,860
And this is…

166
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,822
The CCTV footage from that night.

167
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,452
The first time he turned to me
for help 14 years ago…

168
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,328
It was about you.

169
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:31,083
Are you saying this evidence concerns me?

170
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,913
Are you all right?

171
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,085
I guess there's nothing much I can say.

172
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,800
But now that we have new evidence,

173
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,886
you can just apply for
the Seopyung case's retrial.

174
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,722
Once Yu-jun begins the investigation,

175
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,517
they won't be able to skip through
as they did back then.

176
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,144
That means everything is almost over.

177
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,023
Is it really?

178
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,736
I might as well slap all these jerks.

179
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,115
When I ran into Han Sung-hye,

180
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,200
I just wanted to slap her face.

181
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,411
I should have, but…

182
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,248
Thinking about her makes me angry again.

183
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:38,586
How many emotions do we have to repress

184
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,923
in order to win against
people of their kind?

185
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,010
It's just a thought I had.

186
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,639
I wonder.

187
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,017
At first,

188
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,896
I got into this thinking
I'll simply punish those criminals.

189
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,814
But when I got into that brawl

190
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,524
against Han Sung-hye in the office,

191
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,318
I suddenly had a reality check.

192
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,321
I won't go down to their level.

193
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,698
I'll make sure
they're punished by the law.

194
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:12,620
When everything is over,
will you go back to the US?

195
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,376
That's also not where I belong.

196
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,712
No matter where I live,

197
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,506
I won't sit there wondering

198
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,259
how our stock price will crash
whenever something happens.

199
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,512
I'm not going to live that life.

200
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,520
I may be stepping out of my line,

201
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,731
but I hope you'd do the same

202
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,399
for your sake.

203
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,577
Cheer up.

204
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,040
One second.

205
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,755
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

206
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,515
-That's refreshing, isn't it?
-It is.

207
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,517
Thanks.

208
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,900
They can't arrest
the head of a corporation like this.

209
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,610
This must be a political maneuver.

210
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,279
This is something I heard from my sibling.

211
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:33,951
There was a whistle-blower
who rat on him to the prosecution.

212
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,244
A whistle-blower?

213
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,416
There are a ton of enemies inside

214
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,292
that just came to my mind.

215
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,919
How would I know who it is?

216
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,089
Hey, what's happening at work?

217
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,800
Sung-hye is on duty,
taking care of everything on his behalf.

218
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,051
What about Sung-woon?

219
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,679
He should be glad
if he doesn't get in her way.

220
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,391
Sung-hye should be out there
trying to get him out

221
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,810
instead of doing his work for him.

222
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,187
He had more than a few prosecutors
he sponsored to this day,

223
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,023
but he got arrested helplessly like this.

224
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,899
It's as if she had been waiting--

225
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,363
Goodness, do you think
she had been waiting for this?

226
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,243
My head hurts. And I have no appetite.

227
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:22,416
So is there anything
that can appease my appetite?

228
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,835
You sound completely fine

229
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,880
as if you could
chew a stone down and be fine.

230
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,466
So why did you want porridge?

231
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,426
What?

232
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:36,597
Ms. Kim wanted to take the day off,
so we don't have anything here.

233
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,223
Mi-na also left home,

234
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,185
so we don't need to worry about
how word will get out.

235
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:44,021
We got our old helpers to come back,

236
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,689
so you can ask them for something

237
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,357
once they come to work tomorrow.

238
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,943
What's with you?

239
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,030
I'm tired of trying to humor everyone.

240
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,908
Instead of trying to read
what everyone is thinking,

241
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,036
I want to live my life
saying what I want to say.

242
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,798
Why is she acting like this too?

243
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,467
She won't humor her in-laws
who are powerless now.

244
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,721
If Sung-woon succeeds the group,
you might have a say or two in it,

245
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,307
but if Sung-hye gets it,
the story completely changes.

246
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:25,354
You're just an old woman in the back seat
who has a few shares in her pocket.

247
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,900
What? An old woman in the back…

248
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,244
Hey, good morning.

249
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,957
Why? What? Is something going on?

250
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,378
You should check
the personnel announcement.

251
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,889
PERSONNEL ANNOUNCEMENT

252
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,933
PROSECUTOR CHO YEON-JU
SUSPENSION: 2 MONTHS

253
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,393
Suspension?

254
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:11,900
Chief.

255
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,696
You can't suddenly suspend me.

256
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,782
Who's on the disciplinary committee
and when was it held?

257
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,075
And what's the reason?

258
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,494
Why are you making a scene here?

259
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,373
Oh, you haven't heard?

260
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,584
You were sued.

261
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,671
A prosecutor falsely assumed the identity
of the CEO of a corporation,

262
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,964
scamming people?

263
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,299
Are you out of your mind?

264
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,925
Sued?

265
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,553
Hanju sued me?

266
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,056
What kind of damage did I cause
by impersonating someone?

267
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,725
Who sued me?

268
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,113
The director of Yumin Foundation?

269
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,661
Even so,
it's not like the ruling was made.

270
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,122
You can't suspend me
as soon as I get sued.

271
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,291
It's the Discipline
of Public Prosecutors Act.

272
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,084
The ruling does not matter.

273
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:14,671
Any violation of decorum
or dereliction of duty…

274
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,091
Of course, I know that.
But the prosecution is famous

275
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,636
for going easy
on those within the organization.

276
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,554
Why did they have to suspend me?

277
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,765
Because you're not on our side right now.

278
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,726
And you think it'll end with a suspension?

279
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,103
They want to reevaluate
your qualifications.

280
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,731
You know you'll be fired
if you're deemed unfit for the job.

281
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,153
Whether you have a personal grudge or not,

282
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,988
you should've known your place.

283
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,659
Do you think a mere prosecutor
can win against a conglomerate?

284
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,328
You trust them too much.

285
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:51,166
Do you think a conglomerate
will look after a mere chief prosecutor?

286
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,960
Are you worried about me now?

287
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,420
Worry about yourself.

288
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,965
Don't worry about me.

289
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,050
They'll have no choice
but to take care of me.

290
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,635
Sure, fine.

291
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,721
Let them take great care of you.

292
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,685
CHIEF RYU SEUNG-DUK

293
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,688
Look at her thinking

294
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,816
she can afford to worry about someone else
when she's the one who's doomed.

295
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,492
Nice weather.
What a perfect day to listen to my clock.

296
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,083
Why is it…

297
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,184
Darn it.

298
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,771
Who did this?

299
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,442
Did someone sneak into my office?

300
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:09,703
The prosecutors in this country
sure work fast and efficiently.

301
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,122
They had me come in
for an interview right away.

302
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,380
I came here thinking
I'd let Ms. Han fool me one last time,

303
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,507
but I'm glad I listened to her.

304
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,140
How could you two look

305
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,267
so much alike?

306
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,936
Are you sure you're not related
to my brother whatsoever?

307
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:37,773
How dare you.

308
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,525
I can't believe you deceived everyone
in the financial world.

309
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,736
What did you do to my niece?

310
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,280
How did you get rid of her
without a single trace?

311
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:46,907
What?

312
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,284
It's true. You got rid of her.

313
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,204
Who else benefited from her going missing
other than you?

314
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,707
The prosecution's investigation
will reveal everything soon.

315
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,710
Gosh, whenever I think
about the humiliation…

316
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:03,423
-Get ready to be locked up behind bars.
-My gosh.

317
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:07,302
You believe I did something to your niece?

318
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,888
That's why I sued you.

319
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,432
Why would I put up with this humiliation

320
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,434
and sue you
if I were after some chump change?

321
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:24,945
CHO, A PROSECUTOR,
IMPERSONATED CHAIRMAN KANG MI-NA

322
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,532
The chief prosecutor called.

323
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:33,036
He says they can't arrest Cho Yeon-ju.
They'll investigate without detaining her.

324
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,037
That's it?

325
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,831
Yes, he didn't say anything else.

326
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,083
CHAIRMAN HAN YOUNG-SIK

327
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,169
Reporting everything
and trying to take credit…

328
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,462
He's a handful.

329
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,299
That day, 14 years ago…

330
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,970
He has some kind of evidence
regarding that incident.

331
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,223
What do you think it is?

332
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,184
Tell me.

333
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,396
What do you think
the chief prosecutor has?

334
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,815
Evidence…

335
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,527
Maybe it's security footage
from the factory.

336
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,281
At the time, there were
no security cameras in your office.

337
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,032
Maybe the one in the hallway?

338
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,659
Then we have a problem.

339
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,328
Sorry?

340
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,664
You.

341
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,333
What are you going to do?

342
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:25,422
When my uncle died, you got me out.

343
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,054
If you had taken him
to a hospital right away,

344
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,848
he'd still be alive, don't you think?

345
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:40,061
HANJU FASHION

346
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,528
Uncle.

347
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,907
I wish you had given us a heads-up.

348
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,744
If you ask the employees
for the ledger when I'm not here…

349
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,496
You said you'd practically been living

350
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,873
at the factory.

351
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,042
Where were you?

352
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,503
I need to get some rest here and there.

353
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,715
I rushed here
because I heard there was a problem

354
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,050
with the books.

355
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,553
But judging from your attitude,

356
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,223
I don't even need to go through this.

357
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,351
I'm taking this with me.

358
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,897
Uncle, let's talk.

359
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:28,443
You know, this won't do you any harm.

360
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,322
Are you trying to strike a deal with me?

361
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,659
No, it's not that.

362
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,994
Why did you touch the books?

363
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,373
If you can't do it alone,
there is Seung-wook.

364
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,833
You also have your brothers,
Sung-chan and Sung-woon.

365
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,174
Is that your plan?

366
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,843
Is that why you came all the way here

367
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:58,682
to find evidence to prove that
my first business is failing miserably,

368
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:00,600
raking in debts?

369
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,814
Now I'll fall out of favor with Grandpa,

370
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:09,276
you're probably thinking Seung-wook
will get everything if that happens.

371
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,568
Don't jump to conclusions.

372
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,572
He'll be more disappointed by the fact
that you're doing this

373
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,408
than hearing the company is in the red.

374
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,953
He put you in charge because
he trusted you. You can't do this to him.

375
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,872
Are you trying to threaten me
using Grandpa?

376
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,500
How dare you treat me like a blackmailer?

377
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,379
We're family. Why would I try
to attack you, using your weakness?

378
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:31,715
"Family"?

379
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,760
You're very naive.

380
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,721
You sure are Hanju's eldest

381
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,931
who doesn't have to
lift a finger for anything.

382
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,184
This conversation is pointless.

383
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,352
Wait.

384
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,271
Taking them like this

385
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,106
can get you into trouble.

386
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,607
Don't you know that?

387
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,323
Even if you take it from me,
you can't hide it forever.

388
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:00,660
Delaying it for a few days
won't change anything.

389
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,538
Let go!

390
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,206
Hand them over!

391
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,432
Uncle.

392
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,235
Uncle.

393
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,396
Hello?

394
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,231
Your uncle called out of the blue

395
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,191
and said he was visiting.

396
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:16,569
Is there a problem with the merger?

397
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:19,948
I'm not sure.

398
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:23,034
Find out. Seriously…

399
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,540
Once Hanju Fashion goes public
and completes the merger,

400
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:32,001
you'll rise to power within the family.

401
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,170
Then your uncle will no longer

402
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,089
be able to notify me like this.

403
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,843
Had I waited until your brothers
started behaving themselves,

404
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,053
I would've had to
put up with this forever.

405
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,432
I'm glad I listened to you
and put you in charge of Hanju Fashion.

406
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,935
Find out what's going on and call me.

407
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,354
Okay.

408
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,507
It's too late.

409
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,927
It was an accident. Just an accident.

410
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,890
He fell and hit his head
while trying to take the books from me.

411
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,641
Really?

412
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:33,188
It was just an accident.
Complicating things won't do us any good.

413
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,483
Think wisely.

414
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,068
If I'm not around,

415
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,237
no one in the family
will even care about you.

416
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,656
If anything bad happens to me,

417
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,241
you're doomed too.

418
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,836
I wasn't here.

419
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,047
My uncle did this to himself.

420
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,423
Just clean this up.

421
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,802
Then I'll bribe the police
and do whatever it takes

422
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,053
to get things sorted out.

423
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,096
You know what I mean, right?

424
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,893
I don't care

425
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,270
what happens to this darn factory.

426
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,688
Burn it down if you have to.

427
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,398
Do whatever it takes

428
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,360
to sort things out.

429
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,948
You should leave.

430
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,158
Go home.

431
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,059
If you had made a report back then,

432
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,187
my uncle could have lived.

433
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,401
If the chief reveals the CCTV footage,

434
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,778
I might get in a little trouble.

435
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,283
Then there will be no one
who can protect you.

436
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,786
Do-woo.

437
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,415
What do you think we should do?

438
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,760
PROSECUTOR IMPERSONATES CONGLOMERATE HEAD

439
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,056
"A prosecutor impersonated a chairman?"

440
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,516
"What did I just read?"

441
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,893
"She's a total crook."

442
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,060
A crook?

443
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,813
"I heard she was famous

444
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,649
for taking bribes."

445
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,318
"She must be obsessed with money."

446
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,112
"What a piece of s***."

447
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,281
"She's such a f****** b****."

448
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,908
Stop!

449
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,242
Are you saying that to me?

450
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:56,831
Next comment.

451
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,000
"Isn't her real name Kang Yeon-ju?"

452
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,170
"She looks just like a girl
I went to school with."

453
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,130
"Her dad is a hopeless thug

454
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,341
and went to prison…"

455
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,845
While I try to expose Han Sung-hye,

456
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,389
people are finding out
everything about me!

457
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,809
My personal information has been buried
for more than 10 years.

458
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,938
How did everyone dig it up within an hour?
How is that possible?

459
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,981
I'll take screenshots.

460
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,108
Do that. If anyone crosses the line,

461
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,276
I'll sue them later.

462
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,737
I hope you can do that.

463
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:31,157
-What do you mean?
-What I mean is,

464
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,951
considering your situation right now…

465
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,204
What if it's decided

466
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,664
that you can be arrested?

467
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,750
No way. The chief was just bluffing.

468
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,878
Why would they arrest me
when they know everything about me?

469
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,506
A suspension of two months would do it.

470
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,466
I'm a busy person.

471
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,011
This is just a minor misunderstanding.

472
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:52,971
It'll work out.

473
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,433
By the way, why did you do that?

474
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,228
You suffered from temporary amnesia,

475
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,605
so you could've left
as soon as your memory came back.

476
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,441
Why did you get dragged into all that?

477
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,620
CHAIRMAN HAN YOUNG-SIK

478
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,622
How far do you intend to go?

479
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,374
This is rude.

480
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,251
Do you think you can hide the truth?

481
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,336
I know everything.

482
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,296
The truth?

483
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,882
It's just what you want to believe.

484
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,677
Something you made up

485
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,805
to deny that your father died in vain.

486
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,226
How can you be so shameless?

487
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,522
Leave her alone and work it out with me.

488
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,941
There's no need
to get the foundation director involved.

489
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,278
She almost died
in the accident that you caused.

490
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:54,365
You must be mistaken.

491
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,701
Do you think you're safe?

492
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,245
What?

493
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,372
You'll be dragged into it anyway.

494
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,665
Also, about that accident,

495
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,251
is there evidence that I caused it?

496
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,383
Is there evidence?

497
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,302
Fine.

498
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,722
We'll talk again
when I bring you the evidence.

499
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,641
You still don't seem to understand.

500
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,101
Can't you see?

501
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,854
You and that crazy prosecutor

502
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,190
are doomed.

503
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,567
What?

504
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,034
Who would've thought you'd be questioned

505
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,786
regarding your impersonation case

506
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,830
before the retrial for the arson?

507
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:47,001
Using the fact
that I look like Kang Mi-na,

508
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,046
I teamed up with Han Seung-wook
who held a grudge against Hanju

509
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,048
after his father's death.

510
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:54,175
I hid away Kang Mi-na

511
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,385
and committed a breach of trust
and embezzlement.

512
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,972
And I came back to work
so I wouldn't get caught.

513
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,559
Why did they write this nonsense
at such great length?

514
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,311
Are those stupid prosecutors

515
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,730
really going to investigate me
based on this nonsense?

516
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,607
What else can they do

517
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,400
after their chief indicted you?

518
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,568
Gosh.

519
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,695
To prove your innocence,
you'll have to bring Kang Mi-na.

520
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:18,282
But since she hasn't been found yet,

521
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,369
it's highly likely
that she's already dead.

522
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:25,623
If the missing person case turns into

523
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,959
a murder case without a body…

524
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,627
No way.

525
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,753
Are you saying

526
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,297
I might become a murder suspect?

527
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,632
That's ridiculous!

528
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,968
It's Han Sung-hye
who tried to kill Kang Mi-na.

529
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:40,471
The driver who took orders from her
is with us, isn't he?

530
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,473
Well, the thing is…

531
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,437
What?

532
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,863
I'm sorry.
They said they were going for a walk.

533
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:03,870
The couple found dead this morning
turned out to have been involved in

534
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:07,290
Chairman Kang Mi-na's disappearance,
and the police are investigating.

535
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:10,960
The man turned out to have hit
Chairman Kang before she disappeared,

536
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,462
and they had been staying
at the vacation home of Han,

537
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,256
who is involved with Yumin Group.

538
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,467
It's still unclear
why the couple was staying

539
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,345
at Han's vacation home--

540
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,474
As you ordered,

541
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:28,436
I told the police that we would cooperate.

542
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,355
All the information
will be handed over when requested.

543
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,191
Hand everything over.

544
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,484
The old Hanju doesn't exist anymore.

545
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,541
Why didn't you tell me this sooner?

546
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,168
I've been busy all morning,

547
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,086
getting calls from here and there.

548
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,922
Where's Seung-wook now?

549
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,965
He went to the police station

550
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,300
for questioning.

551
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:03,471
He has a solid alibi.
He won't be suspected.

552
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,848
But the fact that

553
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,184
he's been giving Mr. Jang money

554
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,228
can be a problem.

555
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,022
That's because
Han Sung-hye wasn't looking after him.

556
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,607
It was out of sympathy.

557
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,526
Still, he gave him too much.

558
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,570
Worst case,

559
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,406
I'll make sure he can leave for the US.

560
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,076
What about the Seopyung Factory retrial?

561
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:28,454
As long as we have the flash drive,
there will be a retrial, right?

562
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,252
Hi, Yu-jun. What's the matter?

563
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,419
Hey.

564
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,380
Well…

565
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,008
It's about the Seopyung Factory fire.

566
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,053
The culprit turned himself in.

567
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:48,266
What? Who did what?

568
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,236
He submitted a written confession
to Seopyung DPO,

569
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:03,155
where the case was first investigated,
through his lawyer.

570
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,992
He's being brought in
by the investigators.

571
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,743
He'll be questioned as soon as he arrives.

572
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:15,293
SEOPYUNG DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

573
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,795
Director Han Sung-hye
was planning to reveal

574
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,965
President Han Kang-sik's accounting fraud,

575
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,467
and the two had an argument about it.

576
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,179
I heard them fight and went inside.

577
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,558
Ms. Han left the room first.

578
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,518
While trying to stop Mr. Han

579
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,061
from following her,

580
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,481
he bumped his head on the desk

581
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,191
and collapsed.

582
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,110
Did he die?

583
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,029
Pardon?

584
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:46,490
Did he die right after injuring his head?

585
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,579
I think so.

586
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,914
You didn't call emergency services

587
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,833
or try to save him?

588
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,252
No.

589
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,754
What about the fire?

590
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,049
Why did you start the fire?

591
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,618
I don't need this chump change.

592
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,788
In front of everyone,

593
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,623
I'll set fire to it!

594
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,379
Good grief.

595
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,218
What is it?

596
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,308
Darn it.

597
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,061
Gosh.

598
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,149
Darn it.

599
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,318
I can't believe that old woman.

600
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,154
How is she going to get here
at this hour anyway?

601
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,801
-Fire!
-Run!

602
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,098
-You need to leave!
-Run!

603
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,496
Back then, as I tried to run,

604
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,623
I saw someone
trying to set the place on fire.

605
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,418
I thought I could just blame it on him.

606
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,963
You weren't planning on
setting the place on fire,

607
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,424
but when you saw someone trying to do it,

608
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,884
you thought of arson.

609
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,303
Then you demanded that people give

610
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,430
false testimonies too?

611
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,723
Yes.

612
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,977
Where was Director Han at that time?

613
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,230
She walked out,

614
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,482
then grabbed a cab out on the street.

615
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,900
She left her car behind?

616
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,277
Yes.

617
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,696
Back then, she wasn't good at driving.

618
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,199
She was reluctant to drive at night
along the country road.

619
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:18,244
Then Mr. Jung, you took the car,
drove it back to Seoul,

620
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,247
then you even got into
a hit-and-run accident?

621
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,624
That's right.

622
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,209
Has Director Han Sung-hye

623
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,545
been hiding everything for your sake?

624
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,588
I asked her for help.

625
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,551
She must have thought
everything happened because of her.

626
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,011
He was already dead,

627
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,514
so she wanted to bury everything.

628
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,766
That's why

629
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,269
I burned the books too.

630
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,355
Mr. Jung.

631
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:51,026
Are you telling me to believe this?

632
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,349
Can't you see?

633
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,184
You and that crazy prosecutor

634
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,562
are doomed.

635
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,947
THE PROSECUTOR WHO PLAYED THE RICH HEIRESS
IS UP FOR PROSECUTION INVESTIGATION

636
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,587
THE CON GAME OF THE CENTURY,
WHERE'S THE REAL KANG MI-NA?

637
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,882
WAS YUMIN HOTEL A SECRET HIDEOUT
WITH HER COUSIN-IN-LAW?

638
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,158
She's here. Over there.

639
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,410
-Prosecutor Cho!
-Where's Kang Mi-na?

640
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,580
Move aside. I have nothing to do
with Ms. Kang's disappearance.

641
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,416
Rumors say you're involved in
numerous corruptions. Is it true?

642
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,793
That's…

643
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:33,337
Why do you look so similar
to the real Ms. Kang Mi-na?

644
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,755
Ms. Kang was born out of wedlock.

645
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,715
Do you also carry
a secret behind your birth?

646
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,717
-Say something!
-Where's Kang Mi-na?

647
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,886
-Ask me a better question.
-Why is Kang Mi-na gone?

648
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:43,347
-That's enough.
-You also went out with Ms. Kang, right?

649
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,392
What's your relationship
with Prosecutor Cho?

650
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,268
Is Ms. Kang your ideal type?

651
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,771
Let's just go inside, okay?

652
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,564
Yeon-ju.

653
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:55,359
-Say something!
-Where's Kang Mi-na?

654
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,738
Do you think the shareholders
will acknowledge you as the chairwoman

655
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,323
when you took it by betraying me?

656
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,492
How's the food here?

657
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,661
I hope it's edible.

658
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:09,665
I know you much better
than you think I do.

659
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:13,585
You don't have enough caliber
to lead Hanju.

660
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,714
Only if Sung-chan were with us,

661
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,300
you wouldn't have gotten this far.

662
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:23,429
It's starting to get colder.

663
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,848
And you get cold easily.

664
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,182
I'm worried about you.

665
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,478
Don't you dare dream
that this is how I'll go down.

666
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,945
Do you still think you can do something?

667
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,073
The only thing you can do is

668
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,491
ponder about what you'll do

669
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,243
for the rest of your time

670
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,787
here in the detention center.

671
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,298
That wicked brat.

672
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,303
CHIEF RYU SEUNG-DUK

673
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,144
Cho Yeon-ju goes in.

674
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,442
Han Sung-hye goes in.

675
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,281
I go in.

676
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:27,826
Han Sung-hye comes out.

677
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,164
I come out.

678
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,839
Cho Yeon-ju?

679
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,101
It's almost impossible

680
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:56,021
for someone who's alive
to suddenly disappear like this.

681
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,898
It doesn't make any sense

682
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,191
that it's impossible

683
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:00,943
for people with this much money

684
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,779
to find just a single person.

685
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:07,533
In this case,
there are a few possibilities.

686
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:10,202
I'm a little suspicious of the chance

687
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,286
that they aren't doing

688
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,621
their best to look for her.

689
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,623
She makes it sound so easy.

690
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:17,626
Have they ever tried to look for someone
before they say that?

691
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:18,585
But you know,

692
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,337
I found it trustworhty too

693
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,381
when it comes from Unanswered Questions.

694
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,007
When someone suddenly goes missing…

695
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,176
A corporation this big can't…

696
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,637
You two are still watching TV?

697
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,472
What did you get?

698
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:34,142
Before you left, we were watching
the doppelganger special

699
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,727
on Curious Stories Y.

700
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:39,106
-We're now watching Unanswered Questions.
-Goodness.

701
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,899
You just have me get you food.

702
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,734
Will you continue to sit around like this?

703
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,152
What more can we do?

704
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,906
We can't leave because of those reporters,
and you won't let me order delivery food.

705
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,075
That's because you order too much food.

706
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:53,328
He banned it because they might think
there are a few more people here.

707
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,038
I didn't order that much food.

708
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,915
Will you two give up this easily?

709
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:00,669
I'm a suspended corrupt prosecutor
who used to be in a gang.

710
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:02,921
Mr. Han Seung-wook is a Korean-American.

711
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,715
You're a double agent

712
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,758
who fled from Hanju
at the most perfect timing.

713
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,468
What more can we do?

714
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,972
But there are a few people
who are on your side.

715
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,808
There are a few people on the web
who are on your side.

716
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,477
And those few people on the web are

717
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,479
all me.

718
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,814
You did that all by yourself?

719
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:23,066
What more can we do
while we're stuck in here?

720
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,651
We go around writing comments online.

721
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,114
What's this?

722
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:31,825
It's for you, Seung-wook.

723
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:35,704
TO HAN SEUNG-WOOK

724
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,467
HANJU CHEMICALS THALLIUM THEFT CASE

725
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,635
CASE FILE, SUSPECT JUNG SANG-HO

726
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,470
HANDO BANK, ACCOUNT HOLDER, HAN SUNG-HYE

727
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,181
What's this?

728
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,558
"Hanju Chemicals Thallium Theft Case?"

729
00:48:57,934 --> 00:48:59,227
Something like this happened?

730
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,937
Thallium was found in the syringe

731
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,439
that Jang Seok-ho had.

732
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:03,774
Goodness.

733
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:08,236
AMOUNT TRANSFERRED, JUNG DO-WOO

734
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,821
What is this?

735
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,990
Han Sung-hye and Jung Do-woo.

736
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,117
These are transaction records
between them.

737
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:17,204
That much every month? That's a lot.

738
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,998
There's definitely
something going on between them.

739
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:21,625
HANJU FASHION INC

740
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,627
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

741
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,754
-This is…
-What is it?

742
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,340
This is Hanju Fashion's accounting report

743
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,217
from 14 years ago.

744
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:33,261
These are classified documents.
Even I have never seen this before.

745
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:38,141
But who sent you this?

746
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:42,646
Well… Where did you get this?

747
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,147
It was in the mailbox.

748
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,610
It's sent from a post office
in Seongbuk-dong.

749
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,864
Maybe we should go there and find out.

750
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:58,370
How about jokbaengi for dinner?

751
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,455
We'll order in.

752
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:03,333
You want to eat again?

753
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,504
-He's coming out.
-There he is.

754
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,339
Does she order jokbaengi often?

755
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,299
-A word, please.
-Who came out to get it?

756
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,509
Did you see anything?

757
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:13,844
What exactly did she order?

758
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:17,139
-Another one!
-My gosh!

759
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,350
-Just a moment!
-Did you watch the news?

760
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,394
-Just a comment.
-What did she order?

761
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,771
-Did she order beer or soju?
-Did you see anything?

762
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,905
We have breaking news

763
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,157
about Prosecutor Cho Yeon-ju

764
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,825
ordering jokbaengi.

765
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:39,911
Do you think it has any significance?

766
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,455
Yes, it does.

767
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,081
Jokbaengi is a combination

768
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,791
of jokbal, pig's trotters,

769
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,752
and golbaengi, seasoned whelks.

770
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:49,421
The fact that she ordered
this specific dish

771
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:54,050
shows us her emotional state.

772
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:57,304
In other words, she feels guilty

773
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,348
about impersonating a conglomerate head

774
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,725
when she's a prosecutor.

775
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:04,478
Then for her next meal,
she might order jjamjjamyeon.

776
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,520
If she were to order fried chicken,

777
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:06,480
she might order half and half.

778
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:10,484
Would that be your prediction?

779
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:13,028
The most important thing here is that

780
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,446
we've confirmed

781
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:17,199
that she ordered jokbaengi.

782
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:18,784
Based on that…

783
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,911
I'll personally compensate you

784
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,662
for the calls that you missed today.

785
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,415
So have some of this.

786
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:26,958
Take your time.

787
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,628
She ordered jokbaengi without booze?

788
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:30,921
IT'S SUSPICIOUS SHE DIDN'T ORDER ALCOHOL

789
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:33,924
It's very suspicious.

790
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:37,093
-Should I go pick up some beer for you?
-According to the people

791
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,553
around Prosecutor Cho Yeon-ju…

792
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,514
SEONGBUK

793
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,641
So it was just dropped off
into this post box.

794
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,852
I don't see any security cameras around.

795
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:49,231
You're right. There's a lot
of foot traffic in this area.

796
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:51,983
I have no idea who sent it,

797
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,486
?

798
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:55,737
No, we need more evidence.

799
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,448
Nothing we have at the moment
is solid enough.

800
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,575
You think so?

801
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:05,163
JOKBAENGI

802
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,250
Back in school, I struggled the most

803
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,752
with multiple-choice questions

804
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,796
with more than one answer.

805
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,589
"Select all of the correct answers."

806
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,300
It was so hard
because there was more than one answer.

807
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,302
What are you trying to say?

808
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,596
Maybe we're struggling now because

809
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,640
we're given too many answers
to choose from.

810
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:27,310
So, maybe we should go after
the most important answer.

811
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,479
Let's find Kang Mi-na.

812
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:34,442
And that said, what was she like?

813
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,444
You already know a lot about her.

814
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,780
No. I'm not asking you
about her history or her past.

815
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,615
They say there's a big difference

816
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:43,577
between knowing some things about someone
and really knowing that person.

817
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:47,247
Not things like how unhappy she was
and that she went through a lot.

818
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:51,585
What was she really like as a person?

819
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:55,297
You're no different from me.

820
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,258
You wouldn't have chosen me
had I not been a son of the Hanju family.

821
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:03,096
I assumed they had put
some airhead in charge.

822
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:04,431
I went to see her.

823
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,726
And I happened to meet

824
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,353
a con artist here.

825
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:12,981
But that was not the case.

826
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:15,191
She offered me a deal.

827
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:20,614
Was she a good or bad person?

828
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,492
What would she have done
in a situation like this?

829
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,464
What is this?

830
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,883
What are you doing here?

831
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:40,926
What's the problem?

832
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,844
Your father is locked up
in a detention center,

833
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,180
and both of my daughters-in-law
have moved out.

834
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:46,890
It's just the three of us now.

835
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,060
At this rate,
we'll just get a few useless shares.

836
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:53,146
We'll have to beg Sung-hye for money
for the rest of our lives.

837
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:56,107
Honestly, that wouldn't be
so bad in my opinion.

838
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,193
Be quiet!

839
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:01,905
Come downstairs at once.

840
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,034
Darn it.

841
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:10,747
All right. First,
let's talk about the real Kang Mi-na.

842
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:14,125
You're doomed without her.

843
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:18,213
Do you think she's dead?

844
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:22,509
Did the imposter who was here

845
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,511
really kill her?

846
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,097
You see, about the fake Kang Mi-na.

847
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,599
I really don't think she's capable

848
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,017
of killing a person.

849
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,395
When it comes to women,
my hunches are always right.

850
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,230
That's nothing to be proud of.

851
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,357
You tell us.

852
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,069
You do nothing
but watch and analyze people all day.

853
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,738
Had I been in Mi-na's situation,

854
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,324
I would've desperately waited
for a chance to run away.

855
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,826
Maybe her family's hiding her.

856
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:52,914
But her immediate family died
on the same day,

857
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,416
so we have no one to ask.

858
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,710
There's something you're forgetting here.

859
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,671
The fact that her family

860
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:02,382
wouldn't even have listened to her
no matter what she said.

861
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,885
You have no idea how awful and sad it is

862
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:08,054
to be in that position.

863
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:11,266
Why weren't you nice to her
if you could empathize with her?

864
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:12,767
Why were you so mean to her?

865
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,352
I couldn't even say anything

866
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,645
in front of your grandma.

867
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:18,189
But she never listened to me
even when I lashed out at her,

868
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,149
so I resented her.

869
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:23,820
Every time I saw her, I thought,
"I should've been like that too."

870
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,196
You're so twisted.

871
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,907
Okay. Then let's say
her family is not involved.

872
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:33,121
But she can't run away
and hide like this without help.

873
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:35,874
I had made her cut all ties
with her friends.

874
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,419
Who did she meet or spend time with?

875
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:42,088
The people she met
while volunteering at the penitentiary

876
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,715
and the art dealers.

877
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,676
Mom, maybe we'll really end up

878
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,094
finding her ourselves.

879
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,804
Hey.

880
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,347
Your future depends on this.

881
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:54,309
Your wife is the chairman of Yumin Group.

882
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,853
Stop talking nonsense

883
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:59,022
and try to use your brain for once.

884
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,732
Okay, I will.

885
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,799
I was surprised when you called me.

886
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,967
Since coming here,

887
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,095
I've had the chance to gather my thoughts.

888
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,767
In the small drawer in my study,

889
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:39,521
you'll find my old pen.

890
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:44,567
I need you to bring it to me.

891
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,027
Don't tell anyone.

892
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,213
What would you like for dinner, ma'am?

893
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,633
I'll just have a glass of whisky here.

894
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,051
I'll get it ready, ma'am.

895
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,725
Before I moved to the US,

896
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,894
I had asked Mi-na

897
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,438
to leave with me.

898
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,524
I thought we were in the same boat.

899
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,985
Although that was
arrogant of me, in hindsight.

900
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,738
But she said no.

901
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,658
Mi-na chose Hanju over me,

902
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:34,826
of her own accord.

903
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,328
That's why I was so hurt.

904
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:42,667
But come to think of it,

905
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,752
I don't think she wanted to lose to anyone

906
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,881
although she never showed it.

907
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,383
What would she be up to now

908
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,843
if that's what she was like?

909
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:55,805
She had been gathering dirt on her family
to escape from Hanju,

910
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,683
and cut a deal with the con man,
Lee Bong-sik, to flee the country.

911
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,393
She's obviously very brave.

912
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,520
And she's the rightful heir
of Yumin Group,

913
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,939
so it's strange
that she's not coming back.

914
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,150
Hiding a dead body

915
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,860
is harder than you think.

916
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,821
We think we haven't found her yet,

917
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,699
but I wonder why she hasn't shown up yet.

918
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,244
If she is not dead

919
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,955
or suffering from amnesia…

920
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:30,340
Have a seat. Drink with me.

921
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:41,559
You only brought the nuts I like.

922
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,394
How thoughtful.

923
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:45,647
Thank you.

924
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,691
Are you really just thoughtful?

925
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:51,152
Pardon?

926
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,697
I just don't understand.

927
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,408
What do you mean?

928
00:58:57,492 --> 00:59:00,662
What do you think of the paternity test?

929
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,916
I think they tampered with the results.

930
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:14,050
If paternity was proven, it means
Kang Mi-na's DNA samples were used.

931
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,011
That changed my perspective.

932
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:20,598
Instead of looking for someone
who tampered with the results,

933
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:24,644
I need to look for someone
who has Kang Mi-na's samples.

934
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,188
Who could that be?

935
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:38,491
It's from the director
of Yumin Foundation.

936
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,660
DIRECTOR HAN SUNG-HYE

937
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:43,371
Give these to Mr. Jung outside.

938
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,667
RETURN BAG, KANG MI-NA

939
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:51,337
Yes, ma'am.

940
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:01,014
Someone who had to run away

941
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,057
because she knew Han Sung-hye's weakness.

942
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:07,103
Someone who isn't safe
as long as Han Sung-hye exists.

943
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,732
Someone who could
tamper with the test results

944
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,443
using Kang Mi-na's samples.

945
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:16,362
Kang Mi-na herself?

946
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:19,073
She's near Han Sung-hye.

947
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:20,867
Is there anyone

948
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,201
who showed up near her

949
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,661
right after the accident?

950
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,501
That was close.

951
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,670
I almost fell for it.

952
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:49,020
Anyone who sees that door
for the first time tries to push it.

953
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:52,482
But you knew exactly how to open it.

954
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:10,541
While trying to hide it,
you made it more obvious.

955
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:22,053
There must have been a misunderstanding.

956
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:24,138
Then eat them.

957
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:28,476
Eat the nuts.

958
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:11,310
Gosh, this is boring. Should we stop here?

959
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:16,023
I ran another paternity test
with your hair.

960
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:19,902
Did you come back here to take revenge?

961
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,365
Do you still think I'm a bad person?

962
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:27,910
Who's the one that's been
fooling me all this time?

963
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,184
She left just now.

964
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:53,728
Get her.

965
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:12,830
Where do you think you're going?

966
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:16,334
What's wrong?

967
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:17,794
Are you all right?

968
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:20,922
What are you waiting for? Help her up.

969
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,508
Is everything okay?

970
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:35,269
Run, now!

971
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:38,689
Get her!

972
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:51,619
They must look down on us now.

973
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:54,997
That's understandable
after we got beaten to a pulp.

974
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:58,960
Did Boss really say
we can do whatever we want with them?

975
01:03:59,043 --> 01:03:59,919
He did.

976
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:02,088
-They're dead meat.
-Let's go!

977
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,214
Stop!

978
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:05,424
Get her!

979
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:28,823
Why you little…

980
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:32,493
HANJU

981
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:57,351
This pathetic life is over now.

982
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,980
I just need a face
that looks completely different.

983
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:05,776
So different that no one can recognize it.

984
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:04,502
Get in, Ms. Kang Mi-na.

985
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:21,519
HAN SUNG-HYE

986
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,191
EPILOGUE

987
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:35,032
If I had known you were suspicious

988
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,617
about the factory fire,

989
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:39,453
I would've told you about Sung-hye sooner.

990
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,415
I'm sorry it took me so long.

991
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:48,754
As you probably know,

992
01:06:50,214 --> 01:06:51,882
it seems like Sung-hye was

993
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:54,385
planning to reveal
your father's accounting fraud.

994
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:56,053
Think about all the kindness

995
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:59,432
my father has shown
to Hanju Fashion and Sung-hye.

996
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:03,352
I was told there was something suspicious
about your alibi.

997
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:06,188
Do you have proof
that I was there that day?

998
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:07,773
Can you leave?

999
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,402
Must you be this disrespectful
to my father on a day like this?

1000
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,830
One word from you, Uncle,

1001
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:24,206
and it'll be over.

1002
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:27,001
You can save my mom's entire family.

1003
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:29,295
I will now take responsibility
for everything

1004
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,213
that is related to Chairman Han Kang-sik.

1005
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:33,674
What really reminds me of that time

1006
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,009
is the fact that the owner

1007
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:36,302
has something to hide.

1008
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,603
Even with his relationship

1009
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:47,938
with Chairman Han deteriorating,

1010
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:50,858
the person your father
worried about the most was

1011
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,319
you.

1012
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:56,864
He was afraid

1013
01:07:57,364 --> 01:08:02,036
that you would turn into someone
who worries about the stock prices first

1014
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,831
whenever something happens.

1015
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:12,797
When I heard you'd come back from the US,

1016
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:15,925
I thought a lot about your father,

1017
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,178
and that's what made me worried.

1018
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:33,150
Dad.

1019
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:36,779
I miss you.

1020
01:09:19,363 --> 01:09:23,075
There is something
no one knows about Han Sung-hye.

1021
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,828
Sung-hye is the only one who doesn't know,
but I'm holding her by the leash.

1022
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:28,914
So I got fired as a prosecutor?

1023
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,499
If you wanted a better life,

1024
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,126
why didn't you find
a rich family to depend on?

1025
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:35,129
Your dad has something
he can attack you with.

1026
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:37,131
I don't think he's saying that
just to scare you.

1027
01:09:37,214 --> 01:09:38,757
Get me connected to Lawyer No Hak-tae.

1028
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,593
When things go well
for those who are wicked,

1029
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:43,179
they tend to take things overboard.

1030
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:44,889
They either realized later on
that they had been duped

1031
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:45,848
or became bitter later on.

1032
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:48,142
That was when they came forward.

1033
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:50,978
Let's just do what we can.
