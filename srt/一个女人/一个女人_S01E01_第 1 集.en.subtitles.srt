00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,834
SAMGEORI NIGHTCLUB

2
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,267
Prosecutors and gangsters.

3
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,895
Do you know what they have in common?

4
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,384
This is our turf.

5
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,887
No matter what happens in here,

6
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,514
no one outside can find out.

7
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:42,894
One. They have their turf.

8
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,523
Which means…

9
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,278
you can relax now.

10
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,282
I hope the investigators didn't cause you
too much trouble.

11
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:00,328
Things weren't this bad
when Lee Bong-sik-gate broke out.

12
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,372
There are fewer and fewer prosecutors

13
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,124
I can easily talk to.

14
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,168
Don't worry. It'll be no problem
as long as we don't indict.

15
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,421
And it's not like anyone else
has the power to indict.

16
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,175
Two.

17
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,010
We're not the only ones using weapons.

18
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,805
They have their own weapons too.

19
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,516
Come on.

20
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,727
There's no proof you gave
those paintings as bribes.

21
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,104
What can they do?

22
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,439
Anyway, since Lee Bong-sik took off,

23
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,442
the list of people you bribed
will never surface.

24
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,402
Rest assured.

25
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,488
We'll trust you this time too.

26
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,449
Goodness, I'm a nobody.

27
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,702
These days, people say

28
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:45,206
the prosecution is only a department
of the Ministry of Justice.

29
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:50,795
There aren't many things
you can achieve on your own.

30
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,547
Even if you get someone's help,

31
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,216
it's your achievement too.

32
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,305
Let's see here.

33
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,099
I'm being summoned.

34
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,101
If you'll excuse me.

35
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:08,062
Once the prosecutor in charge is replaced,
it'll be fine.

36
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,814
Prosecutor General. Hello, sir.

37
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,857
Yes.

38
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,653
Three. They're nothing in reality,

39
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,949
but they put on airs.

40
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,372
In other words, our only difference
is that their gang is legal

41
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,290
while ours...

42
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,960
is illegal.

43
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,672
Do you see what I'm getting at?

44
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,425
I'm not sure.

45
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,346
I'm telling you not to get nervous
in front of prosecutors.

46
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,766
Since I served time
in the juvenile detention center at 14,

47
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,227
I get anxious whenever
I pass by a government office.

48
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,979
How can I possibly file a suit
at the prosecutors' office?

49
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,232
Then do you want to get punished

50
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,275
along with Samgeori Gang
for using weapons again?

51
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,403
Times have changed.

52
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,907
I'm 100 percent sure Samgeori Gang,
those lowlifes, hire minors

53
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,992
and evade taxes at their nightclub.

54
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,246
I bet they broke the Food Sanitation Act
at the very least.

55
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,039
Just find the proof and submit it.

56
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,583
Leave the rest to the government.

57
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,254
Regarding the Food Sanitation Act,
we're not innocent either.

58
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,255
Come on.

59
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,424
This brings us back to my point.

60
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,969
You have to be confident
even in front of a prosecutor.

61
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,053
Then what do you need?

62
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,516
Courage?

63
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,984
All the smart ones
must have left the gang for college.

64
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,157
Only the prosecution
has the power to indict.

65
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,452
Once you win the prosecution over,
your crimes won't mean anything.

66
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,371
And who can win them over and how?

67
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,292
I was going to give it to you later.

68
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,044
You didn't have to ask for it so directly.

69
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,504
Well…

70
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,715
You knew?

71
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,468
I almost got the wrong idea.
What took you so long?

72
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,930
Good. This will make things
so much easier for everyone.

73
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,352
Asking the prosecutors for favors
isn't an easy job to do, you know?

74
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,396
Do you know how stressful it can get?

75
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,485
Move!

76
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:26,951
Scumbags!

77
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,538
Boss, Samgeori Gang
showed up with weapons.

78
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:34,167
What? Those punks made the first move?

79
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,211
You should leave.

80
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,633
-You punks!
-Get lost!

81
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,929
Darn it.

82
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,599
Do you guys still fight over nightclubs?

83
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,560
Times have changed.
How can you still be the same?

84
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,062
What did this bitch just say?

85
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,648
Calling me bitch,
you obviously don't know who I am.

86
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,859
You idiot.

87
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,652
She's the heiress
to Seopyung Nammoon Gang.

88
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,197
Come on. That's all in the past now.

89
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,742
Are you high or something?

90
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,411
Sweetie, will you tell me who you are?

91
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,667
Let go. Please.

92
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,336
That hurts!

93
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,424
Get her!

94
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,468
Guys, get her!

95
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,400
No!

96
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,444
Hey!

97
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,687
-Hey.
-Oh, my gosh.

98
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,565
What are you doing here from Seopyung?

99
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,066
Were you in Seopyung yesterday?

100
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,695
I guess so. You smell like pain patches.

101
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,405
Why would I go all the way there?

102
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,451
The Samgeori Gang tried to take
on the World Cup Gang last night,

103
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,036
but someone suppressed them
and disappeared,

104
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,122
so they ended up just wasting their time.

105
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,291
The war between criminals is something

106
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,793
we prosecutors must work on
for the rest of our lives.

107
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,086
My informant saw you.

108
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,214
The guy in the yellow tracksuit, right?
I could tell…

109
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,222
Are you still taking bribes from thugs
as you did in Seopyung?

110
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,101
We've been in conflict with the police
over organized crime recently.

111
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,812
If you'd been caught there
during a police raid,

112
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,814
you would've been in real trouble.

113
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,274
I got it, Yu-jun.

114
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:06,152
I'll do my best so that you can catch me.

115
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,654
By the way, your suit looks good.

116
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,822
That's not what I mean.

117
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,159
What happened to you?

118
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:17,663
You weren't like this at the Institute
or during your first appointment.

119
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,291
You talk as if you know me well.

120
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:23,711
But that closeness
may just be all in your head.

121
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,171
Is it?

122
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,298
Do I not know you?

123
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,592
I can see the wheels turning in your head.

124
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:33,554
Which deputy chief will be the next
chief prosecutor? Division Two or Three?

125
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,182
Which one should you kiss up to? That's…

126
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,060
Hey.

127
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,395
Give me that. I'll take it.

128
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,064
Thanks.

129
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,486
-Good morning.
-Hi. Morning.

130
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,780
Why do I smell pain patches?

131
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:54,492
My gosh. Were you working
all night again last night?

132
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,786
My neck hurt from reading
too many transcripts.

133
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,456
You're the ace of Division Three.

134
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,417
See that? This is how Division Three is.

135
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,671
It's rare to find someone
who pulls all-nighters like this.

136
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,131
I don't compare to you though,
Deputy Chief.

137
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,176
The prosecutor with stamina,
the prosecutor with two hearts,

138
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,177
Ryu Seung-duk.

139
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:18,140
I cut out that newspaper article
and carry it with me at all times.

140
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,433
PROSECUTOR WITH TWO HEARTS

141
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,020
Two hearts?

142
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,691
From Lee Bong-sik-gate, right?

143
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,402
The huge scandal that Ryu Seung-duk,

144
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,820
our dear prosecutor,

145
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,947
missed immediately before we arrested him?

146
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,492
What use is having two hearts?

147
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,494
You need to catch one criminal.

148
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,788
You can't focus when it counts

149
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,165
and miss the criminal
right before their arrest

150
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,710
because you stay up all night
for no reason.

151
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,045
-Am I wrong?
-Sorry?

152
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,046
Well…

153
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,049
It's fine. Speak freely.

154
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,093
Well…

155
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,012
Don't mind him. Speak freely.

156
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,638
Were you efficient

157
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,557
after staying up all night?

158
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,935
I didn't stay up all night.

159
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,687
You didn't?

160
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,690
-I can't say I didn't.
-That means you did.

161
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:09,859
It's not certain.

162
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,237
If it's not certain,
does it mean you didn't?

163
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,115
I can't say it is not true that I didn't.

164
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,326
Anyway,

165
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,579
it was efficient.

166
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,582
-Exactly.
-Yes.

167
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,000
Right?

168
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,377
Go up, sir. Okay.

169
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,882
I didn't upset either of them.

170
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,425
It was a wise conclusion.

171
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,431
I see you asked me
to help with the Lee Bong-sik-gate

172
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,933
so you could become
one of Deputy Chief Ryu's people.

173
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,185
Did you find something?

174
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,811
That's why you're here.

175
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,816
Don't be clueless and talk about it here,
you adorable punk.

176
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,444
That's pricey,
so let's talk in private, okay?

177
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,321
I'll call you, so go. Later.

178
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,119
She is one of a kind.

179
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,621
No one can come close.

180
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:08,501
There could be only one person like her
in the entire world.

181
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,426
I said to come down a while ago.
What took you so long?

182
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,556
You saw the tabloids, right?

183
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,476
Don't you even apologize anymore?

184
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,186
Hey. My son wouldn't have strayed

185
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,689
and gotten involved
in strange rumors if not for you.

186
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,233
How could he have
dirty rumors like this circulating

187
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,735
when his father is being interrogated
for the company?

188
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,696
Are you even sorry?

189
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,450
Answer me.

190
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,411
Are you ignoring me?

191
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:29,999
Mom.

192
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,168
Give it a rest.

193
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,044
The workers are watching.

194
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,131
They have no business
coming into the living room.

195
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,717
I warned you.

196
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,930
I'll let you eat and sleep here for free,
but don't try to have pride.

197
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,309
You're a concubine's daughter,
so act like it.

198
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:51,896
Go upstairs.

199
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:04,325
-Why are you home so early?
-I just got home after an all-nighter.

200
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,495
I'm the one fixing the tabloid issue
but I'm keeping quiet.

201
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:11,123
Why are you harassing Mi-na,
not Sung-woon, about his scandal?

202
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,376
What if she gets ideas because of it?

203
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,838
She may end up suing us
if we don't stifle her now.

204
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:22,051
Stop acting nice. All people are the same.

205
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,595
If you don't stomp on them,
they'll climb all over you.

206
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,767
DEPUTY CHIEF PROSECUTOR, RYU SEUNG-DUK

207
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,187
You wanted to see me, sir?

208
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,606
Hey. Do you do stocks?

209
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,484
You know the CEO of Golden Circle.

210
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,152
He came in for embezzlement.

211
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,781
Hey, old man. This is prime intel.

212
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,158
If I get this for you,
you'll let me go, right?

213
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,619
I told you. Don't worry.

214
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,497
It's hard for me to wipe
financial crimes clean.

215
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,582
It's too complicated,
even for the reporters.

216
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,834
It's not like it'll be easier
if I get out.

217
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,836
Why did I start an entertainment agency?

218
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,465
Those kids are gathering
and getting high every night

219
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,467
because I'm not there.

220
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,011
Even if investigators come,
don't go running.

221
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,514
-Call me first.
-I don't have to go with them?

222
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,600
They won't bring a warrant
unless they catch you in the act.

223
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,854
As per the laws of criminal procedure,
an investigator needs a suspect's consent

224
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,233
in order to bring the suspect in
for questioning during an investigation.

225
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,985
You may just refuse.

226
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,654
But why? What's the intel?

227
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,323
You're a quick one.

228
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,825
And you get us.

229
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,327
Give her some tips too.

230
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,037
Shall I?

231
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,372
Come here.

232
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,790
Yes, sir.

233
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,961
You'll be assigned a case next week.

234
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,631
You know Hanju's chairman
is being investigated for lobbying.

235
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,301
It's with Division Two right now,
but from what I can see,

236
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,053
they mistakenly believe
there's a slush fund and whatnot.

237
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,514
Take over the case.

238
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,935
-You understand, right?
-Of course.

239
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,939
That's right. It's about time
that you became close to Hanju Group.

240
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,911
Are you okay?

241
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,288
Mother seemed very angry.

242
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,457
Yes, I'm fine.

243
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,709
Be understanding.

244
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,128
She's extra sensitive
because it's about her son.

245
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,132
Of course, you wouldn't know
because you don't have a son.

246
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,469
What's his scandal about this time?

247
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,764
My friends don't send it to me
because it's about my family.

248
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,351
You haven't seen it yet?

249
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,354
"H Group's son H,

250
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,649
who is always in the spotlight
for his messy private life,

251
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:45,861
was caught doing improper things
in the toilet of an airplane?"

252
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,906
Oh, my gosh.

253
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,825
"'Hanju Airlines' new airplane

254
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:55,079
has larger toilets than
competitors' planes, so no one noticed."

255
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,956
This is so convincing.

256
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,085
Tabloids always make things
sound convincing.

257
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,920
We know Sung-woon.

258
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,880
They didn't make this up out of thin air.

259
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:09,760
Mi-na, what if he comes home
with a baby one day?

260
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,846
You need to keep him in check.

261
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,391
Would he listen if I tried?

262
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,521
That sad loser.

263
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,357
Your life is so much easier.

264
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,193
Your husband is dead,
so you don't need to keep him in check.

265
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,947
Why you…

266
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,916
Ms. Cho. The assault suspect is here.

267
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,001
Where is he?

268
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,294
He wanted to sit down on the sofa
and wait there.

269
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,756
On the sofa?
Does he think he's a VIP or something?

270
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,385
I think one of his relatives
owns Songseong Construction.

271
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,386
His relative? Who?

272
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,523
Since you're an expert,

273
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,859
I'm sure you understand
that this is unfair.

274
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,820
Those who don't know what they did wrong
always say that.

275
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,614
I'm telling you. He provoked me first.

276
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,492
I bought a nice car,
so I wanted to speed a little.

277
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:20,456
But he kept hovering around me,
which annoyed me like crazy.

278
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,498
So you beat him up?

279
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,417
It's not like he got beaten up for free.

280
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,627
Are you Cho Tae-o in Veteran?

281
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,798
You think you can beat someone up
and just throw some chump change?

282
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,634
I suppose you like movies.

283
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,470
Don't like them too much.

284
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,430
In the movie, Yoo Ah-in gets arrested.

285
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,140
But what happens in real life?

286
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,767
The prosecutor will let him off

287
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,644
and be appointed
executive director of the company.

288
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,733
I heard my family
pulled some strings to win you over.

289
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:53,489
I wonder if you can be appointed
executive director of Songseong Group.

290
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,081
You're being ridiculous.

291
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,127
About that string you pulled…

292
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,714
Let's say this is you. This is your wife.

293
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,550
Her cousin's sister-in-law's father.

294
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,551
CHAIRMAN SONG

295
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,011
That's Chairman Song, right?

296
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,805
No.

297
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,683
He's the sister-in-law's
brother-in-law's father.

298
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,937
-We are all a family.
-Family, my foot.

299
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,773
By that logic,
Biden and Putin are family too.

300
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,945
Just suspend the indictment.
They said you'd take good care of me.

301
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,538
Hello, Mr. Chairman. It's me.

302
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,046
Where is Sung-woon?

303
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,051
At this age, I was humiliated
at the Prosecutors' Office

304
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,637
and my son embarrassed himself
on a plane. What a mess.

305
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,764
Don't be so angry.

306
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,891
I think it's actually helping
our stock price.

307
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,476
I hired people to post comments,

308
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,645
and everyone's talking about
the new plane now.

309
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,774
That's the best news I've heard all day.

310
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,491
Do you not even want to eat with us?

311
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,786
You told her not to eat
in front of you ever again

312
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,122
because you couldn't stand her
eating like a bird.

313
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,667
She does eat very little.

314
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,752
I thought she only drank water
and never ate.

315
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,798
Eat just enough to survive.

316
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,259
If you die in this house,
it'll bring us bad luck.

317
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,469
By the way, Mother.

318
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,472
What's the plan for Grandfather's
remembrance service tomorrow?

319
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:47,227
Should all the women in the family
go to the salon and go together?

320
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:52,608
Sun-woo will be formally meeting everyone
for the first time as the eldest grandson,

321
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,902
so he should look nice.

322
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,279
Don't you have to go
to Jeju Island tomorrow?

323
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,157
Jeju Island? Why?

324
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,534
I was asking Mi-na, not you.

325
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,914
Tomorrow is the grand opening
of her family's hotel in Jeju.

326
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:07,998
Right.

327
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:11,335
They beat you
and got the permit for that spot.

328
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,005
Are you afraid to bring it up
even though you have to be there?

329
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,342
They'll also host your mother's
70th birthday party there.

330
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,304
My gosh. You didn't know?

331
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,390
I shouldn't have said it.

332
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,101
I guess they only invited
their immediate family members.

333
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,270
Technically,
she's no longer considered one.

334
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,191
Can you not say everything you think?

335
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,153
I must say, your family is very selfish.

336
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,323
If they take pictures
with the entire family except for you,

337
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,408
people will gossip like crazy.

338
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,202
I'm sorry.

339
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,746
That again.

340
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:51,166
These days, even machines
have a wider vocabulary than you do.

341
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,544
I can't believe I married my son off
to that disgusting family.

342
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,882
I truly regret listening to you back then
and accepting her into the family.

343
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,717
I should have never given in.

344
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,552
Enough.

345
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,638
Because I struggled all my life,

346
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,766
I chose her family
so my son could get help from them.

347
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,853
I had no idea she was born out of wedlock.

348
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,524
Goodness.
I'd rather stay in the interrogation room.

349
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,943
I feel much more comfortable there.

350
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,528
That cranky man.

351
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,530
Why must you bring up my family again?

352
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,533
You never admit to not having leverage
for being the second son.

353
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,785
If only the fire had never broken
out at the factory…

354
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,412
-Mom.
-What?

355
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,832
Hey.

356
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,377
Stay out of my sight.
I don't even want to hear you breathe.

357
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,505
No, just get out. Get out of my house!

358
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,644
I have a temper too.

359
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,521
This is too much, don't you think?

360
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:58,692
Well, he's my son's
sister-in-law's brother's…

361
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,861
-Brother-in-law.
-That's right.

362
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,821
-Who was it?
-Cousin's husband.

363
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,031
Right. Cousin's husband.

364
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:08,118
Anyway, it seems like
he was quite rude to you.

365
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,495
-Mr. Chairman.
-Yes.

366
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,581
You think prosecutors are a joke?

367
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,502
Since last year,
you've been bribing the senior prosecutors

368
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,629
and the deputy chief prosecutor.

369
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:22,883
I know you have!

370
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,136
Right. It is true.

371
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,763
What about me?

372
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,807
-Pardon?
-Why leave me out?

373
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,936
I never get anything
other than the sum you give to everyone.

374
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,482
You see, I never give up.

375
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:41,276
I take what I want
until I'm fully satisfied.

376
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,945
You've barely done anything for me,

377
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,532
so how dare you send me all your
distant relatives and acquaintances?

378
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,950
Please calm down.

379
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:53,997
I should have been more attentive.

380
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,208
But the bond we've built over the years

381
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,044
doing bad deeds together
will never be broken.

382
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:03,381
Not the kind you build
playing golf or drinking together.

383
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,426
People only truly bond
when they engage in bad deeds together.

384
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,179
If I'd never introduced you

385
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,099
to the deputy chief prosecutor
when that case broke out,

386
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,477
you wouldn't even be in Seoul today.

387
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,729
You'd still be stuck at rock bottom.

388
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,150
What are you trying to do here?

389
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:26,738
"Bond?"

390
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,366
Look, Mr. Chairman.

391
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,620
That's what you say
when you have something to lose.

392
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,581
You think you can threaten a prosecutor

393
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,750
by bringing up her past mistake,
don't you?

394
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,169
No. I won't fall for that.

395
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,546
I'm glad you brought it up.

396
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:47,050
Just like you, I climbed my way
up to where I am today from rock bottom.

397
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,636
So you'd better be careful.

398
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,515
Since we're both from the gutter,
I sure know exactly where to hit

399
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,017
when dealing with folks like you.

400
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,812
I should have been more thoughtful.

401
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:00,897
I apologize.

402
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,195
No need to apologize like that.

403
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,448
Some side effects are inevitable
for things to work.

404
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,326
So let's get over this hiccup
and work well together.

405
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,661
Thanks for the dinner.

406
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,388
Hi, Uncle.

407
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,432
What? You're not done yet?

408
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,810
-You jerk.
-Darn it!

409
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:39,853
Hey.

410
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,064
You jerks! Do you know who I am?

411
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,859
Who are you? Why don't you tell us?

412
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,486
You think you're the only one
with connections?

413
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,655
I want to follow the law,

414
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,700
but we have no choice
but to step in because of you sly weasels.

415
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,912
Hey, Yeon-ju. We're almost done here.

416
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:01,374
Wrap it up now.
I need your help on another case tomorrow.

417
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,418
Okay, got it.

418
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:09,007
Hey. You beat up someone.

419
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,427
You think you can cover it up
with chump change?

420
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,055
You need to spend at least this much.

421
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,514
Take this

422
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,225
and leave the country for a while.

423
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:22,854
The victim doesn't want to run into you
again in this country. Okay?

424
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,607
-Right. What? Do you think this is a joke?
-Yes, sir.

425
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,444
If I ever spot you,
I will teach you a lesson.

426
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,321
Take it, you idiot.

427
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:32,822
Take it.

428
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,584
-Did you have a good dinner?
-Yes.

429
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,629
As for the assault case,
let's suspend the indictment.

430
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:48,922
Sorry?

431
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,799
But for the settlement money,

432
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,885
ask for 18 times the amount
they're offering.

433
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,887
Teach those money-grubbing jerks a lesson.

434
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,181
Yes, ma'am.

435
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:01,268
Also, I'm taking some time off
starting tomorrow.

436
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,937
You should also take it easy
for about a week.

437
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,147
Don't work late,
and don't work on the weekend.

438
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,148
Is everything okay?

439
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,193
We're a team,
so I should probably tell you.

440
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:13,029
I might have to go out there alone
to gather some evidence.

441
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,406
For the Lee Bong-sik-gate.

442
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,615
The Lee Bong-sik-gate?

443
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,952
That jerk sold fake paintings
to rich people at high prices and ran off.

444
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:22,455
But we missed him,
and that got us in so much trouble.

445
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,415
When was that?

446
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,959
Check the article
you always carry around with you.

447
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,630
I can't believe that was three years ago.

448
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:35,427
So many super rich families
fell victim to his art fraud.

449
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,222
Rumor had it
that they used the fake paintings

450
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,182
as bribes and to set up slush funds.

451
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,894
There must have been a ton of businessmen
who were relieved by his disappearance.

452
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,855
And that Lee Bong-sik resurfaced?

453
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,482
I got intel that he might.

454
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,193
His money must be running out
after three years.

455
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,945
Once you make money from fraud,

456
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,489
you can't resist
committing the same crime.

457
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,534
-Is that an unwritten rule?
-No.

458
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:02,120
It's what they said
on Unanswered Questions last week.

459
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,624
So based on intel saying
he might resurface

460
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,753
and something you heard on TV,
you're taking a leave of absence

461
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,838
and going undercover without reporting?

462
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,214
I can't report.

463
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,759
The deputy chief prosecutor
missed him three years ago.

464
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,011
I'll surprise him by catching him and…

465
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,055
-Score some points.
-Bingo.

466
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,222
Do you need backup?

467
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,350
I can't request backup without reporting.

468
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:27,270
You don't have to worry about me.
Take it easy, both of you, okay?

469
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,486
Maybe someone is taking her
to a hot spring or something.

470
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,237
-Do you think so too?
-No.

471
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,951
PROSECUTOR WITH TWO HEARTS

472
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,578
LEE BONG-SIK'S ART FRAUD

473
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,236
I definitely got my temper from Grandma.

474
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,406
Why would she get so upset
just because I raised my voice?

475
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,701
There are no buses at this hour.
Why would she storm out like that?

476
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,576
Grandma!

477
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,251
Hello?

478
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,213
I think my grandma
was in a hit-and-run accident.

479
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,215
What's the location?

480
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,301
Let me see.

481
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,595
Near Hanju Factory.

482
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:29,934
All ambulances have been sent
to the factory on fire.

483
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,103
But help will be there shortly.

484
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,900
Grandma!

485
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,779
Help!

486
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,323
Help!

487
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,953
Grandma!

488
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,914
Grandma!

489
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,008
Wait just a little longer, Grandma.

490
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,487
Stop already.

491
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:26,783
I'm almost done, I promise.

492
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,827
Please.

493
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,412
Stop, okay?

494
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,708
Why are you even reading that rubbish?

495
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,710
You've been staring at your phone all day.

496
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:38,837
Gosh.

497
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,506
The comments are getting on my nerves.

498
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,883
Why did they have
to end the article this way?

499
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,969
"Sports star K was recently eliminated

500
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,763
in the preliminaries
of an international competition."

501
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,014
It's so unnecessary.

502
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,934
People are blaming me now.

503
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,019
Whatever. Get out.

504
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,402
Don't be like that.

505
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,487
Are you upset?

506
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,629
Aren't I the best?

507
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,674
I don't know why I even gave you a ride.

508
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:25,967
I agree.

509
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,886
You're an angel.

510
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,973
-See you.
-Bye.

511
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,268
Drive safe.

512
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,563
Jeez.

513
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,862
Why are you standing out here again?

514
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,864
You scared her!

515
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,575
Who's behind the article this time?

516
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:55,121
Your sister who wants
to show off her new airplane

517
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,999
or you who wants to hide your real lover?

518
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,378
Have some manners.

519
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,423
Were you watching us secretly?

520
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,758
That's creepy.

521
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,303
You have no shame.

522
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,305
Shame?

523
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,101
I'm not sure who should be more ashamed.

524
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,563
I've never crossed the line.

525
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,691
I always send your husband home at night.

526
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,904
I'm sorry. You must be tired. Go home now.

527
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:30,698
See you tomorrow.

528
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,458
Do you ever feel any kind of emotions?

529
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,380
You creep me out sometimes.

530
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:05,525
IDENTITY SUMMARY, LEE BONG-SIK

531
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,113
So this is what Lee Bong-sik looks like.

532
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,157
He had smuggled himself
out of Seopyung Port

533
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,202
and came back through there this time too.

534
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,955
And he's highly likely to appear
at today's auction.

535
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,457
It's a very similar event to the last one.

536
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,126
There will be mostly

537
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,378
emerging Korean artists'
undisclosed works.

538
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,256
And since it's sponsored by big companies,

539
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:32,010
most guests will be celebrities
and department store VIPs.

540
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,012
They're easier to deceive
than art experts.

541
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,180
But to get in there, don't I need

542
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,057
a VIP invitation or something?

543
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,811
I found one at home.
My mom is a client there.

544
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,647
A rich friend sure is good to have.

545
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,065
Great job.

546
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:52,155
All right. I'm going undercover today.

547
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,828
Don't you worry about me getting caught.

548
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,830
When I'm undercover, I don't just act.

549
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,167
I just completely blend
into the environment.

550
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,419
Is this how you dressed

551
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:09,130
when you went undercover
on the land speculation case?

552
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,633
Correct. The Pocheon land fraud case.

553
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,512
What other clothes do you have?

554
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,020
This is similar
to what my cousins usually wear.

555
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,271
I think this will do.

556
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:29,192
We both went to the same university
and passed the bar exam,

557
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,444
but I guess we will always have
some differences.

558
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,946
I know how badly
you want to climb up the ladder

559
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,323
but take it easy.

560
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:38,701
Hey, that's not how it works.

561
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:42,288
Do you think you can get to the top
by taking it easy?

562
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:45,458
You have to give it your all
if you don't want to fall.

563
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,336
Let's go.

564
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,846
-Hello?
-Prosecutor Cho Yeon-ju?

565
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,809
-This is No Hak-tae from Hanju.
-Hello.

566
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,522
I hear you're an ace prosecutor
at the Seoul Office.

567
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,774
Word travels fast.

568
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,236
But I'm on leave right now.

569
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:16,614
This isn't something to discuss
on the phone.

570
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:20,076
I was wondering if I could meet you
in person soon.

571
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,410
Sure.

572
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,912
When will you be back at work?

573
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,958
I'll just call you back.

574
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,544
Please give me a call
in the middle of next week.

575
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,379
Bye.

576
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,173
Who was it?

577
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,218
Do you know No Hak-tae,
the Head of Legal at Hanju?

578
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,177
No Hak-tae?

579
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,513
Yes, No Hak-tae.

580
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,348
He was classmates
with our chief prosecutor.

581
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,810
I remember him saying he was a good guy.

582
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,562
He was a good guy?

583
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:49,814
That's not good.

584
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,440
Why? He says he's a good guy.

585
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,359
Haven't you ever been set up?

586
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:57,697
If they say the person is nice,
there is always a trap.

587
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,660
Anyway, let's go.

588
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,876
Didn't I tell you to leave?

589
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,878
Why are you standing there?

590
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:16,924
You said to never go out
unless you approve my outfits.

591
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,719
I told her to go to the auction today.

592
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,639
Do you plan to go in that?

593
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,727
Didn't your family teach you how to dress?

594
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:33,065
But then again, why would they bother?
They don't even care about you.

595
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,361
Jae-hee. Take Mom and go.

596
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,155
-Okay. Let's go, Sun-woo.
-Okay.

597
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,656
Mother.

598
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,495
Thank you.

599
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,497
Don't thank me.

600
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:52,335
I didn't want to get involved
and get dragged into the gutter with you.

601
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:56,631
You'd prefer being at the auction
than sit there with us anyway.

602
00:36:57,131 --> 00:37:00,968
Stop by the department store next door
and pick up my shoes for me.

603
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,304
They arrived this morning from Milan.

604
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,681
Why are you telling her
to run your errand?

605
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,766
It's a pain.

606
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,810
If Mom tells you to earn your keep,

607
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,729
tell her that you run my errands.

608
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:18,110
Get some air and relax while you're out.

609
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,321
You've been through a lot.

610
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,989
You deserve some rest.

611
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,575
Okay. Thank you.

612
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:54,397
If you saw the article
that the entire family is going

613
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,899
to a function in Jeju
and plan to show up, don't.

614
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,443
Let's say you're not feeling well
and can't attend.

615
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,404
We said that because people would talk

616
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,572
if we said you wouldn't
attend from the get-go.

617
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,871
HANJU HOTEL

618
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:14,750
HANJU GROUP AND HYEBYUL GALLERY,
ART AUCTION FOR BENEFACTORS

619
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,420
Should I try getting a painting too?

620
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,631
I only get money from companies
that made money in real estate,

621
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,091
so I only get sushi.

622
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,594
Nothing high-class like this.

623
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:15,061
The auction will begin shortly.
Please proceed to the auction hall.

624
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:19,398
An event sponsored by Hanju Group
and joined by Hyebyul Gallery.

625
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:20,983
We will begin

626
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,278
the 2021 Hyebyul Gallery Public Auction.

627
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,155
All of the profits

628
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:29,075
will be donated to children in shelters
across the nation.

629
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,494
Your participation is appreciated.

630
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:34,663
Here is the first piece.

631
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:38,376
It is an early undisclosed work
by Kim Myung-sung,

632
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,960
who recently passed away.

633
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,303
We will start the bidding.

634
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,930
-Thirty million.
-Thirty million.

635
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:53,391
-Thirty-five million.
-Thirty-five million.

636
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,602
Yes? What is your bid?

637
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,815
-Two hundred million.
-Okay. 200 million.

638
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,817
-Two hundred million?
-It's 200 million now.

639
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,277
Two hundred million?

640
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,155
I like where this is headed.

641
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,325
Is there anyone else?

642
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,624
You must bid higher than 200 million
to have a chance.

643
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,126
Wait. What…

644
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,630
Anyone else?

645
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,299
If not, this piece will be sold.

646
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,176
No. Wait.

647
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:32,721
Yes? What is your bid?

648
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,808
Two hundred million…

649
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,227
and 30,000 won!

650
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,480
-What?
-Did she say 30,000?

651
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,399
Two million and 30,000, it is.

652
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,776
We have 200,030,000 won.

653
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:49,905
She thoughtfully raised the bid
to 200,030,000 won.

654
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,324
Yes?

655
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,661
300 million.

656
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,330
-Yes. 300 million.
-Three hundred million?

657
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,040
Three hundred?

658
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,587
What a big bid.

659
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,882
That is the highest bid yet.

660
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,758
-Anyone else?
-But…

661
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,303
How does she look exactly like me?

662
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:15,931
I'll make a final count to three.

663
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,852
Three hundred million.
Going once, going twice,

664
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,981
sold to VIP number one.

665
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,441
Congratulations.

666
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,530
Let's see the next item.

667
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:34,408
The next item is a piece by Kim Jun-ki.

668
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:38,871
He is known for his use of colors
and expression…

669
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:39,872
Bong-sik.

670
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,041
-We'll start the bidding.
-Isn't that you, Bong-sik?

671
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,338
Hey. Stop right there.

672
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,673
-Hey! Bong-sik!
-Darn it.

673
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,219
Darn it. Hey!

674
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,054
Stop right there!

675
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,684
Stop!

676
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,727
Move.

677
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,021
Hey! Stop right there!

678
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,607
Darn it.

679
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:11,862
Hey!

680
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:18,077
Lee Bong-sik! Stop!

681
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,958
Stop right there!

682
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,633
Hey!

683
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:34,885
Lee Bong-sik!

684
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:37,680
Hey!

685
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,323
Hey!

686
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,158
Darn it.

687
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,214
Where did they go?

688
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,634
Boss. I'll go this way.

689
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,352
I thought you couldn't come
because of your family function.

690
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,688
Thank you so much for coming.

691
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:29,857
Not at all.

692
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,483
Hanju was sponsoring it after all.

693
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,486
How should I process the purchase amount?

694
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,615
I'd like to see the painting first.

695
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:41,702
Of course. My mistake.

696
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,495
They'll bring it right up.

697
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,790
There's another painting
that my family requested.

698
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:47,833
I'll take them both.

699
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,711
Okay. Please wait right here.

700
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,184
Hi. We're ready.

701
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,645
Both the painting and me.

702
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,439
You're coming soon, right?

703
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:15,486
Darn it.

704
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,668
Darn it. The intel was right.

705
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,965
HANJU HOTEL

706
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,236
How could she look so much like me?

707
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,071
What's weirder is

708
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:01,907
her exuded wealth.

709
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,953
How could the same face
have such a different feel?

710
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,080
How?

711
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,874
I don't think anything is missing.

712
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,836
How long has it been
since you last spoke with her?

713
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,421
I think over five hours.

714
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:48,388
This is Ms. Kim from Seongbuk-dong.

715
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,319
Have you checked with the hotel?

716
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,488
They're checking their security footage.

717
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:08,033
The phone was turned off at the hotel.

718
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,499
Commemorating the anniversary

719
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:18,043
of the passing of Hanju Group's founder,

720
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:20,629
let's all reflect on ourselves

721
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:23,465
and see if we've been
giving and generous to others,

722
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:24,716
which he always emphasized,

723
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,180
so we can once again
nourish and fulfill our souls.

724
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:36,853
This was written when David's life
was crashing down into a bottomless pit.

725
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,606
In life, there are moments when you feel

726
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,859
as though your entire life
is crashing down.

727
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:43,944
What crashed?

728
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:45,279
Sorry?

729
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:49,533
SERVICE FOR LATE CHAIRMAN HAN HYUNG-MO

730
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,788
When our souls come crashing down

731
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:56,790
because of money

732
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:57,916
and our sins--

733
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,167
What is this nonsense?

734
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:06,425
Yumin Group had partnered
with a world-renowned hotel chain

735
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:09,928
and opened Yumin Hotel,
the first six-star hotel in the country.

736
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,430
Yumin Group's private jet,

737
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,141
which had left for Jeju
for the grand opening of the hotel,

738
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,935
crashed into the ocean
at around 4 p.m. today.

739
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:21,189
Chairman Kang Jang-soo of Yumin Group
and his family who were on the private jet

740
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,233
are presumed to be dead,

741
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:26,403
-and many are shocked by this news.
-That really is Mi-na's family.

742
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,100
The search is still ongoing,

743
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,479
but no survivor has been found yet.

744
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:04,441
The Coast Guard will focus
on finding those who were on the jet.

745
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,693
They'll also try to find the wreckage

746
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:10,364
and the flight recorder
to further investigate the accident.

747
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:11,782
As for this accident,

748
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:14,826
we'll share the updates with you
as soon as they come in.

749
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,372
Where is she?

750
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:34,680
The chairman's body was found,
so we brought him here first.

751
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,682
What can you do?

752
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:39,101
We can't keep on waiting
until the bodies are found.

753
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:54,366
I can't believe this!

754
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:58,662
Jang-soo! My dear brother!

755
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:03,583
My brother!

756
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,088
No, my brother!

757
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,718
-Ma'am!
-Ma'am! Hurry.

758
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:13,885
Call a doctor!

759
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,679
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am.

760
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,472
-Are you okay, ma'am?
-Ma'am.

761
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,682
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am.

762
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:23,353
HANJU HOTEL

763
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:33,196
Find out which hospital she was taken to.

764
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,322
Yes, ma'am.

765
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,830
Yes. It's me, Ms. Kim.

766
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:46,168
I went through the security footage
from the hotel.

767
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:54,593
Gosh, how could the whole family die
and leave their fortune behind?

768
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:57,262
They died together,
so at least they won't be lonely.

769
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:01,183
Hold on. Who's first in line
to inherit all the money?

770
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,518
There are no surviving children
or grandchildren.

771
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,270
Siblings are next in line.

772
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,028
Gosh, no.
I'll be punished for having such thoughts.

773
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,654
Yes, I'll be punished.

774
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,698
My brother and his children died.

775
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:41,932
Mi-na!

776
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:45,811
You're alive!

777
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:50,023
-Do you know this patient?
-Yes! She's my niece.

778
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,404
She's alive.

779
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,366
Is she alive?

780
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:05,413
She's alive!

781
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,418
She's alive.

782
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,128
We're from Hanju Group.

783
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,505
Take her. Hurry!

784
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:53,128
We have the latest news
on Yumin Group's plane crash,

785
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:54,754
which took place on the 2nd.

786
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:58,049
The bodies of all the victims
have been found.

787
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:02,178
Ms. Kang Mi-na, the youngest daughter,
wasn't on the plane.

788
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:06,224
The police have stated that they're
not able to look up

789
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,101
her phone records or track her location

790
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:11,563
as no missing persons record
had been filed.

791
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,859
She is also the second daughter-in-law

792
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:18,403
of Mr. Han Young-sik,
the chairman of Hanju Group,

793
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:21,615
-who hasn't released a statement…
-Your customer service is awful.

794
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:27,871
When it comes to slush funds,
nothing's better than construction.

795
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:33,585
And a hotel business can't be profitable
unless your subsidiaries help you out.

796
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:37,047
Yumin has a proven track record
in construction,

797
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:41,718
and they have many subsidiaries
they can strike deals with.

798
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:44,638
My daughter-in-law
is the only surviving child

799
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:46,556
of that family.

800
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,186
It took too long for the misfortune
to turn into a blessing.

801
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:54,898
Let's take care of the funeral
for the family.

802
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,066
Yes, sir.

803
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:59,110
And keep an eye on Yumin Group
to figure out their next move.

804
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:02,489
Most companies give
the head of legal role to officers

805
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,200
from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office
or former chief judges

806
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,743
from the Central District Court.

807
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:10,664
It's time you showed everyone
why I hired you for the role.

808
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,041
Yes. Well understood, sir.

809
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:19,130
CHAIRMAN'S OFFICE

810
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,467
Look at him boasting.

811
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:26,179
Everyone knows someone from
the Supreme Prosecutors' Office

812
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:27,389
turned down the offer.

813
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,643
Hey, miss.

814
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:35,480
You're really frustrating me here.
All other airlines would do this for me.

815
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:40,026
All seats including upgrade seats
and discounted seats have sold out.

816
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:40,944
Hey!

817
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:43,238
I know. I get it.

818
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:46,658
But I can't fly in economy class
in this condition.

819
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,952
I know you have some seats put aside.

820
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:52,038
In that case, there will be
an additional fee. Is that okay?

821
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:56,209
You don't seem to understand.
Do I have to repeat myself?

822
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,545
My wife's cousin's sister-in-law's

823
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:01,381
brother-in-law's father
is the chairman of Songseong Group.

824
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:04,634
You know Songseong Group, right?
They're related to Hankuk Airlines.

825
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:08,805
Without paying an additional fee,
you can't upgrade to business class.

826
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,473
This is frustrating.

827
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,309
You're just a lowly airport clerk.

828
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:14,853
How dare you treat me this way?

829
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,605
Gosh. What's with the face?

830
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:18,565
Are you offended?

831
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:20,650
I'm sorry, sir.

832
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,819
How can you be so rude?

833
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:23,987
Do you want to die?

834
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:29,117
Who… Who are you?

835
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,745
I'm an acquaintance
of the chairman of Hankuk Airlines.

836
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,414
Following your logic,

837
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:37,125
we all are about six degrees away
from one another, right?

838
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:39,377
What's wrong with you? Hey, let go.

839
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:40,879
Do you even know who I am?

840
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,881
Do you want me to call
a prosecutor I know?

841
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,967
I'm just trying to help you
fly business class.

842
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,177
What do you mean?

843
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,012
You'll be able to fly business class

844
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:51,514
if you become an emergency patient.

845
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,682
What do you say?

846
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,853
Should I break your other arm too?

847
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,690
Let go! That hurts! I'm sorry!

848
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,360
Darn it.

849
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,363
I'm sorry.

850
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:13,703
Mr. No.

851
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,706
You're the mighty Head of Legal
at Hanju Group.

852
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,708
I'm honored to be picked up by you.

853
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:21,669
What a fancy way to announce your return.

854
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,464
You could have called the airport police.

855
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,966
Why did you have to step in?

856
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,470
I'm not going to stand
on the sidelines anymore.

857
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:33,473
I think you've changed.

858
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:36,851
I should. I've been too patient.

859
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:43,441
Didn't that guy say something
about a prosecutor he knows?

860
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:45,985
I hope there won't be any trouble.

861
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,363
Who cares about such a lousy prosecutor?

862
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:50,490
I'd love to see
that pathetic person actually.

863
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,611
What's going on?

864
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:45,211
Why did you have to go there alone
and get hit by a car?

865
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:49,632
You made such a fool out of us all.
Are you happy now?

866
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:55,263
Why are you looking at me like that?

867
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:58,057
How dare you?

868
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,103
Who are you?

869
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,858
Hey! Are you out of your mind?

870
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:07,942
Let go!

871
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:14,574
Hold on. Am I really out of my mind?

872
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,285
What's wrong with me?

873
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,499
Who…

874
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,584
Who am I?

875
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,229
EPILOGUE

876
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:03,122
If anyone can hear my prayer,

877
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,707
please save me.

878
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:08,753
If you save me,
I will become a good person.

879
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,674
Wait. Who's this handsome priest?

880
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,551
And what's with this solemn music?

881
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,680
Welcome, Sister.

882
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,181
Let me guide you.

883
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,685
Did I die? Am I dead?

884
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,353
Yes. Why else would you be here?

885
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,272
-Come with me.
-Hold on!

886
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:12,692
It's true I took bribes, swore,
and hit people. But I can't die like this.

887
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,319
All deaths are sudden.

888
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:18,114
I don't know why you died,
but everything happens for a reason.

889
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:20,783
-So come with me. Hurry.
-No.

890
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,869
I really can't die like this.

891
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:23,995
Something's wrong.

892
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:28,333
Wait.

893
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:38,176
Michael.

894
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:43,890
No way.

895
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:46,601
Nothing ever tasted this good.

896
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:48,478
Is this galbi or chicken?

897
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,605
Did you order chicken?

898
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:53,024
Is it you again?
No one ordered chicken here.

899
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,817
What are you doing here?

900
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,569
Why do you do this to me every time?

901
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,321
-You made a mistake.
-Hold on.

902
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,157
Are you the Grim Reaper?

903
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:04,869
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm a priest, and I'm here to guide you.

904
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:06,663
Why would the Grim Reaper be here?

905
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,581
I'm just a deliveryman. Give me a second.

906
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,209
Username, Yeolhyeolsaje.
"Extra picked radishes, please."

907
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:12,835
It's you, isn't it?

908
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,587
That actually is my username.

909
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,340
So why are you doing this every time?
Pay me already.

910
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:21,219
Be quiet, you two!
I have something very important to do.

911
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:24,889
-So goodbye.
-Where do you think you're going?

912
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:25,890
Hold on.

913
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:30,436
Have we met before?

914
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,776
What? What's going on?

915
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,571
We have to go.

916
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,408
This doesn't feel right. Stop!

917
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:47,745
-What are you doing in this sacred place?
-Why are you like this every time?

918
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:50,915
-I never ordered any chicken.
-And why are there so many stairs here?

919
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:52,583
-What's the point?
-Wait!

920
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:56,629
I really have to get back.

921
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,885
You can't do this!

922
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,221
I can't believe
she punched me in the nose.

923
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,473
Is that why your nose is gone?

924
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,559
My nose.

925
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,769
My nose.

926
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:15,106
She probably took it.

927
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:17,024
My goodness. Wait here.

928
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,401
I'll go and get it.

929
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,613
Wait. Pay me for the chicken!

930
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,791
I nearly died just now.

931
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,175
A hard blow to the head
caused retrograde amnesia.

932
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,801
I'm a daughter-in-law of Hanju Group?

933
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:48,264
-Are you okay?
-You're so good-looking.

934
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:51,976
I'm a daughter-in-law of Hanju Group.
All I do is housework?

935
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:53,227
Are we in the 19th century or what?

936
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,188
-Hey!
-You're the best.

937
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,690
Like how I'd tie Mother's arms
behind her back.

938
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,317
How crude you are.

939
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,568
Who are you?

940
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:04,238
It doesn't seem like
she just lost her memory.

941
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,656
She lost her sense of identity.

942
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,325
Her memories may be gone,
but not her emotions.

943
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:10,620
Don't tell me
you still have feelings left for her.

944
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:11,954
You don't

945
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:13,706
know me?
