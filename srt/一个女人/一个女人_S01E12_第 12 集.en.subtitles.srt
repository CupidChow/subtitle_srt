1
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,748
It wasn't your fault.

2
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,544
I took money in exchange for saying

3
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,381
I started the fire.

4
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,425
You were paid?

5
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,137
By whom? Who paid you?

6
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,389
I didn't know who he was.

7
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,225
He came to see me at the police station.

8
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,105
He said he worked for Hanju.

9
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,649
You took money from Hanju?

10
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,570
Why?

11
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,326
Was the money

12
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,369
that paid for my food and education

13
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,915
from Hanju?

14
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,588
Why did you take that money? Why?

15
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,095
By any chance,

16
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,766
was the Hanju employee
who came to the police station

17
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,185
this man?

18
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,233
Yes.

19
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:56,449
14 YEARS AGO

20
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,118
HANJU FASHION SEOPYUNG FACTORY

21
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,035
Where are they?

22
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,414
-Help!
-This way!

23
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,052
Come in.

24
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,929
-You search that way.
-My goodness.

25
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,722
What do we do?

26
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,349
Wait.

27
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:24,561
After throwing a tantrum
saying you'd burn everything down,

28
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,104
did you really set it on fire?

29
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,231
What do you mean?

30
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,440
-What?
-What?

31
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,401
-Was it you?
-You jerk!

32
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,070
People accused me at the scene,

33
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,614
so I was taken to the police station.

34
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,827
MAY THEY REST IN PEACE

35
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,662
I heard Mother was cremated

36
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,497
without a funeral,

37
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,625
so I begged them to let me go.

38
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,711
CHOI SEUNG-OK

39
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,588
Why did you come here?

40
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,590
What right do you have to come here?

41
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,385
It's all your fault.

42
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,763
Why did you call Grandma?

43
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,517
Things like this always happen
when you show up.

44
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,979
You should've just stayed in prison.
Why did you come out?

45
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,689
Yeon-ju.

46
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:14,569
There was a misunderstanding,
but it'll be cleared up soon.

47
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:18,489
I mean it. I swear before my mother.

48
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,617
This is a misunderstanding.

49
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,286
I'll explain everything once I get out.

50
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,831
Mother.

51
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,757
LOOKING FOR WITNESSES

52
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,436
Hello.

53
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,897
May I put these up?

54
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,774
You can put one up there.

55
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,905
The police determined that the fire
at the Hanju factory in Seopyung

56
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:02,450
was the act of a disgruntled worker
who was angry about being laid off.

57
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:06,955
According to Seopyung Police,
the suspect Kang had forewarned

58
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:11,334
that he'd set the factory on fire
and burned tissues in a trash can.

59
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,836
He has admitted his guilt.

60
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,338
Imagine how I felt

61
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,466
when I saw on the news that you confessed

62
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,010
after swearing to me that you didn't.

63
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,599
That last sliver of hope
that I was holding on to

64
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,895
snapped that very moment.

65
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,278
I had no choice.

66
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,170
Who…

67
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,302
Are you my attorney?

68
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,470
Please get me out of here.

69
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,055
This is unfair.

70
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,557
What is?

71
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,226
-What?
-What's unfair?

72
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,186
I didn't start the fire.

73
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,479
But you wanted to.

74
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,525
That was just talk.

75
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,737
I didn't mean to really do it.

76
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,990
Would people believe you?

77
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,745
Do you think they would believe

78
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,413
an ex-con thug?

79
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,458
You can't get out anyway.

80
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,752
Thugs like you

81
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,795
should be used to these things.

82
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,380
What do you say?

83
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,550
Why don't you take some money
and keep your mouth shut?

84
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,814
At that moment,

85
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,235
I felt like what my daughter needed

86
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,322
wasn't this useless dad

87
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,867
but money.

88
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,828
That was why I agreed.

89
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,122
My condition was

90
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,792
that they make sure you never find out

91
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,377
that I was paid.

92
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,964
Why did you decide that by yourself?

93
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,010
You

94
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,763
always ended up being hurt

95
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,182
when I was in your life.

96
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,476
Why did you think that…

97
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,271
Things like this always happen
when you show up.

98
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,274
You should've just stayed in prison.
Why did you come out?

99
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:46,322
Why do you still barge into my life
and mess up everything?

100
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,365
Why?

101
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:54,956
Yeon-ju.

102
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:10,388
Okay. You don't have a choice anymore.

103
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,099
Tell me

104
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,893
everything you know about Mi-na.

105
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,938
Who is she?

106
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,318
Not long ago,

107
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,990
I saw medicine in our room
with someone else's name on it.

108
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,534
PRESCRIPTION

109
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,121
Cho Yeon-ju.

110
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,499
It was from a hospital, not a pharmacy,

111
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,126
so I called the hospital director.

112
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,045
There was a record in the VIP ward.

113
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,922
I went right over.

114
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,757
Which room is Cho Yeon-ju in?

115
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,259
I'm here to visit her.

116
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,470
It says she was discharged.

117
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,971
She left right away.

118
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,265
That can't be.

119
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,895
Wasn't it her?

120
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,396
Yes, it was.

121
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,315
She stayed briefly and left.

122
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,358
May I see her medical file?

123
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,611
I'm sorry, but I can't let you see that.

124
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,114
I couldn't get anything else.

125
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,658
They couldn't give me info
about a VIP patient.

126
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,118
Is that all?

127
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,746
All you know is her name and age.

128
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,498
It's true.

129
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,710
What will happen to her?

130
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,714
Don't you get it yet?

131
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,941
Cho Yeon-ju.

132
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,694
I've heard that name before.

133
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,281
Find someone for me.

134
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,076
All I have are her name and age.

135
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,370
Yes, ma'am.

136
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,834
Here.

137
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,676
I got calls from the ER
all the time when I was young.

138
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,637
That my dad was stabbed

139
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,265
or that he beat someone to a pulp.

140
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,976
I was so used to it.

141
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,606
That was how you knew
they had these things in the ER.

142
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,194
About that money.

143
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,321
Someone gave it to me

144
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,324
saying my grandma took out
a life insurance on me.

145
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,660
I was too young

146
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,204
and didn't think to check the documents.

147
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:44,292
There's no way to find him now.

148
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,296
I'm so sorry.
I don't know how to face you.

149
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,631
Don't say that.

150
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,841
No.

151
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,635
My grandma always said
nothing ever happens

152
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,512
purely because of one person.

153
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,683
But after what I heard earlier, I think

154
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,894
it really was because of me.

155
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,524
If I had stopped my grandmother
from going that day,

156
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,319
she'd still be alive today.

157
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,989
Then my father wouldn't have
tried to take the blame

158
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,158
for something someone else did.

159
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:22,288
It really was purely because of me.

160
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,339
Why does my life stink so much?

161
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,675
From the moment I was born,

162
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,178
I've worked hard and given it my all.

163
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,139
Why must I always be
embarrassed and ashamed,

164
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,933
and always feel so pathetic?

165
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,895
I hate my life so much.

166
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,569
I can't blame you.

167
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,909
He was never there for you.

168
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,370
He was always in and out of prison.

169
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,955
Whenever people almost forgot,
he'd get out of prison

170
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,584
and cause trouble and humiliate
you and your grandmother.

171
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,587
Your grandmother
provided for the family all by herself.

172
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,298
How do you know that so well?

173
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,760
That was what your father said.

174
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,971
And after what he told you today,

175
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,475
I'm sure you hate him.

176
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,811
So…

177
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,816
let go of at least one thing.

178
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,653
What do you mean?

179
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,906
You have to find the person
who killed your grandmother,

180
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,866
get revenge on the prosecutor
from back then,

181
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,161
hate your father,
and pretend to be Mi-na now.

182
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:47,748
Gosh.

183
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,084
What a tough life.

184
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,885
Let's reduce your burden.

185
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,346
Start by no longer hating your father.

186
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,393
It's not that easy.

187
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,396
I've said and done so many things.

188
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,733
Human beings are complex and multifaceted.

189
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,945
That was something you said.

190
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,741
He'll have to tell himself that was
how you used to be, but not anymore,

191
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,161
and accept it.

192
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,633
Here.

193
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,102
Cheers.

194
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,564
Cheers.

195
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,536
That perked me up.

196
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,498
Right?

197
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,250
Do you want one more?

198
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,008
IDENTITY ASSURANCE STATEMENT

199
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,636
FATHER, KANG MYUNG-GUK

200
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,349
SERVING IN SEOPYUNG PENITENTIARY

201
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,191
She was the daughter
of the Hanju factory arsonist.

202
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,693
CHO YEON-JU, LEE BONG-SIK

203
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,655
CHIEF RYU SEUNG-DUK

204
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:47,826
KANG MYUNG-GUK

205
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,328
CHO YEON-JU, LEE BONG-SIK

206
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,705
The lead prosecutor on the case

207
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,333
was Ryu Seung-duk,
who is at the Central District Office now.

208
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,001
And as for the arson case

209
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,586
and the hit-and-run,

210
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,130
I'm sure he didn't properly
investigate either of them.

211
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,968
So he's an enemy, to both of you.

212
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:08,806
Jung Do-woo offered Jang Seok-ho money
and ordered him to kill Kang Mi-na.

213
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,725
It tells us she had something
that could harm Hanju's reputation.

214
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,728
The details of what happened 14 years ago,

215
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,355
which was on the tablet.

216
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,066
Correct. 14 years ago,
Jung Do-woo paid Jang Seok-ho

217
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,110
to give a false statement.

218
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,863
That's how he framed Yeon-ju's father.

219
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,490
I'm sure someone from Hanju
started the fire.

220
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,950
Right.

221
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,036
So the most important thing
we can draw from this…

222
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:37,167
is that her father didn't
actually have anything

223
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,753
to do with your father's death.

224
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,297
Good.

225
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,425
Is that important now?

226
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,677
To me, it is the most important thing.

227
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,681
Oh, boy. Let's go home

228
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,975
and sleep comfortably for a change.

229
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,476
Are you kidding me?

230
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,521
How can I go to the Hanju's residence
and sleep there after this?

231
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,525
I'll tell them I have to work all night,

232
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,277
so just say that if they ask you.

233
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,988
We should go to Seopyung
first thing in the morning

234
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,908
and hear what her father has to say.

235
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,826
Sure, suit yourselves.

236
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,871
Wait, hold on.
I should check the schedule.

237
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,291
The memorial service
for Han Sung-chan is tomorrow.

238
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,293
It's the anniversary of his passing.

239
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,128
There's the shareholders' meeting too.

240
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:24,048
They'll probably discuss
the transfer of my shares.

241
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,216
Let's just make sure
we're not late for the meeting.

242
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,346
But if you don't go home again,
they won't let it slide.

243
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,645
I let her off once,

244
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,647
and she's now pulling this
whenever she wants.

245
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,899
Are you sure she's at work?

246
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,317
Wherever she is,

247
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,362
she'd better attend the memorial service.

248
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,238
Only a few people are attending,

249
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,742
so having the chairman
of Yumin Group there will save our face.

250
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,995
Is that all you care about?

251
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,374
Why did you insist on
holding a memorial service to begin with?

252
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,335
I'm already upset it'll be a small service

253
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,379
with just a few family members attending.

254
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,340
How could you say such a thing, Mother?

255
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,515
I'd feel better if I could think
that he lived somewhere far away.

256
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,142
Holding a memorial service for him

257
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,520
just reminds me of the fact
that my son is dead.

258
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,440
My gosh, Mother.

259
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,862
You love your eldest son so dearly.

260
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,449
Gosh, it's such a shame.

261
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,784
If he were alive,

262
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,911
he'd be getting all your love
and your shares too.

263
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,579
Hey!

264
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,375
Hold on. Is Sung-woon not home yet either?

265
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,713
Do they both just not care anymore?

266
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,644
Hey.

267
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,647
I knew you'd come.

268
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,733
I can't believe
you had the nerve to call me.

269
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,151
But you came.

270
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,944
You didn't have to come, you know.

271
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,321
You're the only one who cares about me.

272
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,992
Did your sister get you ousted?

273
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,744
What?

274
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,538
"Oust" is not slang.
It's in the dictionary.

275
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,709
Do you not think at all

276
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,836
before you act?

277
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,547
Wait, do you even have a brain?

278
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,424
I can't believe you called me.

279
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:35,554
I love it when you say mean words to me

280
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,598
with your clear diction.

281
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,475
Do not call me again,

282
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,770
or you'll hear some curse words
that are seriously offensive.

283
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,856
Do you think
I still have feelings for you?

284
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,566
I came here to warn you.

285
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,818
Don't mess things up
just because your plan fell through.

286
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:50,986
You'd better stay quiet

287
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,448
because things are still
looking up for me.

288
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,786
Things are still looking up for you?

289
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,330
What does that mean?

290
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,957
Why would I tell you?

291
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,711
Enjoy the night to the fullest
because this will be the last time.

292
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,463
After the shareholders' meeting tomorrow,

293
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,925
even the staff at your hotel bar
will treat you like dirt.

294
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,605
Hi.

295
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,858
Hey, what's up?

296
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,237
Now you're the chief of the Central,
you think you're out of my league?

297
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,363
SEOPYUNG DPO, KIM YONG-HA

298
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,697
You never call me anymore.

299
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,033
I don't have time for jokes. What's up?

300
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,576
Don't pretend to be busy.

301
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,121
Remember the case
you transferred to our office?

302
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,747
About Hanju's daughter-in-law.

303
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,915
Yes, what about it?

304
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,334
An Yu-jun was in charge of the case.

305
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,670
I was looking for him this morning

306
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,965
because I had a task for him,
but he was nowhere to be seen.

307
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,968
Then I found him in the archives.

308
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,719
What are you saying?

309
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,766
I checked what he was looking at
to see what he was doing.

310
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,603
You worked on the Hanju factory arson case
when you were here.

311
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,315
Turns out, he made copies
of all the documents on the case.

312
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,109
Did you ask him

313
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,278
to look into something regarding Hanju?

314
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:26,123
RYU SEUNG-DUK

315
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,632
Hey, it's me. Is Ms. Cho in her office?

316
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,426
She called in sick.

317
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,760
What?

318
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,682
VISITATION ROOM

319
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,711
You're here.

320
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,839
No one came in,
so I stepped out to check the time.

321
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,507
We'll be right in.

322
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,301
You were here yesterday too.

323
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,845
I guess that jerk is giving you
the runaround, ma'am.

324
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,058
You see, arsonists have no remorse.

325
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,560
And he used to be a thug.
What do you expect?

326
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,231
Good luck today.

327
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:49,915
Well, I can't feel better overnight

328
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,584
because of what I heard yesterday.

329
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,630
But now we know
that there was a misunderstanding.

330
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,761
You received money
in return for taking the blame,

331
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,304
so you're not completely innocent.

332
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,847
You're still an accomplice.

333
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,724
I'm okay,

334
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,102
so stay strong.

335
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,312
As if that's any of your business.

336
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,736
I'll get you out.

337
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:28,829
I wanted to be of help to you.

338
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,166
I wanted to pay for my mother's death

339
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,379
by rotting here for the rest of my life
and take the truth to my grave.

340
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,591
But because I helped them
conceal the truth,

341
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,430
I now owe this young man an apology.

342
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:52,686
And I thought I should tell you

343
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,982
that I didn't kill his father.

344
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,193
Okay, I heard you.

345
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,905
By the way, what really happened that day?

346
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,743
I only found out
about your release that day.

347
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,086
It's soybean stew. Is Dad out?

348
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,465
Just be quiet and eat your food.

349
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,925
When did he get out?

350
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,177
I'm not eating this.

351
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,888
He didn't come here.

352
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,307
He knew you'd be like this,
so he couldn't come here.

353
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,851
He's scared of his own daughter.

354
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:36,938
I even made his favorite dish,
but he didn't come see his mum.

355
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,985
He was released a while ago.

356
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,447
He got a job at a big company.

357
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,909
-A big company?
-At the Hanju Fashion factory.

358
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,536
Are you sure he's not getting involved
in another protest?

359
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,122
He's been hired officially
as a production worker.

360
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,708
Let's see how long he stays.

361
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,544
He's already worked there
for almost a month.

362
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,464
Grandma.

363
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,883
It's time to give up on him.

364
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,134
"I've changed.

365
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,761
I'll never use violence again."

366
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,513
Then we got a call from the police.

367
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,766
It's happened too many times.
If you keep falling for his lies,

368
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,101
he'll never change.

369
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:17,270
You're right. You're such a smart girl.

370
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,815
I'll never fall for his lies again.

371
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:24,444
I'll make sure my son
stays on the right path.

372
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,449
I'd say that if I were a respected

373
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:33,870
independence activist's mother on TV.

374
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,750
But I can't because I feel bad
for not raising my son right.

375
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,132
If I don't welcome him
and feed him, who would?

376
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,927
What about you?

377
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,222
Every time someone brings up your dad,
you flip your lid,

378
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,142
get into a fight and quit school.

379
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,727
Why should I put up

380
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:00,147
with a troublemaker like you?

381
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,525
Think of how I must feel.
You're responsible for him as his mother,

382
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,609
but what about me?

383
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:09,030
Not all parents
are satisfied with their children.

384
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,199
It's the same the other way around.

385
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:15,328
Not all children
are satisfied with their parents.

386
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:19,332
You may feel it's unfair,
but what can you do?

387
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,044
That darned brat.

388
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:27,507
Still, I didn't get a call
from the police this time.

389
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:31,469
Imagine how relieved I was
to hear he was working in a factory.

390
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,140
He'll be fine as long as
he doesn't lose his temper

391
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,183
and hit someone.

392
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,309
I doubt it.

393
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,270
I bet he gets in trouble again
in a few days.

394
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,899
HANJU FASHION

395
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:47,652
You heard about the theft
that happened in the office yesterday,

396
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,862
right?

397
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,781
All the money
from our clients went missing.

398
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:52,866
Yes.

399
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:56,661
The culprit is definitely among us.

400
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,079
Even if it were an outsider,

401
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:02,292
there must have been an accomplice
within the company.

402
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,296
You have a criminal record, don't you?

403
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:10,300
Your family seems to be struggling too.

404
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,010
What are you trying to say?

405
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,180
I only started working here recently.

406
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,099
How would I know where that money is?

407
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,852
I mean… Search me.

408
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,231
That day, someone important
was supposed to visit.

409
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:28,902
I think that's why they wanted
to cover up the incident.

410
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:39,162
They weren't going to trust me
from the beginning.

411
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,916
They just wanted to pin everything on me.

412
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:48,713
They even paid me
the next month's salary and kicked me out.

413
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:52,467
If they thought I was the culprit,
why would they pay me?

414
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,597
They must've felt bad about framing me

415
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,725
when there wasn't even any evidence!

416
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,731
If they investigated,
they would've known it wasn't you.

417
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,525
What's wrong with them?

418
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:12,654
During the investigation,
they found out about my criminal record.

419
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,656
But that doesn't mean I'm the thief!

420
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,409
As you know, I've only been
convicted of assault so far.

421
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,744
I've never committed any thefts!

422
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,747
Goodness, I'm so proud of you.

423
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,459
It's because
you get into fights all the time

424
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,463
and try to solve everything with violence

425
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,174
that people suspect you
whenever something happens.

426
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,343
I've had enough of your nagging.
I'm hanging up!

427
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:42,350
How could they treat a member
of the Nammoon Gang like this?

428
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,729
I can't take this money. I won't!

429
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:50,317
I'll burn everything in front of everyone!

430
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,334
I don't need this chump change.

431
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:11,379
In front of everyone, I'll set fire to it!

432
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:15,717
You think I'm a thief? You hurt my pride!

433
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,219
What do you take me for?

434
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,398
What is it?

435
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,693
What are you up to now?

436
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,238
You'll burn what?

437
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,617
How much did you drink?

438
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,785
Listen.

439
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:46,081
Don't be such a nuisance
in the middle of the night.

440
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,166
Wait right there.

441
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,085
I'm coming over now.

442
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,213
Don't do anything
and wait right there, okay?

443
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:54,756
Goodness.

444
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,635
Where are you going?

445
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,262
I'm going to go get your dad.
Lead the way.

446
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,807
See? I knew he'd get in trouble.

447
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,059
What did he do now? A gang fight?

448
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,228
He's not in trouble yet.

449
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:11,940
You go alone. I'm not going.
I'm sick and tired of this.

450
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,567
My goodness.

451
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,614
I just want them to listen to me.

452
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,324
Who cares if I set fire

453
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,826
to a bunch of money?

454
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,619
Why is she making such a fuss?

455
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:25,954
Gosh.

456
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,542
Darn it.

457
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,545
I can't believe that old woman.

458
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:37,590
How is she going to get here
at this hour anyway?

459
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,939
She should've just stayed home.

460
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:55,024
There's no way she can get here.

461
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,575
What?

462
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,035
Why is there smoke?

463
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:11,332
What's going on? How did the fire start?

464
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:20,341
But something didn't feel right.

465
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,927
What? What do you mean?

466
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,766
It felt like something had changed.

467
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,977
What's this?

468
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:35,231
Something I didn't see earlier
was on fire.

469
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,194
I saw the Hanju Fashion logo
on the front cover.

470
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,863
HANJU FASHION

471
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,865
A ledger.

472
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,328
That's what it looked like.

473
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,748
Hanju Fashion's ledger…

474
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,583
was outside?

475
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,669
Your father must have tried to
either move the ledgers

476
00:29:56,753 --> 00:30:00,048
or burn them up, thinking it was too late.

477
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,341
He couldn't escape the fire

478
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,676
because of the ledgers.

479
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,430
If the ledger was outside,

480
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,682
why was he inside?

481
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,104
Maybe he couldn't come out.

482
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,654
Could the important visitor

483
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,280
have been your father?

484
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,367
He went there unannounced.

485
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,829
That's why no one knew he was in the fire.

486
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,249
His car was found in the garage afterward,

487
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,584
and it seemed like he drove there himself.

488
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,839
Then who's the important person
that was supposed to come?

489
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:41,965
I'm not sure.

490
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:45,176
Back then, Hanju Fashion
was under Hanju Trade.

491
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,471
So it may have been my uncle,
the then president of Hanju Trade.

492
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,640
He also benefited the most

493
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,809
from my father's death.

494
00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:00,692
Did you say only your father's car
was found in the garage afterward?

495
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,652
Yes.

496
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,112
While working as a prosecutor,

497
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,073
I've requested many warrants
for hit-and-run cases.

498
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:10,076
A lieutenant at the traffic division
once told me this.

499
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,579
In a hit-and-run case,

500
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,331
what's most important is
where the car came from.

501
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,584
My grandma's accident was

502
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,419
such a long time ago.

503
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:22,881
There were no CCTV cameras
anywhere near the scene.

504
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,050
No witnesses nor any clues.

505
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,346
So it was impossible to find out
where the car had come from.

506
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,807
But if something happened

507
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,727
between Chairman Han and your father

508
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,312
and Chairman Han left in a car,

509
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,691
he may be the person who hit my grandma.

510
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,197
I think we should go
to Seopyung DPO. Let's go.

511
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,701
PROSECUTOR AN YU-JUN
INVESTIGATOR KIM JU-HYUNG

512
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:58,499
The case files are a mess.

513
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,336
Most interviews were omitted.

514
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,587
Is that okay?

515
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:06,674
The prosecutor gets to decide
what goes on record.

516
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,969
Was there really
an important visitor that day?

517
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,472
According to the factory employees'
statements in the case files,

518
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:15,516
there were no scheduled appointments
or visitors that day.

519
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,190
But the person
who asked the witnesses from that night

520
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,651
to lie was Jung Do-woo.

521
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,904
He was Han Young-sik's driver at the time.

522
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,659
That's right.

523
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,703
It's unlikely that he went there alone
on the day of the fire.

524
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,998
But Chairman Han Young-sik had an alibi
on record that he was in his office.

525
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,751
It could've been a lie.

526
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,379
A witness mentioned
only in an early article said

527
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,048
that he had left work late
and heard people arguing.

528
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,218
He's in the prosecution's file too.

529
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,137
But he changed his statement the next day.

530
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,889
He said he was mistaken.

531
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,349
Then we should find him.

532
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:58,643
He died.

533
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,938
About two weeks after the fire.

534
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,816
The cause of death was overworking,

535
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,859
and they didn't investigate.

536
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,570
Darn it.

537
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,657
Anyway, what's with this teamwork?

538
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,201
Why do you know all of this so well?

539
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,330
SEOPYUNG HANJU FACTORY FIRE

540
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,752
I brought this in case
you were interested in Hanju Group.

541
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,716
I investigated all I could
and gave it all to him.

542
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,175
I found out recently

543
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,303
after I gave you the USB drive
about the witness dying.

544
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:38,808
But it was too long ago,
so there were no hospital records.

545
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,061
There wasn't much I could gather.

546
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,522
In other words,

547
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,360
we have to uncover facts
that are not in the prosecution's file,

548
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,155
which we can't find
because it has been too long.

549
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,406
That's right.

550
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:58,953
-Why are you standing up?
-It's like term savings maturing.

551
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,038
What is?

552
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,915
All of this happened in Seopyung.

553
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,335
Let's go cash out.

554
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,068
-My gosh.
-My gosh, Ms. Cho!

555
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,987
-It's been so long.
-How have you been?

556
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,280
When the fire department goes out!

557
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,531
We save lives!

558
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,785
You haven't changed.

559
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,120
If you need anything,

560
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,705
call him anytime.

561
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,291
Mr. An Yu-jun,
a prosecutor at Seopyung District.

562
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,126
Even before the laws were changed,

563
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,713
Seopyung's Fire Department
was allowed to run over

564
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,633
illegally parked cars thanks to Ms. Cho

565
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:57,720
stating there was clear intent
and slamming them with fines.

566
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:01,933
We got really used to that
and our jobs are so comfortable.

567
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,601
Of course.

568
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:06,729
Ambulances and fire trucks
should always go forward.

569
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:10,149
That's not all.
You knew everyone's connections

570
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,568
and covered up
the fire inspection corruption

571
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,987
by higher-ups
so that there were no problems.

572
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:18,074
Is it okay to talk about this?

573
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:20,201
You always say what you want

574
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,953
and then ask if it's okay.

575
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,371
You haven't changed one bit.

576
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,040
Changing isn't good.

577
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,794
Anyway, you were in Seopyung
for almost 15 years, right?

578
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,921
Seopyung is a great place to live,

579
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:34,048
so there couldn't have been
many big fires.

580
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,343
Of course not. Why do you ask?

581
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,847
May we go somewhere and chat?

582
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,723
Sure. Come in.

583
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,061
Her term, savings…

584
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,855
Was with a person.

585
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,488
Yes, I remember the Hanju factory fire.

586
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,949
I was a rookie back then.

587
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:03,119
They say what you see as a rookie
stays with you until you retire.

588
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,831
One person died in that fire, right?

589
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:10,126
Yes. There were many people in the dorm,

590
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,211
but someone had gotten them out safely.

591
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,423
But human beings are strange.

592
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,176
That man deserved a medal
for being a hero,

593
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,761
but it turned out he was the arsonist.

594
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:29,228
Was there anything strange
at the scene of the fire?

595
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,486
The man who died probably died

596
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,406
because he was trapped
when the fire shutter came down.

597
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,660
It was way too late
by the time we found him.

598
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,207
When there is a fire,

599
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,085
most victims are found
by exits and windows.

600
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,172
So it wasn't strange that he was there.

601
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,592
But there was no trace.

602
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,511
Trace?

603
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,348
Whatever the case may be,
if you make it to the fire shutter,

604
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,976
you pat the shutter to look for the door,

605
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,895
bang on it, or something like that.

606
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,272
So that always breaks my heart.

607
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,525
You see handprints on the shutter
and traces of the victims

608
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,944
trying to get it open.

609
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,154
But…

610
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,079
there was nothing like that
on the shutter.

611
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:33,751
Even if he had spent
all his energy getting there…

612
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,921
But that couldn't have been.

613
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,506
He was lying down too straight.

614
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,801
But since it was arson,

615
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,219
I assumed

616
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:46,472
the cops would get an autopsy
or something and figure it out.

617
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:50,518
SEOPYUNG FIRE DEPARTMENT

618
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,145
I never heard anything about an autopsy.

619
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,730
My uncle had moved my father

620
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,108
to Hanju Hospital
before the police even arrived.

621
00:37:57,191 --> 00:38:00,111
You can require an autopsy
regardless of where the body is.

622
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,862
There was no request made.

623
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,371
What's wrong with the chief prosecutor?

624
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,666
Why does he want pictures
of his junior prosecutor on sick leave?

625
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,294
What if this is considered surveillance?

626
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,049
Going to the police was a dead end,

627
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,843
so you'll go to the fire department.

628
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,679
These runts are getting creative.

629
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,055
My gosh. Ms. Cho.

630
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,558
It's been so long.

631
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,851
-How have you been?
-Hold on.

632
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,311
This is Yu-jun.

633
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,772
Who is this jerk?

634
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:41,861
Where have I seen him before?
Does he work at a department store?

635
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:45,197
SEOPYUNG FIRE DEPARTMENT

636
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,710
What? She showed up in Seopyung?

637
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:00,296
Yes. She's gallivanting around town

638
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,672
with two guys.

639
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,299
Are you sure she was the woman

640
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,551
who chased you for the USB drive?

641
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,636
I told you. I'm positive.

642
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,555
Even if you cover your face,

643
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,807
people like us just know.

644
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,518
So? Should I keep tailing her?

645
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,062
Yes, just stay on her for now.

646
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:20,983
Also, have you heard the name
Cho Yeon-ju before?

647
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,526
Cho Yeon-ju?

648
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,446
Hold up. That name sounds very familiar.

649
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,784
That rumor is true?

650
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,037
-Yes.
-What is going on here?

651
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,873
Are you saying you ran the DNA test

652
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:39,502
not to silence the fake rumor,
but to prove it was true?

653
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,880
I couldn't tell you that back then,
but yes, that's correct.

654
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,257
Why are you telling me this now?

655
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,051
I requested a DNA test

656
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,261
using the DNA sample you gave me,
and we're getting the results today.

657
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,180
We're short on time,

658
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,557
so the results will be delivered
to the shareholders' meeting.

659
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,185
I need you to announce it there.

660
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:01,857
That means she'll lose her position

661
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,275
as chairman of Yumin.

662
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,486
No. That's not important.

663
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,655
She'll be taken out in handcuffs.

664
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,031
I called SBC

665
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,742
and planted a reporter
in the shareholders' meeting,

666
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,869
so once you make the announcement,

667
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,080
the world will find out almost instantly.

668
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:21,460
Is it wise to expose this so publicly?

669
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:26,674
We may be humiliated
for being played by that fraud.

670
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,259
Oh, my.

671
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:31,429
I'm actually doing this for you.

672
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,764
You are?

673
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,267
Think of the pros first.

674
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,352
She's the chairman of Yumin.

675
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,188
You can't catch her
if you don't do something public.

676
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,983
Also, the one who lied is at fault.

677
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,277
We're just victims who fell for her lies.

678
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:50,990
That's true.

679
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:54,660
I can't lose something bigger
just to save face.

680
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,664
Then where's my real niece?

681
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,500
The fake should know.

682
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:07,673
The fake may have already
done something to the real one.

683
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,217
It is heinous,

684
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,428
but we don't really need

685
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,472
the real one to show up.

686
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,601
The Prosecutors' Office
should be able to investigate.

687
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,104
What do you think?

688
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,566
If that happens,

689
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:29,570
I'll feel bad, but what can you do?

690
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,656
All her life,
she's been a nuisance to the family.

691
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,493
She is my niece, but I don't feel
attached to her in any way.

692
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:40,456
Anyway, I'll remember
everything you did for me

693
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,584
if we can just
get that con artist locked up.

694
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:53,052
I'm sure there were security cameras
inside the factory.

695
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,721
Even if that was the case,
they'd be gone by now.

696
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,642
Forget the factory workers.

697
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:02,978
Why don't we look for other witnesses?

698
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,731
The factory is in the middle of nowhere.

699
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:08,567
No one went there
unless they worked at the factory.

700
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,320
Someone else was in the area that day.

701
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,823
-Who?
-Me.

702
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,868
My grandmother's accident took place
near the factory,

703
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,787
and I was close by.

704
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,374
Is there anything you remember?

705
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,085
That's the problem.

706
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,462
I was in panic mode that day.

707
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,048
I can barely recall the things
that I used to remember.

00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,930
It's worth a try.

710
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:41,100
It relies on memory,
so it's not admissible in court,

711
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,060
but it may be helpful
for the investigation.

712
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,480
It tends to be very effective
when the person really wants

713
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,731
to recall what happened.

714
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,366
All right. Shall we get started?

715
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,328
Relax. Breathe in and out.

716
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,790
Take a deep breath.

717
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:10,296
We will now dig up your old memories.

718
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,424
Deep in your heart,

719
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,260
are there any images

720
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,263
or still shots of past events

721
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,057
that you are holding on to?

722
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,700
Try to remember what happened.

723
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:47,541
It's the night of October 2, 2007.

724
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:55,132
Clearly, I got my temper from Grandma.

725
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,676
She got mad at me
because I raised my voice at her.

726
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,011
The bus stops running early.

727
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,138
I can't believe she went alone.

728
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,017
It's odd.

729
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,769
What's odd?

730
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,190
The bus stops running early,

731
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,858
and I never see cars on that road.

732
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,235
But I see a car driving by.

733
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,200
And what's even weirder is…

734
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,501
I've never seen
such an expensive car in this area.

735
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,795
What's that car doing here?

736
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,215
What's the car model?

737
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,887
I don't know.

738
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,514
I've never seen that model before.

739
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,308
But the emblem is…

740
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:50,396
It looks like a beetle of some sort.

741
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,482
I see.

742
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:57,403
Now, you can see the license plate number.

743
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,320
Read it out to me.

744
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,657
Five…

745
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,872
Eight. I see eight.

746
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,839
HANJU AUTOMOBILE LAUNCHES
100 LIMITED-EDITION CARS

747
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,345
HANJU AUTOMOBILE

748
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,596
Three, two, five, eight.

749
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,850
With an emblem that looks like a beetle.

750
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:29,935
It was my uncle's car.

751
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,311
HANJU AUTOMOBILE

752
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,021
There were no follow-up articles about it.

753
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,150
And there was never
the limited-edition model.

754
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:37,943
Okay, thank you.

755
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:46,618
The car was scrapped on October 3, 2007.

756
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,328
The day after the incident.

757
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,415
Chairman Han Young-sik
hit my grandmother with his car

758
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:52,958
while driving alone.

759
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:55,836
And Ryu Seung-duk helped him cover it up.

760
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,130
But there is nothing we can do now

761
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:01,258
if Chairman Han doesn't respond at all.

762
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,051
Too much time has passed.

763
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:06,096
And we have no solid evidence
to prove that he did it.

764
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,682
There's a strategy I use

765
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:11,768
when I have a suspect in mind
but no solid evidence

766
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,313
when I work on old cases.

767
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:15,981
What is it?

768
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:19,902
Attacking them on the blind side.

769
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,657
Usually, we raid them

770
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,743
after securing evidence, right?

771
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:31,914
But we'll launch an attack
without evidence.

772
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,754
What's he doing here?

773
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,222
What brings you here?

774
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:52,392
I only heard about Sung-chan's death later
and couldn't even attend his funeral,

775
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,478
so I wanted to attend this today.

776
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,940
Come in.

777
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:09,993
When you do something bad,
you can't be at peace with it.

778
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,538
You may think you've put it behind you,

779
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:17,042
but when someone brings it up,
the memories come flooding back

780
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,253
and shake you all up,

781
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,046
like a snow globe tossed upside down.

782
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,801
Even though a lot of time has passed,

783
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,302
it still feels like yesterday.

784
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,389
You can never really get over
your loved one's sudden death.

785
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:34,935
I still vividly remember the day
my father passed away.

786
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,772
Didn't you visit

787
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:43,151
the factory in Seopyung
the day he passed away?

788
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,990
It'd throw you off,

789
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:50,826
so you'd suddenly appear out of sorts.

790
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:54,121
What are you saying, all of a sudden?

791
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,416
I was told there was something
suspicious about your alibi.

792
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,003
My alibi?

793
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,593
What did you hear
that you're asking such a question?

794
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:11,179
Do you have proof I was there that day?

795
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,390
No, I don't.

796
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,809
But I don't believe your evidence

797
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,270
that you weren't there that day.

798
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,152
Then you'd do things
that are out of character,

799
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,070
such as visiting your accomplice

800
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,031
you haven't even called in years.

801
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,911
I don't know
why I have to explain myself now,

802
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,957
but will you believe me
if I bring a witness you can trust?

803
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,543
Is there such a witness?

804
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,503
Ms. Kim.

805
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,342
You visited my office

806
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:51,845
around the time of the accident,
saying you had a message for me.

807
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,149
Yes, I did.

808
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,153
No, like a double agent.

809
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,865
I was also close
to Chairman Han Young-sik.

810
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:22,250
Seung-wook, can you leave?

811
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,753
This is the anniversary
of Sung-chan's passing.

812
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:27,839
Must you be this disrespectful
to my father on a day like this?

813
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:34,721
Darn it. I'm tired.

814
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,352
I wanted to ask you about it at least once

815
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:42,104
to see

816
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:45,232
how you remember the incident.

817
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,278
Sorry I interrupted you.

818
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,505
What are you up to these days?

819
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:10,674
Just working, as usual.

820
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:11,800
"As usual"?

821
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:14,469
You're a prosecutor.
Your "usual" should be

822
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:18,098
being stuck in your office,
going through all the documents.

823
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,809
Are you a mole?
Why are you digging and snooping around?

824
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,437
I'm not following, sir.

825
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,521
Look at you.

826
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:26,815
You little…

827
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,279
What is this?

828
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,364
Isn't this you?

829
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,032
I'm not sure.

830
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,409
You little…

831
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:38,994
What are you playing at here?

832
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,749
Take a good look.

833
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,169
Ms. Cho!

834
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,589
-Long time no see.
-My gosh.

835
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:51,965
Why did you do it?

836
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,759
Did Cho Yeon-ju put you up to it?

837
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,679
I would never accept such a request.

838
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:58,722
What?

839
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,563
Kiddo, you're just a junior prosecutor.

840
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,607
Do you think this organization is a joke?

841
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,692
I'm the chief prosecutor, you know.

842
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,738
I hear your family is pretty well-off.

843
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,074
I suppose that's why
you can be this gutsy.

844
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,868
But do you think

845
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:23,371
any company in this country
can survive a tax investigation?

846
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,750
Do you want your family and relatives

847
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,920
to be turned upside down?

848
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:35,467
If you behave recklessly,
you might destroy your entire family.

849
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,053
Stop here.

850
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,349
Answer me.

851
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,983
Why you little…

852
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,988
Hey. Don't you know who I am?

853
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,699
I am the Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

854
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,494
Everything I bury remains buried.
Understood?

855
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,332
Snoop around all you want.

856
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,502
Do you think things will go your way?

857
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:14,589
That's not why we're doing this.

858
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,925
We're okay if they don't.

859
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,510
What?

860
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:23,139
So you're going to keep playing this game?

861
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,482
Answer this.

862
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:36,403
When you summoned Chairman Kang Mi-na,

863
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,239
who was the person that came?

864
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,449
Kang Mi-na…

865
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:44,828
or Cho Yeon-ju?

866
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:54,170
What is Cho Yeon-ju up to now?

867
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:59,092
Did you think
I wouldn't put a tail on her?

868
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:07,767
Why did Seung-wook suddenly show up
and talk nonsense?

869
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,978
No idea.

870
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:12,314
How could he ruin our party like this?

871
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,773
Hey.

872
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,318
A memorial service for my son
is not a party.

873
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,153
How can you be so insensitive?

874
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,323
We must have
left Seung-wook alone too long.

875
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,867
He'll be taken care of
along with Mi-na soon.

876
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,703
Seung-wook and Mi-na…

877
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,123
No, the woman who pretends
to be Mi-na fooled everyone.

878
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,168
What are you talking about?

879
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:35,670
I can't tell you right now,

880
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:38,465
but you'll see
after the shareholders' meeting.

881
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,969
I knew we probably couldn't stay
until the service ended

882
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,220
because of the meeting.

883
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,431
Let's get going.

884
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:59,986
Look at you.
To think you're the only son I have left.

885
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,237
My goodness.

886
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:06,868
Until when did you drink last night?

887
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,746
You haven't done this in a while.
What's with you?

888
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,456
An irresponsible life

889
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,291
suits me better, don't you think?

890
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:16,586
What's going on? Are you high?

891
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:18,546
If I do use drugs,

892
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:21,091
it's not because I want to.

893
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:23,426
It's because my sister wants me to.

894
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,553
What are you talking about?

895
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:28,890
Hey, you should sober up.

896
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:31,726
Thanks to your wife,
you got the opportunity of a lifetime.

897
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,144
In front of your father…

898
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,354
An opportunity?

899
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:39,025
Didn't you hear what Sung-hye said?

900
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,820
Everything is over.

901
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:46,074
Is this about the rumor about Mi-na?

902
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,995
That rumor saying
Chairman Kang Mi-na is fake.

903
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:51,705
Are you saying it's true?

904
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:54,749
Why is everyone talking nonsense today?

905
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,751
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

906
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,628
Mi-na unlocked her tablet

907
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:01,464
with her fingerprint and everything.

908
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,925
So I thought it was a groundless rumor.

909
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:06,845
I did think something was off.

910
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,432
You mentioned that
she had a thorough health check-up

911
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,100
after the accident

912
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:14,978
and her ovaries
were extremely healthy, right?

913
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,104
What about it?

914
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:19,941
She once told me she was infertile.

915
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,069
What?

916
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,239
If that rumor is true…

917
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:32,495
Who have I been telling
all those secrets to?

918
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,874
And who have I been buttering up
all this time?

919
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:38,793
Hey!

920
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,421
Who cares?

921
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,758
A woman I don't even know

922
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:46,968
twisted my arm, insulted me,

923
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:48,887
and walked all over me!

924
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:52,724
I can't believe this.

925
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,810
What is going on?

926
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:49,447
In addition to the stock transfer,

927
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:52,784
I have another important announcement
to make today.

928
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:57,413
There have been many
horrible rumors going around

929
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,791
about Chairman Kang Mi-na
of Yumin Group lately.

930
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,418
More than anything,

931
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:05,588
people have been saying
that the chairman is fake.

932
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:12,971
Faced with this crisis,
after much thought,

933
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:16,808
we've decided to
tackle the situation head-on.

934
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:23,982
May I say something?

935
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:27,694
Is it really necessary to bring up
those groundless rumors here?

936
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:30,697
If they're not true, wouldn't it be best

937
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,323
if you proved that to everyone?

938
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:36,703
Kang Jang-soo,
the former chairman of Yumin Group,

939
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,913
and Kang Mi-na,
the current chairman of Yumin Group.

940
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:45,712
Their paternity test results just arrived.

941
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,969
How did you carry out the test?

942
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,972
My father's body
hasn't been retrieved yet.

943
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,557
You're right.

944
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,518
But the vacation home
that my brother often visited

945
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:03,605
still remains intact.

946
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,274
We were too busy to clean up the place,

947
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,359
but it was a good thing after all.

948
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:13,114
I collected his razor
and toothbrush from there.

949
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,533
As for Chairman Kang Mi-na,

950
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:16,951
for some reason,

951
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,913
she seemed to be away all the time.

952
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:23,208
So her samples were collected

953
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:27,837
through a member of Hanju Group,
who she currently lives with.

954
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,803
Mr. No, what do I do?

955
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,722
Should I run away?

956
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:40,225
That would look strange.

957
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:49,400
Apparently, the test revealed

958
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:53,905
an extremely important fact
that couldn't be overlooked.

959
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:57,492
So I'd like to ask
Chairman Kang for an explanation here

960
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,370
and hold her responsible.

961
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,666
To prevent any suspicion

962
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:08,920
of tampering with the results,
I'll open the envelope here.

963
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:19,264
STR ANALYSIS AND PATERNITY TEST RESULTS

964
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:23,560
I know you're all busy.
I'll go straight to the important part.

965
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:29,107
"An analysis of 15 DNA markers

966
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:32,026
of Kang Jang Soo and Kang Mi-na reveals

967
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:37,282
that they share 14 out of 15 alleles…"

968
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:43,746
Well…

969
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,292
Give me a second.

970
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:48,876
What?

971
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:52,088
What are you waiting for? Read on.

972
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,256
Okay.

973
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,723
"Based on the amount of DNA
shared between the two,

974
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,517

GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS

01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:36,758
What did you just say?

982
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,178
I mean…

983
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:42,722
Why?

984
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,350
I'm Chairman Kang Jang-soo's
biological child?

985
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,157
EPILOGUE

986
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,825
Five…

987
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:04,702
Eight?

988
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,873
Eight. I see eight.

989
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,710
Open your eyes slowly.

990
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,923
I think I see someone.

991
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,843
Grandma?

992
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,555
Grandma.

993
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,351
Don't go, Grandma.

994
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,644
Don't go.

995
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:36,234
If I had stopped my grandmother

996
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:37,443
from going that day,

997
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,862
she'd still be alive today.

998
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:45,118
It really was purely because of me.

999
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:48,746
Hold on.

1000
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:50,915
I think she has something to say.

1001
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:52,875
Should we wait?

1002
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:22,905
Grandma.

1003
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,617
Grandma.

1004
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,009
Grandma.

1005
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:47,513
Yeon-ju, is that you?

1006
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:50,892
Grandma.

1007
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:55,521
Grandma, don't go.
If you go now, something bad will happen.

1008
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:57,815
I have to.

1009
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:01,277
Your father is beside himself right now.

1010
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,447
Don't go. If you go now, you'll die.

1011
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,994
I still have to.

1012
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:13,623
Even if you try to stop me, I must go.

1013
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:16,501
I'll be right back. See you.

1014
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:18,669
No, don't go.

1015
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:22,298
You'll die because of me.

1016
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:24,467
How can I possibly die because of you?

1017
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:28,346
You got your temper from me.

1018
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:31,974
Even if you try to stop me,
do you think I'll listen?

1019
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:35,186
I have to go and stop my son

1020
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:36,979
from getting in trouble.

1021
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:38,940
You can't.

1022
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,275
If you go now,

1023
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:43,736
I'll be miserable for the rest of my life.

1024
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,614
You'll die because of me,

1025
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:48,241
and I'll blame and resent myself

1026
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,492
for the rest of my life.

1027
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:50,576
Will you still go?

1028
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:55,081
My goodness. I knew you'd be like this.

1029
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,876
If you were someone great,

1030
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,671
like those gold medalists on TV,

1031
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:05,925
you'd listen to me and do as I say.

1032
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:09,554
But you're just my granddaughter.
That's why you won't listen.

1033
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:13,432
Yeon-ju.

1034
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:16,936
Nothing in the world happens

1035
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:19,897
purely because of other people.

1036
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,900
Everything happens because of you.

1037
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:27,530
The same goes for me and your father.

1038
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:29,532
Do you understand?

1039
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:39,959
A fire breaks out

1040
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,420
because someone starts it.

1041
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:44,589
A car accident happens

1042
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:47,842
because someone drives poorly.

1043
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:50,052
Whether you live a good life

1044
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,679
or a bad life depends on you.

1045
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:55,683
You've done enough.

1046
01:04:55,766 --> 01:04:58,853
From now on, live for yourself.

1047
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:03,357
I do have a good life.

1048
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:06,319
I became a prosecutor.

1049
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,572
And the factory fire

1050
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:13,326
wasn't started by Father.

1051
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,423
You've made it, my sweetie.

1052
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:31,761
See? I told you.

1053
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:34,722
Your father may lose his temper
and hit someone once in a while,

1054
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:37,767
but he would never start a fire.

1055
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:42,438
Grandma. I'll find out

1056
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:47,818
who did that to you.

1057
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:53,741
I'll also prove my father's innocence.

1058
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:58,996
So don't worry and get going now.

1059
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,459
Okay.

1060
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:06,712
I will.

1061
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:57,972
Put these on.

1062
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,060
Grandma.

1063
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:44,120
It's regrettable that Hanju Group

1064
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:47,123
provided my DNA samples
without my consent.

1065
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:48,791
I don't want you to be my enemy.

1066
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:50,584
My father got rid of my sister,
and I survived.

1067
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:52,878
Do you think that's because of me?
It's because of that woman.

1068
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:55,548
Let me be a part
of the game that you started.

1069
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:57,383
Don't do anything stupid again.

1070
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:59,468
What you're attacking is my company.

1071
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,178
I've been trying so hard for nothing.

1072
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:03,931
I begged for something
that was never going to be mine.

1073
01:09:04,014 --> 01:09:07,059
Are you sure you doted on me?
You were only going to use me.

1074
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,186
I'll have Chairman Han Young-sik arrested.

1075
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:11,313
Get rid of Cho Yeon-ju.
