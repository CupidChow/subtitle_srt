1
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:42,125
There must have been a misunderstanding.

2
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,252
Then eat them.

3
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,631
Eat the nuts.

4
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,255
Gosh, this is boring. Should we stop here?

5
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,968
I ran another paternity test
with your hair.

6
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,889
Did you come back here to take revenge?

7
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,768
Do you still think I'm a bad person?

8
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:45,104
Who's the one that's been
fooling me all this time?

9
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:54,197
This pathetic life is over now.

10
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,492
Say that again. What did you just say?

11
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,328
Do you ever feel any kind of emotion?

12
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,997
You creep me out sometimes.

13
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,960
What if he comes home with a baby one day?

14
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,088
I had no idea she was born out of wedlock.

15
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,261
I just need a face
that looks completely different.

16
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,847
So different…

17
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,099
that no one can recognize it.

18
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,903
Ma'am, she will serve you from now on
whenever I'm not around.

19
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,197
I'm Kim Eun-jung.

20
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,657
Give these

21
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,993
to Mr. Jung outside.

22
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,829
"The probability of paternity

23
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:47,667
is 99.9999 percent."

24
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,192
She left just now.

25
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,612
Get her.

26
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,044
Where do you think you're going?

27
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,173
What's wrong?

28
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,591
Are you all right?

29
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,719
What are you waiting for? Help her up.

30
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,305
Is everything okay?

31
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,561
Run, now!

32
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,024
Stop!

33
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,194
-Get her!
-Stop there!

34
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,591
Why you little…

35
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,346
HANJU

36
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,869
Get in, Ms. Kang Mi-na.

37
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,799
What happened?

38
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,183
I need to make sure it's you.

39
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:14,772
What's the thing that Ms. Kim acquires
through a secret route every year

40
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,317
and hides next to the kitchen hood
at Chairman's house?

41
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,194
Sun-dried gochugaru from Andong?

42
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,780
So you really are Ms. Kang Mi-na.

43
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,951
Did you send that flash drive
to Seung-wook?

44
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,786
-Yes.
-You should've left right after.

45
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,830
That's the basic rule of spying.

46
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,415
Why did you stay there?

47
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,459
There is something
no one knows about Sung-hye.

48
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,002
-We must uncover--
-Where is she?

49
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,920
Gosh, those punks.

50
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:40,923
Stop!

51
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,686
Just a second.
Seung-wook will be here soon.

52
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,646
How did you know to come here?

53
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,943
She's near Han Sung-hye.

54
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,403
Is there anyone

55
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,239
who showed up near her
right after the accident?

56
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,704
What brings you here?

57
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,961
She got a new female personal assistant.

58
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,255
-A personal assistant?
-Yes.

59
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,261
Hey, Yu-jun.

60
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,806
I put a tail on Samgeori Gang,

61
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,892
and some of the members
are heading to Hanju Group with weapons.

62
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,520
What? Okay.

63
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,899
Han Sung-hye's thugs
are heading to Hanju Group.

64
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,027
After sending this to us,
something might have happened.

65
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,321
-Let's go there.
-I'll call my uncles too.

66
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,414
I should have gone in instead of him.

67
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,792
But he insisted
saying he knew the building well.

68
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,045
He'll be fine.

69
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,089
What?

70
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,259
Seung-wook is tougher than he looks.

71
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,011
"Seung-wook"?

72
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,149
Was it you who was getting in my way?

73
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,278
Turn yourself in, please.

74
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,116
My father, Yeon-ju's grandmother,

75
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,993
Lee Bong-sik and Jang Seok-ho.

76
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,078
How far are you planning to go?

77
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,831
Do these names make you feel anything?

78
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,750
Next time,
it may be a name familiar to you.

79
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,045
Losing one person is enough.

80
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,672
You mean your father?

81
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,760
You're not my family anymore.

82
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,847
A person like you
doesn't even deserve the law.

83
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,434
Stop talking about family already.

84
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,854
Let me warn you
one last time as your family.

85
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,273
Stay out of this.

86
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,196
Han Sung-hye!

87
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,964
Even if he's a better fighter
than I think,

88
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,467
there's something
most people don't understand.

89
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,513
Your energy level drops
after fighting for five minutes.

90
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,098
That's why boxing matches have rounds.

91
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,477
I'm worried. I'll go in.

92
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,064
Stay in the car, okay?

93
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,742
Look who's here.

94
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,662
We meet so often
that I'm becoming attached to you.

95
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,206
Are you alone?
Where did the other girl go?

96
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,256
What are you waiting for? Get her!

97
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:12,760
Run!

98
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,137
Gosh.

99
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,606
-We got you.
-Why did you have to run?

100
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,615
Not so fast!

101
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,785
Mi-na!

102
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,706
-What's going on?
-Let's run!

103
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,296
It's perfect for grabbing.

104
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,133
Mi-na.

105
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,011
Mi-na. Wake up.

106
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,058
Mi-na.

107
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,435
I'm glad you're here.

108
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,854
I'm Cho, a prosecutor
with the Central District. Get them.

109
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,314
Get the ones who fled! Hurry.

110
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,568
What are you doing?

111
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,995
YUMIN HOSPITAL

112
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:37,970
What happened?

113
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,557
They have a detention warrant,
so I can't get her out.

114
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,059
Even though Mi-na showed up?

115
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,810
But look at her.

116
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,189
Han Sung-hye is saying
they were protecting Mi-na,

117
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,233
and that Yeon-ju took her from them.

118
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,861
It's a real mess.

119
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,780
How is she?

120
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,740
She's still unconscious.

121
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,662
Thankfully, Mr. An was headed there.

122
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:06,540
So he took everyone
from Samgeori Gang to Seopyung.

123
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,959
However…

124
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,046
I'm telling you, sir.

125
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,507
Back when we were in Seopyung
with Cho Yeon-ju,

126
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,634
we had such a big grudge
lodged in our hearts,

127
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:20,054
that we took it out on her later.

128
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,431
Why would you have a grudge against her?

129
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,933
Of course, we do.

130
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,726
We're all equal Seopyung thugs,

131
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,021
but she took money from the World Cup Gang
and had their backs.

132
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,233
But she ignored our Samgeori Gang
because we didn't pay her.

133
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,152
How could we not hold a grudge?

134
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,612
I'm very upset right now.

135
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,781
I'm so upset.

136
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,036
That's how Han Sung-hye got out of it.

137
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,957
And Yeon-ju is being criticized
for having ties to a gang.

138
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,420
Shouldn't you leave for the US right away?

139
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,338
No, I can't leave.

140
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,549
Sung-hye has lost her mind.

141
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,467
Forget everyone she has killed so far.

142
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,554
I think she'll kill anyone
who gets in her way.

143
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,013
We can't let her be.

144
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,350
This is seriously insane.

145
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:16,068
Who is she that
Yeon-ju wants us to stand guard here?

146
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,737
Who is she, that the rich boy

147
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:23,200
ran over to her and saved her
while Yeon-ju was being taken away?

148
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,286
As her uncles, we have to do something.

149
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,080
You and your rich boy.

150
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,583
Stay out of their business.

151
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,585
They'll take care of it.

152
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:37,840
Yeon-ju was taken to the station,
and I heard her license was suspended.

153
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,301
I know we weren't that good to him,

154
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,012
but he can't do that to her. I mean…

155
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,141
Hello, sir.

156
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,519
So…

157
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,564
Yes, Uncle?

158
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,857
The thing is…

159
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,944
I didn't get a chance
to talk to you about this.

160
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,532
I feel like I've said many things
that might have offended you.

161
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,328
If I did, I truly apologize, sire.

162
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,413
I mean I apologize, sir.

163
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,958
What do you mean? I wasn't offended.

164
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,630
I am relieved, sire. I mean, sir.

165
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,217
I think Pil-kyu
would like to say something…

166
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,430
What are you doing?

167
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,203
There is something
no one knows about Sung-hye.

168
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,538
We have to uncover--

169
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,297
Thank you for your service.

170
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,642
Okay, then.

171
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,479
The highest probability was

172
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,898
Mi-na fleeing the country.

173
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,316
Then out of nowhere,

174
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,819
Yumin announced a DNA test.

175
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,613
Please stop it already.

176
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,907
They announced that she was really her.

177
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,576
So why would they do that?

178
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,120
They say it was to silence the rumors.

179
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,957
But the real Mi-na was determined

180
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,709
to be an imposter.

181
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:41,922
That means Yumin knew
that she was an imposter.

182
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,217
The test result said
it was really her because

183
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,886
the ones keeping the imposter

184
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,597
were also hiding the real Mi-na.

185
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,057
Which means…

186
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:57,897
the culprit who was hiding the real Mi-na

187
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,857
was none other than…

188
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,414
Look here, Ms. Kang Eun-hwa.

189
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,625
What are you scheming?

190
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,252
Where's your niece, my daughter-in-law?

191
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,463
What are you talking about?

192
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,298
Don't play dumb. I'm onto you.

193
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,009
Where's Kang Mi-na?

194
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,428
Why are you screaming? Have some class.

195
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,430
And why are you showing up now

196
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,932
when it's all over?

197
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,601
All over? What's over?

198
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,854
Don't you watch the news?
I'm about to head over now.

199
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,612
Yumin Group's Kang Mi-na,
the subject of the impersonation case,

200
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,031
finally showed up after going missing.

201
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:55,579
She had received cosmetic surgery
and was being protected by Han Sung-hye.

202
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:59,333
Upon running her fingerprints
and performing several tests,

203
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,668
her identity was confirmed.

204
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,421
-What? Isn't that…
-Cho Yeon-ju, who was impersonating Kang…

205
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,256
Isn't she Sung-hye's assistant?

206
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,883
Her assistant?

207
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,844
She's Sung-hye's assistant?

208
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,513
How long was she with her?

209
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,765
It's been a while.

210
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,017
Does that mean

211
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,395
she had Mi-na with her all along

212
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,481
and teamed up with Seung-wook to dupe me?

213
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,484
Look here!

214
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,778
Your eldest daughter
is a real piece of work!

215
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,947
She completely played me!

216
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,323
My gosh.

217
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,534
Why are you yelling?

218
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,828
-What was that?
-Have some class.

219
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,706
Why are you complaining after being duped?

220
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,377
What is going on here?

221
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,671
What a bunch of thugs.

222
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,762
You make crimes that don't exist
suddenly appear and lock me up.

223
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:57,016
You're more like a magician
than a prosecutor.

224
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,310
Send me to Central District quickly.

225
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,354
Don't leave me here at the police station.

226
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,481
Oh, dear.

227
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,776
Since you're no longer a civil servant,

228
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,946
you have to stay in the holding cell
while you're being interrogated.

229
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,905
What?

230
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,283
Did you feed her?

231
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,411
People complain a lot nowadays
about the rights of the accused.

232
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,039
Get her some gukbap or something.

233
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,667
What's this?

234
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,381
NOTICE

235
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,091
TERMINATION

236
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,677
What else?

237
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,512
It's the result of your evaluation.

238
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,224
This is why we should filter out those
with questionable backgrounds.

239
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,771
Finally, we'll have order
in the Prosecutors' Office.

240
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,147
So…

241
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,983
I got fired as a prosecutor?

242
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,736
By this little notice?

243
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,406
What gibberish is this?

244
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,992
What's wrong with my background?

245
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,870
How long must I put up
with your lame question like

246
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,872
"What does your father do?"

247
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,916
How dare you raise your voice at me?

248
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,628
A prosecutor was arrested for assault
during her suspension.

249
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,421
You should be ashamed of yourself.

250
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,132
What did I do that was wrong?

251
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,760
I fought a gang that threatened
people's lives and finances

252
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,637
seventeen to one and won.

253
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,140
I didn't get hurt at all
and crushed them all.

254
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,059
You should praise me

255
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,520
for leaving a mark as a prosecutor
who caught gangs.

256
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,813
But instead, you fire me?

257
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,857
You punk. You're causing trouble.

258
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,821
You need to cause trouble
in order to be a good prosecutor.

259
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,364
Everyone knows that.

260
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,658
Who doesn't know that?

261
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,454
So why am I the only one being fired?

262
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,249
Even sexual harassers are prosecutors.

263
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,918
Corrupt prosecutors
get promoted the fastest.

264
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,588
You're a corrupt prosecutor too.
You were on the front page.

265
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,133
So why am I the only one getting fired?

266
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,134
What?

267
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,803
"Did your father not do anything great?"

268
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,556
At least you know.

269
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,143
You're right.
Causing trouble is irrelevant.

270
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,856
Whose side you're on is what matters.

271
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,693
If you wanted to live a better life,

272
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,237
why didn't you find
a rich family to depend on?

273
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:23,078
Take it from someone
with more life experience.

274
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,248
Stand down.

275
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:34,339
Forget it. Just leave, mister.

276
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,050
What? Mister?

277
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:42,014
I showed respect and called you sir
only because I was a prosecutor.

278
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,391
But I'm fired now.

279
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:48,103
Now, you're just an old man that I know.

280
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,396
You little…

281
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:52,941
You see, I've been through
a lot more than you have.

282
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,069
You have no right to lecture me
just because you're older than me,

283
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,696
so just leave.

284
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,451
Mister.

285
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:15,589
Hey! When I go out, I can easily get girls
who are much younger than you,

286
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,382
and they call me "babe".

287
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,803
Cancel the gukbap.

288
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,307
Babe, my foot.

289
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,894
Bye, mister.

290
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,146
I can't see you out today, mister.

291
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,481
Bye, mister!

292
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,651
That jerk.

293
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,742
I was going to drag her here,

294
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:47,412
but the cops suddenly showed up,
and others jumped in too.

295
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,456
It got a little complicated.

296
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,333
Yes.

297
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,544
We'll take care of everything
when things die down.

298
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,629
Okay.

299
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,466
How rude.

300
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,012
At times like this,
I wish I had Do-woo around.

301
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:05,931
What a lowlife.

302
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,433
Hanju Group has appointed
Han Sung-hye, CEO of Hanju Hotel,

303
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:12,104
as the new chairman of the group
through an emergency board meeting.

304
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,439
Chairman Han Young-sik,
who is imprisoned at the moment,

305
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,233
will now serve as the honorary chair.

306
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,902
Hanju has officially
transferred the business

307
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:22,072
to the third generation
to get the company back in order.

308
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,577
Is there nothing we can do
to get Yeon-ju out?

309
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,372
I was planning to insist

310
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,375
that she was the victim of a gang assault.

311
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,628
I thought a bunch of gangsters
beating up a prosecutor

312
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,839
would be considered
an extenuating circumstance.

313
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,799
-And?
-It didn't work.

314
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,050
Why not?

315
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,392
Prosecutor Cho Yeon-ju's attorney
previously claimed

316
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,562
that she had been assaulted
by a number of gangsters.

317
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,981
I fought a gang that threatened
people's lives and finances

318
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,524
seventeen to one and won.

319
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:01,194
I didn't get hurt at all
and crushed them all.

320
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:06,074
But in a video that was released today,
Prosecutor Cho Yeon-ju strongly insists

321
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,036
that she fought against 17 gang members

322
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,873
and crushed them all
without getting hurt at all.

323
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:15,959
This video is causing
quite a stir at the moment.

324
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,755
It won't be easy to get her out,

325
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,590
unless through the back door.

326
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,384
The entire nation
is criticizing her at the moment.

327
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,262
Would it be okay
to use connections to get her out?

328
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:30,098
If the entire nation
is already criticizing her,

329
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,267
then at least it can't get worse.

330
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,326
What do you think? Isn't it nice?

331
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,411
I don't know. I didn't see it.

332
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,497
You saw it.

333
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,582
You saw it too.

334
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,589
Honorary chairman?

335
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,800
Says who?

336
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,512
What were you doing
during the board meeting?

337
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,682
I know how I can get out soon.

338
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,851
But I'll need your help until then.

339
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,105
Me? How?

340
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,233
There are eyes everywhere,
so I can't get out right away.

341
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,319
So I want to gather those
who are still in support of me

342
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,404
and remotely run the company for now.

343
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,659
Just stay focused,
and it's totally doable.

344
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:34,287
I'll need you
to relay my messages to people.

345
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:38,125
Remotely run the company from here?

346
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,259
You mean, like regency?

347
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,679
We will sell our subsidiaries

348
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,223
that are in the red

349
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,352
and merge those that aren't profitable.

350
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,316
-Why don't we downsize--
-Hold on.

351
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,653
I stayed away from downsizing

352
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,947
for a reason.

353
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,825
So if you bring it up like this,
what does that make me?

354
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,078
I didn't know

355
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,581
you had intentionally stayed away from it.

356
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,040
You fool.

357
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,043
When you're the head of a corporation,
you cannot list excuses.

358
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:26,173
Whatever it is,
you must own it and say it's your fault.

359
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,632
I see.

360
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,554
It is all my father's fault.

361
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:40,520
Your fault, not mine.

362
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,482
It is my fault.

363
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,822
Then in the end…

364
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:54,451
Rice chest! Bring me a rice chest!

365
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:58,288
Father, I beg for your mercy!

366
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,749
Have mercy, Your Majesty.

367
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,260
Father, I don't think
I can handle something like that.

368
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,055
What? You fool.

369
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:18,308
And we don't know
how much longer you'll be here.

370
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,726
-Don't make any hasty--
-Why?

371
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,311
Do you think I'll never get out?

372
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,272
Sung-hye is the only one who doesn't know.

373
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,191
but I'm holding her by the leash.

374
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,947
Gosh, seriously!

375
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:36,826
He literally offered to spoon-feed you.
Why did you turn it down?

376
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,913
Your father will still run the company.
You just need to do as he says.

377
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,748
No! I don't want to do it.

378
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,876
You see, this isn't just about you.

379
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,045
What about me? The three of us.

380
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,964
Why won't you do it? I don't get it.

381
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,091
That's enough, Mom.

382
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:54,302
It's not easy to follow orders all day.

383
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,555
That being said, stop taking me
everywhere with you like I'm your maid.

384
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:01,142
She's right. Even just following orders
will be hard enough.

385
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,728
But Father says he has something
to take Sung-hye down.

386
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,897
Then he can quietly
get her ousted on his own.

387
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,649
Why must I be sandwiched between the two?

388
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,445
I don't want to take anyone's side.

389
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,906
You're such a loser.

390
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,325
Do you have no ambition whatsoever?

391
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,493
Can you not think?

392
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:21,079
That's right. I have no ambition.

393
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,581
I just want to live quietly.

394
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,668
I don't want to end up like Sung-chan.

395
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,467
What did he just say?

396
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,096
What does that mean?

397
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,777
Do you remember this?

398
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,992
Do you think this would only happen
to your brother, Sung-chan?

399
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,836
Hey, you're here.

400
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,547
Are you never going to set foot
in the hotel?

401
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,092
Can I return?

402
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,846
If anyone heard this,
they'd think I'm so mean.

403
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,017
I don't have time to manage
every single subsidiary on my own.

404
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,287
What's going on?

405
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,749
You're busy running around
just to save yourself.

406
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,126
Shouldn't we do something
to get your father out?

407
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,711
What can I even do?

408
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,173
I know you're intentionally
doing nothing to help him.

409
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,719
Your dad has something
he can attack you with.

410
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,931
I don't think he's saying that
just to scare you.

411
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,225
Did Father say that?

412
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,769
Don't regret this later.

413
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,938
At least pretend
you're trying to help him.

414
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,357
What are you going to do?

415
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:17,362
He's never been on my side
ever since I was born.

416
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,990
So why must I have mercy on him?

417
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,283
"Mercy"?

418
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,163
What's with this attitude?

419
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,082
Well…

420
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,960
Why don't you figure it out on your own?

421
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:36,548
All my life,
I've tried so hard to figure Father out.

422
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,134
You can't even do this, Mom?

423
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,559
How dare she…

424
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,772
SEOUL GANGNAM POLICE STATION

425
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,650
I intentionally revealed
who the real Kang Mi-na is.

426
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,486
All the reporters are at the hospital now,

427
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,114
so they won't be foolish enough
to do something there.

428
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:05,410
But when I got Kang Mi-na into the car,

429
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,745
she said this to me.

430
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,915
"There is something
no one knows about Sung-hye."

431
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,418
Additional crimes?

432
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,003
I think so.

433
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,506
But I'm stuck in here,
so I can't do anything. Darn it.

434
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:23,261
You'll be released before the case
is transferred to the prosecution.

435
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:24,846
How?

436
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,480
Did she undergo jaw reduction surgery?

437
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,066
My gosh. Where did she get it done?

438
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,569
Oh, boy.

439
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,696
She's neither alive nor dead.

440
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,948
She's just like a zombie.

441
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,742
I have a favor to ask.

442
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,870
A favor?

443
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,456
Look.

444
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:55,877
You teamed up with an imposter
and tried to take over Yumin Group.

445
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,545
Why should I do you a favor?

446
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,883
I'll hand over
all the rights that I acquired

447
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,718
at the shareholders' meeting to you.

448
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,476
Then I guess it's a deal.

449
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,978
Then you haven't suffered
any losses, have you?

450
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:18,149
In that case, please drop
all charges against Ms. Cho.

451
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:23,154
If you want to settle,
we'll accept whatever terms you propose.

452
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:27,534
All I want is for Ms. Cho to get released.

453
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,747
Deal.

454
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,835
Are you saying
you gave all your rights to that woman?

455
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,711
That's not important right now.

456
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,463
Han Sung-hye is out of her mind.

457
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,966
You must get out of here
and bring her down.

458
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,133
Put her behind bars.

459
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,302
The thing is…

460
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,932
I got fired from the prosecution.

461
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,518
What?

462
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:01,025
We had no choice but to release Ms. Cho

463
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:06,072
since Yumin Group
dropped all charges against her.

464
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:11,452
And they were pulling strings too.

465
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:15,039
It might be easier to deal with her
when she's out.

466
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:19,711
Too bad the officers arrived
at that exact moment.

467
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,964
No, I disagree.

468
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:27,260
Imagine what would've happened
if she hadn't been brought in then.

469
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,637
She can deal with a hundred people alone.

470
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:34,183
Without the officers,
she would've completely gone mad.

471
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,312
I personally think the officers arrived

472
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,899
just at the perfect moment.

473
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,734
You must have been baffled

474
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:46,279
that the evidence from 14 years ago
turned out to be useless.

475
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,281
Sorry?

476
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:51,701
I'm not sure if you deserve to be…

477
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,412
Hanju's outside director anymore.

478
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,916
To repay your hard work so far,

479
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,877
an appreciation plaque will do.

480
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,298
Well…

481
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,453
There will be personnel changes
among the senior prosecutors next Monday.

482
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,829
All of a sudden?

483
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,498
It's going to be a bloodbath.

484
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:41,250
Most of them are being demoted.

485
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,062
Hey, mister. Where have you been?

486
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,315
Why the long face?

487
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,067
Hanju Group? What did they say?

488
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:09,028
You can't be
their outside director anymore, right?

489
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,197
Too bad.

490
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,747
What?

491
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,546
Was it you?

492
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:31,551
Did you sneak in here
and steal that flash drive?

493
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,556
Do you have any evidence?

494
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,600
Stop acting tough.

495
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,438
Which of us do you think
is in deeper trouble?

496
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:47,442
Do you think I'll go down
just because I lost that flash drive?

497
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:52,155
You know how things work in this world.
Power doesn't last long.

498
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,741
Even conglomerates depend
on which administration takes power.

499
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:55,867
Me?

500
00:33:56,743 --> 00:34:01,622
As soon as I switch sides,
I'll be back on my feet.

501
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,334
Have you seen
any high-ranking prosecutors go down?

502
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,920
Do you think…

503
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,214
I'll go down like this?

504
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,051
If you don't go down like this,

505
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,761
you will next time.

506
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:18,389
I'll attack you until you do.

507
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,308
You…

508
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,773
Why are you doing this to me?

509
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,566
As I said, your father turned himself in--

510
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:31,903
Do you think
this is just about that fire incident?

511
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,824
The accident
Han Sung-hye caused that night.

512
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,785
In that car accident

513
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,246
that you covered up,

514
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,664
my grandmother passed away.

515
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,377
-What?
-What?

516
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,630
Do I sound too calm?

517
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:56,803
Did you expect me to glare at you,
tremble my hands, and shed tears?

518
00:34:56,886 --> 00:35:00,306
I'm long past that stage.

519
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:05,269
All these years,
I saw your face day in and day out.

520
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:10,274
I imagined unmasking you a thousand times.

521
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,569
I imagined every single step of it.

522
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:20,284
Do you know what makes a great fighter?

523
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,039
Someone who fights without worrying
about their social position.

524
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,251
Someone who has no shame
and has nothing to lose.

525
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:32,255
And you just took away
my position as a prosecutor.

526
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,759
You haven't paid
for anything you've done yet.

527
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,469
Be prepared.

528
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,805
After I make you pay
for everything you've done,

529
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,558
I'll file an administrative lawsuit
and come back here.

530
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,853
Wait right here.

531
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:51,649
See you, mister.

532
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,485
Bye.

533
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,572
Hey.

534
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,991
Why does she keep calling me mister?

535
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,744
She would look just as old as me
without that makeup on!

536
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,422
Gosh, there's no way
I'll win an administrative lawsuit.

537
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,799
I should've done some research
before I bluffed.

538
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,718
That was rash of me.

539
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,470
What?

540
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:27,310
I'm sorry. It's my fault
that you've ended up in this situation.

541
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:30,021
Don't say that. I'm fine.

542
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,064
Who cares if I'm not a prosecutor anymore?

543
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,817
It's no big deal. Can't you see that?

544
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,571
No?

545
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,490
But I'm really fine.
I could work as a lawyer.

546
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,118
It doesn't really suit me though.

547
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,287
How am I going to defend people
who committed crimes?

548
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,122
I'll probably just scold them.

549
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,876
But seriously, you don't have to feel bad.

550
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,921
It was my decision
to keep pretending to be Kang Mi-na.

551
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,256
I did that because I cared about you.

552
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,759
If you keep apologizing,
it'll only hurt me.

553
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,847
Anyway, get some good rest for a few days.

554
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,266
You must be tired after being locked up.

555
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,144
I'll get you some hot tea.

556
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,564
Rest? No way.

557
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:17,193
They must think they can relax
since I'm not a prosecutor anymore.

558
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,488
But there's something they don't know.

559
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,157
You can never win a fight
against an unemployed person.

560
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:27,161
I have all the time in the world
and have nothing to do.

561
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,999
I could keep up with them
even while playing two roles.

562
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:36,128
Imagine what I could do
with all the time and energy I have.

563
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:47,807
That's exhausting.

564
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,810
Gosh, I need a break.

565
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,854
My goodness.

566
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:58,317
Those punks shouldn't have messed with me.

567
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,206
What energy was she talking about?

568
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,493
HANJU GROUP

569
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,828
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR INAUGURATION

570
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,832
Rush the reorganization
that we couldn't do during the merger.

571
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,625
Get rid of everyone at Hanju Hotel.

572
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,003
But there were too many back then.

573
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,339
It's almost 1,000 employees.

574
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,341
Really?

575
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,468
I can fire 1,000 people with my signature?

576
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,724
What an accomplishment, Mr. Gu Jae-hak.

577
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,934
It was a pain for Hanju Construction

578
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,270
because the lot in Pyeongtaek
wouldn't sell to us.

579
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,190
This is all thanks
to our new Chairman Han.

580
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:23,652
Seeing someone I knew
since she was a baby become chairman

581
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:27,948
and show such spirit
makes me feel warm inside.

582
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:29,992
I'm proud of you.

583
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,748
Didn't you graduate college?

584
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,251
-Sorry?
-You're proud of me? You feel warm inside?

585
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:44,840
Those are things someone higher up says
to someone below them.

586
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,178
Yes, ma'am. My apologies.

587
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,354
Wipe.

588
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,400
What should we do about your inauguration?

589
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:05,528
Some say we should forgo it
since the chairman is in jail.

590
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,363
That's more reason to do it.

591
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,407
Yes, ma'am.

592
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:21,544
What brings you here,
Seopyung's ace prosecutor An Yu-jun?

593
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,212
I have good news.

594
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:24,713
What is it?

595
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,550
There will be personnel changes
among senior prosecutors next Monday.

596
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,844
You know my aunt is a manager
in the Ministry of Justice.

597
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:33,097
She says I'm going to be demoted
to coincide with that.

598
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,057
What?

599
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:38,477
I won't be a prosecutor at Seopyung
for much longer.

600
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,395
What?

601
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,564
How is that good news?

602
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,442
This works the best when she's out of it.

603
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:48,696
Other people suffering injustice
energize her like a bolt of lightning.

604
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,531
Are you okay?

605
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,574
Yes, well…

606
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:56,620
If I'm going to be demoted anyway,
I might as well use it for good.

607
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,913
But…

608
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,375
What about the retrial?

609
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,004
First, they'll determine

610
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,923
whether or not Jung Do-woo
really committed the crime.

611
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,051
If they are convinced
that Kang Myung-guk didn't do it,

612
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,553
he'll be acquitted.

613
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,639
Then there will be a trial
regarding Jung Do-woo.

614
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:19,518
Without him, that trial will be a joke.

615
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,897
"You confessed, so you're the killer."

616
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,982
Is it impossible
to flip the result based on

617
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,984
our gut feelings
and the evidence we've gathered?

618
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,778
We need evidence that is admissible
and carries weight in court.

619
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,822
It's true that we don't have much.

620
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:35,284
That security video was just bait
to start the reinvestigation.

621
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:41,790
Why is that guy Jung Do-woo
so devoted to Han Sung-hye?

622
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,252
According to the bank records
Mi-na sent us,

623
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,255
she had sent him money regularly
for many years.

624
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:52,968
If they go that far back,
it won't be easy to get him to flip.

625
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:56,013
Once in a while,
there are people close to the perp

626
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,849
who suddenly volunteer
to provide critical testimony.

627
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,059
From what I see,

628
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:04,146
they don't testify
out of a sense of justice or anything.

629
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,856
Then?

630
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,776
They either realized later on
that they had been duped

631
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,736
or became bitter later on.

632
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,154
That was when they came forward.

633
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,157
I'm sure Jung Do-woo

634
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:18,285
would totally flip on her
if he knew what she was like.

635
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,830
Forget that. There's no time for this.

636
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,251
Seung-wook. Meet with Mi-na.

637
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,711
Talk to her doctors
to find out how she's doing too.

638
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,338
Yu-jun. Meet with Jung Do-woo

639
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,340
-and keep testing him.
-Okay.

640
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,883
I have somewhere to go too.

641
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,718
Anyway, let's meet up later.

642
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,894
Thank you.

643
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,522
She had been in a state of shock
since yesterday.

644
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,233
You know her very well.

645
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,235
Not really.

646
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,445
But you know, right?

647
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:56,574
The less you know the other person,
the more impact you have.

648
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,626
I got a call from the company.

649
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:12,214
They said to get permission from above
if I want to come visit you.

650
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,592
-From above?
-Sung-hye.

651
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,093
She says she's above me.

652
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,762
Do you know what she says?

653
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:22,349
She says she can't show you mercy.

654
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,560
She wants to be on top of us.

655
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:29,023
You won't get out of here easily.

656
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,358
What's wrong with her?

657
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,945
Why were you so mean to her
all these years that she's…

658
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:40,451
It is your own fault
that we're in this mess.

659
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:41,994
Back then and now.

660
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,539
You must stay strong.

661
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,751
It's your own fault.
All of this happened because of you.

662
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,503
This is so you.

663
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:55,007
You think only of yourself
whenever the opportunity arises.

664
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,136
It was because she knew me too well.

665
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,389
Because she was so much like me.

666
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,684
Just like you and Sung-woon's wife.

667
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,776
I need to see Seung-wook.

668
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:16,445
My kids

669
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,781
can't save me.

670
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,336
Your dad has something
he can attack you with.

671
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,755
I don't think he's saying that
just to scare you.

672
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,716
What does he have?

673
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,809
Who did you say visited Father?

674
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:00,614
Hey, old lady. Let's chat.

675
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,158
Hey. Stop.

676
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:06,829
-Where is she going?
-Hey.

677
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:08,747
Stop.

678
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:16,505
Hey. Where are you going?

679
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:39,611
I've been driving
since before you were born, kids.

680
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,865
My driver's license number
has one less digit than yours.

681
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,080
YUMIN HOSPITAL

682
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,585
Who are you?

683
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,844
Move. Please.

684
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,679
But…

685
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,816
When you get old,
you shouldn't just ask for help.

686
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,613
But I have no choice.

687
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,908
Help me.

688
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,081
Straight to the hospital?

689
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:35,751
Okay.

690
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,714
I knew it. My poor dad.

691
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,846
-Get me connected to Lawyer No Hak-tae.
-Yes, ma'am.

692
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,731
You're no longer a prosecutor or anything?

693
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,318
Is that why we're meeting
in a regular visitation room?

694
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,445
Who cares about that?

695
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:06,698
The real killer
is about to weasel out of it,

696
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,283
so we have to do all that we can

697
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,827
while Jung Do-woo
is emotionally vulnerable.

698
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:14,081
I know I didn't do it,
but I don't think he did it either.

699
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,584
You're saying someone high up in Hanju

700
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,962
is framing someone again.

701
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:27,594
In the past,
when I went around collecting debt,

702
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,890
do you know what we did if we thought
the borrower couldn't pay the debt?

703
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,602
We lent them more money.

704
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,022
The larger the debt,
the sooner it comes due

705
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,024
and the sooner
you can take the collateral.

706
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:42,901
What are you talking about?

707
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:46,572
I'm saying what
that person way up there is doing.

708
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:50,367
When things go well
for those who are wicked,

709
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,703
they tend to take things overboard.

710
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,249
If things look good,
it means it's almost over.

711
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,044
Are you comforting me?

712
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,589
It seems you can't expect

713
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,675
to be treated like a parent
if you do nothing for your children.

714
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:09,678
But even a pathetic parent

715
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:13,223
cares about their children.

716
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,517
You're so weird.

717
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:19,146
Who comforts someone
by talking about being a loan shark?

718
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:24,276
There's no life experience
that is utterly useless.

719
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,069
It's a matter of

720
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,322
how well you use it in the future.

721
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:32,909
You have a way of forgiving yourself
for your past acts.

722
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:36,038
Is this how you
beautify your past as a gangster?

723
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:40,250
It was because I was uneducated.

724
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,794
Hence my lack of wisdom.

725
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:47,174
I didn't even realize that it was wrong.

726
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,468
I lied to you,
which I clearly shouldn't have.

727
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:53,847
I just wanted my daughter…

728
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:58,644
to live a good life without me.

729
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:02,731
That's why I made such a mistake,
so could you try to understand?

730
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,862
I'm sure you've seen

731
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:14,159
other dads lying to their daughters…

732
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,788
when teaching them how to ride a bike.

733
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,708
They've let go of the seat,

734
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,460
but they tell their daughters

735
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:24,795
that they haven't.

736
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,924
They'd follow them for a bit

737
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,467
but eventually stop.

738
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:35,430
And watch them ride their bikes from afar.

739
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,729
Could you please think…

740
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:47,859
that's where I was coming from?

741
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:13,009
Why must he be so difficult
and make you come here repeatedly?

742
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,971
I guess he keeps changing his statements.

743
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:17,222
That's who they are.

744
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,684
It must be very stressful
to deal with criminals.

745
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,023
He's my father.

746
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,945
-Pardon?
-He's my father.

747
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:34,322
That man in there, Kang Myung-guk.

748
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,159
I see.

749
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,286
Family is off limits.

750
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,538
My apologies.

751
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:58,388
Chairman Han used this
to record conversations.

752
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,058
It was planted in your father's home
and also in other places.

753
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,061
He had planted it

754
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:08,398
among Han Sung-hye's belongings
on the day of the incident.

755
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,193
Sorry?

756
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,236
He couldn't even trust his own daughter.

757
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:18,617
I suppose he thinks he could use this now.

758
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,285
He asked me to get it for him.

759
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:27,125
All this time,
I thought I should remain neutral,

760
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,376
but I was wrong.

761
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:32,506
I've realized that I did it
because it was easy for me.

762
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,216
It was such a cowardly thing to do.

763
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:38,553
I finally had a wake-up call
upon sensing the danger I was in.

764
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,891
It's wrong to say
I've remained neutral all this time.

765
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,976
I was an accomplice
in all their wrong deeds.

766
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:51,525
Take a listen,
and you'll understand what I'm saying.

767
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:05,747
Taking them like this
can get you into trouble.

768
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:07,374
Don't you know that?

769
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,127
You think you can hide this forever
by not letting me take them?

770
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:14,172
Delaying it for a few days
won't change anything.

771
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:15,632
Let go.

772
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:17,300
Hand them over!

773
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,599
Uncle.

774
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,028
Father, I just

775
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,573
hit someone with my car.

776
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,867
You need to get this sorted out for me.

777
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:45,453
Near the Hanju Fashion factory.

778
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,622
I heard Uncle was there

779
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,416
because of the ledger.

780
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,117
MR. HAN SEUNG-WOOK

781
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:44,179
When you're done,
press the star or the pound key.

782
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:48,433
We have a recording of the situation
from that day, 14 years ago.

783
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:52,812
Hurry over, Mr. No.
I think we can get Han Sung-hye with this.

784
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,399
Your message has been recorded.

785
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,573
I'm sure you remember it.

786
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,408
When you were Kang Mi-na's secretary,

787
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,619
you were ordered to return
to the head office.

788
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,163
That was me.

789
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:13,375
When I saw you
risk your career to return to her,

790
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:17,754
I knew you weren't on our side.

791
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:21,758
But does Seung-wook know…

792
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:27,055
that you once betrayed
Chairman Han Kang-sik?

793
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:37,273
Everyone says you're specialized
in finance and accounting,

794
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:40,151
and you're very close to Mr. Han Kang-sik.

795
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,987
That's why I came to you first.

796
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:44,906
What's the matter?

797
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,618
There's something wrong
with Hanju Fashion's accounting records.

798
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:49,661
HANJU FASHION ACCOUNTING REPORT

799
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:51,413
RECONCILIATION DETAILS

800
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:53,790
What should I do?

801
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,502
Just wait and see.

802
00:54:57,585 --> 00:55:00,588
In this country,
only the employees get hurt

803
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,590
when they get involved in the owners' war.

804
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:09,347
Back then, I had no choice.

805
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,560
My father had been ill for many years.

806
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,981
Right, you had a lot of expenses.

807
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,984
From what I know, it's only worse now.

808
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,946
You have many troublemakers
in your family.

809
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,868
I bet you're already

810
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,328
regretting handing in your resignation.

811
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:52,432
I got off on the wrong foot

812
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,059
when I took over Hanju Group.

813
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,228
I shouldn't have been so harsh on you.

814
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,649
I am deeply regretting
my past decisions these days.

815
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,568
I didn't grow Hanju

816
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:06,488
into what it is today
just to hand it over to Sung-hye.

817
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:10,909
I should've taken care of her long ago.

818
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,664
I need to get out of here.

819
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,459
I have a weapon
that can take her down in one blow.

820
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:24,380
Would you join hands with Yumin
and get me out of here?

821
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,174
A weapon?

822
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,344
You mean the wiretapping device
that looks like a pen?

823
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:33,890
You obviously heard
all the recorded conversations

824
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:36,810
but have just quietly held on to it
all these years.

825
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,144
And now, you want to use it

826
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:41,272
because you don't want to give Hanju
to your daughter?

827
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:46,528
That is called "greed", not "regret."

828
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:49,531
I'm afraid I can't help you.

829
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:51,574
Did you…

830
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,701
hear everything?

831
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,747
Then,

832
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:00,333
you will get Sung-hye, right?

833
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,337
You have to, Seung-wook.

834
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,590
If your father was alive,

835
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:10,844
he wouldn't abandon me like this.

836
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:15,682
At least, I never committed
such trashy deeds like Sung-hye did.

837
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,727
It may be true that
you didn't stoop as low as she did,

838
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,772
but it seems like you're finished now.

839
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,178
What are you thinking about?

840
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,431
"I smell grilled fish."

841
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,267
"I want some too." Something like that.

842
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:03,980
Do you have such a specific craving
even on a day like this?

843
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,732
Of course.

844
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:08,860
If I was someone
who stays depressed for days

845
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:12,489
every time something happens,
I wouldn't have made it this far.

846
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:18,411
Let's just do what we can.

847
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:37,013
Our investigation headquarters
finally reopened.

848
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,016
Some of you have never met before, right?

849
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,893
Let me introduce each of you briefly.

850
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,436
This is Ms. Kim.

851
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,397
She's staying at my place
for the time being.

852
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:49,776
She knows more than you can imagine
about anything.

853
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:54,489
By any chance, do you know
the secret of the Bermuda Triangle?

854
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:57,200
The Bermuda Triangle?

855
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:01,788
It's the bubbles created
by a large amount of methane gas

856
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,081
that sinks the ship.

857
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:06,709
I believe it's just a natural phenomenon.

858
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:09,045
I knew it.

859
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:10,672
There's nothing she doesn't know.

860
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:14,008
Next, Prosecutor An Yu-jun
from Seopyung DPO,

861
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,260
who's being demoted soon.

862
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,929
The prosecution
is just as brutal as the Mafia

863
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:20,056
when it comes to punishing their traitors.

864
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:23,184
I'm being transferred next week,
so we only have this week.

865
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:27,355
This is our double agent…

866
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:30,316
Hey. Stop calling me that.

867
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,485
He's very irritable, as you can see.

868
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,905
I'm sure you all know Seung-wook well.

869
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:39,117
We don't know when
the real Kang Mi-na will wake up.

870
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,244
Using the voice recorder
that Ms. Kim gave us

871
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,413
and the tip-off from Kang Mi-na,

872
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:46,583
we'll have to corner Han Sung-hye.

873
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:49,043
How about I hold a press conference?

874
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,923
-You?
-There's no one

875
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:57,010
we can trust with the bug.

876
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:00,221
I think it's best
if we reveal it in public.

877
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,141
While working as
the Head of the Legal team,

878
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:06,060
I found out about some wrongdoings
of Hanju Group as well.

879
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:09,397
Are you talking about something like this?

880
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,692
You know, you see this
in movies and on TV all the time.

881
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:15,194
At inauguration ceremonies
or when someone announces

882
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,696
they'll run for the presidency.

883
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:20,033
INAUGURATION FOR CHAIRMAN HAN SUNG-HYE

884
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,118
A crowd gathers.

885
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,042
Han Sung-hye steps onto the platform
and begins a speech.

886
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:34,047
-Gosh, he's heavy.
-Get to it.

887
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:37,467
Her microphone turns off.

888
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:39,802
Through the speakers,

889
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,349
-this recording plays.
-Uncle.

890
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:48,478
People wonder, "What's going on?"

891
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,355
The room is filled with whispers.

892
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:53,024
That's when Mr. No steps in.

893
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:55,401
I'm here to reveal
Hanju Group's wrongdoings.

894
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,028
Let's begin the press conference.

895
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:00,406
Cameras start clicking.

896
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,909
When Han Sung-hye tries to run away,

897
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:06,829
Yu-jun, who has been on standby,
strides to her.

898
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,373
He stands before her and goes…

899
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:10,166
Chairman Han.

900
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:13,044
You're under arrest for murder,
aiding and abetting murder,

901
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:15,088
a hit-and-run, and corruption.

902
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:19,842
You have the right to remain silent
and the right to consult an attorney.

903
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,388
Anything you say
may be used against you in a court of law.

904
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:32,021
That's how we'll get her.

905
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,568
I'll be on the lookout

906
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,946
and give you a sign
when Han Sung-hye shows up.

907
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:43,700
But why isn't Mr. No here yet?

908
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,628
HANJU HOTEL

909
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:56,838
Here she comes.

910
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:00,299
Can you still not reach Mr. No?

911
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,093
He won't pick up his phone.

912
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:03,428
I'll keep calling him.

913
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,893
The receiver cannot be reached.

914
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:15,648
Darn it.

915
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:18,526
Why doesn't this thing work?
I'm getting anxious.

916
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:20,945
-Hey, Dae-chi.
-What?

917
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:23,781
-Hey, Dae-chi!
-What? I'm busy--

918
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:27,702
-That hurts!
-Darn it.

919
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:29,495
What's going on?

920
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:34,917
HANJU HOTEL

921
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:42,633
WELCOME, CHAIRMAN HAN SUNG-HYE

922
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:55,980
Why is she coming here?

923
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:21,839
Darn it.

924
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:26,844
The receiver cannot be reached.

925
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:40,817
There's more.

926
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:10,888
EPILOGUE

927
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:13,683
Anyway, be careful.

928
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,478
Han Sung-hye is out of control now.

929
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,606
Being in prison
doesn't guarantee your safety.

930
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:23,943
By the way, people say

931
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:27,697
prosecutors are just like thugs.

932
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:29,657
To me,

933
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,617
it seems like conglomerates are the same.

934
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:35,079
Especially those who got to the top
by getting rid of anyone

935
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:40,793
who gets in their way
are exactly like us thugs.

936
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:43,880
When you always have to act tough

937
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:45,506
and intimidate others,

938
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:48,885
do you know how afraid you feel inside?

939
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:54,932
Do you know
how to attack such conglomerates?

940
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:16,787
All this will be over in a few days.

941
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:19,540
In a few days,
will Cho Yeon-ju not exist in the world?

942
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:22,376
Was this his plan all along?
Has he been fooling us all?

943
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,629
Public humiliation?

944
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:26,839
No. We can't use you as collateral
to take such a gamble.

945
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,717
Since I need to
take revenge for myself too.

946
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,844
As long as we get her to sit
at that gambling table,

947
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,804
I can get her to confess.

948
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,640
I said I wanted to kill you myself,

949
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:38,059
and he drugged you just enough
so you wouldn't die.

950
01:05:38,142 --> 01:05:39,477
I told you

951
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,270
that I wouldn't let you
get away with it twice.
