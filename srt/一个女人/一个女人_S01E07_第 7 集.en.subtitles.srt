1
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,957
What do you do when you're by yourself?

2
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,293
Why?

3
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,336
Judging from the way you talk and behave,

4
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,839
you must've been pretty extraordinary.

5
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,842
And the things you do
when you're by yourself

6
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,052
often reveal who you really are.

7
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,973
Why do you want to know
who I am all of a sudden?

8
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,226
I'm curious where you'll be going back to.

9
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,771
I'm also worried

10
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:06,483
if you were involved
with dangerous people.

11
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,526
Are you worried

12
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,945
I might be someone dangerous?

13
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,990
I'm worried you'll be in danger.

14
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:21,498
I'm searching the whole world
using all the resources I have.

15
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,541
You'll be going back soon.

16
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:31,090
By the way, why do you hate hospitals?

17
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,763
If it's not something serious,

18
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,641
I'm wondering if you could
drop off food while I'm here.

19
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:40,725
Why should I?

20
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:45,355
I'll be stuck here for the next few days,
and Mr. No can't visit me.

21
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,483
Do you hate hospitals so much?

22
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,110
Being in a hospital

23
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,445
brings back bad memories,

24
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,073
It's all in the past though.

25
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,951
It's not in the past

26
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,078
if you still hate to be reminded of it.

27
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,623
Fine. If all else fails,

28
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,917
I'll go down to the emergency room
wearing a mask

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,710
and make do with some instant coffee.

30
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,379
You know what?

31
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:13,133
The warmest place in a hospital at night
is the emergency room.

32
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,843
And they have instant coffee there.

33
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,931
It's crowded with people there
around the clock.

34
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,481
I call this "Magic Powder."

35
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,526
Have some when you feel down.
It'll cheer you up.

36
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,028
You know what?

37
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,824
The warmest place in a hospital at night
is the emergency room.

38
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,202
It's crowded with people there
around the clock.

39
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,468
I'll be going now.

40
00:02:58,636 --> 00:02:59,804
Eat well.

41
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,057
Why are you leaving all of a sudden?

42
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,521
Every time we're having a good time,
he suddenly sends me home

43
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,940
or leaves.

44
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,067
What's with him?

45
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,531
He barely even touched his sushi.

46
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,949
What a waste.

47
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,451
Goodness.

48
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,973
"Chairman's Way of Avoiding
Prosecution's Investigation."

49
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,185
"Caught on camera

50
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:50,396
eating sushi in a hospital VIP room."

51
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,732
I knew it.

52
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,236
Look what happened as soon as I left her.

53
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,863
Maybe I should go back
to being her secretary.

54
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,574
What kind of idiot brought food

55
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,910
to someone faking stomach cramps

56
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,495
in the hospital?

57
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,623
Maybe she was too hungry
and threw a tantrum.

58
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:12,001
So what if she threw a little tantrum?
What was this person thinking?

59
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,963
Why couldn't they get her
porridge or something

60
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,089
in case she got caught?

61
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,175
I can't believe
someone so stupid became her secretary.

62
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:21,886
It was me.

63
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,848
-What?
-I'm the one who got her sushi.

64
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,393
I see.

65
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,854
So what happened?

66
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,399
What else?

67
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,985
A swarm of reporters
showed up at the hospital,

68
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,904
and another summons
arrived from Seopyung DPO.

69
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,908
So she pretended
she had recovered quickly and went home.

70
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,286
Did you say that
the prosecutor at Seopyung

71
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,122
didn't seem to be going after Ms. Kang?

72
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,709
Still, is it really okay
to send her to the prosecution?

73
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,588
Come here, punk.

74
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,519
Did you say I grew up like a princess?

75
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,897
Maybe you're right.

76
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,651
But do you think
I still live like a princess?

77
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,739
Once you're thrown out into the world,
you're the same as everybody else.

78
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,036
I should've gotten rid of you
three years ago. What a headache.

79
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,499
You'll regret it if you get rid of me now.

80
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,085
-What?
-You'll never guess

81
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,712
what I know!

82
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,631
It's about your sister-in-law.

83
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,800
Don't you think something is offâ€¦

84
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,262
about Chairman Kang?

85
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,850
So?

86
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:57,065
Kang Mi-na may not be Kang Mi-na.

87
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,775
Is that it?

88
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,155
I have that much information.
What I need is evidence.

89
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,824
Shall we give you a chance?

90
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,161
Bring me evidence,
and I'll spare your life.

91
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,298
Hey.

92
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:25,134
I thought I'd find out
about your investigation in the paper.

93
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,053
But you bothered to say goodbye to us.

94
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,638
I'm honored.

95
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,850
You ran away to the hospital
without saying anything to us.

96
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,311
What a nerve you've got
to wait until you got caught

97
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,314
and then come home only this morning.
And you're going out again?

98
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,858
Have some respect for the Han family.

99
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,736
Your last name isn't even Han.

100
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,696
Stop defending the Han family already.

101
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,697
Then again,

102
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,658
you feel insecure about your background.

103
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,285
That must be why
you're so obsessed with this family.

104
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,495
Mi-na.

105
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,039
Where did you get your eyebrows tattooed?

106
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,332
You weren't even wearing any makeup,

107
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,835
but your eyebrows looked defined
even from a distance.

108
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,045
Do you think this is the right time
to ask that question?

109
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,089
Are you still high?

110
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,134
Cut it out.

111
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,594
She's not in the mood to answer.

112
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,182
After fooling around with so many women,

113
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,476
you seem to understand women so well,

114
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,146
although you're clueless
about what Father thinks.

115
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:23,401
Mi-na, you're just being summoned
as a witness. What's the fuss?

116
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,986
Everything will be fine.

117
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,406
She knows so little about the world.

118
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,575
That's why she fell
for that ridiculous scam.

119
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,328
Right.

120
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,248
I know all your weaknesses.

121
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,584
You shouldn't be treating me
so badly, should you?

122
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,544
Do you think I'll go down alone?

123
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:46,424
After being so mean to me all these years,

124
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,676
aren't you afraid
to send me to the prosecution?

125
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,014
What would you do
if I told them everything I know?

126
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,100
You violated the Narcotics Control Act.

127
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,312
You'll be sued for adultery.

128
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,898
You committed habitual assault.

129
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,110
Unfair trade and the violation
of the Capital Markets Act.

130
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,156
Malpractice and embezzlement
through accounting fraud.

131
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,450
What will be the consequences?

132
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,183
If I said that, I'd get killed,

133
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,019
even before I could step outside the gate.

134
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,981
Let me just say this.
If you get caught on camera again,

135
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:48,110
not only you but also Hanju Group
will be forever stigmatized.

136
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,279
Be careful not to attract attention.

137
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,325
There may already be reporters waiting.

138
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,703
Ask the head of legal to drive your car.

139
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,913
What about me?

140
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,669
There's a car Jae-hee bought
for volunteer work, right?

141
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,798
If you drive that,
no one will know it's you.

142
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,633
Gosh.

143
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,268
Am I supposed to think of this
as volunteer work for Hanju Group?

144
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,831
What?

145
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,837
What are you doing here?

146
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,672
Mr. No told me

147
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,092
that you couldn't be seen
and he was asked to drive your car.

148
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,343
And?

149
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,888
Let me guess. You got scolded
by your family this morning.

150
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,808
You lost your temper and threatened them

151
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,144
to tell the prosecution

152
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,104
all their weaknesses.

153
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,981
What are you talking about?

154
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,525
That thought never even crossed my mind.

155
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,904
Just like when you got caught on camera,
you never know what may happen.

156
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,448
That's why I'm here.

157
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,075
If you're not feeling okay,
do you want me to drive?

158
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,952
You're not used to
driving this car, are you?

159
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,585
SEOPYUNG DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

160
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,420
I checked the missing person's call log,

161
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,132
and she spoke with you the most.

162
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,635
But you can't think of anywhere
she could've gone.

163
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,803
No. Butâ€¦

164
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,097
I heard she showed up
at the prosecutors' office.

165
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,515
What was that about?

166
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,435
I think someone was mistaken.
Maybe it was someone who looked like her.

167
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,854
There are several rumors,

168
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,689
but no one says they saw her personally.

169
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,858
What will happen to the investigation?

170
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,027
Since she's a young woman,

171
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,905
we had taken the runaway angle
in the beginning.

172
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,532
But we've changed our angle now.

173
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,744
-To what?
-When a prosecutor goes missing,

174
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,704
it's often a bad sign.

175
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,666
Are you saying something happened?

176
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,334
You know.

177
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,002
Like being stabbed

178
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,879
by someone they locked up

179
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,464
who held a grudge.

180
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:17,134
Or if a case they were working on
involved high-level corruption

181
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,179
and they are found dead by a river
in a staged suicide.

182
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,931
What are you talking about?

183
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,933
They're just examples.

184
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,518
Everyone said

185
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,646
she probably had many enemies
with her temper.

186
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,023
Well, that is true.

187
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:35,444
Regardless, I think we should consider
those possibilities more.

188
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,447
Things like that happened so many times.

189
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,408
Or she may have been in an accident.

190
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,452
Prosecutors don't usually disappear
into thin air.

191
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,219
Stop speeding.

192
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,930
Stop nagging.

193
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,474
You need to keep up with the flow
when you drive.

194
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,018
I may create traffic if I go slowly.

195
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,817
I said to slow down.

196
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,069
You're going way too fast.

197
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,209
I said to slow down.

198
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,045
I want to, but I can't.

199
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,506
Something's wrong with the brake.

200
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,967
What?

201
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,172
This is Kim Kyung-sin from Seongbuk-dong.

202
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,967
Can you tell me the location of the car
Chairman Kang is driving?

203
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,471
What's wrong with that car?

204
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,265
Ms. Kim, something's wrong.

205
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,018
Yes. We'll head there now.

206
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,138
Darn it.

207
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,940
So this is why they told me
to take this car.

208
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,234
Those lazy Hanju jerks have no creativity.

209
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,445
They tried to kill someone in 2021
by cutting the brake line?

210
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,953
They're blatantly following me now.

211
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,589
Gear down for now.

212
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,923
Reduce the speed a little

213
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,718
and let's crash somewhere
with minimum impact.

214
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,804
If I crash the car, those jerks
on our tail will blame the car.

215
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,222
I can't walk into their trap.

216
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,892
This is why you keep getting
into more and more trouble.

217
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,560
Since when were you so worried about me?

218
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,479
You don't care what happens to me.
You care only about finding Mi-na.

219
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,315
You think I'm looking for her,
for her sake?

220
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,735
Those people will kill you
if we don't find her.

221
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,239
Are you saying
you were looking for her for me?

222
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,618
Careful.

223
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,310
What are you doing?

224
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,853
My head.

225
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,648
What's wrong? Are you all right?

226
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,783
Is that driver drunk?

227
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,576
It's worse.

228
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,827
Maybe they're high.

229
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,828
Let's go after it.

230
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,006
Are you okay?

231
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,175
Hang in there.

232
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,678
The car may spin out of control
at this rate.

233
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,348
I'll take us to the prosecutors' office.
Just hang in there.

234
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,022
What now?

235
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,485
Hang on. Here we go.

236
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:55,597
Hanju Group's daughter-in-law is coming
after trying to evade it.

237
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,433
She wouldn't come through here.

238
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,185
It's either here
or the underground garage.

239
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,604
That's filled with reporters too.

240
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,818
What's that?

241
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,946
Okay. I'm turning off the engine.

242
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,406
One, twoâ€¦

243
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,413
Three.

244
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,977
Out of the way.

245
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,687
Step back.

246
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,824
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

247
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,909
I'm okay.

248
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,831
Darn it. I wanted to sneak in,

249
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,084
not make an entrance.

250
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,128
Let's go. It'll look suspicious
if you stay in here for too long.

251
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,392
Madam Chairman! Please look here.

252
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,605
How do you feel?

253
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,524
-Please give us a statement.
-Stand back.

254
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,858
Stand back.

255
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,610
Stand back, please.

256
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,903
A word, please!

257
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:33,904
What?

258
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,989
Madam Chairman, please give us a word.

259
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,960
Hey.

260
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,760
What happened to you? Are you okay?

261
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,138
I thought something bad
had happened to you.

262
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,348
Do you know me?

263
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,563
Wait.

264
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,730
Do you reallyâ€¦

265
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,482
know me?

266
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,526
Hey.

267
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,493
This was near Seopyung District
Prosecutors' Office this afternoon.

268
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,079
A car weaved through traffic,
changing lanes erratically

269
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,123
and striking a divider.

270
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,333
It was extremely dangerous.

271
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:33,088
Behind this car were police cars
and numerous cars from a security agency.

272
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,426
The person in this car
was Chairman Kang Mi-na of Yumin Group.

273
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,886
Auntie Mi-na rocks.

274
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:43,599
Chairman Yumin Group, who was summoned,
attempted to evade complying.

275
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,475
The security agency carsâ€¦

276
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,353
Who is that standing behind her?
Isn't that Seung-wook?

277
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,483
We were told her driver
was the one behind the wheel,

278
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,069
but a clear explanation was not provided.

279
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,200
Chairman Kang submitted to questioningâ€¦

280
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:05,537
I was going to create a scandal about them
and have them ostracised from society.

281
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,832
But they're digging their own graves.

282
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,880
That stupid fraud.

283
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,633
Where's Lee Bong-sik?

284
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,676
I'll send the boys to get him.

285
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,305
Why did Security follow her?

286
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,473
Ms. Kim told them to.

287
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,767
What?

288
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,811
I apologize.

289
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,065
We found a problem with the car
in the parking lot,

290
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,691
so I told them to follow her.

291
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,195
The car was fine
when I went to do the volunteer work.

292
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,613
What happened?

293
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,156
Scrap the car first.

294
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,450
Okay.

295
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,538
But what about her?

296
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,708
What's the point of scrapping the car
when she's clearly the problem?

297
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,752
Call Seung-wook here now,
so we can find out

298
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,212
what the two of them are up to.

299
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,674
Seung-wook won't come here
just because I tell him to.

300
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,468
Even last time, he came here

301
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,719
because he wanted to.

302
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,264
Then what? Are you saying
we'll sit back and do nothing?

303
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,351
We'll make him want to come here.

304
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,941
INTERROGATION ROOM, SEOPYUNG DPO

305
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:20,070
So you're Kang Mi-na,
the chairman of Yumin Group.

306
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:23,448
And you know nothing
about Prosecutor Cho Yeon-ju?

307
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,326
Who? Prosecutor who?

308
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,869
From what I know, you are Cho Yeon-ju,

309
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,789
a prosecutor
at the Central District Office.

310
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,259
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD, CHO YEON-JU

311
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,177
Cho Yeon-ju?

312
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,687
PROSECUTOR WITH TWO HEARTS

313
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,397
My grandmother?

314
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,698
So I wasn't impersonating a prosecutor.

315
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,034
I wasn't a fraud, after all.

316
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,076
I'm actuallyâ€¦

317
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,370
A prosecutor?

318
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,503
What's wrong?

319
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:24,009
Why, hello there, madam.
Funny seeing you here.

320
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,054
That's why he called me like that.

321
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,223
I was wondering what was going on.

322
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,516
Who knew I'd see you here?

323
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,852
That's why that lady recognized me.

324
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,028
And that's why I'm a good fighterâ€¦

325
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,988
Hold on. That doesn't make sense.

326
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,824
Does the prosecution have

327
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,077
a special recruitment program
for athletes?

328
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,454
What are you talking about?

329
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,878
Is your arm okay?

330
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,130
Yes, it's fine.

331
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,841
Looks like someone
fiddled with the brakes.

332
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,802
Again?

333
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,347
Thank goodness I said I was the driver
and got you out of there.

334
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,140
That was dangerous.

335
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:16,520
By the way, does the Kang Mi-na stand-in
know that prosecutor?

336
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,480
Yes, I think so.

337
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,442
He summoned her to interview Kang Mi-na.

338
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,945
If she admits
that she's not the real Kang Mi-na,

339
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,321
things will get out of hand.

340
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,951
Anyway,

341
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,078
I have no idea what you're talking about.

342
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,663
I'm a prosecutor? Come on.

343
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,916
Is this a new type of sting operation?

344
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,840
Hey! Are you out of your mind?

345
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,685
Old habits don't just disappear overnight.

346
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,896
Only prosecutors care so much

347
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,439
about mere pieces of paper.

348
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,945
Prosecutor Cho Yeon-ju has gone missing,

349
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,656
and the police investigation
will reveal the truth soon.

350
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,492
Anyway, let's begin.

351
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,869
Impersonation and perjury

352
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,620
are serious felonies.

353
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,372
You don't have to be
a prosecutor to know that.

354
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,790
Darn it.

355
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,377
Admitting that I'm Cho Yeon-ju is like
admitting to impersonating Kang Mi-na.

356
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,046
But if I say I'm Kang Mi-na,
then it's perjury.

357
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,340
Mr. Prosecutor.

358
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,635
May I speak with my attorney for a moment?

359
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,935
I knew it.

360
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,479
Apparently, I'm a prosecutor.

361
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,857
I knew it. No wonder I'm so smart. Right?

362
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,650
Prosecutor?

363
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,486
Not someone
who was caught by a prosecutor?

364
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,571
No!

365
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,990
I'm Prosecutor Cho Yeon-ju
at the Central District Office.

366
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,116
Prosecutor Cho Yeon-ju?

367
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,788
That's the prosecutor I wanted to meet.

368
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:00,540
What?

369
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,460
This must've been heavily photoshopped.

370
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:08,465
I don't even see her nose in this photo.
No wonder I didn't recognize her.

371
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,261
By the way, why did you want to meet me?

372
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,971
You contacted me first.

373
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,015
I did? Why?

374
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,142
How would I know?

375
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,393
You left a message,

376
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,646
saying you had something
to tell me about Hanju.

377
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,815
I figured it wouldn't be a bad idea
to meet you, so we talked on the phone.

378
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,943
But you went missing right after that.

379
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,319
Hold on.

380
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:32,405
The thing is, that prosecutorâ€¦

381
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,158
Do you think Cho Yeon-ju
had a good relationship with him?

382
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,036
How would I know?

383
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,705
You said you've met him before.
Shouldn't you know?

384
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,040
I don't think she did.

385
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,251
Look at this temper.

386
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,961
Who would be nice to her?

387
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,256
The thing is,

388
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,508
he almost burst into tears earlier.

389
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,759
He was worried about me,

390
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,511
thinking something bad had happened.

391
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,012
He got teary-eyed.

392
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,139
Doesn't that mean he cares about me?

393
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,308
Don't believe everything he tells you.

394
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,395
What if he says stuff to the Hanju family?
Then you're dead meat.

395
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,897
You may never go back
to being a prosecutor.

396
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,774
Then what should I do?

397
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:12,112
NAME: KANG MI-NA

398
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,572
They look identical. How is this possible?

399
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,828
Where was she all this time?

400
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,289
And how did she suddenly
show up as Hanju's puppet?

401
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,166
PROSECUTOR WITH TWO HEARTS

402
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,257
Could it beâ€¦

403
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,641
How much does a prosecutor
at your level make a month?

404
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,977
Don't even try to strike a deal with me.

405
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,438
I'll never take the side of rich heirs.

406
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,566
No, you never know.

407
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,986
They used to say, "You can't shake hands
with a clenched fist."

408
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,029
But times have changed.

409
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:58,158
These days, you can totally express
your goodwill even with a clenched fist.

410
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,712
So you don't remember anything.

411
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,548
Then what made you believe
that you are Kang Mi-na?

412
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:14,674
Who told you?

413
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,176
You just said it yourself.

414
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,385
You tricked me.

415
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:21,014
Did someone persuade you
to believe that you're Kang Mi-na?

416
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,349
Based on the circumstancesâ€¦

417
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,100
No one forced me to believe it.

418
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,437
It was caused
by everyone's misunderstanding.

419
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,189
Then where is the real Kang Mi-na?

420
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,025
I am trying to find her.

421
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:35,612
So you didn't know who you were,

422
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,489
but you knew you weren't Kang Mi-na.

423
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,533
Then why are you
still acting like you're Kang Mi-na?

424
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,119
I wasn't trying
to impersonate her on purpose.

425
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,038
I thought I was Kang Mi-na too.

426
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,501
I don't want to hear your excuses.

427
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,669
I just want to know
what you were thinking.

428
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,964
Why do you want to know that?

429
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,092
I'm just doing what I usually do.

430
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,928
You were rarely on my side

431
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,763
even though I was always on your side.

432
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,393
I need to know what you're thinking
to be on your side.

433
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,941
What can I help you with?

434
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,072
WRITTEN PLEDGE

435
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:24,160
"If I, Prosecutor An Yu-jun, tell anyone
about Kang Mi-na's current situation,

436
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,913
if I even just hint at it,

437
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,124
or even if no one believesâ€¦"

438
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,544
She said I had to sign a written pledge

439
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,129
that I'd pay her the given amount

440
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:37,507
to compensate her for all the damage
if any of the above were to occur,

441
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,175
for her to believe me.

442
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,260
So I signed it.

443
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:43,388
I used your NDA as a reference.

444
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,684
Now that you've admitted
that you are Prosecutor Cho Yeon-ju,

445
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,352
can I ask you what I want to know?

446
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,734
Are you all right, Yeon-ju?

447
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,069
It looks like you've lost some weight.

448
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,655
My gosh. You can tell?

449
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:01,865
Of course, I can.

450
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,325
-Have you been sleeping well?
-Noâ€¦

451
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,787
She's now officially
the chairman of Yumin Group,

452
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,331
so they wouldn't treat her that badly.
Don't worry.

453
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,626
They let her drive with broken brakes.
Can it get any worse than that?

454
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,839
And who are you?

455
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:21,676
You barged into my office
and told me to do some digging on Hanju.

456
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,887
This time, you showed up
with their daughter-in-law.

457
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,598
Not even the real one.
You brought a stand-in.

458
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,726
Come on. I explained everything earlier.

459
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,020
It was caused
by everyone's misunderstanding.

460
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,230
Now, we're working together.

461
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,025
Even earlier.
I would've really died without him.

462
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,404
I'm sorry if I offended you.

463
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,824
Thank you for taking care of Yeon-ju.

464
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,367
Why are you thanking me?

465
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,661
I should thank you

466
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,873
for being so nice
to Kang Mi-na's stand-in.

467
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,918
Why would you thank me?
You're not even close to Yeon-ju.

468
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,712
I can thank you
because she and I are close enough.

469
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,382
Stop it.

470
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,719
We don't have time to bicker about
who's closer to Cho Yeon-ju.

471
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,476
CHAIRMAN KANG MI-NA'S AGGRESSIVE DRIVING

472
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,978
TWO CONSTRUCTION WORKERS INJURED

473
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,105
I can't believe
you let them take the car away.

474
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,442
Security took it right away.
How was I supposed to stop them?

475
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,738
Hanju Group blamed poor maintenance
and scrapped the car immediately.

476
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,199
That's why they didn't arrest the driver.

477
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,912
Are you saying
it wasn't the real cause of the accident?

478
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,920
What on earth did you get dragged into?

479
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:44,592
The public is criticizing
the prosecution's lenient treatment.

480
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,845
Hanju won't raise an issue
with the investigation now.

481
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,056
Stall for time pretending
to be interviewed as a witness today

482
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,683
and think about what to do from now on.

483
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:52,725
"From now on?"

484
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,310
Are you telling her
to go back to Hanju Group?

485
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,480
I'm making sure she's safe.

486
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,734
What exactly have you done?

487
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,654
You got her caught on camera
summoned to the prosecution,

488
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,322
and almost got her killed by a faulty car.

489
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:10,034
It was because
she asked him to bring her food

490
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,786
that she got caught on camera.

491
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,413
About today's accident,

492
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,956
she didn't get hurt at all,

493
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,375
but Mr. Han injured his arm.

494
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:18,877
You did?

495
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,045
It's no big deal.

496
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,674
What are you going to do?

497
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,513
Once people find out
that I'm not Kang Mi-na,

498
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,224
the real Kang Mi-na will face danger.

499
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,978
I can't go back
to my normal life just yet.

500
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,231
Don't worry.

501
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,151
With so many eyes on me,
what could possibly happen?

502
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,075
Since that prosecutor promised
to keep his mouth shut,

503
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,162
let's focus on finding
the real Kang Mi-na.

504
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,581
Have you heard anything from anyone?

505
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,459
Mr. Han.

506
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,211
Right. What were you saying?

507
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,255
What's on your mind?

508
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,591
About that prosecutorâ€¦

509
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,345
I'm glad that he promised
to keep his mouth shut,

510
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,472
but why did he have
to give her a ride home?

511
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,059
How else would she get home then?

512
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,311
The car she drove there got scrapped.

513
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,897
And since she's going in secret,
she couldn't call a cab.

514
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,025
Also, this car isn't a shuttle bus.

515
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,944
After dropping you off at home,

516
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,154
am I supposed
to give Ms. Cho a ride home too?

517
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,241
Goodness. Anyway,

518
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,994
to think that the fake Kang Mi-na
turned out to be Prosecutor Cho.

519
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:38,915
What a strange turn of events.

520
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,000
Fascinating indeed.

521
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,213
Is "fascinating" really the right word?

522
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,102
I thought you were taking me home.

523
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,645
Why are we here?

524
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,063
This is where you live.

525
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,941
I live here?

526
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,988
It was the anniversary
of your grandma's death recently.

527
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,448
You booked a flower delivery
and visited her every year.

528
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,741
That must be it.

529
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,036
You must have been really close to me.

530
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,246
Do you see that now?

531
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,712
Wait. What are you two doing here?

532
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,463
Why did you follow us?

533
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,633
He moved here recently.

534
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,802
-Into the apartment here?
-Yes!

535
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,888
Is this where you used to live?

536
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,849
Apparently. Isn't that incredible?

537
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,060
Are you the one who stole her milk?

538
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,729
You stole my milk?

539
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:47,734
-I didn't steal it.
-He got busted by me.

540
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,278
Who cares? It's no big deal.

541
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,071
I said I didn't steal it.

542
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:55,700
Yes, you used to talk to me casually
like you just did.

543
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:58,369
Your subconscious mind
must remember our friendship.

544
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,835
Shall we go in?

545
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,962
Well, sure.

546
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,400
What's with the look?

547
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,780
And why did he cover the keypad?

548
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,698
What does he take me for?

549
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,536
The apartment is a lot nicer
than I expected.

550
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,623
I have one of these too?

551
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,625
Oh, my. Darn it.

552
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,126
Let me see.

553
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,214
This is nice.

554
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,508
I guess prosecutors get paid pretty well.

555
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,927
Gosh. Let's see here.

556
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,888
HEALTH CARE MASSAGE

557
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,767
TEMPLE IN MOUNT JIRI

558
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,810
ENJOY THE REFRESHING SOUNDS OF THE SPRING

559
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:04,852
Yes.

560
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,316
Oh, boy.

561
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,903
The sound of the water and mountains

562
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:16,155
make me feel like I'm in the countryside.

563
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,992
By the way, except for my grandma,

564
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,371
didn't I have any family members
who would look for me when I go missing?

565
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,749
No. As far as I know,
you were raised by your grandma.

566
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,836
But that's all I know about your family.

567
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,337
I thought we were close.

568
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,048
We got close because
I never pried into your personal life.

569
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,096
Who are you? Who am I?
Why am I so good at fighting?

570
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,014
You're the heiress to the Nammoon Gang.

571
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,933
Of course you're good at fighting.

572
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,448
I haven't heard him leave.

573
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,577
Is he still with her?

574
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,329
And why does he knowâ€¦

575
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,832
the passcode to her apartment?

576
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,043
Right.

577
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:13,838
They were colleagues,
so I guess that makes sense.

578
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,506
If they were close colleagues.

579
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:19,260
Maybe they're more like siblings.

580
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,930
Then it totally makes sense.

581
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,224
Oh, my.

582
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,976
What's all this?

583
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,229
They're for preliminary investigations.

584
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,190
Preliminary investigations?

585
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,817
When an investigative authority
becomes aware of a crime,

586
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:38,738
they can start an investigation
even without the victim filing a suit.

587
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,407
I received a tip and shared it with you.

588
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:46,245
But now I can't find out
whether the tip was correct or not.

589
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,498
Gosh, I must've been
one passionate prosecutor.

590
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,084
I investigated crimes
even without anyone filing a suit?

591
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,502
Wellâ€¦

592
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,546
The deputy chief prosecutor
you looked up to

593
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:59,800
once missed a criminal
and got in trouble for that.

594
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,595
So you were pursuing that criminal
without him knowing.

595
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,431
Unbelievable. Was I loyal too?

596
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,851
Well, I wouldn't exactly say that.

597
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,148
You can find out
more about yourself later.

598
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,776
For now, you must learn more
about other people.

599
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:17,902
What do you mean?

600
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:21,113
To withdraw the missing person report,
you'll have to go to work.

601
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,283
Let's memorize
all the personal information

602
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,869
of those you might come across at work.

603
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,371
Again?

604
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:31,582
Come on. I'm sick of doing that.

605
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,584
Gosh.

606
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,973
This buildingâ€¦

607
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,228
is too properly soundproofed.

608
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,705
And the way it's builtâ€¦

609
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,709
It protects
the residents' privacy too well.

610
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,055
I'll bring back your stuff
little by little.

611
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,768
You're unfit for work at the moment,
so request a leave of absence immediately.

612
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,228
I will.

613
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,772
I couldn't possibly live
as a prosecutor and chairman.

614
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,607
By the way,

615
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,610
shouldn't you take some time off
and recover your memories first?

616
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:42,695
What?

617
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,697
Even if you're charged with impersonation,

618
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,409
with a medical certificate
that proves your amnesia,

619
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,369
you won't be punished severely.

620
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,956
So why do you let the Hanju family
walk all over you?

621
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,917
You know who you really are now.

622
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,170
By any chance,

623
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:02,256
is there something else
you're concerned about?

624
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,059
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

625
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,939
I hope not.

626
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,818
What? What do you mean?

627
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,075
Don't be distracted by other things.
You have to memorize this.

628
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,494
Okay.

629
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,579
SEOUL CENTRAL PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
EMERGENCY CALL TREE

630
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,471
Did he leave or not?

631
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,432
Darn it.

632
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,442
What's wrong with her?

633
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,456
You shouldn't put
a cold compress on a wound

634
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,625
that has been left alone for a while.

635
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:23,129
You need to put a warm compress on it
to help with the pain.

636
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,714
I'm going to the hospital later.

637
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,299
You can't fool me. You hate hospitals.

638
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,301
You would've gone already
if you had planned to go.

639
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,682
Aren't you a prosecutor?

640
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,643
How do you know these things?

641
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,145
I know, right?

642
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,480
Maybe I got hurt all the time.
It's very familiar.

643
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,778
There.

644
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,489
What are you doing?

645
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,283
Stay like this.

646
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,785
You should keep your wound
above your heart.

647
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,287
Don't use your arm for a while.

648
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,419
Sorry. I haven't eaten all day.

649
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,715
Wait. That wasn't me.

650
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,510
-Hey!
-Gosh!

651
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,304
Oh, no. Sorry. Are you okay?

652
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,763
I hit that so hard.

653
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,515
-Higher.
-Okay.

654
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,516
-Like this?
-Yes.

655
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,776
This is my home
and I'm the one who's hungry.

656
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,529
Why did you order what you wanted to eat?

657
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,324
I've been craving this since the hospital.

658
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:37,244
And when you hurt a muscle,
you need to eat stuff like this.

659
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:41,207
You almost died this morning
and you don't know who was behind it.

660
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,083
But you're eating jokbaengi.

661
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,543
You are amazing.

662
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,046
The doctor said before

663
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,715
that feelings remain
even if the memories are gone.

664
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:54,553
Maybe my life
was always in danger like this.

665
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,305
That's what I think.

666
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,225
This feels very familiar.

667
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,229
I guess I didn't have
such a comfortable life.

668
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:09,068
I'm sure you'll get your memory back
now that you know who you are.

669
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,695
I hope so.

670
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:15,824
When a person
goes through hardships in life,

671
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:21,580
they remember something from their past,
which encourages and heals them.

672
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:23,916
I don't have that anymore.

673
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:28,837
I felt like everyone else
was driving on a highway in an SUV,

674
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,173
whereas I was running alone,

675
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,841
barefoot on an unpaved road.

676
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,223
Not all memories are good.

677
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,310
There must be a lot of things you can do
because you don't remember.

678
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,994
I ate it because you made me a wrap
and fed it to me.

679
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,453
I know that.

680
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:04,373
You can't make a wrap with one hand.
That's why I made you one.

681
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,545
You put in so much garlic.

682
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,798
You can't handle spice, can you?
You have no appreciation for flavor.

683
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:15,467
You are so lame.

684
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,595
Here.

685
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,098
What?

686
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,392
What was I thinking?

687
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:27,062
You may have the same face,
but you're completely different.

688
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:28,814
Do you mean Mi-na?

689
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,650
What? What were you thinking about?

690
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,861
When we first met.

691
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,572
A woman I had never met before

692
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:40,159
looked frail but very strong
at the same time.

693
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,036
That's what I thought.

694
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,830
I'm sure it was hard for her,

695
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,999
but she comforted me
because it was harder for me.

696
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,918
I'm reminded of that time.

697
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,047
Why are you explaining in such detail?

698
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:55,215
Fine.

699
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,009
What? You asked.

700
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,470
Since when did you explain in detail
just because I asked?

701
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,597
I've stayed too long.

702
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,890
I'm leaving.

703
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:06,018
Look at the mess you made.
How am I supposed to clean up?

704
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,227
You figure it out.

705
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,023
May I put my arm down?

706
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,441
Do as you wish.

707
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,071
When do I put it down?

708
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,449
Darn it.

709
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,707
You have a way of getting yourself
into car accidents.

710
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,043
Especially when it comes
to humiliating our family

711
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,711
without hurting a finger.

712
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,213
You're a real pro.

713
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,882
I miss the good old days.

714
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:41,053
The pitiful loser from before you hurt
your head was much better.

715
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:44,098
Why is everyone
bringing up the past today?

716
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,100
What was so much better about the past?

717
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,478
If you're going to complain,
complain about me.

718
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,356
What?

719
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:55,359
Fine. Since you brought it up,
have you lost your mind?

720
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:56,944
Why was Seung-wook in that car?

721
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:00,155
You're determined to spread dirty gossip.

722
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:04,076
If that hadn't happened to that car,
no one would've known who was in it.

723
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,621
Is there any member of this family
without a bad rumor about them?

724
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,416
What?

725
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:13,085
I heard you scrapped the car.

726
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,756
How would it help anyone
by keeping the car?

727
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:21,593
It'll hurt the company
if it gets out that our car malfunctioned.

728
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:23,929
What if it didn't malfunction?

729
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,058
Why did that happen
if it didn't malfunction?

730
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:33,522
Hey. Are you interrogating us
after being interrogated?

731
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,190
Are you saying it was intentional?

732
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:39,153
How dare you? It was bad enough
that you tainted the company's image.

733
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,779
Fine.

734
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,614
I'll hold a press conference tomorrow

735
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:46,243
and officially apologize to Seopyung
for my reckless driving.

736
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,912
I'll pay whatever fines
and donate to its development.

737
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:52,249
I'll admit the car was defective
and recall every car of the same model.

738
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:55,127
That would help the company's image.
Will that do?

739
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,921
-Hey. Why you--
-Enough, both of you.

740
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:04,511
Human beings take it for granted
when you treat them with consideration.

741
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,638
But how far do you plan to go?

742
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,684
Do you think that consideration
is directed at you?

743
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,354
No. It's for the head of Yumin.

744
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:19,276
If you can't keep that title,
you'll be treated worse than before.

745
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,070
Stop disgracing that title.

746
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,865
Blame the incident
on a poorly maintained car.

747
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,534
Let's bury it quietly.
I'll take care of the media.

748
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:30,871
Fine.

749
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:34,291
Considering the effort they put
into bringing you in,

750
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,502
I'm sure nothing happened in Seopyung.

751
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:41,298
Don't burn bridges with the prosecutor
during the investigation.

752
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,175
That's important for yourself too.

753
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,232
Meanwhile,

754
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:01,777
you've burned your bridge to a prosecutor.

755
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,748
How could a rich family
not have a single camera?

756
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,336
Who was it?

757
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,714
Scrap the car first.

758
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:24,174
The father-in-law

759
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,885
who scrapped the car immediately
after the incident?

760
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:30,055
If you were going to hurt your head,
you should've become paraplegic.

761
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:32,349
Why don't you go jump into a car again?

762
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:35,477
The mother-in-law who is open
about being disappointed I'm alive?

763
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:37,896
What's this car?

764
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,565
I bought it yesterday.

765
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,108
Jae-hee, the owner of the car?

766
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,070
How's Mi-na?

767
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:48,949
Sung-hye, who fed me kongguksu
to test whether or not I'm Mi-na?

768
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,745
I sincerely hope you'll become successful.

769
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,915
The husband
set to inherit it all if I die?

770
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,210
Are you insane?

771
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:03,589
Sung-mi, who may do anything
when she's high?

772
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:09,428
Or finally,
the person who suspects my identity?

773
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,346
Ms. Kim.

774
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,514
What?

775
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:17,477
-What's wrong? You called me first.
-What?

776
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,187
Are you okay?

777
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:22,816
Yes. What are you doing here?

778
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,068
I returned from grocery shopping
with Trang,

779
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,820
and I saw oil marks on the floor.

780
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:33,160
Someone messed with that car
in this garage, didn't they?

781
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:41,877
Mr. Han Sung-woon removed all the cameras
in order to protect his private life.

782
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,295
The car was scrapped.

783
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,756
It'll be difficult to catch the perp.

784
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:50,510
When you make someone do kitchen work,
you can tell right away whether or not

785
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,012
that person has a brain.

786
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,473
You seem to be very calculating.

787
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,142
You must know that you're in danger.

788
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,353
Why are you still here?

789
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:04,524
Why are you telling me these things?

790
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,818
Whose side are you on?

791
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:11,865
There's more to life
than my side and someone else's side.

792
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,451
Apologies if I was out of line.

793
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,085
Why are you here?

794
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:27,089
Why was Seung-wook in the car with you?

795
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,841
Have you no conscience at all?
How dare you ask me such a question?

796
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,595
I broke up with So-yi.

797
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,222
So I can ask you these things now.

798
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,766
-What?
-You'll never have to worry

799
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:40,018
about issues like that again.

800
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,603
So I suggest

801
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,939
you watch your conduct too.

802
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,483
Give me a break.

803
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:50,320
What? You broke up with her
now that my situation is different?

804
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,030
My gosh.

805
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:56,868
You got us good,
both your wife and your mistress.

806
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,870
You're a disgusting piece of human trash.

807
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,542
We're in this together
for the sake of business.

808
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,168
So can't we just get along?

809
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,921
You keep talking about "business".

810
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:11,717
What would I even gain
from doing business with you?

811
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,761
These days, rich families
pass down their assets to just one heir.

812
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,680
If you divide them equally
among your kids,

813
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:19,182
the rest of the shareholders
can gang up against them.

814
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:23,437
My father will never
pass everything down to me,

815
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,106
but it's a different story if we team up.

816
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,276
If we have a child together,

817
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,944
all his money and assets

818
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,320
will be ours.

819
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,824
Don't you want that?

820
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:40,412
I know you're a spoiled rich heir,
but you're awfully clueless.

821
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:44,416
Who would let their daughter-in-law
inherit their assets?

822
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,460
It's all for their sons and grandsons.

823
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,254
You're just trying to use me
to get what you want.

824
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,006
Don't you dare use the word "business".

825
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:53,925
Then what if it's not
for the sake of business?

826
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,428
-What?
-You're no longerâ€¦

827
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,930
the Kang Mi-na you used to be.

828
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,976
I'm more attracted to you
now that you have money and power.

829
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,229
I'm going to sleep in this room
starting today.

830
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:21,953
Are you all right?

831
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:25,165
Can you fight well?

832
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,792
If not, stay away from me.

833
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:29,377
I don't even know how strong I really am.

834
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,296
What if you die?

835
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,758
Do you hate me this much?

836
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:36,593
Then how about this?

837
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:38,470
Was the accident earlier today

838
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,306
-really caused by a defect?
-What?

839
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:44,810
Aside from me,
who else needs you in this house?

840
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,978
Don't you think you need more allies?

841
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,357
Think about it.

842
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:52,776
Darn it.

843
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,322
What?

844
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,371
They keep talking about it on the news.

845
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,957
What's Yumin doing?
They should stop these news outlets.

846
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,251
Why do you think
Yumin isn't doing anything about it?

847
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:11,753
The public's immense interest
in Sung-woon's wife

848
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,381
has resulted in an overall increase
in their stock price.

849
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:17,843
Due to the corruption in the prosecution,
not everyone is criticizing her.

850
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:22,389
The scarf and even the sunglasses
she wore today are selling out fast.

851
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,391
So who cares about those news shows?

852
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,934
It doesn't mean anything.

853
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:30,272
How well did the hotel do
in the first two quarters this year?

854
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:32,482
The credit reports aren't looking good.

855
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,442
You don't need to worry.

856
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:37,279
It's even more suspicious
to not be worried

857
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:38,697
when the economy is this bad.

858
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,532
Don't tell me

859
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:43,368
you're still running the hotel
like you used to.

860
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:44,995
What do you mean?

861
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,414
Don't be selfish.

862
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,416
You need to think about
the entire company.

863
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:54,296
Why should I?
It's not like I own the entire company.

864
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,423
What did you say?

865
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,758
Even though I'm the most capable one
among your kids,

866
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:02,304
I feel like I can never be your number one
because I'm a daughter.

867
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:04,055
Do you know how that feels?

868
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:07,893
Should I tell you why my selfishness
bothers you so much?

869
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:11,438
Now that Mi-na's situation has changed,

870
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,732
you want to give
that idiot Sung-woon more power.

871
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:16,443
You're afraid
I'd use my assets as my weapon

872
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:19,487
if Sung-woon and I end up
fighting over the company later on.

873
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,908
Just like what you did in the past.

874
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:31,416
I'll make sure our hotel
becomes one of the best hotels.

875
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:35,045
Don't hound me when you gave me nothing
but an opportunity.

876
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:37,714
Give me enough time to get the job done.

877
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,812
Who is my enemy?

878
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,940
And who is on my side?

879
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,234
Gosh. With all this going on,

880
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,029
I have to go to work
when I don't even remember

881
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,657
where the restroom is
at the Central District Office.

882
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,412
RECENT CALLS

883
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:12,123
PROSECUTOR AN YU-JUN,
DEPUTY CHIEF PROSECUTOR RYU SEUNG-DUK

884
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,793
Looks like I had no life.

885
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:24,344
-Hello?
-Yeon-ju? It's me, Uncle.

886
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,846
What have you been doing?

887
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,100
What? I have an uncle?

888
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:32,686
Uncle!

889
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,982
Where are you, Uncle?

890
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,282
So you're saying

891
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:49,244
I changed my surname
because of my gangster father

892
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:51,204
and managed to become a prosecutor.

893
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,748
Then after my grandmother passed away,

894
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:57,210
the two of you started raising me
as if I was your real niece

895
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:59,045
because my father was in jail.

896
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:01,548
That's right.

897
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:05,010
What do you mean, you raised me?
I was over 20.

898
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,222
Looks like her memory is still intact.

899
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,518
How shrewd.
You were born to be a prosecutor.

900
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,896
Who were the thugs who chased me that day?

901
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,064
Those boys.

902
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,900
They're from the Samgeori Gang,
a street gang based in Seopyung.

903
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,487
Apparently, you showed up at
one of their fights and beat up everyone,

904
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,489
so they almost got arrested.

905
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,574
My gosh.

906
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:30,702
I helped the police
round up a street gang?

907
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,455
Oh, my.

908
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:35,123
What about my father?

909
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,374
When and why did he get arrested?

910
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,071
I'm Han Seung-wook.

911
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:09,949
Do I know you?

912
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,285
I'm Han Kang-sik's son.

913
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:21,127
The arson case you were involved in
killed my father.

914
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,424
I'm here to ask you about that case.

915
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,969
What do you expect me to say,

916
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,262
after all this time?

917
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:32,931
Did someone from Hanjuâ€¦

918
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,434
ordered you to start the fire?

919
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,728
I've never even met

920
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,647
any of the higher-ups in the company.

921
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,565
You can get your sentence reduced

922
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,776
if you admit
that you were ordered to do it.

923
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:48,530
It sounds like you have a reason

924
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,949
to prove that someone from Hanju
put me up to it.

925
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:53,576
-Sorry?
-Too much time has passed.

926
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,037
Who would believe me if I said

927
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:57,872
that I did nothing wrong?

928
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:01,167
Even my own daughter doesn't believe me.

929
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,129
Just tell the truth.

930
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:07,465
Why would people not believe the truth?

931
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:08,800
You're clueless.

932
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:12,929
You simply can't persuade someone
who refuses to believe the truth.

933
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,975
I have nothing to tell you,

934
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:19,269
so don't come back here again.

935
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:22,564
Please open the door.

936
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:35,368
Well, all we know is
that you hate talking about your dad.

937
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,662
Why don't you go talk to him in person?

938
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,583
I wonder what happened.

939
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:48,465
Seopyung Penitentiary is not accepting

940
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,383
visitor applications for him this month.

941
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,760
What's going on?
Looks like he wants no visitors.

942
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:56,181
No one visits him, except for us.

943
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,099
Does it mean
he doesn't want us to visit him?

944
00:57:58,183 --> 00:57:59,684
You think so?

945
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:06,065
Yeon-ju, is there any way
you can regain your memory?

946
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,443
I'm sure I will.

947
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:12,614
You're the first person to ask me
if it can be fixed.

948
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:17,076
The thing is, you owe us some money.

949
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,871
What? Did I borrow money from you?

950
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:20,872
No.

951
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,415
That's not it.

952
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,709
You used to pay us regularly.

953
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:25,668
The thing is--

954
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,962
You came to us.

955
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:31,174
Even if a prosecutor works their tail off
and wins a trial,

956
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:33,593
it doesn't help the victim in any way.

957
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,011
That's why

958
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,721
you received money from the crooks,

959
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:38,640
dropped the cases,

960
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,099
and paid us instead

961
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,935
to punish the crooks.

962
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,019
Do you understand?

963
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,317
LADY JUSTICE

964
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:55,156
Am I just like Jeon Woo-chi
and Hong Gil-dong or what?

965
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,700
I can't believe this.

966
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:00,787
How could someone
possibly be so righteous?

967
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,920
I'm the most righteous person
in the world!

968
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:16,052
I'm righteous! Good morning.

969
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,350
-Isn't that Ms. Cho?
-Who?

970
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:26,938
The one who took a leave of absence
to expose corruption in the prosecution?

971
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:29,732
Is that her? What is she doing here then?

972
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,694
Is today D-Day?

973
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:34,988
Yes.

974
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,114
Is it?

975
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:42,537
RYU SEUNG-DUK PROMOTED TO
CHIEF OF SEOUL CENTRAL DPO

976
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,747
Prosecutor Ryu Seung-duk.

977
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,835
So I'm one of his followers,

978
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:52,505
and I went missing while looking
into a case out of loyalty to him.

979
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,261
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

980
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,894
Even with the world at your feet,

981
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:10,148
a mere nightmare can ruin your whole day.

982
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:11,482
That's what being human is.

983
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,819
What's going to happen today?

984
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:16,863
I feel so anxious.

985
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,202
Gosh.

986
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,175
Ms. Cho?

987
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:39,802
Msâ€¦

988
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:42,013
Ms. Cho.

989
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,224
Congratulations, Chief.

990
01:00:56,486 --> 01:01:00,198
I mean, do you know how worried I was?

991
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:03,034
What on earth happened?

992
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:06,162
Don't get me started.

993
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:08,915
My plan was to go fishing
on an island and take it easy.

994
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:11,918
But I ended up falling into the sea
and was bedridden for days.

995
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,711
I lost everything including my phone.

996
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,214
And there was no reception
on that entire island.

997
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:17,757
That's why I couldn't call you.

998
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:22,679
Where exactly

999
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,056
were you?

1000
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:28,476
Why are you asking?

1001
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:33,648
Why else?

1002
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:36,401
So the next time you go missing,
I know where to search.

1003
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:40,822
You apparently have no family or friends.
Do you know how frustrated I was?

1004
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:43,574
I'm the one who reported you missing.

1005
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:46,327
I'm sorry. But don't worry.

1006
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:49,038
I'll never go near that place again.

1007
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:52,792
By the way,

1008
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:55,920
did you ever say anything

1009
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:02,719
about stabbing the prosecution in the back
or taking a tablet to the police

1010
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:06,264
around here?

1011
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:08,182
Me?

1012
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,479
You can never trust prosecutors.

1013
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,648
You have no idea what they're like.

1014
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:18,276
They kiss up to whoever is next in line

1015
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:21,779
and are always in search of someone
who will have their backs.

1016
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:23,614
Didn't you see what's on that tablet?

1017
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:24,741
Who knows?

1018
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:26,993
Maybe they hired someone to harm me.

1019
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:29,495
No, I didn't.

1020
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:33,166
No way. Someone must've been mistaken.

1021
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,834
Is that right?

1022
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,548
How did your
preliminary investigation go then?

1023
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:43,384
-Did you miss him?
-Oh, that?

1024
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,344
Preliminary investigations?

1025
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,638
The deputy chief prosecutor
you looked up to

1026
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:51,309
once missed a criminal
and got in trouble for that.

1027
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:53,895
So you were pursuing that criminal
without him knowing.

1028
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,064
Did you know about that?

1029
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:01,694
What are you talking about?

1030
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:05,156
After you went missing, Mr. Park told me.

1031
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:09,535
-So you were looking for Lee Bong-sik?
-Yes.

1032
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,413
But the tip must have been wrong.

1033
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,498
I failed.

1034
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:15,875
The tip was wrong?

1035
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,128
Yes.

1036
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:23,591
Didn't anyone follow you around?

1037
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:24,675
Someone did follow me,

1038
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:27,553
but I wouldn't be here
if I'd told her about it.

1039
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,267
Chief.

1040
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:36,729
Ever since I almost drowned,
I haven't been feeling so great.

1041
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:38,898
I'm getting forgetful too.

1042
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:41,150
So I'm thinking of taking
a few months off.

1043
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:43,528
A few months off?

1044
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:47,740
Yes. I don't think
I can go back to my routine yet.

1045
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,701
Anyway, I'm sorry I made you worry.

1046
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:53,621
All right.

1047
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:55,873
-I'll be going now.
-Okay.

1048
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:57,375
-Take care.
-Yes, sir.

1049
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:09,011
I understand that she lied
about badmouthing the prosecution.

1050
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,098
But why does she hide
seeing Lee Bong-sik from me?

1051
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:16,185
And why is she taking time off?

1052
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:21,649
Just what is she thinking?

1053
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,781
I had received a tip
and shared it with you.

1054
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:33,911
But now I can't find out
whether the tip was correct or not.

1055
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:38,332
-Mr. Park.
-Yes?

1056
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:40,459
I told you
about my preliminary investigation

1057
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:41,627
before leaving, right?

1058
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,922
I forgot to ask you.

1059
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:46,424
Did you find Lee Bong-sik?

1060
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:47,884
There you go.

1061
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:51,178
That's more natural.

1062
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:52,638
What do you mean?

1063
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,640
If I was pursuing a tip,

1064
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:58,853
you'd want to know if the tip was correct
and if Lee Bong-sik really showed up.

1065
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:00,396
Of course.

1066
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,483
So why did he ask me if I missed him?

1067
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:10,656
CHIEF RYU SEUNG-DUK

1068
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,159
What nonsense is that?

1069
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:16,954
Use your connections
and smuggle me out of the country already.

1070
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:20,666
I already paid you
so you could leave the country.

1071
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,668
Do I look easy to you?

1072
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:25,546
Come on. That's all in the past.

1073
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:29,216
I got tangled up with Hanju Group.

1074
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,636
Things are looking bad.

1075
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:33,471
Smuggle me out of here one last time,

1076
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:35,181
and I'll lie low for the rest of my life.

1077
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:37,016
Please help me.

1078
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:39,727
Hold on.

1079
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:41,896
Did you go to Hanju Group?

1080
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:44,690
Are you out of your mind?

1081
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:48,527
Who in Hanju Group?

1082
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:51,072
Let's meet. I'll tell you in person.

1083
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:55,660
All right. I'll see you there.

1084
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:07,129
Why are there so many--

1085
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,174
-Gosh!
-I'm sorry.

1086
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:16,597
Bong-sik.

1087
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:18,140
Isn't that you, Bong-sik?

1088
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:24,397
Are you okay?

1089
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:34,490
They look the same?

1090
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,998
THERE WILL BE AN EPILOGUE SHORTLY

1091
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:45,960
RYU SEUNG-DUK

1092
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,095
EPILOGUE

1093
01:06:56,178 --> 01:07:01,726
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

1094
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:04,895
You know what?

1095
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:08,858
The warmest place in a hospital at night
is the emergency room.

1096
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:10,317
And they have instant coffee there.

1097
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:12,570
It's crowded with people there
around the clock.

1098
01:07:32,673 --> 01:07:37,553
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

1099
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:52,151
Grandma.

1100
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:26,977
Miss.

1101
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,480
Are there any other family members?

1102
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:33,859
There are papers to sign
and decisions to make

1103
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,694
at the mortuary.

1104
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:38,614
Is there any grown-up you can call?

1105
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:47,248
Get changed first.

1106
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:50,251
Wash your face in the bathroom too.

1107
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:54,004
You'll have to toughen up

1108
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:56,298
to hold your grandma's funeral alone.

1109
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:02,573
Do you know why scams are bad?

1110
01:10:02,656 --> 01:10:06,785
Only desperate people fall for them.

1111
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:09,705
Now that the situation has changed,
are you revealing your true colors?

1112
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:11,874
That's not it. I'm finally myself again.

1113
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:14,877
Mr. Han Seung-wook was driving
when the accident occurred, wasn't he?

1114
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,170
This is nothing to me.

1115
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:19,757
-I'm totally okay with--
-I'm not okay with it! Stop getting hurt!

1116
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,801
She keeps bothering me.

1117
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:24,553
I'm the center of attention.

1118
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:27,514
How am I going to double as a chairman?

1119
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:29,016
Theyâ€¦

1120
01:10:29,099 --> 01:10:30,893
look the same?
