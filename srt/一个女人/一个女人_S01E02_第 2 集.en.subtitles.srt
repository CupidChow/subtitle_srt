1
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,488
What's going on?

2
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:27,462
Why did you have to go there alone
and get hit by a car?

3
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,715
You made such a fool out of us all.

4
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,008
Are you happy now?

5
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,472
Why are you looking at me like that?

6
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:40,266
How dare you?

7
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,312
Who are you?

8
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,817
Hey! Are you out of your mind?

9
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,151
Let go!

10
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,324
Hold on. Am I really out of my mind?

11
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,285
What's wrong with me?

12
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,080
Who…

13
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,333
Who am I?

14
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,696
Rabbit.

15
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,322
Dog.

16
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,032
Cat.

17
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,909
Pig.

18
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,619
Chicken.

19
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,167
It seems like a hard blow to the head

20
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,044
caused retrograde amnesia.

21
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,422
Unbelievable.

22
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,507
Other than that, she seems fine.

23
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,176
She can speak
and carry out daily activities.

24
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,679
It's only memories
from before a certain point in time

25
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,014
that have been lost.

26
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,266
It may be due to a psychological cause.

27
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,603
It's possible that another shocking event
may bring her memories back…

28
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,772
So basically, you're saying
you don't know what really happened.

29
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,150
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,737
Her memories may be gone,
but not her emotions.

31
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,406
Spending time with those
close to her will help her

32
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,033
with her psychological stability--

33
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,410
Psychological stability, my foot.

34
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,245
Look what she did to me.

35
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,414
Who do you think needs
that stability the most?

36
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,665
Just get out.

37
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,721
-Are you okay?
-Gosh!

38
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,941
I shouldn't have
twisted her arm like that.

39
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,321
Why did she have to go
and injure her head?

40
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,325
Chairman Kang was still working,

41
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,619
and the succession process
hadn't even started.

42
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,205
Unless something unexpected happens,
I assume Mi-na will

43
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,873
automatically inherit everything.

44
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,626
When it comes to shares, yes.

45
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,837
But the transfer of management
has to be approved by the shareholders.

46
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,759
There are two fund investors in the US

47
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:22,804
who own more than 30 percent
of Yumin Group.

48
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,430
But their involvement is unlikely.

49
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,393
This means the decision will be
up to the other shareholders,

50
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,437
and I'll be able to control most of them.

51
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:36,609
If word gets out about Mi-na's condition,

52
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,529
the shareholders will not support
the transfer of management.

53
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,032
And if her family asks for shares,

54
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,994
we might end up blowing our chance.

55
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,620
Don't worry.

56
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:51,207
I'll make sure Mi-na
stays home at all times.

57
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,960
All the maids except Ms. Kim

58
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:58,214
will be replaced with foreigners
who don't understand Korean.

59
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,426
But some people must have seen her
at the hospital.

60
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,429
The hospital director is the only one
who knows her test results.

61
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,847
And all the other witnesses

62
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,182
have been checked.

63
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:25,575
So even if I don't remember it,

64
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,370
I'm a daughter-in-law of Hanju Group?

65
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,915
PUMP TOOTHPASTE
HANJU HOUSEHOLD AND HEALTH CARE

66
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,669
HANJU FNB

67
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,757
HANJU ELECTRONICS

68
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,718
HANJU ELECTRONICS

69
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,430
HANJU ELECTRONICS

70
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,603
Wait.

71
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,147
All of it has always been mine.

72
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,691
Why do I feel like I just won the lottery?

73
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,362
Now I feel even worse
about hurting my mother-in-law.

74
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,614
Has she left?

75
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,452
-My gosh!
-Goodness.

76
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,079
Oh, dear.

77
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,039
What's wrong?

78
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,626
You're so good-looking…

79
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,337
sir.

80
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,465
Are you okay, honey?

81
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,342
"Honey?"

82
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,636
Does that mean…

83
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,305
So you did lose your memory.

84
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,976
I'm your husband.

85
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,107
Lucky me.

86
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,740
What's with you?

87
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,117
What do you mean?

88
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,578
We have to go out,

89
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,331
so change into this.

90
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,126
Ms. Kim picked it out
because your clothes were ruined.

91
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,254
And here's a new phone.

92
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,297
Awesome. Let me see.

93
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,465
This is the latest one.

94
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,634
This is nice.

95
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,386
Calm down.

96
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,679
I need to talk to you.

97
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,180
What is it now?

98
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,725
No one outside of our family can know

99
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,061
that you lost your memory.

100
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,273
You may not speak
with anyone you don't know.

101
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,983
You may not leave home alone.

102
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,527
Why must I do that?

103
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,671
Is it because I can't remember?

104
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,256
Why don't I feel anything?

105
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,347
Some people have all the luck.

106
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:57,143
My gosh!

107
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,853
Even my brother-in-law's wife

108
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,313
is crying so sorrowfully.

109
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,526
OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

110
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,989
Your cousin.
Youngest maternal aunt's daughter.

111
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,782
Director Byun Soo-kyung
at Yumin Life Science.

112
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,869
-Soo-kyung.
-What…

113
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,789
What's wrong with you?

114
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,375
You're my aunt's daughter,
so you're a close relative.

115
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,585
Thank you for coming.

116
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,920
Sure, okay.

117
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,755
Let's forget the past.

118
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,090
Of course. I've forgotten it all.

119
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,926
Let's grab a meal together sometime.

120
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,052
Thanks so much.

121
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,803
Thanks.

122
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,224
The shock must have gone to your head.

123
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,935
Good for me, I guess.

124
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,734
The eldest in the Yumin owner family.

125
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,069
Grandma.

126
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,862
Aunt.

127
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,322
Great-aunt.

128
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,490
No, just aunt.

129
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,449
Aunt.

130
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,537
You look more and more like Grandma.

131
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,914
Like you've ever seen her.

132
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,334
Sung-woon.

133
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,212
The shock must be too much for her.

134
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,339
Has this girl lost her marbles?

135
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,181
Mi-na?

136
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,016
I think it's too soon

137
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,935
after your injury to see guests.

138
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,311
Why don't you rest?

139
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,106
-I feel fine.
-No, you need to rest.

140
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,442
You may seem fine now,
but you'll faint before you know it.

141
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,070
You saw the VIP room outside, right?

142
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,739
Okay, I'll do that.

143
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,199
That would be better.

144
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,909
You're tiring me out.

145
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,744
Okay, then.

146
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,837
It doesn't seem like
she just lost her memory.

147
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,338
She lost her sense of identity.

148
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,257
Why does she keep overreacting?

149
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,766
OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

150
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,065
Did you find someone we can ask?

151
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,985
Yes, I found someone suitable
and made contact.

152
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,987
Can the person handle it?

153
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,115
Do you play janggi?

154
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,075
Janggi?

155
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,911
I played it often with your father.

156
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,164
That's how janggi is.

157
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,750
You can't catch the general

158
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,001
using your general.

159
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,546
You have to catch the chariot
with your horse,

160
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,091
and the general with your soldiers.

161
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:38,054
Is this an excuse for having
only a soldier ask the favor?

162
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,181
Don't you worry.

163
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,099
Dealing with evil people for so long,

164
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,477
you can easily identify good people.

165
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,020
This person is trustworthy.

166
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,022
Anyway,

167
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,777
I understand that Kang Mi-na
just suffered a great loss,

168
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,071
but must you go there?

169
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,450
Don't tell me
you still have feelings left for her.

170
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,871
You were arranged to marry her once,
but that is all.

171
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:08,793
We had a connection from before then too.

172
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,596
As soon as it was confirmed
that my father,

173
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,765
Hanju Group's heir apparent, had died…

174
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,558
14 YEARS AGO, HANJU HOSPITAL MORGUE

175
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,062
…you were the only person who stayed.

176
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,486
All everyone said was

177
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,656
that my uncle would succeed
and take over the company.

178
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,965
That's when I first met her.

179
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,261
By chance, before she was chosen
to be my wife.

180
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,267
I found out later on
that she was hospitalized

181
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,768
for unfortunate reasons.

182
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:16,318
Well, her partner was changed
to Sung-woon later,

183
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,281
so you can't really say
I was arranged to marry her.

184
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,868
That is so terrible.

185
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,245
What about people who are already dating?

186
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,291
After Father died, I was pushed out
from the line of succession.

187
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,544
Yumin wanted Sung-woon, not me.

188
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,633
Anyway, this is simply
a humanitarian visit.

189
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,886
I have to see her eventually.

190
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,930
Humanitarian, my foot.

191
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,891
She was your first love.

192
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,602
What?

193
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,854
I'm not dense.

194
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,483
This is why first loves
are a problem for guys.

195
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,610
You still have feelings for her.

196
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,529
Don't even talk to her.

197
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,115
Just pay your respects and leave.

198
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:15,669
Did you see that? Yumin's daughter
didn't even shed a single tear.

199
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,089
-It's because she's a mistress' daughter.
-Still.

200
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,554
Yes, Mom. Kang Mi-na.
She must've lost her mind.

201
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,348
She said we should eat together.

202
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,100
I don't know.
Maybe she got hit on her head.

203
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:33,812
After how much we humiliated her.
Anyway, I'll call you later.

204
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,241
ENTIRE FAMILY DIES IN A PLANE CRASH,
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YUMIN GROUP?

205
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,325
CHAIRMAN KANG'S DAUGHTER
RUMORED TO BE ILLEGITIMATE

206
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,911
CONGLOMERATE FAMILY'S
ILLEGITIMATE CHILD SCANDAL

207
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,539
WHO IS KANG MI-NA,
FIRST IN LINE TO INHERIT THE FORTUNE?

208
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,957
Seriously.

209
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,167
So…

210
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,088
there were tons of rumors
that I was an illegitimate child,

211
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:03,092
but my in-laws were good to me
as if they didn't know?

212
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,558
There's a strange rumor spreading online.

213
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,602
It can't be weirder than the one
about you and the plane.

214
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,979
It was.

215
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,730
It's a new rumor about her

216
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:20,401
being an illegitimate child
and her kind in-laws.

217
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,028
Was it you again?

218
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,698
You can find anything online
if you run a few searches.

219
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,201
You can't hide it. It's better to leak it.

220
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,662
So this is what you did
about my past rumors.

221
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:35,082
Do you know where you should
hide the body if you kill someone?

222
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,750
In a battlefield.

223
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,128
You should be grateful.

224
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,297
Those countless scandals

225
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,048
buried the real scandal about you.

226
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,801
-It's a win-win.
-Still.

227
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,596
The scandals about me
are sometimes over the top.

228
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,931
So confirm with me first.

229
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,142
Confirm? Give me a break.

230
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,227
Just do your part right.

231
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,688
Don't ruin what I've set up.

232
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,816
Check on Mi-na and see what she's doing.

233
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,949
Let me get this straight.

234
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,327
I was mistreated and bullied all my life,

235
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,495
and suddenly I'm an heiress

236
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,623
about to inherit a huge fortune.

237
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,585
How sad.

238
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,339
I was the child of a rich family,
but I've been picked on all my life.

239
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:27,051
Then I was hit by a car at full speed,
flew into the air, and landed on my head,

240
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,094
but no one asks if I'm okay.

241
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,142
Why am I so hungry
in the midst of all this?

242
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,712
Why is he staring at me?

243
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,756
Has he never seen someone eat peanuts?

244
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,429
I'm allergic to peanuts.
I can't eat a single one.

245
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:16,266
Sometimes, I start to break out
just from smelling them.

246
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,277
Get it together. How could you eat this?

247
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,407
-What's wrong with you?
-I know you're in shock, but still.

248
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,702
This is all I have to eat.

249
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,371
Give it back!

250
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,458
Seriously.

251
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,426
Sorry about that.
I was just reminded of the old days.

252
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,927
Do I know this guy?

253
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,598
Darn it. This is so embarrassing.
Who are you?

254
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,100
Right.

255
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,441
I guess I've changed too much.

256
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,318
I didn't expect him
to talk to himself like that.

257
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,820
Who is he?

258
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,655
I should carry on the conversation.

259
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,490
How long has it been…

260
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,161
What do I do? Drop the honorifics or not?

261
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,205
-How long has it been?
-Well…

262
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,708
Has it been over 10 years?

263
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,502
He's talking to himself again.
Once again, it didn't work.

264
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,921
What should I do?

265
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,384
Hey, bro.

266
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,225
Is he his brother?

267
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,285
How have you been?

268
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,498
I've been well, trying not to care
about what's going on here.

269
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,999
Were you in Korea?

270
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,251
No, I came back recently.

271
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,088
I know how you've been
thanks to the articles.

272
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,172
Doing quite well?

273
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,632
There's nothing well about it.

274
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,551
They pick on everything I say
because I'm a woman.

275
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,469
It's not easy.

276
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,806
But you got there on your own.
No one handed it over to you.

277
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,310
Keep it up. Do your best.

278
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,774
Thanks. You should stay for some food.

279
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,825
By the way…

280
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,662
Are you okay?

281
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,094
Yes, I'm okay.

282
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,355
What's with you?

283
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,525
He was the first person to ask me

284
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,985
if I was okay.

285
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,704
That little…

286
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,629
Who is that?

287
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,382
He's really handsome.

288
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,634
He's my cousin.

289
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,261
When his father died,

290
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,890
Grandpa passed the business on to my dad,
so he got ousted and moved to the US.

291
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,642
I see. No wonder.

292
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,935
He's handsome,

293
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,354
but there's something dark
and depressing about him.

294
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,317
But why is he here?

295
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,653
Now that Mi-na has hit the jackpot,
is he here to see

296
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,739
if there's anything
he can get out of this?

297
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:02,284
My gosh. Does he have the right too?

298
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,203
The eldest son of the eldest son.

299
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,164
So technically,
he is the eldest son of the family.

300
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,290
Is he married?

301
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,513
What is it?

302
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,600
Did everyone freeze and get awkward

303
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,227
as if they walked into a funeral

304
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,937
the moment you showed up?

305
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,773
Who cares? They're at a funeral anyway.

306
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,610
About Kang Mi-na…

307
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,655
She was acting strange.

308
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:44,910
When women run into their ex-boyfriends,
they treat them like total strangers.

309
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,205
It wasn't like that.

310
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,666
That's what you want to think.

311
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,877
The company is keeping it hush-hush,

312
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,173
but I think she was also in a car accident

313
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,634
right before the funeral.

314
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,844
A car accident?

315
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,139
Not a minor one.

316
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,183
She's probably
all over the place right now.

317
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,893
Maybe that's why.

318
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:17,025
Does the company's VIP team still manage
the Hanju family's medical records?

319
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,152
-Yes, correct.
-May I view the records?

320
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,072
You said you coming to the funeral
was just a humanitarian act.

321
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,782
Why would you view those records?

322
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:27,077
Maybe they put her there even though
she's not okay. You know them.

323
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,871
Even if that is the case, why do you care?

324
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,252
I can't look into it right now.
I'll let you know as soon as I find out.

325
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,287
Auntie Sung-hye, Uncle Sung-woon,

326
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,039
Auntie Sung-mi. You're back.

327
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,671
Mom.

328
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,050
Sun-woo, say hello to Auntie Mi-na too.

329
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,305
You told me
I didn't have to greet Auntie Mi-na.

330
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,222
What?

331
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,310
Nonsense. What are you talking about?

332
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,436
Come, let's go.

333
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,949
The funeral must have taken a toll on you.

334
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,912
I am the only father you have now,

335
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,623
so you should be good to me.

336
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,374
Dad, please.

337
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,294
You should be saying
you'll be good to her, if anything.

338
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,671
There's nothing wrong with what he said.

339
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,925
The shareholders gave you those rights
only because they trust us,

340
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,468
not a young woman like her.

341
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,680
Hey, you really should be good to us.

342
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,642
-Mom.
-Why won't you let me talk?

343
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,354
I'd have nothing to say to her
if I had to watch what I said.

344
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,441
Just pick and choose
what you want to hear.

345
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,818
Mom is old-fashioned.

346
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,278
I tell her she can't say
things like that these days,

347
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,446
but she won't listen.

348
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,281
It's okay.

349
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,451
The brain ages when you get old,
so it gets harder to break habits.

350
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,042
Well…

351
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:43,213
I noticed that she's been saying things
without thinking ever since the accident.

352
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,215
But we're all used to it, thanks to her.

353
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,550
What?

354
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,220
I'm tired. We'll be upstairs.

355
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,389
Let's go. Come on.

356
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:53,974
What?

357
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:01,148
Now she thinks she has the upper hand,
has she completely lost it?

358
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,108
The brain is what?

359
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:08,405
Hey, I can't put up with this.
It's not like we'll die without her money.

360
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,282
-Mom.
-You be quiet!

361
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:13,160
Or I'll tell all the shareholders
that she twisted my arm.

362
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,289
Seriously!

363
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,753
You said Seung-wook came.
What do you mean?

364
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,424
I suppose he was already in Korea.
He came to the funeral.

365
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,845
If he keeps hovering around us,

366
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,222
give him one of
the restaurant chains or something.

367
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,099
We can do that much for him.

368
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,517
Consider yourselves informed.

369
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,856
You know, about Mi-na.

370
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,108
She forgot everything we did to her.

371
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:48,195
It's like her brain has been reset
and her dark aura has gone.

372
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,907
Are you saying it's a good or bad thing?

373
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,408
I like her better this way.

374
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,329
-Sorry?
-She seems more human now.

375
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,372
In the past,

376
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,166
she just let us trample all over her.

377
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:04,085
It felt like she had a hidden agenda,
so it always bothered me.

378
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,050
See?

379
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,219
She's definitely way meaner than I am.

380
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,222
But I always get blamed for everything.

381
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,265
My gosh.

382
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,395
They're both crazy.

383
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,652
Gosh! I can't even talk in this house?

384
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,987
That's right. You're not allowed to talk.

385
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,448
Never back to my father,
no matter what he says.

386
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,951
Goodness. Why don't you
erect his statue in the house?

387
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,286
You can greet and salute his statue
every morning.

388
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,038
Hang on a second.

389
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,540
Where are the honorifics?

390
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,833
You don't use them either.

391
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:46,920
Forget it.

392
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,051
I was waiting for you, Ms. Kang.

393
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,819
I'm Director Kim Kyung-sin.

394
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,362
Hello.

395
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:15,490
You can call me Ms. Kim.

396
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,245
I've been in charge of housekeeping here

397
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,497
since the former chairman was alive.

398
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,374
This is Trang.

399
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,754
She doesn't understand Korean.

400
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:33,049
Her job is to help
the chairman's second daughter-in-law.

401
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,551
Second daughter-in-law?

402
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:41,558
There's the chairman's wife,
his first daughter-in-law,

403
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,977
and his second daughter-in-law,
which is you.

404
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,854
It's so complicated.

405
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:54,112
A weekly schedule? What is this?

406
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,740
It's a schedule you must follow.

407
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:01,077
I'm a daughter-in-law of Hanju Group.

408
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,622
Why don't I see any hair salon,
shopping, massage, or golf here?

409
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,249
All I do is housework?

410
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,334
All housework

411
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,504
was always your duty.

412
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,257
I did all this by myself?

413
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,427
With the help of others, of course.

414
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,678
But the problem is,

415
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,765
if we kept many people working here,

416
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,850
the news of your amnesia might get out.

417
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,353
That's why all maids have been fired

418
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,355
except me and her.

419
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,523
In other words,

420
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,025
your injury

421
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,610
is making my life very difficult.

422
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,364
You'll have to make up
for the shortage of hands.

423
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,617
There's no way she and I can do
all the work in this huge house.

424
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,411
She can't even buy groceries
because she can't speak Korean.

425
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,290
If you have any conscience at all,

426
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,833
I trust you'll help me.

427
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,961
What about the other people in the family?

428
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:55,882
The chairman's wife can't because
a certain someone broke her arm.

429
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,718
The chairman's first daughter
is too busy with work.

430
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:02,597
The first daughter-in-law
is too busy looking after her son.

431
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,932
As for Han Sung-mi,

432
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,683
I don't like her.

433
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,149
Unbelievable.

434
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,360
I should be busy spending
all my money now.

435
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,737
Why do I have to do so much housework?

436
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,918
Oh, my. Already?

437
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,089
Wait, what am I imagining?

438
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,508
What else? Some physical intimacy.

439
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,594
But I barely know him.

440
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,556
Is it really okay to share a bed
with him already?

441
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,892
Why not? He's my husband.

442
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,729
I'm sure my body remembers him.

443
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,149
Let's do this.

444
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,059
Are you done?

445
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,399
Oh, my. Honey.

446
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,485
I haven't showered yet.

447
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,698
Get your hands off my wine.

448
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,911
You don't drink.

449
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,497
What? I don't drink?

450
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,083
This smells lovely.
What do you mean, I don't drink?

451
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,629
Your bedroom is across the hallway.

452
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,130
Didn't Ms. Kim mention it?

453
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,675
-My bedroom?
-Yes.

454
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,427
This is my bedroom.

455
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,179
Yours is across the hallway.

456
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:12,477
I can't believe I have to remind you
of these things.

457
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,854
You're a person

458
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,190
who never had any sex drive.

459
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,400
I never had?

460
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,694
Get out.

461
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,156
What are you waiting for?

462
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,918
I can't believe the way he talks to me.

463
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,546
I've almost lost
all my confidence as a woman.

464
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,964
After all this housework,

465
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,841
how can I have any sex drive?

466
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:48,221
Was there anything I enjoyed in my life?

467
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,224
So this is my room?

468
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,907
Look at that.

469
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,327
I could even play soccer here.

470
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:14,831
What's this?

471
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,420
It's spacious.

472
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:22,630
My gosh.

473
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,975
This is huge like a candy ring.

474
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,437
I apparently have a great sense of style.

475
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,439
So silky.

476
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,107
It's so soft to the touch.

477
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:45,194
What's the use of having fancy pajamas

478
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,905
if I have to sleep alone?

479
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:53,161
SEPTEMBER 21,
HOUSEWORK AND GROCERY SHOPPING

480
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:57,206
With all these clothes in my closet,
I only wear what I'm told to wear?

481
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,419
Is this really the life I've been living?

482
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:13,848
I can barely keep my eyes open.

483
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,477
There's no way I've been getting up
at 4:00 a.m. every day.

484
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,645
It doesn't make sense.

485
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:21,481
The kitchen work starts at 5:00 a.m.

486
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:22,857
We're already late. Come on.

487
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,276
Are we living in an agrarian society?

488
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,529
The mindset of this family
is too old-fashioned!

489
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:34,452
It's the chairman's belief
that the leader of the company

490
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,287
should come to work first.

491
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,332
So he leaves home quite early.
We must hurry.

492
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,626
That's nonsense.

493
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,795
Then who opens the door for him
at the company?

494
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:47,006
Does that mean the security guard
is the leader of the company?

495
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,676
What are you saying?

496
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,594
Watch your mouth--

497
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,140
Ms. Kim.

498
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,935
I'd like something simple for breakfast,
like dumpling soup.

499
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,025
Gosh, I'm tired.

500
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,155
"Something simple like dumpling soup?"

501
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,282
"Simple?"

502
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,120
This family is filthy rich.

503
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:20,999
Why are we making dumplings from scratch
so early in the morning?

504
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,251
Since you seem to have forgotten,

505
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,336
let me explain to you.

506
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,964
The chairman's wife doesn't eat
store-bought dumplings.

507
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,133
That's her problem.

508
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,010
Then she should make them herself.

509
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,429
Don't put too much filling to save time.

510
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,972
It matters that they look good.

511
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:39,726
Bring the two ends together.

512
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,185
Okay.

513
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,646
Like how I'd tie Mother's arms
behind her back.

514
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,030
If you don't close them tightly,
they'll burst.

515
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,825
-Squeeze them together well.
-Okay.

516
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,702
Like how I'd squeeze Mother's throat.

517
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,747
Squeeze.

518
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,667
There you go.

519
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,343
TAMNA FISH MARKET

520
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:18,222
Even the fish that are about to be cut up
flop as long as they're alive.

521
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:22,268
Why aren't we hearing anything
from Yeon-ju?

522
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,436
Look.

523
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,855
Everyone knows our fish is fresh

524
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,733
and we know Yeon-ju only gets in touch
when she feels like it.

525
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,736
Gosh! Come on.

526
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:34,781
You idiot. In addition to missing
Lee Bong-sik and Yeon-ju,

527
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:35,990
you miss fish too?

528
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,118
It's because they're too fresh.

529
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,870
Stay still!

530
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,748
Darn it. But look.

531
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,584
Isn't it a good thing
that we lost Lee Bong-sik?

532
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,212
Imagine we kept him here
and couldn't reach Yeon-ju.

533
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,005
It'd be embarrassing to let him go.

534
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,175
It's not like the three of us
will play cards together.

535
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,010
Still, something doesn't feel right.

536
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,055
Whenever I call her office,
they just tell me she's on leave.

537
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,767
I hope she's not stabbing us in the back.

538
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,770
We should've received
a written promise or something.

539
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,188
A written promise?

540
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:11,692
TWO YEARS AGO

541
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,194
What do you say?

542
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:17,115
You want us to run errands for you?

543
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,575
-I wouldn't exactly say that.
-Hey.

544
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:23,204
We're not just some back alley bullies.

545
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,748
We have our pride as gangsters.

546
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,875
We can't be running errands for you.

547
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,377
"Pride as gangsters," my foot.

548
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,255
You two are no longer gangsters.

549
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,298
What's the definition of a gangster?

550
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,426
It's a member of a gang of criminals.

551
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,887
Can you call two people a gang?

552
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,181
It's because we're taking a break.

553
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,641
If we gather the boys…

554
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,268
Wake up.

555
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,937
These days, people are self-centered.

556
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,274
They won't sacrifice themselves
for the good of the organization.

557
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:57,196
Even if a prosecutor
works their tail off and wins the trial,

558
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,407
how does that help the poor victim?

559
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,159
It may be better to get them

560
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,202
a huge settlement
and avoid going to trial.

561
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:07,540
But I can't let the perpetrator
benefit from it.

562
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,083
I can't condone that.

563
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,589
What is this?

564
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,299
Come on.

565
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:19,343
-Darn it.
-Move it.

566
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,678
You do it first.

567
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,680
-Seriously.
-Jeez.

568
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,390
Let's do this!

569
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,310
Let's do this.

570
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:33,191
Every time she let them
get away with a light sentence,

571
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:36,402
we went and beat them up
as what they really deserve.

572
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,779
We cleaned up after her all the time.

573
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,531
It wasn't for free though.

574
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,618
Well, that's true.

575
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,829
But this one was supposed to be
a big score with a stakeout,

576
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,539
head-on fights and all.

577
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,710
Maybe she caught Lee Bong-sik on her own

578
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,463
and isn't telling us.

579
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,131
In case it hurts her future.

580
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,468
She even removed her name from
her family register to take the bar exam.

581
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,972
Seriously. Darn it.

582
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,099
Even if the world were ending tomorrow,

583
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,685
they'd uproot
the last remaining apple tree

584
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,979
and chop it up into firewood
to cook chicken.

585
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,566
Why must we cook every meal at home?

586
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,947
Trang.

587
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,032
I say this because you don't understand.

588
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:28,204
I had no one to vent to,
so I posted stuff online.

589
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,581
And all the comments said

590
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,999
everyone lives this way.

591
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,585
So I wrote a comment
saying I was different,

592
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,171
that I'm the daughter-in-law
of a wealthy family.

593
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,258
And they said even women
from Seoul National University, doctors,

594
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,885
judges, and prosecutors all do this
once they're married.

595
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,596
All in-laws are like that.

596
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:49,267
My mother-in-law was like that too,
so I ran away.

597
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,394
You can speak Korean?

598
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,107
Everyone else was fired.

599
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,819
I survived because I pretended
I didn't understand Korean.

600
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,989
-It's a secret.
-Okay. I'll be careful.

601
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,993
You're lucky you have amnesia.

602
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:10,413
In-laws' words are filled
with preservatives.

603
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,248
It lasts forever.

604
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,292
Really?

605
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,378
So stop talking and knead that dough.

606
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,880
-Look, I'm done.
-Okay.

607
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,975
How many prayer meetings must we have?

608
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:33,060
Talk about timing.

609
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:37,565
I think more people will attend
because of what happened,

610
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,692
so it may be a good thing.

611
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,945
It'll be a good chance
to show Sun-woo to everyone

612
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,905
that he's our family's eldest grandson.

613
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,907
Anyway, I went for a facial earlier

614
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,951
and heard from the daughter
of Chungma Foods

615
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,328
that Mi-na…

616
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,803
Mi-na.

617
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,764
I thought you didn't study abroad?

618
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,184
How would I know
whether I studied abroad or not?

619
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,520
But I do understand English perfectly.

620
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,688
Bon appétit.

621
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:04,735
What?

622
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,456
No other family

623
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,669
would keep a daughter-in-law
who was broken like you.

624
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,463
Sung-woon is so thoughtful.

625
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,718
What is wrong with her?

626
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,470
My point exactly.

627
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,890
Do you speak Vietnamese?

628
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:38,227
Right? How do I speak Vietnamese?

629
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,313
I understand it
and the words just come out.

630
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,650
This is great. Keep talking.

631
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:48,737
I'm dying here.
Did I really live like this?

632
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:52,491
It was much worse. They watched you
like a hawk 24 hours a day.

633
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:56,620
You had to wear
only what she chose for you.

634
00:40:56,704 --> 00:41:00,166
You have it easy now.
This is them being nice to you.

635
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,667
Really?

636
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,505
You see how she stays home all day long?

637
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,550
Why? You saw her temper.

638
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,052
She has no social skills.

639
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,020
Shut your mouth.

640
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,399
Do that where I can't see!

641
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,986
Your father-in-law tried to stop her.

642
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,489
It annoys me to look at her

643
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,616
because I feel like
I shot myself in the foot.

644
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:34,533
Darn it.

645
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,494
Don't take it to heart.

646
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:39,163
They're your elders.
It's their right to say those things.

647
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,876
Sung-hye is rationally annoying.

648
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,172
Seriously. You are impressive.

649
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,093
Jae-hee is just annoying.

650
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,764
I wouldn't be able to survive here
if I were you.

651
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,935
Mom's getting stronger every day.

652
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,396
Sung-mi talks without thinking.

653
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,982
Is it from her tennis lessons?

654
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:14,448
These jerks are being nice to me right now

655
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,452
because I'm going to inherit
my family's fortune?

656
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:23,415
No wonder.
I wanted to twist my mother-in-law's arm.

657
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,295
I praise my instincts.

658
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,426
What's wrong with them?

659
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,595
What are they talking about?

660
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,556
Hey.

661
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,100
Why are you excluding me?

662
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,230
They have no manners.

663
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,984
She's suddenly fluent in Vietnamese
after hurting her head.

664
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,110
What is wrong with her?

665
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,957
PROSECUTOR AN YU-JUN

666
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,417
The phone is turned off.

667
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,503
Please leave a message after the tone.

668
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,338
She's pretending to be busy again.

669
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,967
She hasn't read my messages either.

670
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,260
Please press one.

671
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,014
Hey.

672
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,559
I was investigating the Samgeori Gang

673
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:26,186
and some of them are Vietnamese.

674
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,149
Remember the guys
who you thought helped Lee Bong-sik flee?

675
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:33,027
I think they're affiliated with that gang.

676
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,738
Call me when you get this.

677
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,242
Your message has been recorded.

678
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,042
Mr. Dìn Quang Lung.

679
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,587
You were arrested at the scene
of gang violence.

680
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,214
But you assert you did not assault anyone.

681
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,470
Mr. Dìn Quang Lung?

682
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,224
Dìn Quang Lung.

683
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,311
You were arrested at the scene
of gang violence.

684
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,438
But you assert you did not assault anyone?

685
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,106
What? You speak Vietnamese?

686
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,485
A prosecutor who used to be here
told me to learn

687
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:17,029
so that I can question people properly

688
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,657
since we have
many foreign laborers in this town.

689
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,033
So you learned Vietnamese?

690
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,618
Why are you so shocked?

691
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,995
She even spoke French.

692
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:30,334
Because so many Vietnamese people
spoke French in front of her.

693
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:36,131
So, because of the rumors
about my head injury,

694
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:40,219
the shareholders would like to prevent me
from running the company

695
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:43,222
and hire a management specialist instead?

696
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,352
Why aren't you saying anything?

697
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:54,441
You were badmouthing me
like you were French locals just now.

698
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:06,203
HANJU GROUP'S HONORARY CHAIRMAN
HAN HYUNG-MO'S REMEMBRANCE SERVICE

699
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,461
Did I believe in you?

700
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:20,175
First, thank you that I didn't
have to cook dinner tonight.

701
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:25,514
Why did you give me the ability
to speak four languages

702
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:28,142
and let me understand
my in-law's detestable words?

703
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,437
Why did you have to make me multilingual

704
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,647
and give me this hot temper to boot?

705
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,191
If you truly do exist,

706
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:39,236
must I suppress this temper?

707
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,405
Answer me.

708
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:53,625
My gosh. She even understands French.

709
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:57,629
Then that means she understood
everything she heard even in the past.

710
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,966
That sly brat
purposely never said anything.

711
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:03,051
But now that she has a few screws loose,

712
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:06,763
she forgot that she used to put on an act
and says whatever she wants to say.

713
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,225
I'm walking on eggshells
around her these days.

714
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,227
I can't even say anything in front of her.

715
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,396
I'm so annoyed.

716
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,566
How much longer must we worry
about not upsetting her?

717
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,985
You shouldn't have talked behind her back.

718
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,945
What if she changes her mind?

719
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,072
Look at you trying so hard
to win her over.

720
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,908
Her, of all people.

721
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,660
I'm not saying you should be good to her.

722
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,747
Whether it's a good thing or not,
she lost her memory.

723
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,958
She forgot everything we did to her,
so just don't be mean.

724
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,168
Why is that so hard?

725
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:38,587
Especially you.

726
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,173
Why can't you do that?

727
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:45,219
That woman always gave me the creeps.

728
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:50,349
I hope she never regains her memory.

729
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,934
What if she regains her memory,

730
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:54,019
and her personality stays this way?

731
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,356
You fools.

732
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,567
Didn't you all plan to make her
look like a madwoman

733
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,528
and put her in a psychiatric hospital?

734
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,113
You can't put on a little act

735
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,157
when you were planning to do such a thing?

736
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,745
It's just until she inherits
all of Yumin family's money.

737
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:14,581
After that, who cares?
Her parents and siblings are dead.

738
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,126
Even if something
happens to her in this house,

739
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,169
no one will care.

740
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,690
You don't…

741
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,693
know me?

742
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,495
When did you start eavesdropping?

743
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,540
"My gosh. She even understands French."

744
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,042
So you heard everything.

745
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,003
Well, it just happened.

746
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:47,591
By the way, earlier…

747
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:49,760
Why did you do that?

748
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:53,597
Oh, that. It seemed very urgent.

749
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,891
Physical contact is unavoidable

750
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,559
in situations like that.

751
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:58,769
No, not about that.

752
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:01,313
Why did you help me hide?

753
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,774
Were you hoping
to benefit from it later on?

754
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,278
When I was going through
a tough time in the past,

755
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,405
you saved me.

756
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:12,449
I did?

757
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,912
You really don't remember anything.

758
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:19,831
I was just joking.

759
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,541
I help others as a hobby.

760
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,085
I'm a very compassionate person.

761
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:25,045
How could you crack jokes about it?

762
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:27,422
What?

763
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,175
Do you know what it's like
to lose all your memories?

764
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:31,551
It's like floating

765
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,888
in the middle of the sea
all alone at night.

766
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:36,723
Not remembering the person I'm seeing.

767
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,559
Not knowing what happened
between me and those I live with.

768
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,020
Do you have any idea
how devastating and scary that--

769
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,108
They clearly hate my guts.

770
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:48,318
Who knows what they'll do to me now?

771
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,113
-That's not what I meant…
-Forget it.

772
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:54,825
You'd never understand
this dramatic life I'm living.

773
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,831
She doesn't seem to know

774
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,542
that those who hate her have no power.

775
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:08,296
Who votes for someone they don't like?
Everyone votes for who they like.

776
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,845
We are here again
for the remembrance service

777
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:19,349
for the late chairman, which was
unfortunately interrupted last time.

778
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:27,441
Today, we will read
The Gospel of Matthew from 10:34 to 42.

779
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,527
I will read it aloud.

780
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,741
"Do not think that I have come…"

781
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,325
Here's the medical record.

782
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,287
"…to bring peace to the earth."

783
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:44,875
"I have not come to bring peace,
but a sword."

784
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:51,798
"For I have come
to set a man against his father,

785
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,718
and a daughter against her mother."

786
00:50:57,053 --> 00:51:00,056
I hope she never regains her memory.

787
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,642
How much longer must we worry
about not upsetting Mi-na?

788
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,896
That woman always gave me the creeps.

789
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:10,901
I'm not saying you should be good to her.
Just don't be mean. Why is that so hard?

790
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:13,361
That sly brat
purposely never said anything.

791
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,781
But now that she has a few screws loose…

792
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:19,618
Even if something happens to her
in this house, no one will care.

793
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:25,290
"And a daughter-in-law
against her mother-in-law."

794
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,717
"And a person's enemies

795
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,928
will be those of his own household."

796
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,225
AND A PERSON'S ENEMIES

797
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,352
WILL BE THOSE OF HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD

798
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,689
My prayer has been answered today.

799
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,609
Hallelujah, damn it.

800
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:54,861
Hey!

801
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:01,743
You think I'm a joke?

802
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,829
Why do you keep throwing it just at me?

803
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,040
Mi-na, he was just being
a little mischievous--

804
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:10,460
Right, but why just me?
Why is he only doing this to me?

805
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:11,920
Honey, he's just a kid.

806
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:14,840
-Try to understand and sit down.
-Let go!

807
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:18,760
"Understand?" You mean
I should just keep my mouth shut.

808
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,387
Be quiet!

809
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:30,230
Is this a shouting match?
Are we at a gambling joint or something?

810
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:33,567
Why did you suddenly shout?
You startled me!

811
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:41,283
How crude of you.

812
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:43,785
Just what I'd expect from someone
born out of wedlock.

813
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:45,453
Oh, dear Lord.

814
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:49,207
Gosh, it's disgusting that
someone thinks that way in 2021.

815
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:52,711
Aren't you ashamed to say that out loud?
Are we in the 19th century or what?

816
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:55,130
Why are you making such a big deal
out of nothing?

817
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,548
Watch what you say, will you?

818
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,884
Really? Sure, I can do that.

819
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,844
You scumbag. You're the worst.

820
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:03,638
A mama's boy, a papa's boy.
Will you please shut your mouth?

821
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,015
Happy now?

822
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:07,017
Seriously, what's your problem?

823
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,478
What? Did you hit me in the past?

824
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,233
No.

825
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,028
-Mi-na.
-What?

826
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,779
Don't mind me.

827
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,990
I can say that much. What's wrong with it?

828
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:25,118
-Mi-na.
-Let go!

829
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:26,870
-Goodness.
-Mi-na.

830
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:30,332
Treating your in-laws this way is like
spitting on your own face. So stop.

831
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:32,918
Exactly. Let me spit on my own face.
Why do you care?

832
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,045
It's not like
I'm spitting in others' faces.

833
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,171
Darn it!

834
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,049
SERVICE FOR LATE CHAIRMAN HAN HYUNG-MO

835
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:41,384
Don't you dare mess with me!
Do you know who I am?

836
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:44,930
Who am I?

837
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:49,017
Who am I?

838
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,125
About the medical records.
Are you sure they're hers?

839
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,920
I got them from the VIP team.

840
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,588
Is there a problem?

841
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:21,424
Is there really no record of her
getting scar removal surgery

842
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,259
after she got married?

843
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,345
If it's not there,
it means she never got it.

844
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:35,021
I never wear clothes
that don't cover my arms.

845
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,189
Why not?

846
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:41,653
It's a scar from when I was scolded
by my mother as a kid.

847
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,824
You're the first person
I've shown this to.

848
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,410
If I ever go missing, find me using this.

849
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:58,044
I'm allergic to peanuts.
I can't eat a single one.

850
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:03,091
Sometimes, I start to break out
just from smelling them.

851
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,485
Goodbye.

852
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,080
Let's get going.

853
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:38,960
You're the best.

854
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:46,259
I'm going home with Father and Mother.
I'll see you at home.

855
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,305
Jerk.

856
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:53,349
I knew it when he refused
to share a bedroom with me.

857
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,727
You don't want anything
to do with me? Fine.

858
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,564
This is life.

859
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:03,109
Life with money, fame, and a temper.

860
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:07,197
I couldn't ask for more. It's the best.

861
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:16,247
I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

862
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,380
Are you one of those people
with traditional values?

863
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,092
Are you here to lecture me?

864
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:33,765
Fine. I shouldn't have lost
my temper like that.

865
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:36,643
But isn't it understandable?
You heard what they said.

866
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,646
Also, people can get
emotionally unstable after--

867
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:40,772
Who on earth…

868
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:42,774
are you?

869
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:44,400
What?

870
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:46,319
Who are you?

871
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,365
What are you doing here?

872
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:54,202
Where's the real Mi-na?

873
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:16,891
EPILOGUE

874
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:24,566
By the way…

875
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,824
Help!

876
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:34,159
14 YEARS AGO

877
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:37,662
Please. I don't even remember
how many hospitals I've been to.

878
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:40,081
Please don't kick me out.

879
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,749
We don't have any beds either.

880
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,711
Go and register first.

881
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,672
-Sorry?
-Doctor, we don't have any beds.

882
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,592
Squeeze her in for a moment.

883
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,269
Grandma.

884
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,072
We've been keeping an eye on you at home.

885
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,325
Are you taking medication
even at our vacation home?

886
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,287
Every time you're admitted to a hospital,

887
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,331
people gossip
about your blood type and all.

888
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,541
You're such a nuisance.

889
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,336
Instead of being so useless all your life

890
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:29,297
and successfully taking your life one day,

891
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,219
why don't you do our family
some good for once?

892
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:06,793
ARE YOU OKAY?

893
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,179
WHAT?

894
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:35,947
NO ONE ASKED ME IF I WAS OKAY ALL DAY

895
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:41,077
EXCEPT YOU

896
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:00,680
Are you okay?

897
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,357
Father! Why don't you have

898
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,317
some deodeok before you leave?

899
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,651
You should have pounded it more!

900
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,821
So you two had an affair,
and I knew about it?

901
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:19,699
I'm not just a good driver.
I'm very patient too.

902
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:23,328
-What will you do now?
-I'll have to find out who the target was.

903
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:24,621
Once I get my inheritance…

904
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:27,457
-Are you sure you can get it?
-Did you hear that there will be

905
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,292
an extraordinary
shareholders' meeting today?

906
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,794
What? Am I really doomed?

907
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,005
Don't think we can share
Hanju Group together.

908
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:36,716
Something's not right.
