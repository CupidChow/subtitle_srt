1
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,560
Hiro?

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,170
Who—
What are—

3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,110
Get out.

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,770
Hiro: Are you home?

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,710
He wants an update? Is he my boyfriend now?

6
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,840
How do you like your steak, sir?

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,760
Medium-well.
Okay.

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,380
How about you, ma’am? How do you like your steak?

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,630
Wet…

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,920
Uh! I mean…

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,430
Well-done.

12
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,380
You want me to be your fuck buddy?

13
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,150
Having a fuck buddy is not for the weak.

14
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,190
But are you sure you won’t develop feelings for me?

15
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,220
Of course not.

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,580
That will never happen. Even if you swear on your dick.

17
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,610
Who is she?

18
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,850
Woah!

19
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,380
She’s Giselle Davis, right?

20
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,780
Wow!

21
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,480
Wait a sec, why is she looking at me like that?

22
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,200
Chill, girl.

23
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,120
She’s my girlfriend.

24
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,010
“Girlfriend?”

25
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,700
What “girlfriend?”

26
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,430
Just kidding.

27
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,470
She’s my new friend.

28
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,850
What kind of joke was that?

29
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,560
That actually scared me for a bit.

30
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,230
Hiro’s a new pal of mine.

31
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,440
Nice meeting you.

32
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:40,990
I’ll say…

33
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,070
So then—

34
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,240
Why are two coming out of the restroom together?

35
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,960
What’s with her interrogation?

36
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,290
Fuck, this is awkward!

37
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,880
You can handle this, Hiro. I’m out.

38
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,470
I think I should go ahead.

39
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,590
Keys.

40
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,640
Bye, guys. I’ll go ahead.

41
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,900
She’s so fancy.

42
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,240
And looks decent.

43
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,530
Prim and proper type of girl.

44
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,330
So this is Hiro’s type. Someone you can easily introduce to the parents.

45
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,750
Bummer.

46
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,160
I don’t think she’s been able to move on yet.

47
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,470
I wonder if he’s moved on…

48
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,020
Well, it’s none of my business.

49
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,770
As long as Hiro lets me know because I don’t want to be the third-party.

50
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,700
Sorry about that.

51
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,240
It’s fine. Just don’t do that joke again, please.

52
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,620
Okay, I’ll drive you home.

53
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,460
Wow!

54
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,580
I get a free ride today?

55
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,630
Thank you so much.

56
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,840
Hey, it’s not for free.

57
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,010
You have to pay me with your time on Wednesday.

58
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,800
I’m okay with Wednesday,

59
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,640
but I’m not sure what time I’ll be able to finish my project then.

60
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,020
Then let’s reschedule.

61
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,190
Your studies are more important.

62
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,020
He’s really concerned about my grades.

63
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,480
I’m free on Thursday if you want.

64
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,650
I can’t—

65
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,360
I can’t on Thursday, I have some important things to do.

66
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,530
Really?

67
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,910
Then let’s do it this weekend.

68
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,660
Aren’t you supposed to go home to Laguna?

69
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,250
I’ll go home next month.

70
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,670
Why? Aren’t you homesick?

71
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,050
Are you free this weekend or not?

72
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,050
I need to plan my schedule.

73
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,840
You’re not the only one who wants to meet with me, you know?

74
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,010
Yes, okay!

75
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,800
I’ll pick you up on the weekend, okay?

76
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,310
What’s your favorite color?

77
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,390
What?

78
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,430
That’s so random.

79
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,310
Why?

80
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,650
So I’ll know what color underwear I’ll be wearing.

81
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,240
Okay, okay!

82
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,660
I prefer, if you don’t wear any.

83
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,080
Hey! You pervert!

84
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,160
Fine then.

85
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,710
Let’s go?

86
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,210
Let’s go.

87
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,930
I’m sorry, dear. It’s just your Mama wants all of Joker’s gifts returned back to him.

88
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,520
Why, Aunty?

89
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,850
Did they break up?

90
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,400
Yes, that is why she’s so sad right now.

91
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,440
It was already a huge joke when they first started their relationship.

92
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,780
How is she?

93
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,740
As usual, she hasn’t been eating.

94
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,410
That’s just how Mama is whenever she breaks up with her boyfriends.

95
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,120
How about you? Are you sure you won’t be coming home this weekend?

96
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,870
Yes, I won’t.

97
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,920
I wouldn’t want to waste my allowance.

98
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,380
All right, then. I’ll go to the market now.

99
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,420
You take care.

100
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,550
Yes, Aunty.

101
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,590
Bye!

102
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,840
Hiro: Pack an overnight bag.

103
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,970
Well…

104
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,220
Where is this guy taking me?

105
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,200
Someone’s excited here.

106
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,750
Got yourself a date?

107
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,000
What date?

108
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,080
I don’t date, remember?

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,130
I’ll just stay overnight.

110
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,460
So, where will you both stay overnight?

111
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,960
Well?

112
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,300
Is he super hot?

113
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,930
Is he big?

114
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,470
Come on!

115
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,060
Jeez, don’t just laugh it off.

116
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,060
So, what’s his name?

117
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,020
Show us his picture.

118
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,230
We wanna see how yummy he is.

119
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,810
You flirt!

120
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,360
Well?

121
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,650
No!

122
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,190
We’re just short-time fuck buddies.

123
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,280
There’s no need for you guys to meet him since he’ll be out of my life soon enough.

124
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,030
Oh stop it!

125
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,200
I think you’re just scared that—

126
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,620
we might take him from you!

127
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,000
Wow! Seriously…

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,210
- Yes, duh! - As if!

129
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,170
How about this?
Hey!

130
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,800
You can’t handle me!

131
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,010
You can’t handle me!

132
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,880
Why don’t you fix this properly?

133
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,430
You just shoved them all inside.

134
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,220
Be quiet.

135
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,350
Where is she going?

136
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,680
Look at these, it’s so pretty.

137
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,180
Meet me at the parking lot of the billiards center later.

138
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,230
The parking lot, okay?

139
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,850
Don’t go inside.

140
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,490
- Awesome! - You guys are weak!

141
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,870
Riding the high horse now, aren’t we?

142
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,880
I didn’t know you’re good at playing billiards.

143
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,350
I’ll go ahead, guys. My ride's here.

144
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,270
Hey Yanna, who’s that?

145
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:45,980
Your boyfriend?
Jerk!

146
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,190
Yanna’s got a boyfriend!

147
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,610
Motherfuckers!

148
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,400
That’s fine with you?

149
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,690
What?

150
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,490
That they think we’re a couple.

151
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,330
Why?

152
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,340
Did I confirm that you’re my boyfriend?

153
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,080
I don’t really care what other people think.

154
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,580
Besides, didn’t I say that we should meet up at the parking lot?

155
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,540
Why?

156
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,460
You don’t want them to see me?

157
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,800
I just didn’t want to be bothered.

158
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,170
Even with me?

159
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,300
I mean—

160
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,010
Jeez.

161
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,930
He knows he’s hot.

162
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,770
I could just kiss you.

163
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,190
So, what’s with the overnight bag?

164
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,730
Where are we going?

165
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,230
You’ll see.

166
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,500
Alpha Aviation Group is one of the sister companies of FlyAsia.

167
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,750
And this—

168
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,000
This is our hangar.

169
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,500
As you can see, there are a lot of planes here from your dream airline.

170
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,550
Wow, Hiro. There are a lot of planes.

171
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,300
Your family owns this flight school, right?

172
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,140
Yes.

173
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,520
And we are the biggest flight school in the country.

174
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,690
And, as you can see…

175
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,070
these are some airplanes we have.

176
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,190
And yes—

177
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,860
This is where FlyAsia pilots study.

178
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,860
Classmates?

179
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,530
You’re gonna be working with them someday.

180
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,240
When they become pilots…

181
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,250
and when you become a flight attendant.

182
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,170
When I become a flight attendant… It’s so nice to hear that.

183
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,830
It may not be obvious but I’ve promised myself

184
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,510
that I’ll definitely achieve my goals in life.

185
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,090
Do you wanna see the facilities inside?

186
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,890
Let’s go.

187
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,020
They’re your classmates, too?

188
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,680
Yes.

189
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,240
That is one of our regular classrooms for our theoretical classes and…

190
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,890
inside that area is our cutting-edge simulator room.

191
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:10,540
That is where we get our practical experience before getting on an actual plane.

192
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,670
Thanks for this educational tour.

193
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,170
I never thought you’d bring me here.

194
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,420
Why?

195
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,300
You didn’t expect this kind of date?

196
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,550
So…

197
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,140
this is a date?

198
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,390
Bonding, then?

199
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,400
This is next level bonding!

200
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,360
So educational.

201
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:43,570
Later, I’ll give you an educational insight about human body parts.

202
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,950
I really love science!

203
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,870
Hello, Mr. Juarez!

204
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,040
- Sir! -- How are you?

205
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,460
- I’m good. - You have classes today?

206
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,580
No, sir.

207
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,960
Actually I’m with a—

208
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,420
A friend.

209
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,170
This is Ms. Ashianna Fernandez.

210
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,010
FlyAsia’s future flight attendant.

211
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,180
Wow!

212
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,090
Nice to meet you, Ms. Fernandez.

213
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,430
Nice to meet you too.

214
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,180
Future flight attendant and a future airline pilot.

215
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,980
What a perfect couple.

216
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,060
Does he think Hiro and I are a couple?

217
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,230
Wait, do Hiro and I actually look like a couple?

218
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,990
Hey, are you just gonna keep smiling?

219
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,870
Shouldn’t you clear up the misunderstanding that we’re not a couple?

220
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,830
Hiro is my top student.

221
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,670
Although he is the son of the owner, he receives no special treatment at all.

222
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:41,040
He’s very diligent and he’s never absent from his training.

223
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,920
You must be proud of him.

224
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:47,930
Of course! My fuck buddy’s not just amazing in bed but also with his studies, too!

225
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,850
And your dad must be proud of you too, Hiro.

226
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,510
I’m sure he is.

227
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,520
All right.
I’ll see you again.

228
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,230
I’ll see you again.
Goodbye!

229
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,190
Okay, sir.
See you!

230
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,490
Let’s go?
Let’s go!

231
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,240
So here, as you see—

232
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,290
is the simulator.

233
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,450
Can I go inside?

234
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,790
Yes, go ahead!

235
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,500
Wow!

236
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,040
Nice, right?

237
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,420
It’s beautiful!

238
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,010
Most of the student pilots do their procedures training here.

239
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,260
Especially on how to maneuver flight.

240
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,970
It’s amazing!

241
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,060
Does it look good on me?
Yes!

242
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,610
Wow!

243
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,820
Thank you, Hiro…

244
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,660
for bringing me here.

245
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,340
You’re gonna be an amazing flight attendant someday.

246
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,140
Hey!

247
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,900
You might be falling for me.

248
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,760
You better not. Don’t you dare!

249
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,530
You better stop being delusional.

250
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,070
Don’t ruin my hair!

251
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,250
So…

252
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,960
Your…

253
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,960
Your dad’s in charge of this airline?

254
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,550
No.

255
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,630
Am I being too nosy with my question?

256
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,340
It might be too personal.

257
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,050
My mom’s the owner of FlyAsia.

258
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,970
While my brother will be taking over the business.

259
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:01,430
And my dad is a flight instructor in the U.S.

260
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,730
And they’re separated.

261
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,440
Is that why you want to go to the U.S.?

262
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:15,200
Have you considered staying here to take over your family’s business?

263
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,580
No.

264
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,870
Actually, I’m much closer with my dad.

265
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,790
I really want to be a pilot, than doing business.

266
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,050
You’re impressive.

267
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,880
You can juggle flight school and college at the same time.

268
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,010
You make time for the things you love.

269
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,310
Anyway…

270
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,150
Wanna go to the next destination?

271
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,600
Where are we going?

272
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,480
A place with silk and a hot tub.

273
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,050
So, do you like the place?

274
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,150
Are we starting already?

275
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,610
Can’t I freshen up first?

276
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,780
Hey, wait.

277
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,620
Wear this for later.

278
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,320
Why waste time buying

279
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,360
if you’ll just take it all off anyway?

280
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,030
How much is the lingerie?

281
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,410
You don’t have to know that.

282
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,200
What do you mean “I don’t have to know that?”

283
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,080
I’m gonna pay you.

284
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,790
Consider it as a gift.

285
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,670
I don’t want to.

286
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:17,170
You’re not my sugar daddy to give me gifts on random days.

287
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,720
Can’t I give it to you as a friend?

288
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,720
Has there been any woman that was given…

289
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,800
- a lingerie as a gift… - Okay, okay, okay!

290
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,930
I lost.

291
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,970
I’ll message you my bank details.

292
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,270
It’s four thousand, by the way.

293
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,640
So yeah.

294
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:32,810
Four thousand?

295
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,690
Yes.

296
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,440
And you just took it all off?

297
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,770
Why?

298
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,650
Changing your mind?

299
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,820
Four-payment plan.

300
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,740
Four-payment plan?

301
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,160
I’ll split the payment in four installments.

302
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,120
Oh… Four-payment plan. Okay.

303
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,790
Okay, stop.

304
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,340
You’re giving me a hard on.

305
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,440
You idiot!

306
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,950
Why are you so scared of cuddling?

307
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,120
Jerk, you think I’m scared?

308
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,330
Are you scared that you might fall for me if we cuddle?

309
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,750
Yuck!

310
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,330
You’re delusional!

311
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,920
That was really cringey.

312
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,420
So corny!

313
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,960
Why?

314
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,220
Seriously!

315
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,260
After all my satisfying performances.

316
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,970
I think cuddling is your last straw.

317
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,570
Know what, if I’m gonna base it on performance,

318
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,190
then I should’ve fallen in love a lot of times.

319
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,860
So, out of all the guys you’ve been with,

320
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,610
you’re telling me

321
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,070
they’re better than me?

322
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,670
I think I’m your best sex.

323
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,040
In your dreams!

324
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,210
In my dreams, huh?

325
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,590
Okay.

326
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,050
Just admit it.

327
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,970
I’m the best.

328
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,850
By the way…

329
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,640
We can do it without a condom next time.

330
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,730
I went to see a doctor, so I’m taking pills now.

331
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
Are you sure?

332
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,280
I think it’s best if I still wear a condom.

333
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,150
You know, double protection.

334
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,740
Good point.

335
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,910
The last thing I want right now is a kid.

336
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,290
I don’t want to risk it.

337
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,670
Actually, I don’t want to have a kid at all.

338
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,050
Does he not like kids?

339
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,130
Well, I feel the same way.

340
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:09,550
If I’m gonna have a baby, I would properly plan to have one at the right time.

341
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:13,100
I don’t want to have one unexpectedly. I don’t want one when if I’m not ready.

342
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,360
Hey, Elyse?

343
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,280
Yup!

344
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,120
I’ll pick you up.

345
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,830
Who could it be that he needs to pick them up?

346
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,870
Yes, Elyse. I already said okay. I’ll be there.

347
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,790
What’s up?

348
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,710
I have to pick up someone.

349
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,710
So…

350
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,590
can we fix up to leave?

351
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Damn it! I thought we were going for another round before leaving.

352
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,850
Who was that bothersome person?

353
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,410
What would it feel like to be so rich?

354
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,290
Let’s wait for Elyse.

355
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:29,300
Who could this Elyse be that even Hiro seems submissive?

356
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,550
He really has a lot of women in his life.

357
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,780
Oh… She’s young.

358
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,360
Hiro!

359
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,410
Oh, I didn’t realize that you’re with someone.

360
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,670
Well, that was an obvious change of mood.

361
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,710
Elyse, this is Yanna.

362
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,250
Yanna, Elyse.

363
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,880
Hi Elyse, nice to meet you.

364
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,690
What is this girl waiting for?

365
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,710
Okay.

366
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,500
I’ll sit at the back so you guys can talk.

367
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,380
Thanks!

368
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,050
You’re so kind.

369
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,180
Hi!

370
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,930
Thanks for picking me up at my friend's house.

371
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:07,610
Today is our drivers’ day off so no one can drive me to BGC.

372
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,040
No problem.

373
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,400
I’m excited to go to Shan’s condo.

374
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,860
Everyone’s going, right? Including you?

375
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,870
I think she has a crush on Hiro.

376
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:21,790
Ate Erika and Ate Helen are bringing wine and cheese.

377
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,640
Is Neil coming?

378
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,380
I don’t think so. He’s still in Waikiki.

379
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,840
OMG, I’m jealous.

380
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,380
I wanna go, too!

381
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,930
I feel like a third wheel with these two.

382
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,680
Seriously makes me feel out of place to hear two rich people talking.

383
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,710
I guess I’ll just take a nap.

384
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,360
I heard Giselle was at your place last Thursday.

385
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,490
What happened?

386
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,580
Last Thursday?

387
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,080
I’m free on Thursday if you want.

388
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,910
I can’t—

389
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:08,370
I can’t on Thursday, I have some important things to do.

390
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,370
So the important business he meant was his ex.

391
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,800
Nothing much.

392
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,130
He seems to be hiding something.

393
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,430
What do you mean nothing much? Richie caught her leaving your unit late at night.

394
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,310
So she stayed ‘till late, huh.

395
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,770
Nice, bro. That guilty look you have says it all.

396
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:32,440
What have you been doing after agreeing to the exclusivity rule?

397
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:34,940
We just talked.

398
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,570
“Talk” my ass.

399
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,870
So, what happened?

400
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,070
Are you guys back together?

401
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,320
- Yanna— - Thanks for bringing me home.

402
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,360
Hey!

403
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,740
It’s great that we’re exclusive fuck buddies.

404
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,410
But why didn’t you tell me…

405
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,040
that the rule didn’t include exes?

406
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,170
Yanna, nothing happened.

407
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,170
I don’t care if you guys have sex.

408
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,710
It’s just unfair that you’re breaking the rules you agreed to.

409
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:40,010
If you’re gonna get back together with Giselle, let me know.

410
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,930
I don’t want to be your side chick.

411
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,760
We didn’t have sex.

412
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,310
But she kissed me.

413
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,060
Wow!

414
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,150
She kissed you?

415
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,560
Asshole!

416
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,660
Shit, let’s all get drunk!

417
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,410
Let’s go, cheers!

418
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:12,210
Cheers!

419
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,750
Hey! You guys take it slow.

420
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,960
We don’t want anyone getting lost again.

421
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,000
We can never be too careful.

422
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,260
Look at this girl, excited to drink.

423
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,380
So excited to drink.

424
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,430
Why did you suddenly call us to drink?

425
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,800
Is there a problem?

426
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,180
Problem?

427
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,640
Can’t I do this because I wanted to celebrate—

428
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,930
that you finally have a boyfriend!

429
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,480
I know, right?

430
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,690
Fucking finally. It’s official!

431
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,400
It’s so frustrating to watch you guys.

432
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,690
I’m sorry and thanks for all your support.

433
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,990
So, who’s gonna have a boyfriend next?

434
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,490
Obviously not me.

435
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,570
So come on, let’s play.

436
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:47,950
Let’s go, let’s go!

437
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:48,580
Hey!

438
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,950
Hey, take it slow.

439
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,450
Are you sure she doesn’t have a problem?

440
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:09,970
Hi!

441
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,810
Can I race you?

442
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,400
Tall and dark, with a nice smile.

443
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,610
Perfect!

444
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,650
Are we just gonna play?

445
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,860
What will I get if I win?

446
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:30,450
Okay. If you win, I’ll buy you a drink.

447
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,450
Okay, good deal.

448
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:36,420
If you win, I’ll let you kiss me.

449
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,210
Great.

450
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:44,130
Of course, it can't just be Hiro who’s kissing someone else! I should, too!

451
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,010
Fuck, he’s a good kisser.

452
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,470
I’ll immediately agree if he invites me to have sex.

453
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,190
Why do I feel guilty?

454
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,820
There.

455
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,200
You got your prize.

456
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,740
I’ll go back to my friends.

457
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,530
Nice playing with you.

458
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,350
I thought you’re gonna boy hunt tonight?

459
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,480
I’m not in the mood.

460
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,020
Where are the others?

461
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,070
Still playing in the arcade.

462
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,070
Something’s wrong with you tonight.

463
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,630
What are you going on about?

464
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:57,580
I’m just not in the mood because I’ve been doing a lot of stuff recently.

465
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,250
I’ve run out of energy.

466
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,630
Is it about Hiro?

467
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:07,460
What Sam? Are you psychic now? What a perfect intuition.

468
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,660
I’m just mad.

469
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,520
I think he’s hooking up with someone else.

470
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,230
But we’re exclusive fuck buddies, remember?

471
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,650
So annoying.

472
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,780
Are you getting jealous?

473
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,490
Shit!

474
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:29,650
No!

475
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,410
I’m just irritated.

476
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,160
Are you sure?

477
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,240
Yes!

478
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,700
Because if you’re getting jealous, I suggest you better end this set up.

479
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,040
This is just gonna get complicated.

480
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,370
You know that Hiro is leaving, right?

481
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,750
I’m really not jealous!

482
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,590
Okay. I’m just saying.

483
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:51,880
How did you even know that he’s having sex with other girls?

484
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,350
He looked so guilty when I asked him.

485
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,180
Maybe I’m overthinking this.

486
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,310
I don’t know.

487
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,180
So, why don’t you fuck around, too?

488
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,850
If you think he’s breaking the exclusivity rule?

489
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:05,230
That was my plan, but—

490
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,110
I don’t know!

491
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,780
My guilty conscience hit me.

492
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,780
I think it’s the first time you’re being considerate of your fuck buddy.

493
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,620
Yanna, why don’t you tell our friends about this?

494
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,620
They might be able to give you some advice.

495
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,500
There’s no need.

496
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,250
You did say that Hiro’s leaving.

497
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,290
So, there’s no point for me to tell them.

498
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,300
Okay. If you say so.

499
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:40,640
You better not think that I’m falling for him.

500
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,730
It won’t happen.

501
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,650
I’m worried, Yanna.

502
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:50,070
I know Hiro’s kind but liking him is a heartbreak waiting to happen.

503
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,900
I know.

504
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,490
Stop being paranoid now. I know!

505
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:57,450
I’ve even set strict rules for myself. Okay?

506
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,370
I hope you can stick to it.

507
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:16,260
Fuck this hangover! Who even invented this shit?

508
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:28,060
Hiro: Hey, are you busy? You're not replying to any of my messages.

509
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,690
Hiro: I'll go to your dorm. Let's talk.

510
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,950
Hiro: Yanna, I'm here outside.

511
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,240
Hiro: Yanna?

512
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,330
Hiro: Fine. I'm breaking in.

513
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,040
Thank you for helping me out, Ate Nanette.

514
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,410
Just call me Nanette.

515
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,250
Anything for you.

516
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,130
I’ll go now.

517
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,210
Thank you.

518
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,970
So, you manipulated her to open the door to my dorm room?

519
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,260
I guess…

520
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,640
my charm worked.

521
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,730
What are you doing here?

522
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,650
Because you are not talking to me.

523
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,450
What do we have to talk about?

524
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:20,620
If you want to get back together with Giselle, fine by me.

525
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,950
Just let me know so that I can make my exit.

526
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:27,410
Like I said, I don’t want to be your side chick.

527
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,870
Okay

528
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,460
Listen.

529
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:36,020
That night, Giselle was asking me if we could try again.

530
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,600
And I declined because there was no point.

531
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,930
I’m leaving soon and she knows that.

532
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:53,440
She kept crying and crying, so I let her stay late until she calmed down.

533
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:59,150
So to clarify things, we didn’t get back together.

534
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,860
Okay?

535
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,490
Shit, he seems to be telling the truth.

536
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,040
What am I getting angry for anyway?

537
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,540
I’m sorry for not telling you beforehand.

538
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,970
Sorry for being petty.

539
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,100
Can I make it up to you?

540
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:27,600
How?

541
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,890
I’ll bring you somewhere today.

542
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,060
Go pack a bag.

543
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,980
Staying the night again?

544
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,110
Yes!

545
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:39,530
So, pack a cute dress.

546
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,280
Cute dress?

547
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,290
Here you go.

548
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,470
So, what do you think?

549
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,180
It’s fine.

550
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,180
It’s fine?

551
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,940
What does that mean?

552
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:14,810
It’s okay.

553
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,150
It’s okay?

554
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,230
So, where do you wanna start with our self-care weekend?

555
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:33,120
Swimming? Massage? Or anything?

556
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,820
Let’s go swimming.

557
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,800
It would relieve the stress you gave me.

558
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,860
The fuck is that?

559
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,160
- What? - Is this supposed to be a romantic date?

560
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,660
Didn’t I tell you that I don't like this kind of stuff?

561
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,540
It’s just my way of making it up to you.

562
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,450
You even go the extra mile for a fuck buddy, huh.

563
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,790
Actually…

564
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,000
I can do more.

565
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:51,640
But, I stop myself from doing it because I don’t want you to be uncomfortable.

566
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,730
Anyway, you should try this sake.

567
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,940
It’s really good. Trust me.

568
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,070
Looks good!

569
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,400
Yes.

570
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,610
Kanpai?

571
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:09,700
Kanpai!

572
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:16,620
It’s good.

573
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,870
So…

574
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,170
You’ll be leaving for Florida in a couple of months.

575
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,670
Yes, just a few more months.

576
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,970
Don’t you wanna try again with Giselle?

577
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,180
A long-distance relationship?

578
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,280
I don’t believe in LDRs.

579
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,270
My parents separated because LDR didn’t work for them.

580
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,690
My dad is always in the U.S. and my mom is so busy working here for our business.

581
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,030
I get it.

582
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,160
I’m not a fan of LDRs, either.

583
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:58,660
I always want to be with my partner.

584
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,250
Because I never got to experience being together with my family growing up.

585
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,630
So…

586
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,340
Your parents couldn’t make time for you?

587
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,090
My parents are separated, too.

588
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,640
When I was five, Papa caught Mama with another guy.

589
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,730
That was it.

590
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:23,940
He left her.

591
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,150
I never got to know Papa ever since.

592
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,780
Sorry to hear about that.

593
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,200
What happened after they separated?

594
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,620
As a single mom,

595
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,160
she drowned herself with work.

596
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:47,650
From morning ‘till night, no matter what job it is, she’ll take it.

597
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,130
So I was left to Aunty Isabel.

598
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,130
That’s why I see her as my second mother.

599
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,140
My mom was obsessed with getting boyfriends.

600
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,230
She always seemed to be looking for love.

601
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:08,520
She even makes time for her boyfriends more than with me.

602
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:17,320
So, is that the reason why you’re not close with your mom?

603
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:26,250
I hope I’m not overstepping but—

604
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:31,170
is that the reason why you’re not a deep fan of relationships?

605
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,420
A bit.

606
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,220
But honestly,

607
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,890
I still haven’t found a great guy.

608
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,010
They’re all bastards.

609
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,680
As long as I’m happy

610
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,230
and the sex is good, I’m all for it.

611
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,270
If not, good bye.

612
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:54,900
Sex is different when you do it with someone you love.

613
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,990
You know that?

614
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,620
What’s the difference

615
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,730
It’s still the same idea of receiving and giving pleasure.

616
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:12,180
It's hard to explain, but—

617
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:16,240
it’s a different kind of intimacy.

618
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:20,180
But I hope you get to experience it soon.

619
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,870
Help me find a partner, then.

620
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,900
A partner?

621
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:38,570
Okay.

622
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,450
Well, I can’t recommend Shan.

623
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,000
He’s my friend, he’s very close to me.

624
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:48,670
I know him.

625
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,460
How about Zack? Do you know Zack?

626
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,340
He’s my crush.

627
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,350
Oh…

628
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:00,470
Okay.

629
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:02,390
Well, you’re not his type.

630
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,850
Ouch.

631
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,060
Actually, you’re not that hard to like.

632
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,150
So…

633
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,760
you like me?

634
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,720
Nah.

635
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:26,120
This is different.

636
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:30,750
I rarely show my vulnerable side, but I guess, just this once,

637
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,250
I’m giving Hiro the privilege

638
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:35,950
You know,

639
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,510
after this game,

640
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,130
I think we can be friends.

641
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:43,140
Friends?

642
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:47,920
Friends…

643
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:54,440
So we evolved from being fuck buddies to friends with benefits?

644
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,520
Yes.

645
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,980
Same rules.

646
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:01,260
But we can hang out after sex since we’re friends now.

647
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:26,850
You’re a good friend, huh?

648
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,140
Fist bump!

649
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:33,650
Fist bump, good friend!

650
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,020
Sure.

651
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:38,400
There you go. Cheers!

652
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,910
This is really strong, what is this?

653
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:45,410
Sake.

654
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:46,410
Huh?

655
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:47,830
Sake.
Sa-Sa…

656
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:50,250
Sake.

657
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:51,330
Sake.

658
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,540
Later.

659
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:55,130
Wow.

660
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:57,000
You’re drunk.

661
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:58,500
Huh?

662
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:00,050
No!

663
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,260
I’m not drunk.

664
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,760
Yes, you are.

665
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,300
- Yes, you are. - No!

666
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:07,180
Time to rest.

667
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:11,730
Let’s go.

668
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:13,180
Come on.

669
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:16,060
I’m not drunk, really!

670
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,190
Yes, you are.

671
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:20,400
There’s still more. Let’s not waste it.

672
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,150
No, it’s fine.

673
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:23,860
Care—

674
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:27,910
Be careful…

675
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,990
Are we in the bedroom?

676
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,750
Are we gonna have sex?

677
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:38,880
Are we gonna have sex?

678
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,640
Let’s have sex?

679
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,900
Let’s have sex.

680
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:08,990
No sex tonight.

681
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,410
Why not?

682
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:13,790
You’re drunk.

683
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:15,710
You can’t give proper consent.

684
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,170
Be careful.

685
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:25,050
You’re right.

686
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,880
Good job.

687
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:30,600
Okay, your head—

688
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:35,180
No sex if I’m drunk.

689
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:36,940
Right.

690
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:45,150
Where is it?

691
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,840
What are you doing?

692
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:14,100
You took off my makeup last time I was drunk, huh?

693
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:42,630
Yes.

694
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,170
Do you remember?

695
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:52,010
Why are you so kind?

696
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:57,500
You do this to all your fuck buddies, don’t you?

697
00:47:57,930 --> 00:47:59,180
Oh, wait.

698
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,310
I’m your first fuck buddy.

699
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,080
Be careful with your next fuck buddies.

700
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,290
They might just…

701
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:20,360
They might just fall for you, too.

702
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,170
Luckily, I’m a—

703
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:26,540
strong woman.

704
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:30,840
I don’t fall in love easily.

705
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:49,730
Good night, Yanna.

706
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,490
No dating relationship here.

707
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:56,200
No gifts, flowers, dinner dates, not even a sweet greeting.

708
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:00,900
Good morning.

709
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:08,540
No dating relationship

710
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:13,750
No cuddles after sex

711
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,430
Yanna, promise me,

712
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,390
if you start to catch any weird feelings,

713
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:50,150
you’ll stop this.

714
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,110
This is nothing.

715
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,480
This is just a game.

716
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:55,780
- Is that Hiro? - Let’s take a seat.

717
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:57,860
Who’s with him?

718
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,370
I really missed him.

719
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:05,080
If this is how it’s going to be, let’s just stop.

720
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,080
There’s no sense of us being exclusive fuck buddies anymore.

721
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,670
I wanna taste other guys, too.

722
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:11,630
This is for you.

723
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:13,380
Use it when you go on dates.

724
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:16,010
I don’t go on dates.

725
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:16,510
Hi!
Hiro?

726
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,260
What are you doing here?

727
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,550
- I didn’t realize that we have a visitor. - Yes!

728
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:24,180
Hi, Ma.
