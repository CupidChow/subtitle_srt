1
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,700
That's a gift from your daddy.

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,490
Really, Mommy?

3
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,420
I like your hairclip.

4
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,710
Thank you.
My daddy gave it to me.

5
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,550
We need to talk.

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,100
I want to meet her.

7
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,040
This is...

8
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,130
Hiro…

9
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,470
your daddy.

10
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,970
Hello, Avrielle.

11
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
It’s okay.

12
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,600
You wanna meet him, right?

13
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,670
I’m Hiro…

14
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,050
your daddy.

15
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,150
Don’t cry.

16
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,740
I’m sorry.

17
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,720
Don’t cry…

18
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,450
I’m sorry.

19
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,750
You’re not mad at me and
mommy anymore?

20
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,880
I would never get mad at
you and mommy.

21
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,460
Never.

22
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:46,760
Daddy loves you very much.

23
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,810
He loves you so much.

24
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,940
Is it true, Daddy? You love me?

25
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:07,320
I loved you even before you
were born, my love.

26
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,160
I promise, I’ll stay.

27
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,070
I’ll never leave again.

28
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,980
We’ll be together.

29
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,600
But what if I stayed?

30
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,770
What if I was there since
the beginning?

31
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,130
I could have taken care of her
when she was pregnant.

32
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,190
I could have held her when
she was still a baby.

33
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,370
I could have watched
her grow up.

34
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,650
I could have helped
you raise her.

35
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,970
I should have been there for you.

36
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,550
I should have been there
for the both of you.

37
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,830
Can I spend the day with
my daughter?

38
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
Yes.

39
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,670
Don’t cry. Don’t cry, my love.

40
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,050
We’re gonna spend the
day together.

41
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,870
Aunty, are you going with us?

42
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,290
No, aunty has a meeting with
a client today.

43
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,250
I know you’ll enjoy it with your
mommy and daddy.

44
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,790
Okay, Aunty.

45
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,900
Are you excited?

46
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,470
You’re so pretty!

47
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,790
Thank you for letting
me do this.

48
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,030
No problem.

49
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,160
Anytime.

50
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,820
Hi, my love.

51
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,810
Daddy, look at my outfit.

52
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,870
You look so pretty, my love.

53
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
Are you excited?

54
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,820
I’m excited to explore
Japan with you.

55
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,440
Wow!
Let’s go?

56
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,940
Bye, Aunty!

57
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,780
Bye, have fun.

58
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,810
Bye.

59
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,170
Thank you.

60
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,970
What do you want?

61
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,200
I want this, this, this…

62
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,120
and this.

63
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,270
Avrielle, that’s too
much sweets.

64
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,270
It’s fine.

65
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,690
It’s okay, love.
Just for today, right?

66
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,670
Okay, go.
Pick everything you want.

67
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,900
No! Just one. Have just one.

68
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,990
Just for today.

69
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,490
How about three?

70
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,740
- Can you even finish it?
- Say please, Avi.

71
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,950
Avi, say… Mommy, please.

72
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,160
Please.

73
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,540
Okay! We’ll order three.

74
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,880
Three.

75
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,340
There you go. See?

76
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,870
Look at Avi. Looks like
she’s enjoying all the rides.

77
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,620
She’s so cute!

78
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,540
This is the first time
I’ve seen her this happy.

79
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,790
Really?

80
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,970
I’ve never been this happy, too.

81
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,630
How about you?

82
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,390
Me?

83
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,640
I’m overjoyed.

84
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,330
I was thinking if it’s…

85
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,720
okay with you to…

86
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,130
change Avi’s surname to Juarez?

87
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,090
If you want to.

88
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,510
We can talk about it when
we get back to Manila.

89
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,010
Okay.

90
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,380
I also have to ask Avi
for her opinion.

91
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,230
Okay.

92
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,230
By the way—

93
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,900
once we’re back in Manila,

94
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,850
just let me know if you
want to visit Avi.

95
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,830
You can visit her anytime
you want.

96
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,080
Okay, just tell me
your schedule.

97
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,200
I can cancel some flights, too.

98
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,980
So our schedules would match.

99
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,490
Why?

100
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,340
I don't want Avi to be
left alone.

101
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,680
I know you have kind friends
to take care of her.

102
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:41,750
But it’s better if we personally
take care of our daughter.

103
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,300
Okay.
We’ll take turns.

104
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,230
Yanna, I wrote you a
letter back then.

105
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,310
But it got sent back

106
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,370
because no one received
it in your house.

107
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,420
What letter?

108
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,370
Nothing.

109
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,110
It’s just a letter

110
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,260
saying how I admire you
for a lot of things.

111
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,640
How I admire you for
being a strong,

112
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,060
dedicated woman.

113
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,560
Look at you now.

114
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,740
I’m right.

115
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,210
I don’t know why I didn’t
get your letter.

116
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,250
It’s fine.

117
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,420
Better late than never.

118
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,720
I guess it’s just saying destiny
doesn’t want us to

119
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,090
bid our goodbyes.

120
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,770
Did you love me back then?

121
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,900
Between the two of us,
I lost first.

122
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,030
I doubt that.

123
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,580
I fell in love with you first.

124
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,410
Double shot 1926.

125
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,270
Let’s go—

126
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,730
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

127
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,650
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you!

128
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,850
An airplane!
Hurry, make a wish!

129
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,560
I wish that I’ll become a
flight attendant.

130
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,810
A beautiful and successful
flight attendant.

131
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:52,190
I wish I’ll be an international
commercial pilot.

132
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,570
I wish we’d always be like this,

133
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,280
happy and content together
for a long time.

134
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,950
What did you whisper about?

135
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,580
I just added one more wish.

136
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,270
I’ll miss you so much.

137
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,430
You don’t know how much
I love you.

138
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,810
And I still do until now, Yanna.

139
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,610
I love you.

140
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,600
And I’m really hoping to work
things out with you again.

141
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,330
Daddy, look.
There’s fireworks.

142
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:43,870
Wow!

143
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,540
Come here.

144
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,930
SAM: Hey, not going
home tonight.

145
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,450
I’m drinking with my friends.

146
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,770
Feel free to have sex in
my hotel room xoxo

147
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,560
SAM: Don’t wake up the child.

148
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,250
SAM: Also don’t do it in my bed.

149
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,490
Do it in the shower instead.

150
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,570
YANNA: Bitch.

151
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:49,390
Sam’s not coming home tonight
so I’ll sleep here with Avi.

152
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:52,670
You can go down now if
you want to rest.

153
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,710
I also wanna stay here, though.

154
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,880
Suit yourself.

155
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,390
YANNA: Is this room soundproof?
Just kidding.

156
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,610
Who are you texting?

157
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,860
Just Sam.

158
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,910
Okay, I’ll just get something.

159
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,380
SAM: You flirt.

160
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:47,890
HIRO: I forgot to ask, do you
want me to get your luggage?

161
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,720
YANNA: I miss the sex lol

162
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,580
HIRO: What?

163
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,910
HIRO: Calm down, woman.

164
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:24,810
YANNA: I sent the wrong message.
Sure, please get my luggage.

165
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,580
Your luggage.

166
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,290
Thanks.

167
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,680
What was the text?

168
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,390
You missed...

169
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,260
what?

170
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,430
That wasn’t me.

171
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,600
You were hacked?

172
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,610
Yes.

173
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,110
Hacked!

174
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,690
Okay.

175
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,200
Are you okay?

176
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:37,960
I’m not lying!
I meant to say, I miss—

177
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,120
Sam!

178
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,460
You know how autocorrects work.

179
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,890
How do I fix this…

180
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,340
It’s so problematic.

181
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,930
So, what’s your next excuse?

182
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,060
I misclicked.

183
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,190
So, why do you miss having sex?

184
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,910
Because you were my last.

185
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,740
Really?

186
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,220
Why would I lie about it?

187
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,950
Do you want me to make
you remember it,

188
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,680
so you won’t miss it anymore?

189
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,620
Not too loud.
Avi might wake up.

190
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,670
Left, right...

191
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,880
Are you okay, Mommy?

192
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,890
Mommy is so fine.

193
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,940
I’m okay, baby.

194
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,440
Good morning, baby.

195
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,470
Good morning.

196
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,350
Wow. Are you a baby?

197
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,350
Could be. Can I?

198
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,630
Avi, Daddy’s asking if he
can also be a baby?

199
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,940
Yes, Mommy!

200
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,690
Approved.

201
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,020
So?

202
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,990
I’ll think about it.

203
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,370
You’ll think about it… Okay.

204
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,670
How did you learn to braid hair?

205
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,680
From a tutorial video online.

206
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,390
And—

207
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:47,310
Left, right, left, right…
Almost done.

208
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,110
Last one. There you go.

209
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,470
Beautiful!

210
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,600
- You’re like—
- You like it?

211
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,640
Wow!

212
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,200
Yes, Daddy.
Thank you, Daddy!

213
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,700
- Wow!
- You’re welcome, my love.

214
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,410
All right.

215
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,620
Now go. Go pack your things
and your toys, okay?

216
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,350
Be careful.

217
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,050
Hey.

218
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:23,930
Yes?

219
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,770
Live with me.

220
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,850
Let’s be a family living
in one home.

221
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,690
I will take care of everything.

222
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,690
I really want to provide
for my family.

223
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,410
Don’t worry,
you don’t have to—

224
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,890
No.

225
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,900
I’ve decided.

226
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,560
But, we’re gonna help
each other,

227
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,560
you shouldn’t be the only one
who’ll provide for us.

228
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,930
We’ll work together for Avi.

229
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,510
Deal?

230
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,180
How can I say no to that?

231
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,160
Good morning.

232
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,360
Good morning!

233
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,320
Your hair’s so nice.

234
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,340
Hey, baby.

235
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,500
Mommy, where’s Daddy?

236
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,320
He’s driving the plane.

237
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,420
He’ll see you after the flight.

238
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:37,300
Let me know if you
need anything.

239
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,220
Yes, Miss Fernandez.

240
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,550
Bitch!

241
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,640
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen,

242
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,890
this is your captain,
Akihiro Juarez speaking.

243
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:51,980
We are currently cruising
at an altitude of 33,000

244
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,060
at an airspeed of 400
miles per hour.

245
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,570
- That’s my Daddy!
- The time is 11:35 AM.

246
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,280
The weather looks good today

247
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,360
and with the tailwind
on our side.

248
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,740
We are expecting to
land in Manila

249
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,580
approximately ten minutes
ahead of our time.

250
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,110
For your safety, keep your
seatbelt fastened

251
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,430
whenever you are seated.

252
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:15,380
In the meantime, sit back,
relax, and enjoy the flight.

253
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,750
Thank you for choosing FlyAsia!

254
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,550
And I would like to take this
chance to say hello

255
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,800
to two very important
people in my life

256
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,930
who are also on this flight…

257
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,600
Ashianna Fernandez—

258
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,810
You finally admitted it.

259
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,150
and
Avrielle Haven Fernandez Juarez.

260
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,860
That’s me.

261
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:49,370
I love you above and beyond
airplanes could ever fly.

262
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,460
I love you, Daddy!

263
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,380
That was awesome.

264
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,410
There’s no turning back now.

265
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,670
We’ve transferred most of
our stuff to your condo.

266
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,840
I was sure about you even before
I left five years ago.

267
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,840
Good for you.

268
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,740
Are you okay?

269
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,750
She grew up here.

270
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,920
I just wish I was there.

271
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,330
It’s okay.

272
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:32,650
What’s important is that you’re here now.

273
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,350
Sorry.

274
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,730
You had to do all the job
raising our daughter.

275
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,740
I know you can do everything
by yourself,

276
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,000
but it would have been
a lot easier if I was there.

277
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,780
Come on…

278
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:56,000
Did it look like I had
a hard time?

279
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,750
I still look gorgeous.

280
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,120
Good thing Avi looks like me.

281
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:05,250
Hey, our next kid will look
more like me.

282
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,420
I’m claiming it!

283
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,170
Next kid?

284
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,800
You said before that you didn't
want to have children.

285
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,800
I want kids with you, Yanna.

286
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,350
So you want Avi to
have a sibling?

287
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,350
Why not?

288
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:20,640
I want to build a big family
with you.

289
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,610
Big family?
Like a flight crew?

290
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:31,490
Can’t we do a whole
airline instead?

291
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,280
That’s at least a hundred!
I can’t handle that!

292
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,830
Then let’s start
baby number two right now.

293
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,750
Hey!

294
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,750
What? What?

295
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,000
Wait a minute.

296
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,550
I can’t wait.

297
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,580
I can’t—

298
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,740
Look Mommy, Daddy,
I earned a lot of stars.

299
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:22,350
- Wow! You did good, baby.
- Wow! Good job, my love.

300
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:25,290
Because of that, you get
to eat a lot.

301
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,160
Now taste Daddy’s cooking.

302
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:32,190
Okay. Go ahead and eat.

303
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,050
Eat plenty.

304
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,080
So? How’s Daddy’s adobo?

305
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,480
Better than Mommy’s adobo.

306
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,280
Excuse me?

307
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,110
I’m sorry, Mommy.

308
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,280
Kids don’t lie, so…

309
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,330
Don’t be too arrogant.

310
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,040
It's just one point, Mommy.

311
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,620
Okay, let’s give it to him.

312
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,420
He’s been gone for five years.

313
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,750
Sam, let's go.
Get Aunty Sam.

314
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,270
No, no! I’m okay.

315
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,780
Come on!

316
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,320
Okay.

317
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,380
You, you, you!

318
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,080
Aunty Sam!

319
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,500
Mommy! Mommy’s turn.

320
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,480
Copy Mommy.

321
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:05,350
So cute.
Can I join?

322
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,060
Come here!

323
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,610
So cute!

324
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,630
Where’s Hiro?

325
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,860
Why don’t you just introduce
us to your pilot?

326
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,920
He has a flight.

327
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,730
Besides, why don’t you just
introduce us to your—

328
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,660
Taste this pizza, it’s
delicious.

329
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,620
Well? It’s good, right?

330
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:33,000
Come on guys, you all know
who he is already.

331
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,800
Well, yes. Everyone knows him.

332
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,060
You’re really glowing
today, Yanna.

333
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,260
Huh?

334
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,640
I can tell that you’re
very satisfied.

335
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,470
I hope you are, too.

336
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:47,100
You flirt!

337
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,690
So when’s the bachelorette party?

338
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,700
Dibs on being the wedding
planner. I’ll do it.

339
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,770
I’m in charge of designing
your wedding.

340
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,780
You’re all crazy.
I’m not even engaged,

341
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,520
why are you already thinking
about the bachelorette party?

342
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,570
Let’s not talk about
engagements, please?

343
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,910
Don’t dwell on it, girl.

344
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,830
You said we should forget
about the past, right?

345
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,620
Whatever. We are gonna
make your wedding,

346
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,930
the wedding of the year.

347
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,920
Okay?

348
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,460
Yes!
And we’ll also throw the best

349
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,170
bachelorette party of the year!

350
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,960
Yes!

351
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,740
I’ll invite your exes.

352
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,640
Is that so?

353
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:26,350
Is that what you want—
All right, I’ll cancel everything.

354
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,050
No, don't.

355
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,070
You know what,

356
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,190
it’s weird that among us,

357
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,860
I'm the one being talked
about regarding marriage.

358
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:42,200
At least you realized that
love is real.

359
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,370
That’s your character
development.

360
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,060
And you were even so against
that quote I saw online.

361
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,790
You got hit! Twice.

362
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,540
See?

363
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,800
I hope you guys, too.

364
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,960
I wish that you will all meet
the love of your lives,

365
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,920
because— I’m starting to
feel sorry for you, guys.

366
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,590
You feel sorry for us?

367
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,180
Seriously?

368
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,680
Wow.

369
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,890
I wish, that we will all
become happy

370
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:12,060
with our love life and career.

371
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,140
Cheers?

372
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,900
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

373
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,170
Avi, cheers!

374
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,050
- Cheers, baby!
- Cheers!

375
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,340
Very good.

376
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,450
Start them young—

377
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,190
I’ll miss you.

378
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,370
Wait for me, okay?

379
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,790
I’m gonna marry you
when I get home.

380
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,340
Are you proposing right now?

381
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,300
Well, not yet.

382
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,850
I think we should talk about it
before I propose.

383
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,350
So…

384
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,520
do you wanna be married
to me, Yanna?

385
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,400
Depends on the ring.

386
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,320
I’ll buy you the best ring.

387
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,450
I can’t wait.

388
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,370
And because of that,
I don’t wanna leave.

389
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,120
I don’t wanna go now.

390
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,750
It won’t take that long.

391
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:18,090
Once you’re back,
you’ll see us again.

392
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,170
Okay.

393
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,880
My love?

394
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,930
Come here.

395
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,680
You want something?

396
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,980
Nothing.
Just be home safe, Daddy.

397
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,190
Yes, I will.

398
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,700
What’s this?

399
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,530
When you’re sad,
eat candy, Daddy.

400
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:53,950
Or if you see a sad kid,
give them some.

401
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:58,170
Yes I will, my love.

402
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,990
Where are you going, Daddy?

403
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,630
I’m going to Dubai.

404
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,020
Is that far?

405
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:09,770
Yes, it will take hours
before I can call you.

406
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,600
I will wait for you, Daddy.

407
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,470
You’ll wait for me?

408
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,100
Okay before anything else,

409
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:21,090
when Daddy’s away,
be a good girl. Okay?

410
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:23,280
Go already, you might be late.

411
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,730
Besides, I still have a lot
to fix in the condo.

412
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:30,200
Okay.

413
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,500
What’s with the tight hug?
Aren’t you coming back?

414
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,330
Wait for me, I’ll be back.

415
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,710
I love you.

416
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:49,000
Safe skies, my captain.

417
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,100
I love you, too.

418
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:58,730
My love,

419
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,360
I love you.

420
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,320
Okay, I have to leave now.

421
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,280
Bye, my love.

422
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,190
Take care.

423
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,300
I love you, Daddy!

424
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,220
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

425
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,160
Welcome onboard Flight 658 bound for Dubai.

426
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,650
This is First Officer
Akihiro Juarez speaking.

427
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:08,540
Our flight time today is approximately
nine hours and forty minutes.

428
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,260
And our estimated time of arrival in Dubai

429
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,290
is at around 6:15 PM local time.

430
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,920
Thank you and enjoy the flight.

431
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,980
Ashianna,

432
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,620
If only I knew that you
would disappear from me,

433
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,890
I should not have
left that night.

434
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,520
Yanna, I wrote you a letter back then.

435
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,980
But it got sent back.

436
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,480
I should have understood.

437
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,120
I should have insisted
to be with you.

438
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:21,550
There are so many 'ifs' and
'shoulds' running inside my mind

439
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:25,370
I know nothing could
make any difference.

440
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:29,740
As much as I still want to
be there for you,

441
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,200
I don't know where to find you.

442
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,380
I may not understand

443
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,200
why you chose to stop
pursuing your degree,

444
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,890
but I hope you won't stop
pursuing your dream,

445
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:45,740
because my dream is as
important as yours.

446
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,420
I admire you for a
lot of things.

447
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,500
But above all,

448
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,200
I admire you for being a strong
and dedicated woman.

449
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:01,050
I'm always proud of you, and of
what you will become.

450
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,900
So chase your dreams.

451
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,730
We will see each other again.

452
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:10,280
Until then, continue fighting.

453
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:13,720
I had a pleasant
flight with you.

454
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,450
Thank you, Ashianna.

455
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,490
Ready for departure, Akihiro.

456
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,500
You are my safe sky,
Ashianna.

457
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:25,980
I love you.

458
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,450
Wait for me.

459
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,790
Loss of cabin pressure.

460
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,530
Emergency descent.

461
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:04,180
Please remain seated and
fasten your seatbelt.

462
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,130
Alpha 01. Mayday! Mayday!

463
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,240
Request for emergency landing.

464
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:14,990
We've just received a report that
FlyAsia Flight FL 658 crash-lands

465
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:18,970
- at Dubai International Airport.
- Mommy, look. Airplane!

466
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
We are currently trying to reach—

467
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,810
Alpha 01. Mayday! Mayday!

468
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:24,450
Request for emergency landing.

469
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,590
Ladies and gentlemen, put on your mask
and fasten your seatbelt.

470
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,610
Put on your mask
and fasten your seatbelt.

471
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:26,070
You scared me.

472
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,090
Relax, I’m here.

473
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:31,620
I’m fine. Okay?

474
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:35,410
I thought we’d lose you
in our life again.

475
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:37,580
I was calling you but you
never answered.

476
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,870
Babe, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

477
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:41,370
My phone died.

478
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:44,000
I told you,
I'll come back.

479
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,590
Daddy, I thought you’ll
leave us again.

480
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:51,850
No… No, baby. No.

481
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,200
No.

482
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:03,730
Baby, you know what, Daddy
will never leave you

483
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:06,190
and Mommy ever again, okay?

484
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:11,030
That’s a promise. Okay?

485
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:19,370
And—

486
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:25,040
I bought this ring,

487
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:28,300
‘cause I can’t wait any longer.

488
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:35,350
I’m so afraid to lose you
and Avi in my life ever again.

489
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,970
So, please—

490
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,140
Marry me.

491
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,620
Yes. Let’s marry.

492
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,760
I love you, Hiro.

493
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,440
I love you, Yanna.

494
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:36,660
I love you,
Yanna Fernandez-Juarez.

495
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:59,430
I love you Mommy, Daddy.

496
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,600
- We love you.
- We love you.

497
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,580
Let’s go home?

498
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:37,130
“Because she is my safe sky. With her, I am at peace.”
- Captain Akihiro Leonel Juarez

499
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:56,810
Cheers.

500
00:50:57,650 --> 00:50:59,880
- I thought I heard, "kiss."
- It's fine. Cut!

501
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,260
Okay, finish it.
Cut! Good.

502
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,230
Here's your wine, ma'am, sir—

503
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,360
Be careful.
Okay, I'll slow down.

504
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:17,860
Cut! Good.

505
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,240
What is this?

506
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,970
What?

507
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,570
Where's the hair tie?

508
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:24,610
It's here.

509
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:26,700
Why are you scared of cuddling?

510
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:27,900
Jerk!

511
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,860
Scared or afraid?

512
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,510
Scared.

513
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:32,620
Skrt!

514
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,850
Skrt, skrt!

515
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,070
Got some bold movie?

516
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,340
It’s a dry season, you know.

517
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:37,880
No!
Cut!

518
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:43,540
I got cramps.

519
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:46,840
It's true.

520
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,730
It's true, I got cramps.

521
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,030
I wouldn’t want to intrude.

522
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:50,970
And cut!
Very good.

523
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:53,940
And cut!

524
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,700
And that is a wrap for Safe Skies, Archer!
