1
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,780
Target locked.

2
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,380
Look at that face.

3
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,550
He’s so hot.

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,379
And he seems…

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,450
experienced.

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,009
Your game is kind of weak today.

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,110
Who’s your target?

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,280
Guy with the dark blue long sleeves.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,810
That’s Hiro!

10
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,950
You’re a tourism student,
you should know him!

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,709
I won’t drink anymore.

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,210
That’s a promise, Lord. This is last time.

13
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,180
Wait a minute–

14
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,780
This isn’t Sam’s room.

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,910
You’re Hiro, right?

16
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,780
Yes.

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,050
Did we have sex?

18
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,580
No.

19
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,880
If I wasn’t drunk

20
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,610
and you weren’t drunk…

21
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,580
would there be a chance?

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,150
Of course.

23
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,510
Hiro?

24
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,550
-Bro— -Bro!

25
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,410
Who— What are...

26
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,510
Get out.

27
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,049
I’m sorry. Okay!

28
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,409
-Enjoy! -Get out!

29
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,210
All right, I’m going!
Enjoy, guys! I’m sorry!

30
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,510
What are you doing? You’re going home?

31
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,150
I don’t have to go yet if
you’ll be taking me home.

32
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,650
I can’t…

33
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:36,150
I have to earn hours tomorrow morning.

34
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,950
Earn hours?

35
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,810
I mean...

36
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:42,480
I have to earn flying
hours for my pilot training.

37
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,880
That’s too bad.

38
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,910
If I take you to heaven, would
that count for your flying hours?

39
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,710
Maybe we can do a quickie or a flash bang.

40
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,050
Bargaining now, huh.

41
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,510
Flash bang? What’s that?

42
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,080
-The bomb? -No.

43
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,350
It’s just a quickie but a quicker version.

44
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Flash bang.

45
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,810
Wow, so that’s the word of the day.

46
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,950
I’m no longer in the mood.

47
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,980
Maybe next time.

48
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,110
If... there’s a “next time.”

49
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,910
Excuse me.

50
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,979
We’ll be going home to our families.

51
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,949
You should go home, too.

52
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,949
Don’t stay cooped up in the
dormitory like an old landlord.

53
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,580
If you’re not going home,
there’s food in the fridge.

54
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,550
Are you home?

55
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,810
He wants an update? Is he my boyfriend now?

56
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,080
Unsatisfied.

57
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,710
Why? Am I not good?

58
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,609
I can’t tell since nothing happened.

59
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,280
We’ll have to do it again so I can judge.

60
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,610
I'll see you next week?

61
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,780
I'd bury myself in you.

62
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,250
You’re so fucking delicious!

63
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,749
Just kidding.

64
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,050
Have a good sleep, Ashianna Fernandez.

65
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,610
How did you know my full name?

66
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,950
Are you a stalker?

67
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,510
Fuck. I think I know now.

68
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,279
Samantha Maureen Vera.

69
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,780
Full name basis now?

70
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,510
Why, Ashianna Kim Fernandez?

71
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,750
You sold me out to Hiro, didn’t you?

72
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,849
Uh-What? Hello, Yanna?

73
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,750
I can’t hear you, the line’s breaking…

74
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,110
I know you can hear me.

75
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,379
Why do you think it’s me?

76
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,649
You’re our only mutual friend.

77
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,779
Why did you give him my full name?

78
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,110
You know I have rules.

79
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,780
Chill, girl. Settle down.

80
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
So was it really you?

81
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,410
Why did you give him my name?

82
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,280
Come on, Samantha…

83
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,580
Fine. Yes.

84
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,149
I gave your name because
he looks really interested to

85
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,050
know you.

86
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:32,179
And to be honest, I can
feel that he likes you.

87
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,700
Besides, I’m not gonna sell
you out to just some guy out there.

88
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,950
Jeez, Sam.

89
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,310
Don’t be mad.

90
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,880
I know Hiro’s your type, too.

91
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,249
How about this…

92
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,710
In exchange, I’ll give you all his socials.

93
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,110
Anyway, I need to go. I
have Saturday class tomorrow.

94
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,550
Will you be going home to Laguna?

95
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,480
I’m not sure yet.

96
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,280
Well, just take care, okay?

97
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,980
-All right now, bye! -Bye!

98
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,480
Will you be coming home tomorrow?

99
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,710
I’m not sure yet…

100
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,150
Your mama said she misses you.

101
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,849
Laguna! This is where I was
born and where I grew up and

102
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,850
blossomed!

103
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,049
Not much has changed since I was young.

104
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,209
Everything still looks the same.

105
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:55,549
Unlike the other towns
that blossomed, just like me.

106
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:00,310
But still, I need to learn to
find the beauty in this place.

107
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,509
I never lose hope that
my beloved Laguna will also

108
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,880
improved.

109
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,850
This is a significant part of my identity.

110
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,880
Even if…

111
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,350
My experiences here aren’t perfect.

112
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,940
Kuya, you can drop me off
in front of that white gate.

113
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,750
- Thank you so— - Thanks, sexy!

114
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,980
Next time, lose the jacket.

115
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,979
Catcalling really has nothing
to do with what a person is

116
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,780
wearing.

117
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,179
Kuya, your mother would be ashamed of you.

118
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,179
Even if you’re very
well-covered no matter the gender...

119
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,349
Perverted jerk!

120
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,849
If they want to be disrespectful,

121
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,479
they will be.

122
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,549
What would happen to those who
are just quiet and can’t fight

123
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,880
back?

124
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,080
I hope all perverts worldwide
would just get hit by lightning!

125
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:55,680
Yanna…

126
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,549
- Yanna! - Aunty!

127
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,179
I’m glad you were able to come home.

128
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,049
You haven’t been home for three weeks.

129
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,109
I was starting to feel really sad.

130
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,580
Oh Aunty, how can I come home,
if there’s no one here anyway?

131
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,750
So, what am I? A pig?

132
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,549
But I came home for you Aunty,

133
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,510
since you texted me and
because I really miss you.

134
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,580
I miss you too. Have you eaten already?

135
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,980
Not yet.

136
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,209
Perfect. I’ve prepared some food.

137
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,780
- Okay then. - Go and eat.

138
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,910
Aunty, whose car is that?

139
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,379
Okay.

140
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,250
Forward and then back.

141
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,980
Right here.

142
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,649
And then forward.

143
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,210
See. You can do it.

144
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,010
And then, turn. Easy as that.

145
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,280
So good to see you home.

146
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,250
This is Joker, by the way. My boyfriend.

147
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,979
This is Ashianna, my daughter.

148
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,749
Of course, I know her.

149
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,950
You’re gorgeous.

150
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,750
Good-looking.

151
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,280
Like me!

152
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,950
Shit! He really is a joker.

153
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,710
Hi!

154
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,310
Let’s eat together later since
we’ll be going out in a bit.

155
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,280
You’re leaving?

156
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,480
I just got back.

157
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,009
No, it’s just that...

158
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,580
I promised Joker that I’ll
give him a tour of Laguna.

159
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,550
All right.

160
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,210
I’m tired from the trip.

161
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,180
I’ll just go and rest. You guys take care.

162
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,880
Okay, I’ll make you some food later, okay?

163
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,480
Since I was young, Mama
wasn’t always at home.

164
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,510
She was either busy with
work or her love life.

165
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,079
It seems like she has
a different boyfriend,

166
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,149
everytime she comes home.

167
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:04,180
It's not really an issue for
me because I do want to see her

168
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,010
happy.

169
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,480
But I hope she doesn't forget
that she has a child, right?

170
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,279
Are you free today or tomorrow?

171
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,180
I’m free but I’m not in
Manila. So, I'm not available.

172
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,180
When can we meet?

173
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,550
Are you that excited to see my beauty?

174
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,680
Let’s continue when I get back on Monday.

175
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,180
Not only is he a big bird,
but he really is some big shot!

176
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,210
His friends are all famous and rich.

177
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,650
Wow. An influencer!

178
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,356
He doesn’t just look like a
playboy, he also looks like a

179
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,480
fuckboy.

180
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,950
I’m okay with Monday. I’ll
treat you to a proper meal.

181
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,686
Let’s just stay in your condo
so we don’t have to spend much.

182
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,550
You might start eating
something else, though.

183
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,210
You don’t want me to?

184
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,180
Eat all you can.

185
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:03,050
Go! No sharing! No leftovers!
Nothing goes to waste!

186
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,380
But let’s eat first. I
know a good steak house.

187
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,879
- Wow! - Good morning, my dear!

188
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,450
Breakfast is ready!

189
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,750
Tell me if there’s anything else you want.

190
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,610
I’ll cook it for you.
What else do you want?

191
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:29,310
What else is there? Everything is right
here. Your cooking is the best, Aunty!

192
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,610
Thank you.

193
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,549
You’re very welcome, dear.
I’ll do anything for you!

194
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,209
Let’s eat.

195
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,510
Come on.

196
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,379
I am starving.

197
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,150
Is Mama, awake now?

198
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,380
She didn’t come home.

199
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,650
Maybe she slept at Joker’s place.

200
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,680
You know how it is. Surely,
she’s too tired from work.

201
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,810
That’s why she just stayed with him.

202
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,580
But, maybe, she’s on her way home now.

203
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:08,980
We might not see each other. I’d be
back in Manila by the time she comes home.

204
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,679
Come on…

205
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,679
Look at you, sulking…

206
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,110
You don’t have to sulk now.

207
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,710
You know why?

208
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,480
Because she has something for you.

209
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,210
You’ll like it.

210
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,250
Well?

211
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,080
I’m happier with this food.

212
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,750
- Really? - Delicious!

213
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,110
I’m on a diet, so...

214
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,850
I won’t have too much rice.

215
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,210
This is expensive.

216
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,710
Maybe around fifteen thousand.

217
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,179
Fifteen thousand?

218
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,880
That is so expensive! It’s roughly a
quarter of my tuition fee per semester.

219
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,009
Shit, that’s worth fifteen thousand?

220
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,409
Where did that come from?

221
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,310
Mama gave it. I’m sure it’s
actually from her boyfriend.

222
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,326
I didn’t realize that
it’s worth fifteen thousand.

223
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,279
Maybe I can just sell it?

224
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,010
I’ll get an additional allowance
and budget for more alcohol.

225
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,710
Or maybe you can just give it to me?

226
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,580
That might get the attention of my crush.

227
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,910
But you’re not here.
Just come here already.

228
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,150
Where are you anyway? You
did say you were coming.

229
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,280
We suddenly had a tune-up game. Sorry
guys, I’ll make it up to you. I promise!

230
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,680
Yes, coach!

231
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,980
All right, they’re calling me.

232
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,749
- Yeah, whatever! - I’ll call again later.

233
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,179
- Bye! - Bye!

234
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,580
Whatever, loser!

235
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,510
I think I’m falling for you!

236
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,850
Jeez… You keep flirting...

237
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,880
Is that Kalix?

238
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:44,650
Yes, girl.

239
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,210
I’m seriously marrying this guy.

240
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,780
I’m in too deep.

241
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,979
You’re falling so hard but he
might not be there to catch you.

242
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,479
I just know what’s gonna happen.

243
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,510
Come on, don’t be so negative.

244
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,450
- It’s just how it is. - True!

245
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,210
#LuKal, incoming!

246
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,580
#LuKal?

247
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,580
Luna and Kalix!

248
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,180
You guys have a hashtag now?

249
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,379
What are you getting with
all that love business anyway?

250
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,950
You can get the same benefits
even without a commitment, right?

251
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,049
You know nothing.

252
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,250
You’ll understand when
love comes knocking at you.

253
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,079
I once read that…

254
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,710
“Love comes when you least expect it.”

255
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,380
Which website did you find that?

256
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,410
Fuck all those quotes!

257
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,310
Seriously!

258
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,110
Hiro: Done with my
classes. I'll pick you up?

259
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,750
Yanna: Wait, is this a
date? I’ll pass if it is.

260
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,910
Hiro: No. Afternoon delight.

261
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,410
Yanna: Let’s meet at the resto.

262
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:08,210
Smiling from ear-to-ear, Yanna?

263
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,509
That’s the smile of someone in love.

264
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,510
This?

265
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,150
This is a happy pv$$y,
happy life kind of smile!

266
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:19,980
Goodbye!

267
00:17:19,981 --> 00:17:21,149
I’m going ahead, bye!

268
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,449
Hey, smile!

269
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,110
- Smile! - Bye!

270
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,680
She’s in denial.

271
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,710
There you are. Hi!

272
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,010
Hi!

273
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
Sit here.

274
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:13,950
Okay.

275
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,950
How’s your day?

276
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
It’s good.

277
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,080
This place is fancy. I
won’t have enough to pay.

278
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,050
I’ll cover your parking fee.

279
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,550
Is twenty enough?

280
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,910
Don’t worry about that.

281
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,280
This is my treat.

282
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,510
Okay.

283
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,050
You’re a rich kid anyway.

284
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,150
Not me. My parents.

285
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,110
Wine, sir?

286
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,150
You have a lot of famous
celebrity friends, huh?

287
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,450
How’d you know?

288
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,910
You stalked me?

289
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,410
Hey!

290
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,810
Don’t be too full of yourself.

291
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,310
I just saw it because I
was following some of them.

292
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,080
Okay.

293
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,910
Yes, so they’re my friends.

294
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,080
Friends or flings?

295
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:21,680
Some of them are my ex-flings.

296
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,980
But I don’t have one right now.

297
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,480
Really?

298
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,680
You don’t have to hide it.
We’re not in a relationship anyway.

299
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,180
I’m single. Why’d you ask?

300
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,150
You jealous?

301
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,950
Of course not, you bastard!

302
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,680
Okay. If you say so.

303
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,610
Let’s order...

304
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,510
Because I’m starving.

305
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,110
Thank you!

306
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,280
What do you want?

307
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,310
That’s for later.

308
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,980
Okay.

309
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,650
Yes, ma’am?

310
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,280
We’ll order…

311
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,510
One spiced seafood salad.

312
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,850
One shrimp diablo.

313
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,149
What do you want? You want pasta?

314
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,309
One aglio e olio and…

315
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,350
two ribeye.

316
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,950
How do you like your steak, sir?

317
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,980
Medium-well.
Okay.

318
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,580
How about you, ma’am?
How do you like your steak?

319
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:41,850
Wet…

320
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,050
Uh! I mean…

321
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,980
Well-done.

322
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,480
Thank you.

323
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:05,150
Ma’am, sir, enjoy your meal.

324
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,480
I will.

325
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,180
Hey…

326
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,809
Here you go.

327
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,179
I can manage!

328
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,610
No, it’s fine.

329
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,780
Thanks.

330
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,180
Don’t do that again.

331
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,549
It’s too sweet.

332
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,550
So disgusting!

333
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,380
So, how was it?

334
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,410
It was good.

335
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,750
I meant the food.

336
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:40,910
It’s good, too.

337
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,780
Okay. Are you free this Friday?

338
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,880
Why? What’s up?

339
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,880
Shan reserved a place for his
birthday and I’ll bring you with me.

340
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,180
Shan always has parties, huh?

341
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,750
Don’t you have anyone else
to bring? A fling or something…

342
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,750
I told you, I don’t have flings.

343
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,880
FUBU?

344
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,050
"FUBU" like, fuck buddy?

345
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,710
I don’t.

346
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,550
What’s the difference?

347
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:29,909
You go and hang out with a fling.

348
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,280
For fuck buddies, you
meet just to have sex.

349
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:36,850
I see.

350
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,780
Have you experienced having a fuck buddy?

351
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,280
No, why’d you ask?

352
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,080
Wanna try it out?

353
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,710
What do you mean?

354
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,210
Do you want to try having one?

355
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,580
You want me to be your fuck buddy?

356
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,080
It depends.

357
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,510
Depends on what?

358
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,580
Depends on your performance, of course.

359
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,380
Like a job interview?

360
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,180
Something like that.

361
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,580
You think you’ll pass?

362
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:31,280
I’m a good performer and a good giver.

363
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,450
I always put on a good show.

364
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,910
Wow!

365
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,050
All right then.

366
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,680
We’ll see.

367
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,680
I’ll be the judge.

368
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,980
Okay.

369
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,710
Judge me with whatever rubric you have.

370
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,480
And I’ll pass it with flying colors.

371
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,280
Looks like I’m challenging the wrong guy.

372
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:02,450
He might throw me in bed. Not
that I’ll complain, though.

373
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,010
Maybe you’re just all talk.

374
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:10,410
We’ll see during the practical exam.

375
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,410
We’ll see.

376
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,410
Why don’t we do it tonight?

377
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,480
I’m ready to fight.

378
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,880
I can’t tonight. I have to study.

379
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,780
Mr. Big Bird here really
knows how to tease me.

380
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,850
But on Friday, I’m down.

381
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,810
That’s why I’m asking if you’re free.

382
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,780
Okay.

383
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,950
But I’m not gonna be your date.

384
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,510
And I won’t be your plus one.

385
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,380
Yes. See me as your applicant.

386
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,349
Sam, are my clothes okay?

387
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,279
Yes! You look great, as usual!

388
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,679
Why are you asking?

389
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,850
Nothing.

390
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,250
Don’t tell me you want
to be pretty on another

391
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,750
level because you and Hiro
are on another level now?

392
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,580
Hey!

393
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:24,110
I’m only dressing up for myself.
I’m not dressing up for guys.

394
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,310
Okay, if you say so.

395
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,480
Oh my gosh!

396
00:26:28,481 --> 00:26:29,809
Erica, you’re here!

397
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:30,880
- Hi! - Hi!

398
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:31,780
How are you?

399
00:26:31,781 --> 00:26:33,909
I’m good. Join us.

400
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,610
I’ll go with her, okay?

401
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,550
I’m glad you came!

402
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,210
You look gorgeous.

403
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,580
Bastard!

404
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,580
So, what kind of sex do you like?

405
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,550
I want it wild…

406
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,080
spontaneous…

407
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,550
and rough.

408
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,150
Bro!

409
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
Yanna, right?

410
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,309
You’re the girl who was drunk
and also the one in bed with my bro...

411
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,380
Shan!

412
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,950
Enough.

413
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,580
Enough.

414
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,509
Happy birthday, Shan.

415
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,510
Thank you, Yanna.

416
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:52,680
Well, enjoy the party.

417
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,680
I’ll leave her to you, Hiro.

418
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,810
Drinks? I’ll see you around.

419
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,950
Enjoy, guys!

420
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,410
Happy birthday!

421
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,750
All right!

422
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,210
Chug! Chug! Chug!

423
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,580
Let’s go!

424
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,549
Bro, it’s my birthday!

425
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:26,010
Chug! Chug! Chug!

426
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,780
Bend over.

427
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,250
So how’s my performance?

428
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,009
The grand winner! He
made an effort! Awesome

429
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:25,180
performance level! He also has good timing.

430
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,480
It was okay.

431
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,080
What does that even mean?

432
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,710
You said you were going
to put on a good show…

433
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,679
Did I not put on a good show?

434
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,150
It was a great show! For
primetime! People would buy tickets!

435
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,110
It’s okay.

436
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:45,910
All right.

437
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,880
I’m down. You?

438
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,910
What? You don’t want to?

439
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,110
Yanna…

440
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,580
Will you be my fuck buddy?

441
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,550
What is that? Fuck!

442
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,010
Don’t do that, that’s disgusting!

443
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,709
You know what, nevermind.
I don’t want to anymore.

444
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,509
No! I’m just kidding.

445
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,050
Okay, I’m down with this.

446
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,480
But guide me.

447
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,480
I don’t know how this works.

448
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,450
It’s my first time doing this.

449
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,080
Okay.

450
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:28,650
But before we start, we need to be
clear about the oaths of the strong-willed.

451
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,880
Huh?

452
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,480
Having a fuck buddy is not for the weak.

453
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:37,450
There are dos and don’ts
that we need to follow and

454
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,350
we need to promise that
we will commit to our oaths.

455
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:47,410
First, we will meet just for sex.

456
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,379
There’s no strings attached,
so no feelings are involved.

457
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,310
In short...

458
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:54,549
TITIL.

459
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,650
TITIL?

460
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,680
Taste test.

461
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,379
But are you sure you won’t
develop feelings for me?

462
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,250
Of course not.

463
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:09,750
That will never happen. Even
if you swear on your dick.

464
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:22,780
Second, we won’t go on dates.

465
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:24,249
No dating relationship here.

466
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:28,780
No gifts, flowers, dinner
dates, not even a sweet greeting.

467
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:30,880
Wow!

468
00:34:30,881 --> 00:34:32,350
Three hundred calories.

469
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,650
Let’s eat?

470
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,810
But at least...

471
00:34:37,811 --> 00:34:39,480
Let me buy you a meal?

472
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,380
Excellent service.

473
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,980
Clean and yummy.

474
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,880
Five stars.

475
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,610
Same here.

476
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,980
Huh?

477
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,579
Same rating with the food.

478
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,650
Five stars.

479
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:02,549
Third, while we’re fuck buddies,
we won’t enter any relationships.

480
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,210
Okay?

481
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:06,880
We’re not cheaters and
we will never be cheaters.

482
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,380
So…

483
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,410
we can’t have sex with other people?

484
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,879
Do you want to?

485
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,210
I didn’t win loyalty awards during
grade school and high school for nothing.

486
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,980
So…

487
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,680
So let’s be exclusive FUBUs.

488
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:39,580
Fourth, don’t ever introduce
me as your girlfriend.

489
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:42,950
As I said earlier, we’re not dating.

490
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,680
We’re fuck buddies.

491
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,280
Buddies that fuck.

492
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,579
Write your partner a little poem.

493
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,349
Could be funny, romantic or cute and go.

494
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:53,780
Nah...

495
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,050
You will tell me it’s...

496
00:35:55,051 --> 00:35:56,250
-Disgusting. -Disgusting.

497
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,550
Okay.

498
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:03,610
Turn your partner on by removing
only one piece of clothing.

499
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,480
Easy.

500
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,650
Boring.

501
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,250
Your turn.

502
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,750
Okay.

503
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,880
Slowly kiss your partner’s
body for ten seconds.

504
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,450
Forget these cards.

505
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,280
So many rules.

506
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:34,849
Let’s just quit this if you don’t like these
rules. I don’t want to waste my time...

507
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:35,850
No!

508
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,350
Let’s do this.

509
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,350
I’m down with this fuck buddy thing.

510
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,280
Deal?

511
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,450
Deal.

512
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,580
Why is there a pillow?

513
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,610
Fifth Oath.

514
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,710
We will not cuddle after sex.

515
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,510
I know I got you tired after all
that but you don’t get to rest on me.

516
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,010
I hate cuddles.

517
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,880
Okay…

518
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,850
I wasn’t even thinking of that.

519
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,580
Good. Sleep now.

520
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,180
- Good n— - Oops!

521
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,150
You can’t say that.

522
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,410
Good night to me.

523
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,610
Good night to me.

524
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,250
Are you still awake?

525
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,510
Why?

526
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,180
Can I ask you a question?

527
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,080
What?

528
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,910
Why don’t you do boyfriends?

529
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:37,980
I just don’t want to.

530
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
You?

531
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,210
Why don’t you have a girlfriend?

532
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,810
I won’t stay here for long.

533
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,110
Huh? What do you mean

534
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,880
I’ll be leaving after graduation.

535
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,950
Where are you going?

536
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,150
In the U.S.

537
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,310
Gonna reach my dreams in Florida.

538
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,650
Why in Florida?

539
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:11,050
My dream flying school is there.

540
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,480
I’ll try to get a pilot
license there in the U.S.,

541
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,210
then I’ll work there
and stay there for good.

542
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,310
Why does it have to be there?

543
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,410
Don’t you guys have your own airlin

544
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,050
Nah.

545
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,450
I don’t want to be a nepo baby.

546
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,150
I want to do it on my own.

547
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,650
How about you?

548
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,410
Why do you want to be a flight attendant

549
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:50,050
I’ve always dreamed of going to
different countries since I was young.

550
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:51,950
Besides…

551
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,626
I don’t want to put my
beauty to waste if I’ll

552
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,290
just stay here in the Philippines, right?

553
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,410
This deserves international recognition.

554
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,250
What’s your dream airline?

555
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,580
FlyAsia.

556
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,680
Good choice.

557
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:15,950
I don’t think they’ll accept me, though.

558
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,880
I’m sure they will.

559
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,350
If you want me to pull
some strings just tell me.

560
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,580
Don’t.

561
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:26,410
Besides, we wouldn’t be
talking anymore by then.

562
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,410
We might have forgotten
each other by then too.

563
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:34,610
I don't think I will forget
my first ever fuck buddy.

564
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:42,250
Whether you like it or not,
we’ll forget each other eventually.

565
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,980
I think I’ve forgotten
all of my past fuck buddies.

566
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:53,710
They all fell for my beauty that’s
why we had to stop being fuck buddies.

567
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,610
But I’m glad that there’s
an expiration date with Hiro.

568
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:02,010
We both know that this will end
eventually without anyone getting hurt.

569
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,350
Where are your plates for...

570
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:31,010
What happened to you?

571
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:35,080
Slept on the wrong side.
My legs got squished.

572
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:39,650
Where is Luna?

573
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,350
She might be flirting with Kalix.

574
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,810
Honestly, I feel bad for Sevi.

575
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,650
He always sees those two at school.

576
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:51,109
Why doesn’t he just go for it?
It’s obvious that he likes Luna.

577
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:54,380
Well, Luna’s pretty dense about it.
She can’t tell he has feelings for her.

578
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,550
That’s true.

579
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,620
I’ll help look for a girl for him,
that way he has his own cheerleader.

580
00:41:58,950 --> 00:41:59,710
Right?

581
00:41:59,711 --> 00:42:01,380
Hey, what about you?

582
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,110
Don’t you have a boyfriend yet?

583
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,510
No one? Really?

584
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,980
Me? Have a boyfriend?

585
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:10,910
As if!

586
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:14,009
Happy pv$$y, happy life!

587
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,209
Jeez…

588
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:19,110
With all that talk, we won’t be surprised
if you’ll be the first to have a baby.

589
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,880
Huh?

590
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,679
Excuse me…

591
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,510
With Luna’s flirting, I’m sure
she’ll be the first one to get pregnant.

592
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,279
Just give us a godchild already, Yanna.

593
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,280
Can you do it within the year?

594
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,080
Knock on wood.

595
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:36,650
Where’s the wood?

596
00:42:36,651 --> 00:42:39,110
Wait, I have something
to buy in the bookstore.

597
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:40,980
Come with me, Ke.

598
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:41,880
Sure!

599
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,350
Wait for us.

600
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,950
I’ll just bring this.

601
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:50,580
Sam, you have an ObGyne doctor, right?

602
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,010
Can I get their contact number?

603
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:56,049
Huh? Don’t tell me...

604
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:57,980
Bitch! Of course not!

605
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:01,810
I just wanted to be ready.
What Via said got me thinking.

606
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,450
It’s a good thing you think about that.

607
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,250
Okay then, I’ll refer
you to our family’s OB.

608
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,980
She’s the best here in Manila.

609
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,180
Thank you!

610
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,010
OBGYNE: Okay. You can go here
in my clinic on Thursday for

611
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:22,080
your consultation. I can give
you a prescription by then.

612
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,510
Yanna: Thanks, Doc.

613
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:41,450
Are you okay?

614
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,380
Of course.

615
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:45,980
Who are you texting?

616
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:50,450
No one… Just the online delivery guy.

617
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:53,950
Okay.

618
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,380
What are you doing?

619
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,650
I'm writing you a review plan.

620
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:02,250
You look so stressed.

621
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:07,180
You just need to focus on your reaction
paper and submit it within the next hour.

622
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,349
No need! You’ll just
stress yourself out, too.

623
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:11,710
It’s all good.

624
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,850
Finish that and...

625
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,180
You get your reward.

626
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:22,550
A fuck buddy that’s concerned
with my grades? What a catch.

627
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:40,450
Submitted!

628
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:43,910
All done.

629
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:48,910
Okay.

630
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:53,480
So, you wanna claim your reward?

631
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:05,180
So that’s the flash bang. Took
only seven minutes but it was a blast!

632
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,780
That was hot.

633
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,580
Hiro?

634
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:21,950
Who is she?

635
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,710
She’s my girlfriend.

636
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:04,250
Hiro: Pack an overnight bag.

637
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,080
So, where will you both stay overnight

638
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:08,810
Well?

639
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,350
Is he super hot?

640
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:13,950
We’re just short-time fuck buddies.

641
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,300
There’s no need for you guys to meet him
since he’ll be out of my life soon enough.

642
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,150
Wear this for later.

643
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,279
Why are you so scared of cuddling?

644
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,680
Are you scared that you
might fall for me if we cuddle?

645
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:38,680
Hey, Elyse?

646
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,980
I have to pick up someone.

647
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:47,780
Hiro!
