1
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:10,940
Yanna?

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,860
Oh, Ericka!

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,780
Mommy, can you open this?

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,240
Come on, Avi. Let me open it.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,450
Your mom’s talking to someone.

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,580
This is alcohol poisoning. Stop acting like kids!

7
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,880
Your wife’s mad at you.

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,040
Wife? What the hell!

9
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,840
He’s not your husband?

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,090
No. I’m not married.

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,640
That’s Princess Ola.

12
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,890
Her favorite doll, right?

13
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,000
That’s Princess Ola.

14
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,200
Her favorite doll, right?

15
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,710
Huh? Her favorite doll?

16
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,560
You know Avi?

17
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,570
You know your child?

18
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,080
Who?

19
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,340
The one you gave the doll to.

20
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,960
Her favorite is Princess Ola.

21
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,160
Right?

22
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Yes. She’s her favorite.

23
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,370
Because she likes snow.

24
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,020
She must be really cute.

25
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,250
We’re almost there. Just ten minutes away.

26
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,330
Caleb and Kyla are on their way.

27
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,910
I don’t mind. That’s fine.

28
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,090
Anyway, next week is my birthday.

29
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,170
I’m having a party. Hope you can come.

30
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,470
Wow, sounds like a fancy party.

31
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,010
I’ll send you the details of the invite.

32
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,770
There.

33
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,440
I’ll have to check my schedule first.

34
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,320
I hope you can come.

35
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,030
Because…

36
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,390
if not…

37
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,630
I’ll feel bad.

38
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,340
Ladies and gentlemen, Good afternoon.

39
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,060
Welcome onboard FL514 bound for Manila.

40
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,770
This is your captain, Captain Akihiro Juarez,

41
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,720
and our flight time today will be approximately

42
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,770
4 hours and 30 minutes. Our estimated time of arrival

43
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,990
in Manila is 9:10 PM local time.

44
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,150
The temperature at our destination

45
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,240
is 31 degrees celsius.

46
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240
Thank you and enjoy the flight.

47
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,600
Is Avi asleep?

48
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,140
Yes, she went to bed at 9 PM.

49
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,140
We went to the playground earlier so she’s really tired.

50
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,400
That’s okay. I’m tired, too.

51
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,690
Can I sleep here tonight?

52
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,940
Of course, the guest bedroom is always ready for you.

53
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,740
Thank you.

54
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,330
I have something to tell you.

55
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,870
Oh, right. How was your flight?

56
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,750
Was Hiro the pilot?

57
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,160
Yes.

58
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,040
He’s been really nice to me

59
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,380
right after your birthday party.

60
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,010
We talk a lot more often now.

61
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,220
He also finalized the deed of sale for the car.

62
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,400
And he even invited me to his birthday party.

63
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,220
That’s good. Is there a problem?

64
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,020
Not really. I'm just glad

65
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,400
that we're becoming close to each other again.

66
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,940
I never expected us

67
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,780
to be on speaking terms after all that happened in the past.

68
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,200
Although…

69
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,480
I do feel guilty.

70
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,000
We’re friends again—

71
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,460
but I still haven’t told him about Avi.

72
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,590
It’s just gonna get worse the more I prolong this.

73
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,260
It’s really a difficult situation to be in Yanna.

74
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,260
But you know how to end this cycle of guilt, right?

75
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,640
Tell Hiro once and for all.

76
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,850
Nevermind if he’s with Giselle, nevermind

77
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,100
if he never wants to speak to you again.

78
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,150
What’s important

79
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,480
is that you’ve told him about Avi.

80
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,530
You owe that to Avi,

81
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,110
to Hiro and to your peace of mind.

82
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,450
You’re right.

83
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,580
That’s exactly what Luna told me, too.

84
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,660
I’m sorry. I’m sure you’re sick of hearing my repetitive rants.

85
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,290
Don’t be silly, you’re just in a dilemma.

86
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,130
Remember Luna after breaking up with Kalix?

87
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,970
That was one year of repetitive rants from her.

88
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,300
Oh my god!

89
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,050
Why don’t you tell Hiro during his birthday party?

90
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,850
Make it dramatic. Tell it to him like this—

91
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,730
Hiro, my gift for you is…

92
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,230
A child! Happy birthday!

93
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,820
- Right? - This bitch!

94
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,280
You’re so pretty but you’re also full of bull.

95
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,700
At least I’m pretty.

96
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,700
We have a flight to Tokyo again

97
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,530
the week after next.

98
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,910
I’m bringing Avi.

99
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,460
That would be the last time for us to bond

100
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,500
with just the two of us, before everything changes.

101
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,700
After that, I’ll tell Hiro everything.

102
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,640
All right.

103
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,140
What do you want to watch?

104
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,220
Any channels you like?

105
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,810
Got some porn? It’s a dry season, you know.

106
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,810
No!

107
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,780
I’ll make mommy look like Princess Ola.

108
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,160
I think I’m prettier than Princess Ola.

109
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,520
I don’t think so.

110
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,570
Hey!

111
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,040
That’s why you’re my favorite godchild, Avi.

112
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,160
You’re so honest!

113
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,000
You’ve been teaching her a lot of nonsense, haven’t you?

114
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,250
Excuse me, all the good things she learned,

115
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,130
she learned it from me!

116
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,300
Right, baby?

117
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,880
I’ll get more clips, mommy!

118
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,220
Okay, baby.

119
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,640
By the way, I’m also invited to Hiro’s birthday party.

120
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,060
Accept the invite so we can go together.

121
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,140
I’m still thinking about it. I don’t know where

122
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,850
I can leave Avi then.

123
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,090
You can get your car now.

124
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,330
Sorry, I’m not home. I’m at Sam’s place.

125
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,120
Where can I pick it up?

126
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,350
I can bring it there.

127
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,260
Oh no!

128
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,170
Oh no, Hiro’s coming here.

129
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,140
He’s bringing the car here. Does he know your address?

130
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,890
He might see Avi.

131
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,640
Tell him to just meet you somewhere.

132
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,190
What about Avi?

133
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,690
I’m not doing anything ‘til later.

134
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,020
I can still look out for her until three.

135
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,400
Really? Okay, thank you!

136
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,700
You’re not just pretty, you’re so nice too.

137
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,660
Hey! You’re so sweet all of a sudden. I love it.

138
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,370
All right then.

139
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,410
Message Hiro before he makes a surprise appearance.

140
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,790
Okay, okay.

141
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,120
Bye! Bye, Avi!

142
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,290
Sorry, were you waiting long?

143
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,260
You look cute.

144
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,940
Oh!

145
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,820
Why are you taking it off? It looks good on you.

146
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,150
Shut up.

147
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,200
So here’s your car. I had it washed today.

148
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,570
Wow! It looks new.

149
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,410
Is this really a second-hand car?

150
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,120
- Yes! - Thank you!

151
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,250
You get a five-star rating from me.

152
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,410
You know what,

153
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,210
Caleb learned that I sold you this car at a discounted price.

154
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,750
- Really? - He wanted to outbuy you.

155
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,460
How much?

156
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,470
650k.

157
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Wow! We almost had a bidding war.

158
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,150
I told him it’s too low.

159
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,600
I only gave you a special rate because

160
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,180
we go way back.

161
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:12,520
This is nice. It's like we have no problems to deal with.

162
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,400
Excuse me.

163
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,660
These might be the last moments that we’re okay with each other.

164
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
Yes?

165
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,200
I’m busy. I can’t pick you up.

166
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,870
Could that be Giselle?

167
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,870
I’m not at work. I’m with my—

168
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,340
I’m with my colleague.

169
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,000
So it's really Giselle.

170
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,550
Okay. Bye.

171
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,140
So…

172
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,510
Here’s your key.

173
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,680
Thank you very much.

174
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,850
Are you excited to drive it?

175
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,230
Of course. I can’t wait.

176
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,860
But first, I’ll show you the controls, okay?

177
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,400
- Okay. - So…

178
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,320
This car is pretty easy to understand

179
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,070
and I’m pretty sure,

180
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,160
you’ll get used to it easily.

181
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:11,000
If you need help, just in case,

182
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,660
don’t hesitate to message me.

183
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,880
Awesome. Thank you.

184
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,920
I’m so excited to start driving this.

185
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,710
By the way,

186
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,220
you’re coming to my party, right?

187
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,640
I’m not sure. I still don't know what to wear.

188
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,180
Don’t worry about that, you can wear anything you want.

189
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,430
What if I arrive naked?

190
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,310
It’s a formal occasion, you know.

191
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,760
Foul joke.

192
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,280
But, uhm—

193
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,120
I’ll just rent a gown I guess, since Sam invited me too.

194
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
Thanks.

195
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,000
So how are you going back? I can drive you home.

196
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,290
No. Thanks for the offer but

197
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,380
I have to run some errands.

198
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,340
- Maybe next time. - That sucks!

199
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,380
You won’t get to see my driving skills.

200
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,840
I'm pretty sure you drive like a pro.

201
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,640
Do you have a flight tomorrow?

202
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,600
Yes, Singapore.

203
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,910
Safe skies.

204
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,630
Oh…

205
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,210
Wear it with your dress.

206
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,340
And this one…

207
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,930
Give it to her. A special gift.

208
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,560
See you!

209
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,050
So glad that the necklace looks good with this dress.

210
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,700
But why did Hiro give me this?

211
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,640
And the hair clip for Avi…

212
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,550
Did he find out about Avi?

213
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,270
Where are you going, Mommy?

214
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,440
Mommy, I want to go with you.

215
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,740
I want to wear a pretty dress too.

216
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,570
Sorry, baby. You can’t come

217
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,410
because the party is for grown-ups only.

218
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,290
Next time, I promise to bring you with me.

219
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,500
Pinky swear?

220
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,380
Pinky swear.

221
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,180
For the meantime…

222
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,310
wear this.

223
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,980
I’ll help you, okay?

224
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,520
Nice!

225
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,110
The color looks pretty.

226
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,320
Pretty!

227
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,370
Wow! Mommy, it looks pretty!

228
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,460
That’s a gift from your daddy.

229
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,000
Really, Mommy?

230
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,670
Does Daddy want to see me?

231
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,630
Does he not hate me?

232
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,470
Baby…

233
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,560
Of course he doesn’t hate you. He even gave you a gift, see?

234
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,100
But why doesn’t he want to see me?

235
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,770
I promise you, baby…

236
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,610
You’ll meet your daddy soon.

237
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,820
You know how to count 1 to 10, right?

238
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,950
In ten days, you’ll meet your daddy.

239
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,370
Really, Mommy?

240
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,750
Yes!

241
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,460
You look so pretty! Look!

242
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,550
Your daddy did a good job.

243
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,690
Look! Hi! How are you guys doing?

244
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,530
Looks good! Maybe we can serve this over there.

245
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,040
Sam, I don’t belong here.

246
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,500
Maybe I should forget about giving this gift.

247
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,880
Chill, we're here to celebrate Hiro.

248
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,930
So don’t be self-conscious and just have fun. Okay?

249
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,720
Miss Samantha Vera? Wow! Looking good!

250
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,640
- Thank you! - Miss Samantha, look here please.

251
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
Model?

252
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,700
No. Excuse us, please.

253
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,570
You’re really famous.

254
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,280
- Samantha! - Giselle!

255
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,950
Yanna…

256
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,840
Yanna, you look amazing.

257
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,380
See, you have very good taste.

258
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,760
- Thank you. - Let’s take a selfie.

259
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,010
- Sure! - We’re twinning.

260
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,260
By the way, have you guys eaten already?

261
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,890
The food is just about to be served.

262
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,970
- I’ll come back. - Thank you!

263
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,440
She’s busy with Hiro’s birthday? Such a girlfriend.

264
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,570
You might feel uncomfortable seeing Giselle and Hiro together.

265
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,780
Why? It’s his birthday so, of course,

266
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,570
his girlfriend’s gonna be here.

267
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,610
Duh.

268
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,700
Okay, let’s just enjoy the night.

269
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,490
Let’s go.

270
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,690
Are you looking for him?

271
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,690
Don’t worry, he’ll show up soon.

272
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,530
I’m not looking for him.

273
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,780
I’ll say hi to Kalix.

274
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,490
What’s he doing here?

275
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,330
Of course, Hiro invited him.

276
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,620
I’ll be right back.

277
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,250
Hey!

278
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,260
- How are you? - I’m good, you?

279
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,430
Yo, Shan!

280
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,550
Hiro!

281
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,410
Hey man! Thank you.

282
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,690
Thank you for coming!
Where’s the boys?

283
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,890
Hey!

284
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,780
Bro, wine for tonight?

285
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,070
- Take it easy. - Yes!

286
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,700
Captain! Cheers!

287
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,280
Ladies.

288
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,990
Thank you for coming!

289
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,450
Thank you.

290
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,970
Hi! Thank you for coming.

291
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,510
Long time no see.

292
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,400
Get a drink.

293
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,600
- Happy birthday! - Thank you.

294
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,410
Kalix, thank you for coming.

295
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,800
See you later.

296
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,570
Hey! Thank you for coming.

297
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,990
Cheers!

298
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,160
Thank you, thank you.

299
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,530
Hi!

300
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,620
Why are you alone?

301
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,040
Hi!

302
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,500
I’m with Sam.

303
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,880
She went to greet someone.

304
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,710
By the way, happy birthday. I have a gift for you

305
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,720
but I don’t know where to put it.

306
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,800
There’s a table for that, but you can give your gift

307
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,140
directly to me.

308
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,760
Like, right now?

309
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,690
Later.

310
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,570
What was that? Why was he whispering like that?

311
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,190
Is he already drunk?

312
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,750
Oh, Giselle!

313
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,770
Hi.

314
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:25,880
This is so awkward! I wanna go home.

315
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,100
Why are you here?

316
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
Why?

317
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,480
Entertain your guests.

318
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,150
You’re my guest, too.

319
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,150
I’m okay. You don’t need to entertain me.

320
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:47,240
Besides, I’ll meet up with Kyla and the others in a bit.

321
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,120
I’m just reserving my social energy.

322
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Okay.

323
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,880
- Hi. - I told you she’d come.

324
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,710
- Hi Kuya. - Hi.

325
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,380
Hey.

326
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,030
- Hi. - Where's Hiro?

327
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,200
Where were you?

328
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,100
Hiro!

329
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,060
- Elyse! Hey! - Happy birthday!

330
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,310
I haven’t seen you in a while. How are you?

331
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,360
- I’m okay. - That’s good.

332
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,940
Yanna, hi!

333
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,530
Hi! I hope you’re well.

334
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,820
Of course, I’m well. Are you?

335
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,450
I guess she’s still mad at me.

336
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,250
Yes! I’m fine. Thank you.

337
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,660
Good for you.

338
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,040
Anyways… Talk to you later Hiro.

339
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,170
- Happy birthday again. - Thank you for coming.

340
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,820
Don’t come closer, someone might get jealous.

341
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,950
Jealous? Who’s gonna get jealous?

342
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,760
Stop acting dumb.

343
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,330
Your girlfriend.

344
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,370
What do you mean?

345
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,210
My girlfriend’s here.

346
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,880
Giselle?

347
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,390
Oh…

348
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,600
Looks like someone else is jealous.

349
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:40,690
Huh?

350
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,770
Giselle said that she’s dating a non-showbiz guy.

351
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,690
Everyone knows that it’s you.

352
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,940
- Right? - Me?

353
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,840
Who else?

354
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,490
It’s Kalix.

355
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,540
- Huh? - She’s dating Kalix Martinez.

356
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,880
You want proof, look in front of you.

357
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:12,720
So that’s why Kalix is here? That means—

358
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,880
I am very much single, Yanna.

359
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,890
So, do you have any more concerns?

360
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,070
Huh?

361
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,360
Okay. It’s my turn now, Ashianna.

362
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,820
I’m jealous of your engineer.

363
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,370
- Sevi’s harmless. - I don’t care.

364
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,670
If you want an engineer, I can be an engineer, too.

365
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,670
So choose me.

366
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,800
Bro, Hiro! It’s cake time, bro. Come on, Let’s go!

367
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,470
Bro… Bro, let’s blow your cake. Come on!

368
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:03,810
Bro, bad timing...

369
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,780
How is she doing?

370
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,160
She’s okay.

371
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,620
I'll let her know that you're asking about her.

372
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,870
No, just don’t.

373
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:30,680
He’s right. It’s better not tell Luna. I’ll be doing her a favor.

374
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:37,340
Happy birthday to you!

375
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:42,890
Happy birthday, happy birthday… Happy birthday to you!

376
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,320
Thank you, thank you!

377
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,450
Make a wish!

378
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,180
Hey!

379
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,730
Again, happy birthday.

380
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:30,900
Thank you again.

381
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,360
Don’t expect too much.

382
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,360
Okay.

383
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,550
This is so priceless.

384
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,170
Thank you.

385
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:03,100
It’s not as expensive as the others.

386
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,430
What else can I give someone

387
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,560
who owns an airline company?

388
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,440
My mother owns the company

389
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,520
and my brother is operating it.

390
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,650
Me? I’m just one of their employees there.

391
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:20,660
But you still have a pretty high position.

392
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,870
And I’m confident enough, it’s because of my credentials.

393
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,910
First and foremost,

394
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,660
I’m a pilot-engineer.

395
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,180
Licensed engineer?

396
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,210
How?

397
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,250
Didn’t you leave after graduation?

398
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,930
Yes, I passed the boards.

399
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:46,010
I came back months after I left, Yanna.

400
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,350
I messaged and called you, but—

401
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,150
you were out of reach.

402
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:01,810
I was in Nueva Ecija. Pregnant with Avi.

403
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,120
But, thank you!

404
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,330
At least you got your license.

405
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,380
Yes!

406
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,300
You’re really a pilot-engineer.

407
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,670
That’s awesome.

408
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,570
Hiro, why did you come back?

409
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,080
Yanna, I came back because—

410
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,500
I don’t want you to go through it alone.

411
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,010
I had a feeling that you’d continue with the pregnancy

412
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,840
and I wanna be there for you.

413
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,270
I pushed you away. Weren’t you mad at me then?

414
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,930
- I don’t care. - I said...

415
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:17,190
- I was fucking other men— - And I don’t care, Yanna.

416
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,650
I was ready to father the child.

417
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,280
But you kept me out.

418
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,290
You pushed me.

419
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:40,500
Yanna…

420
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,960
I still...

421
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,500
I still—

422
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,260
Hello?

423
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,590
Hello, Yanna? Will you be coming home soon?

424
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:51,860
Avi has a high fever.

425
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,020
I want mommy. Where’s mommy?

426
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,520
All right, I’m on my way there.

427
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,940
Sorry, there’s an emergency.

428
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,670
Sorry.

429
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:37,310
Yanna, make sure to have Avi take her meds on time.

430
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:40,230
Check her temperature from time to time, okay?

431
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,610
Give her a cold compress

432
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:45,440
and have her drink lots of water so she won’t be dehydrated.

433
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,070
Do you want me to bring some meds and food?

434
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,070
Should I stay there with you?

435
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,950
Yanna, I’m ready to leave. Just let me know.

436
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,660
I’m okay.

437
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,460
I’ve given Avi a cold compress.

438
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,580
I’ll wake her up later so that she can drink her medicine.

439
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,000
What’s wrong?

440
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:07,010
I feel so guilty.

441
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:11,010
I shouldn’t have attended that party. I didn’t realize

442
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:15,010
I didn't even realize that Avi had a fever.

443
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:18,390
I was too preoccupied with

444
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:23,480
how to break the news with Hiro that I neglected Avi.

445
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,770
Yanna, stop saying that.

446
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:28,820
You’re doing a great job being a single mom.

447
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,780
Yes. Don’t be too hard on yourself.

448
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,530
What you're doing is not something everyone can handle.

449
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,240
Also, you need to go out from time-to-time, you know?

450
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,870
Besides, we’re all witnesses to how much you’ve sacrificed.

451
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,830
You going out to a party

452
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,540
doesn’t make you a bad mother.

453
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,420
I’ll come over if you continue to cry!

454
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,860
Just focus on taking care of Avi.

455
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,260
This is your chance to bond with her.

456
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,390
Thank you, girls.

457
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,260
I took a three-day leave.

458
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,560
I know I need to make time for Avi.

459
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,690
I feel so guilty that she needs to get sick

460
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,770
just for me to realize this.

461
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:08,190
You’re blaming yourself again.

462
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,990
You’re working for Avi and I’m pretty sure Avi knows that.

463
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,740
She’s a smart kid, Yanna.

464
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,330
Thank you, girls. Virtual hug to all of you.

465
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:21,160
I’ll go ahead now. I’ll fix Avi’s stuff.

466
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,460
Okay, just call me if you need anything.

467
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,960
Okay, bye! Good night, Yanna.

468
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,420
Bye!

469
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,710
Bye! Get well soon Avi!

470
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,680
Bye, good night.

471
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,010
Good night!

472
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,020
Is everything okay?

473
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:50,820
Yes, everything’s okay. I’m sorry I had to go suddenly.

474
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,030
Enjoy your after party.

475
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,740
Don't worry about it.

476
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,890
You know I’m here for you, right?

477
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,200
If you need anything, don’t hesitate to message me.

478
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,290
Hey… Good morning, baby!

479
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,960
Mommy prepared breakfast for you.

480
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,050
Finish this so you can take your medicine. Okay?

481
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:57,970
Okay.

482
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,230
No work, mommy?

483
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:09,270
No work for mommy until you’re okay. Let me see.

484
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:14,110
I don’t want to be okay now.

485
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,740
Don’t say that, Avi.

486
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,700
If I’m okay, you’ll leave again.

487
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,990
I’m sorry, baby. Mommy needs to work for you.

488
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:27,120
My friend is always with their mommy and daddy.

489
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,000
But what about me?

490
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,040
Maybe Daddy hates me.

491
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,130
Daddy doesn’t hate you.

492
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,010
Remember what I told you?

493
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,010
You’ll see Daddy soon.

494
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,840
How many more days left?

495
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,270
Nine days?

496
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:50,150
That’s right! But before that, we’ll go somewhere you like.

497
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:52,230
Really, Mommy? Where?

498
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:55,780
In Tokyo, baby. See, I told you.

499
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,150
So don’t be sad.

500
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,320
After we come home from Japan,

501
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,690
we’ll go see Daddy.

502
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,570
So, eat now.

503
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,810
- I will, Mommy. - Focus on getting well, okay?

504
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:24,220
Sam, thanks for coming along at the last minute.

505
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:28,600
Of course. I know it’s hard to travel with a 4-year-old.

506
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,690
- Avi! - Avi, your mommy.

507
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,560
You stay with Aunty Sam for now, okay? We’ll see each other later.

508
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,940
Okay, Mommy.

509
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,530
All right, let’s talk later. My phone’s drained, see you soon.

510
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,660
Bye, Mommy! I love you, Mommy!

511
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,610
Bye, Avi! I love you, too. See you!

512
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,960
Thank you!

513
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:55,090
Aunty, can I go to the restroom?

514
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,550
Sure, let’s go.

515
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,260
Be careful…

516
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:06,350
Look, Avi. That’s mommy. She’s super busy, see?

517
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,720
Hi, Mommy! You’re so pretty.

518
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,640
You’re so cute, my baby.

519
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,020
Okay Avi, go to the lavatory.

520
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
Okay…

521
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,280
Girl, are you okay?

522
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:27,330
Sam, I have a problem. I don’t know what to do.

523
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,600
What is it?

524
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,910
Hiro’s the pilot.

525
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,790
There was a last-minute change.

526
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,300
We’re also staying in the same hotel with the flight crew.

527
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,840
What if we bump into Hiro?

528
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,800
What if—

529
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,090
Maybe I should just change hotels, just to be safe?

530
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:47,800
We can do that. But really, Yanna.

531
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,270
What if you just tell Hiro about Avi?

532
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,480
I think that’s the easier option.

533
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,020
Maybe this is the right timing you’ve been waiting for.

534
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,780
Okay, sorry.

535
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,200
I know it’s not easy.

536
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,200
I’m not ready, Sam.

537
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,410
What if he rejects us?

538
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,750
That would be traumatizing for Avi.

539
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,420
She’s even so excited for this trip

540
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,880
since we seldom bond together like this.

541
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,730
Yanna, what if Hiro accepts Avi?

542
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,880
Then this would be your first family bonding in Japan.

543
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,420
Happy ending!

544
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,140
Okay, fine.

545
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,270
Let’s just do our best in hiding.

546
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,730
Mommy, I’m done.

547
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,780
Go back to your seat, baby.

548
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,340
Candies!

549
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,670
Candy again?

550
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,570
You silly girl.

551
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,850
Avi would love that.

552
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,410
You're spoiling her again.

553
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,940
I'll buy these for her, what else?

554
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,190
Jeez. That’s too much candy.

555
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,190
No, It's okay.

556
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,190
This one?

557
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,670
I want chocolate.

558
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,700
- That's too much. - No, it's okay.

559
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,030
This one, give it to her.

560
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,150
A special gift.

561
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,210
I like your hair clip.

562
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:24,500
Thank you. My daddy gave it to me.

563
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,670
Are you a pilot?

564
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,520
- Yes. - My daddy is a pilot, too.

565
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,640
Avi, let’s go to our hotel.

566
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,950
We need to talk.

567
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,100
Is she my daughter?

568
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:04,950
Yes.

569
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:23,910
Why—

570
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,540
I’m sorry.

571
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,360
How could you do this to me, Yanna?

572
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,560
- I’m sorry— - Damn it, Yanna—

573
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,100
Damn it, Yanna…

574
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,940
She’s my child.

575
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:53,570
I was the— Fuck.

576
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,440
It's almost five years, Yanna.

577
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,620
How can you not tell me about it?

578
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,720
I was with you...

579
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,580
for the past weeks.

580
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:13,300
We were alone for countless times.

581
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,550
How can you not tell me about her?

582
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,800
Why?

583
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:21,010
I wasn’t... ready.

584
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,680
When will you be?

585
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,690
Yanna, tell me when?

586
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,110
I was scared…

587
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,490
that you won’t accept Avi.

588
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,080
She’s also my daughter, Yanna.

589
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:50,040
How heartless do you think I am?

590
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:54,250
You told me back then that you didn’t want a child.

591
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,380
It was not in my plans, Yanna.

592
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,970
But if it was with you…

593
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,090
You know.

594
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,810
I was always ready to take risks.

595
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:10,020
I could—

596
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,400
I could have sacrificed for her, too.

597
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,780
You didn’t have to carry all the burden.

598
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,200
Because I—

599
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,530
I would have also loved her.

600
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:31,250
I would have also given all that I had for that child.

601
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,340
Even if nothing’s left of me, Yanna.

602
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,680
I thought I made the right decision.

603
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:45,040
If I told you that you got me pregnant,

604
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,810
would you still be in your position now?

605
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:49,640
I can still be a pilot while providing for my—

606
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:53,730
I can still be a pilot while providing for my daughter.

607
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:57,730
We talked about your dreams, remember?

608
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,700
And your dad was sick, too.

609
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,200
Why would you even stay here?

610
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:05,240
What for?

611
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:07,910
Did you think that my love for you

612
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:09,700
was not enough for me to stay?

613
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:15,790
You’re my only reason to stay, Yanna.

614
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:21,880
But you pushed me away.

615
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:32,730
I wanted to share the pain and happiness with you.

616
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,820
Raising a child alone is not easy.

617
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:48,240
I’m sorry.

618
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,040
I’m sorry.

619
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,630
I’m really sorry, Hiro.

620
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:07,930
I’m sorry I lied to you.

621
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,220
I’m sorry.

622
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,440
I thought I could handle it on my own.

623
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,650
I’m sorry.

624
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,820
I didn’t give you a chance.

625
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,000
I was scared. I was a coward.

626
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:42,010
I’m a coward!

627
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:44,260
I knew you would be mad at me,

628
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:47,800
I made the wrong choice. I was scared…

629
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,520
I’m sorry I deprived you of the truth.

630
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,060
I’m sorry.

631
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:59,110
I’m really sorry.

632
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,030
I’m sorry.

633
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:37,440
- I’m so sorry. - Hey, hey.

634
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:42,230
I’m sorry.

635
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:46,990
I wasn't there when you went through a lot.

636
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:58,160
What's her full name?

637
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,290
Avrielle Haven.

638
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,860
Avi for short.

639
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,110
Avi...

640
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,350
The name of our daughter.

641
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,010
Avi.

642
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,240
I want to meet our daughter.

643
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:29,550
I wanna meet her.

644
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,130
Wow! So pretty.

645
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,040
Thank you.

646
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,400
I’ll go out for a while.

647
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,360
Are we going to ride the carousel now?

648
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,620
Let’s see.

649
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,830
But for now…

650
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:21,160
I want you to meet someone, okay?

651
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:47,320
This is Hiro...

652
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,490
your daddy.

653
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:02,720
This is Hiro...

654
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:06,600
your daddy.

655
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:08,310
Hello, Avrielle!

656
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,980
Thank you for letting me do this.

657
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,530
No problem.

658
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:18,070
Is this room soundproof? Just kidding.

659
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:20,660
- Who are you texting? - Just Sam.

660
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,160
I’m just gonna get my clothes.

661
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:28,300
I miss the sex lol

662
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,960
What?
