1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,700
Time flies so fast, Yanna.

2
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,280
I wish I had met you sooner.

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,080
What if that's our only role
in each other's lives?

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,080
Just a quick layover

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,870
before heading to
the final destination?

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,090
Hiro doesn't want this.
I can’t have a baby now.

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,130
I’m pregnant, Ma.

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,470
I'll be fine on my own, right?

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,820
Of course!

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,100
We'll look at the same sky every day,

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,970
but in different colors.

12
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,340
Are you pregnant?

13
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,670
Am I the father?

14
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,040
Hey—
What are you doing?

15
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,820
Hiro, come on.

16
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,930
-Stop it.
-What the fuck, Yanna?

17
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,650
You’re fucking pregnant?

18
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,480
How the hell can I leave
after knowing

19
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,780
you’re carrying our child?

20
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,040
How?

21
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,530
Tell me how?

22
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,120
This isn’t yours.

23
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,250
It’s not yours.

24
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,550
What?

25
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,510
Yanna, answer me.

26
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,480
I fucked other men.

27
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,770
-I broke our exclusivity rule—
-Don’t fucking lie to me, Yanna.

28
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,190
Why would I lie to you?

29
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,490
This baby isn’t yours.

30
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,570
So don’t waste your life here.

31
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,250
Just go.

32
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,800
I’m not planning to keep
the baby anyway.

33
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,880
I’ll get an abortion.

34
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,220
Are you fucking serious?

35
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,340
Yes.

36
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,610
Who’s the father?

37
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,040
I don’t know.

38
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,760
I had sex with a lot of fuckers,
I just don’t know anymore.

39
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,260
Yanna, please. Please.

40
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,810
Please, don’t lie to me.

41
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,350
I’m begging you.

42
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,100
Hiro, I’m not—

43
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,900
I’m not lying to you.

44
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,740
Okay.

45
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,950
I’ll leave now.

46
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,950
Yanna,

47
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,370
-don’t lie to me please.
-Finish packing up.

48
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,500
You wouldn’t want
to be late for your flight.

49
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,920
Yanna!

50
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,060
Why are you doing this to me?

51
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,230
Why are you doing
this to me, Yanna?

52
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,280
Why?

53
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,120
Yanna—

54
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,460
One last, please.
Just stay still.

55
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,180
I’ll drop everything
for you, Yanna.

56
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,740
Just stay.

57
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,280
Yanna...

58
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,300
I love you, Yanna.

59
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,890
I love you.

60
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,520
This is it. We’re over.

61
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,620
Hiro, when I first saw you,

62
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,630
I admired the way you talked
and presented yourself

63
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,880
because you stood out
in the crowd.

64
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,050
But when I got to know you,

65
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,970
I realized the thing I admired the most

66
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,020
was your determination
to achieve your dream.

67
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,480
From the start, you had already
made your goals clear to me.

68
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,320
I already told you about this,
but I want to write it this time

69
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,990
because the ink will stay longer
than my words in your memories.

70
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,120
I’m so proud of you.

71
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,710
I’m so proud of what you have
become and for what you will be.

72
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,090
You have a bright future
ahead of you.

73
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,380
So, chase your dreams.

74
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,970
I will delay mine, but
I promise we’ll get there.

75
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,490
We may or may not
see each other again,

76
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,530
but I hope this pain
will put us in the right places,

77
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,980
in the right destinations.

78
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,630
Safe skies, my archer.

79
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,620
Please remember that we will always
be under the same sky, Yanna. - Hiro

80
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,480
Please remember that we will always
be under the same sky, Yanna. - Hiro

81
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,380
2 WEEKS LATER

82
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,800
Be careful, Yanna.

83
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,640
It’s a bit muddy.

84
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,060
- My dear!
- Yes.

85
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,520
Oh wow.

86
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,850
Let’s go to the kitchen,
I cooked a lot of food.

87
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,610
RIDE OR DIE

88
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,610
LUNA: Hey let’s drink later!
Who’s coming?

89
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,330
SAM: I’m coming.

90
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,910
KIERRA: ME!!
VIA: Okay, I’ll go.

91
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,960
LUNA: @Yanna you?

92
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,220
LUNA: Wow. Seenzoned.
Not even a reply.

93
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,920
Mama never left my side as I
entered the new chapter of my life.

94
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,340
I saw how hard she worked for us.

95
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,740
I've forgiven her and
she has forgiven me too.

96
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,180
I'm not sure if we can ever
mend our broken relationship

97
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,180
but I'm hopeful that one day,

98
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:32,770
we'll both be able to see each other
without being reminded of our past wounds.

99
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,710
Why aren’t you answering, Yanna?

100
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,760
Once upon a time,

101
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,180
a powerful Ice Princess
lived far away.

102
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,690
Her name was Princess Ola…

103
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,610
LUNA: See you later
at The Pop-up, girls!

104
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,110
LUNA: Don’t be late.
TGIF! Let’s party!

105
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,040
LUNA: Pop-up later, you free?

106
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,430
LUNA: Why haven’t you been
responding? Are you okay?

107
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,770
LUNA: The heck Yanna,
why are you ghosting us?

108
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:28,360
LUNA: This really hurts.
Aren’t we friends?

109
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,540
I’m pregnant, Luna…

110
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,910
Hey!

111
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,570
What are you doing here, bitch?

112
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,110
Wow! So welcoming!

113
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:14,070
By the way,
I have a lot of gifts! Look!

114
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,530
Jeez! It’s still too early
for gifts.

115
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,500
Thank you! I’m so touched.

116
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,460
Why are you touched?
These aren’t for you,

117
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,210
they’re for my godchild.

118
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,170
So, when are you planning
to tell our friends

119
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,550
about your pregnancy?

120
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:35,050
They feel sad that you haven’t
gotten in touch with them.

121
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,610
It’s okay
if you’re not ready yet.

122
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,490
It’s your choice.

123
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,070
They’ll think...

124
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,620
I’m so stupid.

125
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,170
Trust me,
they would never think that.

126
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,800
You know them. They don’t judge.

127
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,170
They might even be happy since

128
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,840
this is the first baby
in our group.

129
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,830
Your child will become
so spoiled.

130
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,060
I still feel ashamed, Sam.

131
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:26,850
I can’t even forget
about the shame I felt

132
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:31,070
because I had to quit
my studies because of this.

133
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,560
I’m also bothering grandma because of this.

134
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,700
I feel so embarrassed.

135
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,780
I understand what
you’re feeling right now.

136
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,160
Yanna,
you don’t have to tell them

137
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,500
if you’re not yet
comfortable about it.

138
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,510
Don’t you think I’m stupid for

139
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,970
getting pregnant with a guy
I chose to push away?

140
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,970
No.
I think you’re brave for that.

141
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,020
You are the bravest
woman I know, Yanna.

142
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,070
How about you?
What brought you here?

143
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,530
Got a problem?

144
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,540
Is this about a guy?

145
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,750
Is this about the guy
you’re supposed to marry?

146
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,940
SAM: I feel tired.

147
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,630
Sam unsent a message

148
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,370
Grandma, Aunty,
I’ll be leaving for a bit.

149
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,550
Huh?

150
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,730
Where?

151
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,330
Just around the corner.

152
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,880
Huh?

153
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,270
What the hell
are you doing here?

154
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,690
Are you alone?

155
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,940
Yanna, you should have
called me!

156
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,650
I didn’t think about that.
I just hurriedly got on the bus

157
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,360
when I received your message.

158
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,070
Well? What happened to you?
Are you okay?

159
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,450
I’m okay.

160
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,740
Oh god Yanna,
the whole group is here.

161
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,910
Sam, is the food there yet?

162
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,840
Oh, I thought
it was the delivery.

163
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,430
I can’t blame them
for getting mad.

164
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,640
I’ve been ghosting them
for months now.

165
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,270
You wanna come in?

166
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,020
Sam…

167
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,520
I’m scared.

168
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,360
It’s okay.

169
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,130
Uh, girls.

170
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,160
Yanna’s here.

171
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,880
So, you're still alive.

172
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,130
You didn't even
bother to reach out.

173
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,850
You’re pregnant?

174
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,280
Sorry.

175
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,290
I made a mis—

176
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,990
God…
I’m so sorry, Yanna.

177
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,530
I’m so sorry!

178
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,950
You were suffering alone
and we didn’t know.

179
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,370
I’m so sorry!

180
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,150
I’m sorry, I didn’t tell you
sooner because—

181
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,420
I was so scared.

182
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,630
I thought you all
might get mad at me.

183
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,930
Tell me that I’m so stupid.

184
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,600
I’m scared that
you might tell me

185
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,770
that I should have expected this
after all that I’ve done.

186
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,190
No. Yanna, sorry.

187
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,490
We’re sorry that
you felt you had to

188
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,820
hide your pregnancy from us.

189
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,280
Yanna, sorry.

190
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,580
I didn’t know what to do either.

191
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,290
It really hurts.

192
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,520
Who’s the fa—
Nevermind.

193
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,420
Come here.

194
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,470
That’s not important.
Sit down.

195
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,640
Be careful.

196
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,560
It—

197
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,930
It is—

198
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,980
It’s Hiro.

199
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,410
We were fuck buddies at first.

200
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,760
It was all just a game.

201
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,970
But, you see...

202
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,660
I lost.

203
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,540
I fell so deep.

204
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:44,210
He’s in America now
to become a pilot.

205
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,140
I chose to push him away because

206
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,980
I can’t let him give up
his dreams for me.

207
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,940
I’m sorry for being stupid.

208
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,940
Who cares? We can be the father
of your child.

209
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,820
Hey! Don’t be sad anymore.

210
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,450
The baby already
has a lot of aunties

211
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,450
that would shower with love.

212
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,680
And Sevi, too!

213
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,580
He’s coming soon.
I’m sure he’ll be surprised

214
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,420
when he sees you.

215
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,210
About Sevi… Don’t tell Sevi

216
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,320
who the father is please.

217
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:29,140
You know he could be
overprotective of us.

218
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,630
He might look for Hiro.

219
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,490
I don’t wanna be
in a messy situation.

220
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,720
Speaking of the devil.

221
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:49,690
I’m sorry I’m late, guys.
But I got us pizza

222
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:53,360
so none of you will get mad—
Hey! You’re here!

223
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,730
Shit.

224
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,950
Yanna!

225
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,830
What happened?

226
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,140
Shit, who’s the—

227
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,350
Did he leave you?

228
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,940
That fucking bastard.

229
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:31,420
Don’t worry, I’ll be the
baby’s father if you want.

230
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,860
I’ll take care of you.

231
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,660
Damn, Sevi.

232
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,160
Can you actually
provide for a baby?

233
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,310
Of course!

234
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,460
Who do you think I am?

235
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:50,310
Thanks for the offer
but I’m fine.

236
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,840
All right then, I’ll just become
the best uncle.

237
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,640
Just don’t teach my baby
about all our antics, okay?

238
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,060
Oh! You better take the
baby away from Sevi.

239
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,890
Hello!
Hi, baby!

240
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,980
Hey! You might
squash the baby.

241
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,020
Come on, guys.
Be careful.

242
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,360
Hey, Yanna! It’s your
turn to take a shot!

243
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,200
- Hey!
- She can’t!

244
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,280
Don’t!

245
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,490
You’ll be taking the
shots for Yanna, okay?

246
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:21,160
Fuck, I missed you guys.

247
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,090
Life may not always go as planned

248
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:34,800
but it's how we handle the unexpected
that defines us.

249
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,500
I may not have chosen this path,

250
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:43,450
but I will make the most of it
and create a happy life for my child.

251
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,620
My new source of light.

252
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:50,030
My new source of happiness is here.

253
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,080
My baby Avi.

254
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,600
Yanna!

255
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,700
- Hey! Are you okay?
- Let’s go.

256
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,240
Hey! What happened to you?

257
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,410
What’s wrong?

258
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,870
It’s Hiro.

259
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,960
Does Captain Hottie
have a girlfriend?

260
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,770
I wonder if he has
any social media?

261
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,720
- Let’s stalk him—
- I wonder too.

262
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,970
If he’s single, I’m having him.

263
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,270
Oh, wait a minute.

264
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,480
Someone else
already beat us to it.

265
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,650
Seriously, Yanna.
You literally fell on him.

266
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,320
That embrace you had
with the Captain—

267
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,860
- was so tight.
- Right?

268
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,200
Hey, Yanna!
Are you okay?

269
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,120
You seem out of it today.

270
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,870
Ah, no...

271
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,390
It’s just that my ankle hurts
after tripping earlier.

272
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,170
- Fortunately—
- That would really hurt…

273
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,430
Fortunately, we have the day
off after this flight.

274
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,510
You’ll be able to rest.

275
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:43,030
He looks mature now.
In a good way.

276
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,740
Are we complete?

277
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,340
Yes.

278
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,940
He seems happy.

279
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:51,750
That captain uniform suits him well.

280
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:56,080
By the way, this is our first
officer for this flight, Caleb.

281
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,250
- Hello Captain!
- Ohayou gozaimasu!

282
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,000
Good morning, crew!

283
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,420
- Ready?
- Hello!

284
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,060
Come on. Let’s get ready.

285
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,790
Such a fancy car. I better be
careful not to hit it.

286
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,510
So it was his. That explains it.

287
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,950
Not today, please!
Not today.

288
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,760
Is there a problem?

289
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,370
Not really.

290
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,880
Pop the hood.

291
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:29,900
I forgot that he’s also
a mechanical engineer.

292
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,080
Is there a problem
with the engine?

293
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,200
Checking…

294
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,290
You should have this checked.

295
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,840
Your battery is fine.

296
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,130
I think your oil pump
is failing.

297
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,300
Better not use this today.

298
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,590
Really?

299
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,720
All right then, thank you.

300
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,850
Do you need a ride?

301
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,020
No need.
I’ll just book for a ride.

302
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,110
Okay. Take care, Ya—

303
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,260
Ms. Fernandez.

304
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,700
By the way, nice sweater.

305
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,750
Hi baby!

306
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,820
I miss you!

307
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,240
- Mommy!
- Hello!

308
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,240
Have you been a good girl?

309
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,240
Here!

310
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,790
Have you been a good girl, baby?

311
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,790
- Mommy!
- Yes?

312
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,790
Aunty went with me to
Emma’s birthday party!

313
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,080
Really?

314
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,670
Wow!

315
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,840
You’re here.

316
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,130
Aunty, tell mommy what I did

317
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,320
at Emma’s birthday party!

318
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:19,480
Avi was a very good girl.

319
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,470
She’s well behaved and—

320
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,890
Not that, Aunty!

321
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:28,980
Out of 5 games that they
played, she won three!

322
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,780
Wow! My baby is amazing.

323
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,570
You really take after mommy.

324
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,870
She’s definitely a
show-off like you.

325
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,950
Show-off?
I’m just really competitive.

326
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,590
Seriously…

327
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,370
Mommy, are we going home?

328
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:47,620
Yes, baby.
Go get your things, okay?

329
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,670
- Okay.
- Go inside.

330
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,470
What’s wrong? Tiring flight?

331
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,760
Something crazy
happened to me today.

332
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,930
I’m sure you’ll go crazy, too.

333
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,090
Why? What happened?

334
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,670
I’ll tell you tomorrow.

335
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:06,730
I’ll explain it during
our lunch date with the girls.

336
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,430
You and your cliffhangers!

337
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,480
I hate you.

338
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,150
I’m sorry. I just need to
organize my thoughts.

339
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:16,150
Okay, fine! I’ll wait
until tomorrow.

340
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,360
Thank you.

341
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,030
Looks like Avi really
enjoyed her day today.

342
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,910
She didn’t miss me too much.

343
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:25,660
You’re my favorite babysitter.

344
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,000
No worries.

345
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I enjoy being with her too.

346
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,170
You know how much
I love that kid.

347
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,960
Jeez!

348
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,800
She’s my favorite.
My favorite godchild.

349
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,680
She even placed her stuff here.

350
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:56,310
Avi, you need to eat
your vegetables, baby.

351
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,610
But I don’t want to, Mommy.

352
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,350
Avrielle Haven Fernandez—

353
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,280
You need to eat your veggies
so you’ll be healthier

354
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,290
and so you can play games
with more energy!

355
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:10,330
But I won the game
without eating veggies.

356
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,500
I only ate hotdog
and spaghetti.

357
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,200
Where are you going?

358
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,550
I danced like this.

359
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,660
Really? Like that?

360
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,900
And then what?

361
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,930
Mommy, there was a
mascot at the party.

362
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,640
He also danced like this.

363
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,860
Yes, okay.

364
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,020
Okay.

365
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,150
And then when
he removed the costume,

366
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,190
it was Emma’s daddy!

367
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,060
She was surprised and cried!

368
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:47,120
Okay, come here.
Let’s continue eating.

369
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,250
Eat now.

370
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,790
Mommy, will daddy
surprise me too?

371
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,760
Of course.
Daddy will surprise you too

372
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,880
when you become a big girl.

373
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,550
So that’s why you have to
finish your veggies, okay?

374
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,970
- Okay, Mommy.
- Okay, continue eating.

375
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,430
Eat your veggies.

376
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:12,060
Princess Ola
saved the Ice Kingdom

377
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,770
from the evil Fire Queen.

378
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,270
The end.

379
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,940
One more story, Mommy.

380
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,910
But you’re already sleepy.

381
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,740
I’m not yet sleepy!
One more, Mommy!

382
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,410
Wait—

383
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,040
Grandma’s calling.

384
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:35,380
-Ma?
-Hello, Yanna!

385
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:39,380
I’m planning to go there this
Saturday. Are you off then?

386
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,300
- Yes, Ma. I have the day off.
- Okay.

387
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:46,220
- Grandma!
- Hello, Avi! How are you?

388
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,680
- Lola, are you visiting me?
- Yes!

389
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,390
What do you want me
to bring for you?

390
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,020
Want me to bring food?

391
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,810
Hotdog and spaghetti.

392
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,690
How about some bitter gourd?

393
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,860
- That’s ew.
- Oh, Ma,

394
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,610
it's really hard to get her
to eat vegetables

395
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:05,570
She’s just like you! You were
the same when you were young.

396
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,200
Do you want me to cook
Mechado and Sinigang

397
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,700
when I go there?

398
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,580
-Sure, Ma.
-Okay!

399
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,880
Now go to sleep.
Take care on your flights.

400
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,670
- See you soon!
- Take care too, Ma.

401
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,550
Okay.
Say goodbye to your grandma.

402
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,760
- Bye, Grandma! I love you!
- Good night, baby Avi.

403
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,180
Good night! I love you!

404
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:33,020
Time to sleep. Good night.

405
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,400
Spill the tea, sis.

406
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,190
So, Hiro is back!

407
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:45,400
He was the pilot
of my last flight.

408
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,070
Seems like we’ll be working
for a while.

409
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:49,780
I knew it!

410
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,080
I’m actually aware that
Hiro is back in Manila.

411
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,540
I just didn’t tell you because

412
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,710
I don’t know if you wanted
to talk about him.

413
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:02,150
But yeah, I wasn’t expecting
you guys to meet on the plane.

414
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,770
How was it? Was it awkward
working with your ex?

415
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:10,430
Correction! We were never a
couple so he’s not my ex.

416
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,220
It’s the same thing.
You loved him, right?

417
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,180
So, how do you feel?

418
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:19,070
Honestly, I don’t know.

419
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:22,020
I don’t really want to entertain
those thoughts right now.

420
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,400
It wasn’t a good feeling.

421
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,900
I wanted to hide from him
most of the time.

422
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,910
I’m not ready to face him yet.

423
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,370
Is it because of Avi?

424
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,120
I feel guilty that
I’m hiding Avi from him.

425
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:41,540
And I feel bad whenever Avi
asks for his dad from me.

426
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,710
I’d just say that I don’t know.

427
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,730
What can be done?

428
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,590
Since you'll always
be working together,

429
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,660
can't you request to transfer?

430
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,970
No, that won’t be
a valid reason.

431
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:55,970
Tell them that it’s for your
mental and emotional well-being.

432
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,430
- Yes.
- Just like that.

433
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:00,020
Besides, you don’t really
need to resolve

434
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,310
all of your past issues
immediately.

435
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,410
I agree.

436
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:05,610
Just stay professional.

437
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,690
Limit your interactions.

438
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,660
Focus on work-related concerns.

439
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:15,200
That’s all I can do anyway.
But—

440
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,790
did I mention that he’ll be our
pilot for our flight to Japan?

441
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:20,790
That Japan flight
has a three-day layover.

442
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:23,210
I’ve been waiting so long

443
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:25,300
for us to have
a layover in Japan.

444
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,380
- Your dream country.
- Exactly!

445
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,550
Just don’t mind Hiro.

446
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,720
Go roam around on your own.

447
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,350
That’s the plan.

448
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:38,520
I’ll avoid Hiro until I’m ready
to tell him everything.

449
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,560
You got this!

450
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,400
- Get back to eating.
- You’ll be fine. Eat!

451
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,940
Go, sis. Eat your feelings out.

452
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,280
- Let’s toast.
- Let’s drink.

453
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,820
Hurry now.
Toast to this.

454
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,160
- She is so tired and stressed.
- You got this!

455
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,410
Cheers!

456
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,880
Mommy, where are you going?

457
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,670
Japan, baby.

458
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,840
Is it far?

459
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,160
A bit.

460
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,280
I’m going to miss you, Mommy.

461
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,850
Baby…

462
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:25,980
You know mommy
needs to do this for you.

463
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,440
It’s your dream
to see snow, right?

464
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,780
And to buy lots of
dolls and toys?

465
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,200
For that to happen, mommy
needs to work hard.

466
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,750
Don’t worry, once I’ve saved up...

467
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,790
I’ll bring you to Japan with me.

468
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,170
Really, Mommy?

469
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:50,130
Yes! So you have to behave and
finish your veggies. Okay?

470
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,400
Okay, Mommy.

471
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,320
Pinky promise!

472
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,510
Pinky promise!

473
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,650
Three for I love you.

474
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,280
Thank you, baby.

475
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:15,910
You know, there was a kid crying
in the airport last time.

476
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:17,460
Here you go.

477
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,660
I gave her your candies.

478
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,120
Did she stop crying?

479
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,540
Yes, she did.
Thanks to your candies.

480
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,100
Is that for me?

481
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,640
Give it to the other kids,
Mommy.

482
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,320
You’re so sweet, baby.

483
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,850
Come here.

484
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,480
My baby…

485
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,400
Thank you.
I’m gonna miss you.

486
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:12,840
We’ll enjoy this flight again,
thanks to our handsome captain.

487
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,460
Right.

488
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,800
Bri, I’ll bring his food to
the cockpit again, okay?

489
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,600
Didn’t Miss Arlyn say that
Yanna’s bringing in the food?

490
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,430
She might catch you.

491
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,980
Why?
Who are you talking to?

492
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,270
No one, just someone I know.

493
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:37,280
Another dating app
winner, everyone.

494
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,820
Huh? He’s just a friend,
what are you talking about?

495
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,910
You’re silly—

496
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:43,080
- Lower your voice.
- Sorry.

497
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,410
Who is that anyway?

498
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:49,250
No, it’s just… I got a match
with him on a dating app.

499
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,710
A British expat based in Japan.
We’ll be meeting in Tokyo so,

500
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:56,130
I’ll see you guys on
our next flight, okay?

501
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:58,930
Is that so?

502
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,930
Your answered prayer
is in Japan.

503
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:05,220
- Don’t be silly.
- Take care of yourself.

504
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,140
Yes, I promise.

505
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,980
Now hide that before Ma’am
Arlyn catches you.

506
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:21,930
I was right.
This is meant for him.

507
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,700
Thank you, Miss Fernandez.

508
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:41,470
All right, food!
Thank you, Yanna.

509
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,370
TOKYO

510
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:11,560
Look!

511
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,660
We have a better itinerary now.

512
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,230
Since Brianna’s not here,
she’ll definitely be jealous.

513
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:21,280
You’re right.
Let me see that.

514
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,440
Where are we going?

515
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,530
Will go to Naritasan.

516
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:27,530
These have been
approved by Captain.

517
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:31,910
And he even recommended—
He recommended these.

518
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,790
I also invited him.

519
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:37,250
So, he's coming?

520
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:40,420
That’s the thing, he’s not
gonna join because—

521
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:45,470
he said he doesn’t feel well
and he would rather just rest.

522
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,680
Miss Arlyn on the
other hand said

523
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,100
that she’ll be visiting
her relatives.

524
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,890
So it’s just going to be
Captain Caleb who’s joining us.

525
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:56,690
- Hi, guys!
- Hey! Speaking of…

526
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,860
Captain’s joining us, too.

527
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,900
I persuaded him. He said he
knows a restaurant

528
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:03,150
he wants us to try.

529
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:05,200
Nice one!
Leave it to the expert!

530
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:08,200
It’s just near here,
walking distance.

531
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,660
Lead the way, Captain!

532
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,120
- Let’s go!
- Wait a minute. Kyla, I think—

533
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:17,760
I feel really sleepy, so
I better go back to the hotel.

534
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:20,290
- You just said you were hungry.
- I need to sleep this off.

535
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,770
- You can’t!
- I am really sleepy.

536
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,380
Come on, let’s go eat.

537
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,840
Besides, you shouldn’t sleep
with an empty stomach.

538
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,340
But—

539
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,930
Seriously,
Captain Hottie is joining us

540
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:37,480
so you can’t bail on us.
Let’s go, we’re eating.

541
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,780
- I’ll stay here.
- I'll sit here.

542
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,660
All right.

543
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:53,870
You can sit there.

544
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,380
I’m sure you guys would
love the steak here.

545
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:10,090
Steak again?

546
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:14,060
What do you mean?

547
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:16,470
We haven’t had any steak.

548
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,860
I did!

549
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,860
I— I had steak yesterday.

550
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:56,060
- Here you go.
- I can manage!

551
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,100
No, it’s fine.

552
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:20,680
Girls, try these. It's so good.

553
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,290
I'm still full.

554
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,450
I'll take your picture.

555
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:51,130
Try those!

556
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,660
Matcha!

557
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,570
It's so beautiful here.

558
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:17,870
This one looks delicious!

559
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:27,810
I’m so excited to try
Captain’s recommendation.

560
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:29,690
This better be good, Captain.

561
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:32,690
As long as it’s Captain’s
recommendation, it’s good.

562
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,570
- Let’s order.
- Here’s the menu.

563
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:36,820
Just order what you want.

564
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,450
I wanna try this.

565
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:46,330
Actually you can
order over there.

566
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:48,450
- Let’s check it out.
- Wait a minute, Captain.

567
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:52,880
I wanna try their takoyaki.

568
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:55,090
Let's order that.

569
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,720
I wanna order that too.

570
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,510
Okay, let's order.

571
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:10,770
Here.

572
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,030
What’s this, Captain?

573
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:21,320
I saw you at the department
store checking that doll.

574
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:32,530
- Yes, actually—
- Anyway, I hope she’ll like it.

575
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,390
Okay, thank you.

576
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:48,010
I’m sure this will be appreciated.

577
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:57,860
- Did you guys order?
- Yes.

578
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,190
The okonomiyaki looks delicious.

579
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,700
I can already smell it.

580
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,830
Cheers!

581
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:55,040
You’re not wearing
your sweater today.

582
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:57,310
Correction,

583
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,640
my sweater.

584
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,170
That sweater’s mine.
I bought it.

585
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,390
Okay, if you say so.

586
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,810
I’ve been meaning to tell you this...

587
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,570
I’m happy.

588
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,700
I’m happy that you’re a
FlyAsia flight attendant.

589
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:39,870
Me too.

590
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:43,000
I’m glad you’ve
reached your dreams.

591
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,010
By the way,

592
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:49,330
can you stop being
so polite with me?

593
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:51,480
It’s making me feel old.

594
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,690
Okay.

595
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:03,400
Thanks, Yanna.

596
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:35,880
So we can actually
be civil with each other.

597
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:40,370
Maybe we can become
work friends in the future.

598
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:45,960
But if I tell him about Avi,
would he accept her?

599
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:48,190
Will he forgive me?

600
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:36,780
What's a pilot, Mommy?

601
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:38,830
A pilot is someone
who drives an airplane

602
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:41,160
to bring people
to their families.

603
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,000
Wow, Mommy! I want to be
a pilot when I grow up.

604
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:46,880
- Yanna?
- Hey. Ericka!

605
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,710
It’s been so long.

606
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:50,710
- Mommy, can you open—
- Let me open it.

607
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:52,260
Your mom’s talking to someone.

608
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:55,640
Captain, this is
Engineer Sevi Camero.

609
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,760
Sevi, this is
Captain Hiro Juarez.

610
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,810
- What’s up, bro?
- Do you have a flight tomorrow?

611
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:01,000
Wait, let me check.

612
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:03,320
She doesn’t have a flight, bro.
We’re going out tomorrow.

613
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,770
I didn't ask you.
