1
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,780
Well?

2
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,240
Is he super hot?

3
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,750
Why are you so scared of cuddling?

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,460
Are you scared that you
might fall for me if we cuddle?

5
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:27,830
Hiro!

6
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,670
Oh, I didn’t realize
that you’re with someone.

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,550
I heard Giselle was at
your place last Thursday.

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,719
So, what happened?

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,850
Are you guys back together?

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,720
Giselle was asking me,
if we could try again.

11
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,060
I declined.

12
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,220
You’re actually way cuter up close.

13
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:52,019
Thick brows, well-defined
nose, kissable lips...

14
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,560
Wow!

15
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,620
Fuck! Wait a minute. Why are we cuddling?

16
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,210
How did this happen?

17
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,500
This can’t be!

18
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,760
Why is he hugging me so tightly?

19
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,900
Slowly now, can’t wake him up.

20
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,069
Maybe I should just push him away by force.

21
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,569
Who cares if he wakes up.

22
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,699
One…

23
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,160
Two…

24
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,059
This is a nightmare!

25
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,900
Wake up already!

26
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,650
I can’t believe this.

27
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,950
That wasn’t considered a cuddle, right?

28
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,950
Cuddles are supposed to be mutual.

29
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,160
I didn’t want it, so it wasn’t mutual.

30
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,290
What’s important is
that it’s not a big deal.

31
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,709
You were asleep. How could you have known?

32
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,880
I don’t think he’ll remember
it when he wakes up anyway.

33
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,550
How was your sleep?

34
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,190
Looks like you slept well.

35
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,149
Why?

36
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,530
Because I still look gorgeous
even when I just woke up?

37
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,950
Wow!

38
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,030
Wow.

39
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,700
Ow!

40
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,650
Ouch!

41
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,460
My arm hurts.

42
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,800
You like cuddles after all.

43
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,349
What are you talking about?

44
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,930
Stop denying it.

45
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,980
You were even pulling my arm.

46
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,940
You were awake?

47
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,510
No.

48
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,840
I woke up because you kept moving around.

49
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,520
I thought I had a girlfriend
for a second, you softie.

50
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,310
Girlfriend?

51
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,060
Softie?

52
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,730
Yes, softie.

53
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,690
You’re quite hard at night...

54
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,490
But you’re really soft in the morning.

55
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,320
Softie…

56
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,910
Really?

57
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,450
Yes. Am I wrong?

58
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,100
Lie down.

59
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
What?

60
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,990
Take it off.

61
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,250
Why?

62
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:44,170
We’ll see if I really am a softie.

63
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,470
Hey!

64
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,059
Girl, you’re glowing!

65
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,060
Always, what’s new?

66
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,440
I mean, I think you really
enjoyed your trip with Hiro.

67
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,730
How was it?

68
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,940
It was fun.

69
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,649
Why do you look so giddy?

70
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,699
No way!

71
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,409
It was fun ‘cause it was wild.

72
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,870
We were really wild...

73
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,369
He actually called me a softie.

74
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,959
So I showed him who he’s dealing with.

75
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,790
Why did he call you a softie?

76
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,920
Maybe you did something that
made you look like a softie?

77
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,970
No!

78
00:07:38,971 --> 00:07:40,020
Nothing!

79
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,440
Seems like you’re with Hiro a lot.

80
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,440
Let me remind you.

81
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,270
Take your pills on time.

82
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,610
Of course.

83
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,820
Serious question.

84
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,070
Are you sure you’re
just fuck buddies with him?

85
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,700
Huh? Why’d you ask?

86
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,540
Nothing, it’s just that...

87
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,959
You might fall for him and I
don’t want you getting hurt.

88
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,580
Of course not!

89
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,380
I never even fell for my past flings.

90
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,089
I don’t think you’re really my best friend.

91
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:11,880
That’s exactly it!

92
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:14,890
I’m your best friend
so I can see it clearer.

93
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,050
It’s just that…

94
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,639
I think there’s something
different with how you care for him

95
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,889
and talk about him
compared to your ex-flings.

96
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,690
You might be falling for him
but he thinks this is just a game.

97
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,439
Don’t worry.

98
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,279
He has an expiration date, remember?

99
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,990
Hiro’s leaving.

100
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,570
We’ll be done on or before that date.

101
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,780
Yanna, promise me,

102
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,749
if you start to catch any weird feelings,

103
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,290
you’ll stop this.

104
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,579
Unless, you want to try
having a serious relationship–

105
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,630
That won’t happen! I’m sure of it.

106
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,050
Fine.

107
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:54,720
To ease your mind, fine, I’ll stop.

108
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,640
Happy now?

109
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,890
What should I get? What did you order?

110
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,270
Is that Hiro?

111
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,060
Who’s with him?

112
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,070
I don’t know.

113
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,830
Maybe his friend.

114
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,370
I’m not familiar with her.

115
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,590
I’ll just go to the bathroom.

116
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,180
Yes, I’m with Hiro right now.

117
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,310
You know him! Hiro Juarez from Mech Eng.

118
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,030
Yes, we're on a date... I think.

119
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,990
Right! I really missed him.

120
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,200
I think we're going to his condo after.

121
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,580
Can't wait! I'm so ready for him!

122
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,920
I hope he has condoms though.

123
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:16,209
That bastard. How could he break our deal?

124
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,630
Has he been making a fool out of me?

125
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Yanna!

126
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:28,770
- You’re here— - Hey!

127
00:10:28,771 --> 00:10:30,059
You’re here, too.

128
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,110
Your companion’s still inside, she’s
excited to have sex with you later.

129
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,650
What are you saying?

130
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:36,860
She’s still inside.

131
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,990
I’m not a stalker, okay? I just heard her.

132
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,909
What— Wait...

133
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,780
What do you mean?

134
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:44,239
It’s unfair.

135
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,120
I’ve been following our agreement, okay?

136
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,419
If you want to have sex
with someone else, tell me.

137
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,420
It’s fine, it’s not a problem.

138
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,089
If this is how it’s going
to be, let’s just stop.

139
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,010
There’s no sense of us being
exclusive fuck buddies anymore.

140
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,720
I wanna taste other guys, too.

141
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,260
Yanna, let...

142
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:04,810
Let me ex...

143
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,019
Hiro?

144
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,560
Are you waiting for me?

145
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,439
Sam, let’s go.

146
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Why?

147
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,690
We’re leaving.

148
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,240
Why? What happened?

149
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,860
Let’s just go.

150
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
Hey!
Hey, what happened?

151
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,950
Why are we in a hurry?

152
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:29,830
What ha...

153
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:30,869
Were you slapped or something?

154
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,330
Do you want me to go back?

155
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:33,880
No, it’s nothing. No one was slapped.

156
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,090
So what? Is it because of Hiro?

157
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,920
So it is because of Hiro.

158
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,219
Are you jealous right now?

159
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,349
The hell! Why would I be jealous?

160
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,679
I don’t know either.
What’s with your reaction?

161
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,309
I heard that woman.

162
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,810
They were gonna have sex.

163
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,400
I’m not jealous. I’m pissed.

164
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,399
So what? You guys aren’t...

165
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,189
What do you mean, so
what? That’s unfair, Sam.

166
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,149
We’re exclusive fuck buddies.

167
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:04,909
I may not be good with English,
but I know what exclusive means.

168
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,909
It’s not even a problem.

169
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,039
But he should have told me at least.

170
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,520
What if she has some kind of disease?

171
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,120
That would affect me, too.

172
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,210
Right?

173
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,880
You talked to him about it?

174
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,040
Yes, I told him we should just stop.

175
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,420
Forget about being fuck buddies?

176
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,420
Are you sure?

177
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,810
Take care, all of you.

178
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,320
See you guys after this semester break.

179
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,899
Hey! You two are such a sweet couple.

180
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,609
Too sweet to handle.

181
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,199
My baby just loves me so much.

182
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,369
They are so in love.

183
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,620
Hey, bro. Let’s go?

184
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,659
We’re gonna go ahead, okay?

185
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,039
All right. We’ll be going, too.

186
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,436
Via and I will go together.
- Hey! Thanks! - Okay!

187
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,460
- Bye-bye! - Bye!

188
00:12:55,461 --> 00:12:56,960
- Be careful! - Bye.

189
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,879
Hey Yanna, I need to go now.

190
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,089
Take care, okay?

191
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,550
Okay, be careful.

192
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,130
All right, bye.

193
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,220
HIRO: Can we talk?

194
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,850
HIRO: Are you sure about what you said?

195
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,270
HIRO: Is that what you want?

196
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,529
YANNA: I just want this to be fair.

197
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:33,330
HIRO: You didn't answer my
question. Is that what you want?

198
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,890
YANNA: Yes. That’s what I want.

199
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,139
Just come with us.

200
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,310
Yes, let's go.

201
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,230
I really don’t wanna go. Don’t bother.

202
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,569
I’m not in the mood to drink.

203
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,989
Why aren’t you in the mood?

204
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,570
Stop bugging me!

205
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:08,200
Are you heart-broken?

206
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,279
I see now…

207
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,030
Jeez.

208
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:12,989
We’re not really gonna drink there.

209
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,499
Besides, it’s not just some party.

210
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,290
It’s a Halloween party.

211
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,829
And not just any other Halloween party…

212
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,419
It’s a Halloween pool party!

213
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,419
We’re both ready now.

214
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,679
Hurry!

215
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,219
Come on.

216
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,850
I don’t wanna! Just stop!

217
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:37,519
Even if it’s in Maldives or
Bali, I really don’t wanna go.

218
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,559
You’re such a party pooper.

219
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,859
You’re not gonna be doing
anything in Laguna anyway.

220
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,060
So just come with us.

221
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,270
Yes.

222
00:14:44,271 --> 00:14:48,029
Besides, you’ll be staying
there for a while during our break.

223
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,200
So let’s bond with each other!

224
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,369
Will there be a lot of hot guys?

225
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:54,870
Duh.

226
00:14:54,871 --> 00:14:56,659
- Hotties would be swarming there!
- For real!

227
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,999
I won’t be disappointed?

228
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,579
- Not at all! - You won’t be disappointed.

229
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,670
Fine.

230
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,440
But wait, I have a problem…

231
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,630
Isn’t it a Halloween party?

232
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,380
I don’t have a costume.

233
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,570
Don’t worry.

234
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:15,970
I’ve figured you out so
I have one ready for you.

235
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,559
- Here you go. - Wow!

236
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,689
- So pretty. It suits you!
- This will suit you.

237
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,970
- We’ll also fix your hair.
- We’ll put this here.

238
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,980
Am I cosplaying as a curtain? What is this?

239
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,610
Those are ruffles, silly!

240
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,010
If I don’t see any hot guys later...

241
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,440
Hi, you're here.

242
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,530
Later let's play beer pong.

243
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,376
I thought there were
gonna be a lot of hotties?

244
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,200
Well, it’s still early.

245
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,990
Just look around. You’ll see one later.

246
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,080
Exactly, look around.

247
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,160
Bro...

248
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,580
Right?

249
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,750
Pass. Not my type.

250
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,210
He’s okay...

251
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,630
Maybe not.

252
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,679
He looks sweet.

253
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,680
Cute...

254
00:16:34,681 --> 00:16:36,760
but not for me.

255
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,029
Can you feed me?

256
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,490
- Huh? - Feed me.

257
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,410
You want this?

258
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,999
Lasagna.

259
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,659
Lasagna, okay. Okay!

260
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,580
Again?

261
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:06,250
Again, yes.

262
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,130
It’s good.

263
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:12,800
- Delicious? - It’s actually delicious.

264
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,010
You wanna try?
Sure.

265
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,130
Hey!
Try a little bite.

266
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,590
That’s not a little bite.

267
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,649
It’s so hot!

268
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,239
Let’s just cheers, guys!

269
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,699
- Wow! - Cheers to this.

270
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,120
Wow!

271
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:40,909
- Cheers, cheers! - So sexy!

272
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,199
Cheers, everyone! Happy Halloween!

273
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,119
Happy Halloween!

274
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,710
Wait a minute!

275
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:46,869
We’ve run out of drinks. Let’s go get more.

276
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,169
Come on!

277
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,170
Bro.
Get some shots, bro.

278
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,460
I said wait.

279
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,800
Wait for us.

280
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,089
I’m just observing your face at this point.

281
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:55,840
Wow.

282
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,180
Just saying.

283
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,390
So noisy.

284
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,720
Kiss me.

285
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,309
Yanna, wait.

286
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,650
Before we kiss...

287
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,820
I just wanna say something.

288
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,860
We’ve been friends for so long, right?

289
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,740
And I’m already getting tired
of us staying the way we are.

290
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,000
Maybe we can be more than just friends?

291
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,080
Chris…

292
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,459
You know I don’t do
serious relationships, right?

293
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,420
I like you.

294
00:18:31,421 --> 00:18:33,880
I really like you, Yanna.

295
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,090
After what we did at the club,

296
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,470
I can’t just forget about you, you know?

297
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,680
I keep remembering the touch of your
lips on mine every night, before I sleep.

298
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,310
Chris…

299
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,980
I’m sorry.

300
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,570
I don’t like you.

301
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,110
You know I just see you as a friend, right?

302
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,029
We’re pals.

303
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,029
Okay? That’s all we’re gonna be.

304
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,279
Don’t I have a chance with you?

305
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:04,910
Even for a little bit?

306
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:06,410
Don’t you feel anything for me?

307
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,119
Nothing.

308
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,210
I’m sorry.

309
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,619
Look, sorry. I have to go.

310
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,620
Okay.

311
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,299
Fuck! Then why did you kiss me?

312
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,670
Why were you holding my hand?

313
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,009
Was that all nothing? Nothing...

314
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,219
What the fuck?

315
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,340
I’m sorry, Chris.

316
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,890
I thought you understood.

317
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:24,930
But...

318
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,680
I’m sorry I wasn’t clear about it.

319
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,480
What are you doing here?

320
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,990
It’s loud in there.

321
00:20:20,991 --> 00:20:22,530
I’m not enjoying either.

322
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,660
Sorry, do you wanna be alone?

323
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,040
- I’ll leave— - No.

324
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,880
You can stay if you want.

325
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,100
Are you okay?

326
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,560
I’m kinda pissed.

327
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,600
My friend confessed his feelings for me.

328
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,110
I never thought he would.

329
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,190
He just suddenly said it.

330
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,730
Am I wrong?

331
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,700
Did I lead him on?

332
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,490
How is that your fault?

333
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,370
I don’t know.

334
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,370
I can’t blame them though…

335
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,870
if they develop feelings.

336
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,290
It can’t be helped.

337
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:22,290
It’s normal to develop
feelings for someone.

338
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,890
How about you?

339
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,310
How are you and Giselle?

340
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,100
We’re fine.

341
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,810
We’re friends so we’re still hanging out.

342
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,560
But that’s about it.

343
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,570
And Elyse?

344
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,030
You have a lot of girls, huh?

345
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,280
A lot of girls?

346
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,530
Elyse?

347
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,330
She’s just 17.

348
00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:00,250
And she’s Shan’s younger sister.

349
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,210
So she’s like a little sister to me.

350
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,170
Shan?

351
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:07,550
She’s Shan’s sister?

352
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,350
Yes. You didn’t know?

353
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,260
Well…

354
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,850
I do know she has a little crush on me.

355
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,520
And just to be clear…

356
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,030
I never had sex with anyone.

357
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,240
I respect our exclusivity deal until now.

358
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,790
And last time...

359
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:39,040
I’m not your girlfriend so you
don’t have to explain that much.

360
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,670
Okay.

361
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,220
Our break’s coming soon. What’s your plan?

362
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,180
I’ll be going home to Laguna.

363
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,439
All right, I’m going now since
I’m not in the mood to party anymore

364
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,109
and I have to catch the last ride.

365
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,230
Enjoy!

366
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,340
I didn’t know you were here.

367
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,680
Gosh, I got tired with all the shopping.

368
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,510
I have something for you.

369
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:38,020
This is for you. Use
it when you go on dates.

370
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,939
I still have a lot of bags
and clothes at the dormitory.

371
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,980
Besides...

372
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,190
I don’t go on dates.

373
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,200
Did you just arrive a while ago?

374
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,650
I arrived last night.

375
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,280
You weren’t home.

376
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,829
Please, Yanna.

377
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,449
Can’t you at least send me a text
message that you’ll be coming home

378
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:02,120
so that I know that you’ll be here?

379
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,330
What for? I’m used to it.

380
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,049
I go to work so that I can
pay for your tuition fees.

381
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,920
I’m working so hard so
that I can provide for us.

382
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,340
You know this. You know
I’m not doing anything wrong.

383
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,050
You should know it by now!

384
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,710
HIRO: You good there?

385
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,630
YANNA: So far.

386
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,100
HIRO: Send your location.

387
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,269
Maybe he'll send me food here.

388
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,810
I won’t say no to that.

389
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,080
Hi.

390
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,500
Hiro!

391
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,000
What are you doing here?

392
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,630
Good morning.

393
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,050
I felt like driving down here and

394
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,220
go for a nature trip.

395
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,839
Were you waiting long?

396
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,299
No! He just arrived.

397
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,179
I was actually wondering who this
handsome boy was, knocking on our gate.

398
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,730
He said that he’s your friend.

399
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,599
Aunty, this is Hiro.

400
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,309
Hiro, this is Aunty Isabel.

401
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,310
Hi!

402
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,350
Why?

403
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,290
- I didn’t realize we had a visitor. - Yes.

404
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,659
Ma, this is Hiro.

405
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,079
- Hi! - My friend.

406
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,760
- Hi! - Hi, Ma!

407
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,170
Good morning.

408
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,169
Come, eat with us.

409
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,170
Come on.

410
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,839
Have a seat.

411
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,850
Go get another plate inside.

412
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,350
I brought you something.

413
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:23,930
Thank you.

414
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:25,470
- Sit down. - Have a seat.

415
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,640
Don’t be shy.

416
00:26:26,641 --> 00:26:29,560
I apologize, but our house is quite small.

417
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,560
It’s beautiful.

418
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,690
- Thank you. - Thanks.

419
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,780
Thank you so much for the compliment.

420
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,490
Go ahead and eat.

421
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,910
How did you and Yanna meet?

422
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,589
Yanna…

423
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,300
Will you be my fuck buddy?

424
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:57,510
There’s no strings attached,
so no feelings are involved.

425
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,510
We have a mutual friend.

426
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,759
- Yes— - Who?

427
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,760
- Sam— - Who?
It’s Sam.

428
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:03,430
It’s...

429
00:27:03,431 --> 00:27:05,010
Sam!

430
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,470
Okay.

431
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,559
Next time, bring Sam, too.

432
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,599
Yes, bring her here.

433
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,439
And let me know in advance so that
I can ask for permission at work.

434
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,479
- Yes, she’ll be asking for a leave.
- We’ll cook for you.

435
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,650
- Right? - Yes, we’ll both cook.

436
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,950
If I may ask, Aunty...

437
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,990
What do you do for work?

438
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,119
I’m a waitress. Night shift.

439
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,629
I'm usually tired in the morning,

440
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:35,340
so I just catch up on sleep.

441
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,550
That’s why sometimes, Yanna
and I don’t get to see each other.

442
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,719
Your job is quite difficult.

443
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
Yes!

444
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,850
Thank you for taking time now.

445
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,690
I really appreciate it.

446
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,610
Thank you for visiting Yanna, too.

447
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,650
This is fun.

448
00:27:58,651 --> 00:28:00,359
- Yes, so fun. - Go ahead and eat.

449
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,450
Eat up.

450
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,450
Have some more.

451
00:28:02,451 --> 00:28:04,216
- This is too much.
- Give him some sinigang.

452
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,200
I’m on a diet so I’ll just have a banana.

453
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,539
- This is my favorite.
- Just keep eating, okay?

454
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,199
This is Yanna’s favorite, by the way.

455
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,330
This menudo and sinigang.

456
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,040
Mechado is my favorite.

457
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,590
I’m sorry…

458
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,590
Mechado.

459
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,089
I also confuse the two.

460
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,300
- You too? - The mechado and the menudo.

461
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,009
Don’t worry, me too.

462
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,600
I am so confused about what’s
going on with both of you.

463
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,270
I’m just saying what I feel.

464
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,720
Can I take some of these home?

465
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,740
It feels so comforting
to eat home-cooked meals.

466
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,530
Of course.

467
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,659
Is this your favorite, too?

468
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,450
- Yes. - Sure.

469
00:28:48,451 --> 00:28:49,539
We cooked a lot.

470
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,000
Yes, sure.

471
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,080
Go ahead and eat, don’t be shy.

472
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,250
Give them some sinigang.

473
00:28:55,251 --> 00:28:56,380
I will.

474
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,140
My daughter is beautiful, right?

475
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,170
You know where she gets it from.

476
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,030
I can see that, Aunty.

477
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,620
This was...

478
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,940
When she was three years old.

479
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,380
We really had a lot of visitors then.

480
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,120
Come on, Ma!

481
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:20,040
Why did you have to show those?

482
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,520
I’m really ugly back then.

483
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,720
You look cute.

484
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,210
I’m just showing it to your boyfriend.

485
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,390
Boyfriend?

486
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,640
He’s not my boyfriend.

487
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,830
He’s not?

488
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,860
Yes.

489
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,480
You guys seem like a couple, though.

490
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,690
Aren’t you pursuing my daughter?

491
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,930
- I’m not. - He’s not.

492
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,820
We’re just friends.

493
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,110
How about this, Aunty?

494
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,950
The small one.

495
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,110
This...

496
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,050
When was this?

497
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,330
This one.

498
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,020
What was...

499
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,640
When was this, Yanna?

500
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,660
- I can’t remember. - That was in school.

501
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,430
I was in Kindergarten.

502
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,330
Celebrating family day.

503
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,850
Fam...

504
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:14,220
I see, I’m sorry. I wasn’t
there that time, right?

505
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,490
I had overtime work back then.

506
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,310
I’m sorry, my dear.

507
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,290
Can I...

508
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,230
Can I keep this photo, Aunty?

509
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,360
Go ahead, we have copies of it.

510
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,620
- Thank you. - You can have it.

511
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,150
To repel bad luck.

512
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,170
Wow!

513
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,010
Don’t you mean, to attract good luck?

514
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,200
Will you be using this for voodoo?

515
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,230
I was joking.

516
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,500
Hiro...

517
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,510
Have you gone around Laguna yet?

518
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:41,380
Not yet. Where would you recommend?

519
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,740
A lot!

520
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,180
- Right? - There’s a lot to go to.

521
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,250
Hey, Yanna!

522
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,120
If I were you, I’d tour Hiro around here.

523
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:52,130
I know a place where you can go.

524
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,680
What?

525
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,540
What’s with that getup?

526
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,780
Wanna wear a cap?

527
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,310
You didn't tell me that we were going here.

528
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,790
I didn’t know that we were going, either.

529
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,820
Wow.

530
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,110
But you look really prepared.

531
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,930
I have clothes at home, of course.

532
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,210
Better luck to your
expensive white shoes, though.

533
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,600
Wow!

534
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,110
You’re too slow.

535
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,910
Well, be careful.

536
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,880
Take care of your white shoes.

537
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,060
Need help?

538
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,190
I’m good.

539
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,580
You might slip.

540
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,880
You okay?

541
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,140
Awesome!

542
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,670
You might slip!

543
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,510
Nice shoes!

544
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,430
Dirty white.

545
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,920
What? It looks fine.

546
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,220
It’s a limited edition.

547
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,810
I’ll get this. What do you want?

548
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,830
Anything.
Anything…

549
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,680
Really?

550
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,390
An airplane! Hurry, make a wish.

551
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,210
Huh? Isn’t that for shooting stars?

552
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,250
Can you only make a wish on shooting stars?

553
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,900
Don’t bother if you don’t wanna.

554
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,150
I wish…

555
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,520
that I’ll become a flight attendant.

556
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:03,960
A beautiful and
successful flight attendant.

557
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,420
I wish…

558
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:15,300
I’ll be an international commercial pilot.

559
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,540
What’s with the whisper?

560
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,200
What did you whisper about?

561
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,950
I just added one more wish.

562
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,770
There’s no limit, right?

563
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,440
No.

564
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,900
What was your other wish?

565
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,790
You should shout it out.

566
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:45,190
Maybe you wished that I wouldn't
become a flight attendant.

567
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,220
No!

568
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:48,870
I wished…

569
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,400
that we’ll fly together someday.

570
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,240
I’ll be the pilot

571
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,950
and you’ll be my flight attendant.

572
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,070
That won’t happen.

573
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,950
It will.

574
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,870
Trust me.

575
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,670
I wished for it.

576
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,910
And wishes do come true.

577
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,480
After our deal,

578
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,570
you’ll be leaving the Philippines.

579
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,900
We’ll forget about each other.

580
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,760
Besides, it’s impossible.

581
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:35,200
You’ll be in international airlines
while I’ll be in local airlines.

582
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,370
We’ll stay as friends

583
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:41,350
and keep in touch.

584
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,970
We can still use social media, right?

585
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,440
Yes.

586
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,510
But we might not contact each other
then. And we’ll be back to strangers.

587
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,560
I won’t forget you.

588
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,040
Ever!

589
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,970
And you won’t forget me.

590
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,130
Wanna bet?

591
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,290
You want to make a bet?

592
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,580
The last one to reach the
falls will treat the other!

593
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,670
Thank you!

594
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,660
That was fun.

595
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,930
MOM: I will be in
Singapore for work tonight.

596
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,010
HIRO: Ok. Mom, TC.

597
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,410
Your mom?

598
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,200
Is she telling you to go back home?

599
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,130
No.

600
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,080
She told me that she'll be
in Singapore for work tonight.

601
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:33,690
It's nice that you get to spend
more time with your mom now.

602
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,800
Not really.

603
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,830
She just happened to be at home today.

604
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,470
By the way, sorry about
the awkward scenario earlier.

605
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,000
It's fine.

606
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
But...

607
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,400
Does your mom actually work as a waitress?

608
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,960
She’s a model for adult films.

609
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,330
Sometimes for magazines.

610
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,660
You might have seen her already.

611
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,680
No.

612
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,990
I was bullied before because of it.

613
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:21,320
Your mother is a porn star.

614
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:27,180
I saw your mother naked in a magazine.

615
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,600
I do understand why she did it.

616
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,990
It’s hard to take care of a
child, especially as a single parent.

617
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,690
It just hurts that,

618
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:47,390
she couldn’t protect me from the bullies.

619
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:55,370
Since she’s always away, at work.

620
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:02,360
That’s why I learned to protect myself.

621
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,200
Maybe your mom,

622
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:14,640
sees you as a strong independent
person who can take care of yourself.

623
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,860
I think she knows that
you can handle yourself.

624
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,840
At that young age?

625
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,060
I don’t know.

626
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:29,830
It would be nice to have
a mother I can talk to.

627
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,970
Someone I can tell my secrets.

628
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,350
Someone I can run to
whenever I have a problem.

629
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:45,910
Someone I can reach out
to when I’m being bullied.

630
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:55,260
You know what Yanna, I think she's trying.

631
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,660
Give her a chance.

632
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,420
Give each other a chance.

633
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,660
I know, I’m not-

634
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:07,930
I’m not in the place to say this, but
in the short time I stayed with you...

635
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,250
I can feel that you love each other.

636
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,700
Of course.

637
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,850
I love her.

638
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,290
And you know she loves you too.

639
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,340
I like this version of you.

640
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,720
You're different when you're here.

641
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,190
I guess because no one's around,
you don't have this facade.

642
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,250
Facade.

643
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,900
You're just being you.

644
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,940
Just be yourself.

645
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,090
Thank you for trusting me.

646
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,070
Thanks for listening.

647
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,500
Good...

648
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,570
Thank you for welcoming me to your home.

649
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,720
I really enjoyed my stay.

650
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,800
When you go back to Manila,

651
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,700
tell me.

652
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,220
I’ll treat you to dinner, okay?

653
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,630
For what?

654
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:20,160
Just to thank you.

655
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,450
I wanna make it up to you.

656
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,540
Okay, then. Go now, you
might get stuck in traffic.

657
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:32,900
Can you please tell your mom and Tita,

658
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:35,710
thank you.

659
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,190
For the food and everything.

660
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,860
All right, I’ll let them know.

661
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,730
Go already, you don’t want to be
stuck in traffic. Where did you park?

662
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,990
Over there. Just a quick walk.

663
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,490
So, I'll see you in Manila?

664
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,210
Thanks.

665
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,240
Bye!

666
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:39,620
Bye.

667
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:14,960
Yanna, I’m happy that
you have a new friend.

668
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,490
But please, be careful, okay?

669
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,040
I don’t want you to end up like me.

670
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,480
Yes, Ma.

671
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:25,530
Finish your studies first, okay?

672
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,520
Why did you suddenly return to Manila?

673
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:51,340
I feel like if I stayed any
longer, Mama and I would just fight.

674
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:56,470
Really now? Or is it because
Hiro’s back in Manila?

675
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,700
I know he visited you.

676
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,600
I saw it in his IG stories.

677
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,820
Huh?

678
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:05,600
I thought he doesn’t like to post?

679
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,550
Go see for yourself.

680
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,920
Thank you.

681
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:38,510
Hey!

682
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,420
Are you feeling giddy?

683
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:44,360
Bitch, no! It’s just that I
look so gorgeous in the video.

684
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,910
- We’ve talked about this, Yanna.
- Give me that.

685
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:51,230
You’re a big girl. You
should know what you’re doing.

686
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:53,580
Of course.

687
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,180
Just eat already.

688
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,670
What is this feeling?

689
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,390
It’s my first time feeling this way.

690
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:29,580
I don’t get it. I’m so confused.

691
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:35,050
All I know is that I’m
happy whenever I’m with Hiro.

692
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:52,760
HIRO: I'll see you at the restaurant.
I just need to go somewhere in a bit.

693
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,740
YANNA: Okay. See you.

694
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:07,110
Right this way, ma’am.

695
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,510
Thank you.

696
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:16,330
Thank you.

697
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,350
Your meals have been pre-ordered, ma’am.

698
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,990
Should I have them served?

699
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:24,460
Maybe later. I’m still waiting for someone.

700
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:25,990
- Okay. - Thank you.

701
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:03,750
YANNA: Are you on your
way? I’m getting hungry.

702
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,610
Here's your wine, ma'am.

703
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:18,440
Thank you.

704
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,270
Your food is ready, ma’am.

705
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:21,840
Should we start serving?

706
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,700
I think my companion is on the way.

707
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:28,086
Serve it later so that the
food is still hot when he arrives.

708
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:30,050
- Okay, ma’am. - Thank you.

709
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,020
I’m sorry, ma’am.

710
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:51,020
Our kitchen is closing.

711
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,300
We will have to serve your order.

712
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,060
Is that so?

713
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,720
Let me just make a call.

714
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,760
Hello, Hiro?

715
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:09,470
Are you almost here?

716
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:15,130
I’m sorry, Yanna. My phone
died earlier so I couldn't reply.

717
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:19,870
I still can’t leave because
Giselle has an emergency.

718
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:22,730
She needs me right now.

719
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,890
I see.

720
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:30,890
Okay then.

721
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:38,090
Just wrap the food to go.

722
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:40,620
My companion won’t be coming.

723
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,010
All right, ma’am.

724
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:59,110
It’s best to get out of the
deal before it’s too late.

725
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,470
I’m worried that you’ll get hurt even more.

726
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,170
I don’t want to.

727
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:04,650
I just need to strictly follow our rules.

728
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,430
Going on a quick Tokyo trip next weekend.

729
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:07,160
Perfect!

730
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:08,650
Is this your first time going to Japan?

731
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:12,300
Can I interview you for my project?

732
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:14,120
After my trip, I’m good for an interview.

733
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,350
That would be too late.

734
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:16,550
Shan!

735
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,370
Yanna!

736
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:20,560
Can I interview you right
now? It’s for my project.

737
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:21,250
I can’t.

738
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,570
Do you know anyone that I can interview?

739
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,640
Me.

740
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:30,040
Never have I ever denied or
concealed my feelings for my friend.
