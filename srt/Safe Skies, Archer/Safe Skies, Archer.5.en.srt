1
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,609
Yanna, promise me, if you start
to catch any weird feelings,

2
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,079
you’ll stop this.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,809
Fine, I’ll stop.

4
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,580
This is for you. Use
it when you go on dates.

5
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,410
I don’t go on dates.

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,279
Ma, this is Hiro my friend.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,879
Hiro— have you gone around Laguna yet?

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,909
If I were you, I’d tour Hiro around here.

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,179
Yanna, I think she's
trying. Give her a chance.

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,450
Thanks for listening.

11
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,309
It’s my first time feeling this way.

12
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,009
All I know is that I’m
happy whenever I’m with Hiro.

13
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,679
Giselle has an emergency.

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,250
She needs me right now.

15
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,350
Should we buy another tub of ice cream?

16
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,050
Fuck all this.

17
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,250
Ice cream and alcohol?

18
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,950
If it comforts you then why not?

19
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,210
Shit, is this really happening to me?

20
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,050
I’m falling apart because of that guy?

21
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,649
I even promised myself
that I would never cry!

22
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,450
I promised myself to never cry for a guy!

23
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,480
But look at me now.

24
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,950
This is so annoying.

25
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,580
It happens.

26
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,580
You’re human. Don’t
be too hard on yourself.

27
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,910
So what’s your plan about Hiro?

28
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,549
He’s leaving in a few months.

29
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,050
Long-distance relationships
are not for everyone.

30
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,310
Is that something you can handle?

31
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,310
Before I even think about

32
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,250
handling long-distance relationships…

33
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,810
Does Hiro even like me?

34
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,150
Do you feel that he likes you?

35
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
Honestly,

36
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,210
I don’t know.

37
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,410
There are times that I think

38
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,210
he likes me too.

39
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,450
That fucker is too sweet and caring.

40
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,780
At the same time,

41
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,810
I’m guessing that’s just the way he is.

42
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,610
Also, maybe he’s being sweet because

43
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,550
we’re fuck buddies.

44
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,580
Yanna, I know it’s hard,

45
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,350
but it’s best to get out of
the deal before it’s too late.

46
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,250
I’m worried that you’ll get hurt even more.

47
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,550
I don’t want to, Sam.

48
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,349
If I quit the deal,

49
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,380
it would feel like I’m
giving in to what I feel.

50
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,580
Besides, he’s leaving soon.

51
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,950
I’m just gonna enjoy us being fuck buddies.

52
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,050
I’m going to strictly follow

53
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,950
our rules.

54
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,750
I’ll meet Hiro just for sex.

55
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,150
No other reasons.

56
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,410
Are you sure about that?

57
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,250
You’re playing a dangerous game, Yanna.

58
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,250
Aren’t we just fuck buddies?

59
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,850
Why do I have a lot of
photos of you on my phone?

60
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,050
Do you feel that he likes you?

61
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,810
Don’t get your hopes up, girl.

62
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,110
How to flirt responsibly.
Rule number seven.

63
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,680
Take no pictures. Leave no footprints.

64
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,280
Don’t save photos and videos of the person

65
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,809
you’re hooking up with.

66
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:32,150
There’s no point
reminiscing on a vague memory.

67
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,950
HIRO: Yanna, I'm really sorry I
wasn't able to meet you tonight.

68
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,810
Are you home? I hope you're not mad at me.

69
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,210
Why? Do I even have the right to get mad?

70
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,280
YANNA: It’s fine, no worries!

71
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,610
Last flirt responsibly rule

72
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,750
Don’t be an idiot. Idiocy can kill.

73
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,079
I just hope— Not that I’m bragging,

74
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,810
but we finally have a couple’s photo.

75
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,570
I hope you guys can have one, too.

76
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,209
You’re becoming more
and more annoying, Luna.

77
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,479
I’m sick of it.

78
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,350
Too corny, let’s just go already.

79
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,710
I’m kinda annoyed and jealous.

80
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,550
When would I have one?

81
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,110
Hey guys! What’s up?

82
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,850
Hey!

83
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,449
Did you just go on a shopping spree?

84
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,849
Yes, I did! Going on a
quick Tokyo trip this weekend.

85
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,179
So, since it’s autumn there right now,

86
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,579
I bought a few jackets.

87
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,979
Hey, perfect timing! Is this
your first time going to Japan?

88
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,949
Can I interview you for my project?

89
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,009
Sorry Yanna,

90
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,309
but it’s going to be my
firs time traveling to Japan.

91
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,610
But after my trip, I’m
good for an interview.

92
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,080
That would be too late. Our
deadline is two days from now.

93
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,660
How about you Luna? Are you free tomorrow?

94
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,649
Tomorrow...

95
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,079
I still need to finish some of my plates.

96
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,409
Maybe some other day?

97
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,049
I’d run out of time,

98
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,090
since I still need to
create a presentation for it.

99
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,710
What about you, are you free?

100
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,080
I can’t. I have a group meeting tonight.

101
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,350
Let’s go?

102
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,880
-Come on. -I’ll go ahead.

103
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,009
Bye!

104
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,349
Take care!

105
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,810
- He should take care. - Bye, guys!

106
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,250
-Be careful! -Take care, guys!

107
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,550
I can’t handle them!

108
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,649
You, Sam?

109
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,410
Girl, haven’t I told you already?

110
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,780
Oh yeah, I forgot.

111
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,550
I would love to help you.
But I haven’t been to Japan.

112
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,349
Me too.

113
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,350
It’s okay.

114
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,949
I know a lot of people I can chat with.

115
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,649
Why are you doing that just now?

116
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,350
Got busy with your sex life, huh?

117
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,050
Stop it.

118
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,610
HIRO: Hi Yanna. Are you free tonight?

119
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,279
That’s enough, girls.

120
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,650
Whatever! Just keep eating.

121
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,180
At least these two are done.

122
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,050
Wait! I had a fuck buddy who
went to Japan for vacation.

123
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,380
Maybe I can interview him?

124
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:42,279
FRANCIS: I miss you. I
remember our wild night together.

125
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,810
FRANCIS: Wanna hang out? Another fun time.

126
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,749
YANNA: Hi Frans, sorry for replying late.

127
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,010
How are you? You free tomorrow?
I wanted to ask for a favor.

128
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,710
Why do I feel guilty?

129
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,850
I’m not doing anything wrong.

130
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,680
We’re not even a couple.

131
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,610
HIRO: Hi again Yanna. Are you busy?

132
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,149
We’re not giving in today, Yanna.

133
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,410
Nothing good comes
from being fickle-minded.

134
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,079
Hey, Shan!

135
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,309
Yanna, you’re here!

136
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,310
-Hi! -What’s up?

137
00:11:47,311 --> 00:11:50,979
Hey, congratulations! You’re
the chosen one that would help me.

138
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,480
Have you been to Japan?

139
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,510
Yes, why?

140
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,749
Can I interview you
right now? Pretty please!

141
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,349
It’s for my project.

142
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,909
I need to create a presentation
about Japanese tourism.

143
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,549
Pretty please?

144
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,550
I’ll treat you to— yogurt?

145
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,979
Don’t think about it too much.

146
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,009
You’ll be the savior of my grades. Please!

147
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,909
Yanna, sorry. As much as I wanna help you,

148
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,049
I can’t.

149
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,750
I’m about to go on an out of town trip.

150
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,779
Okay, then.

151
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,049
Maybe you know someone
else that has been to Japan,

152
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,880
that I can interview today?

153
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,810
Japan?

154
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,850
What’s up?

155
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,650
Here’s the guy I’ve
been waiting for. Let’s go?

156
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,480
What’s up?

157
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,409
Bro, Yanna needs help.

158
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,979
She needs someone to
interview for her project.

159
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,749
Someone who has been to Japan.

160
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,750
Me.

161
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,079
I think she needs the
interview done right now.

162
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,450
Me.

163
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,610
Weren’t you about to leave?

164
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,080
I can catch up with them.

165
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,650
Right! Yes, he can just follow later.

166
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,849
Well… All good?

167
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,849
-But… -It’s fine, Yanna.

168
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,649
Have Hiro help you.

169
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,180
He knows a lot about Japan.

170
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,410
Anyway, I’ll go ahead. Enjoy.

171
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,450
Well, this is embarrassing.

172
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,980
It’s fine.

173
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,349
You know what, Yanna...

174
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,610
I’ll always make time for you.

175
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,379
Jeez, such a sweet talker.

176
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,080
So what do I have to do?

177
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,809
You’re gonna be naked
in front of the camera.

178
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,450
Sure!

179
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,350
Seriously, Hiro…

180
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,980
Anything for you, Yanna.

181
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,150
Hold on, Yanna. You can’t give in.

182
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,979
Sorry for bothering you with this.

183
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,280
The restaurant was fine, though.

184
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
It’s fine.

185
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,910
You’ll get better audio here.

186
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,650
Why did you agree to go to his condo?

187
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,580
This is gonna be hard…

188
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,580
I’ll have to start all over again.

189
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,480
You done?

190
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,550
Yes, just setting up...

191
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,550
Here.

192
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,110
I found photos from my
previous trip to Japan.

193
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,310
You can use it for your project.

194
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:55,409
So, aside from the typical Osaka and Tokyo,

195
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,779
I also love exploring other places in Japan

196
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,910
that aren’t tourist traps.

197
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,450
Like this.

198
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,079
Nagano. Best place for hot springs.

199
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,910
And… There! Hiroshima and Izu.

200
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,750
Very laid back and peaceful.

201
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
Wow!

202
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,550
It’s so beautiful.

203
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,780
I really want to go to Japan.

204
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,980
We can go there someday.

205
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,580
When I’m a pilot and
you’re a flight attendant.

206
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,610
Sure!

207
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,750
We can go there…

208
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,080
as friends.

209
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,250
I think you would fit well in Japan.

210
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,680
How come?

211
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,449
Well, Japanese people
are not very expressive

212
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,780
with their emotions.

213
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,279
They’ll keep their true
feelings to themselves

214
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,850
just to keep the harmony.

215
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,350
Just like you.

216
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,810
Huh?

217
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,410
That’s not true.

218
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,450
What you see is what you get.

219
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,580
I’m not hiding anything.

220
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,610
Okay.

221
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,340
But why were you avoiding
me this past two weeks?

222
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,050
Avoiding you?

223
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,950
I’m a busy person.

224
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:37,949
You think you’re that
special, for me to avoid you?

225
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,180
Why are you getting mad?

226
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,450
-I’m not mad. -Okay, you’re not mad.

227
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,279
So, come with me later.

228
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,450
Let’s catch up with Shan.

229
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,650
And why would I go with
you? Am I your girlfriend?

230
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,310
We can go there as friends.

231
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,410
Pass. I’m busy. I need
to finish this presentation.

232
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:04,309
Come on. I’ll bring
you home early tomorrow.

233
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,449
No.

234
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,480
Let’s just finish this interview.

235
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,510
Don’t give in.

236
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:21,550
No matter how cute he is,
don’t you dare go with him.

237
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,479
Thanks for coming with me.

238
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,749
I missed your company.

239
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,479
-Hey! -Yo!

240
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,649
-You’re here! Glad you made it. -Told you.

241
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,349
And you invited someone. Hi Yanna.

242
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,879
-Hello! -Hey!

243
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,279
What’s up? Was Hiro helpful?

244
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,410
Of course.

245
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,350
-Bro, how are you? -I’m good!

246
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,350
Yanna, this is Arman.

247
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,480
This is Neil.

248
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,249
-The boys. -Wow.

249
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,950
Such a formal introduction.

250
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:12,509
Should I start celebrating? I
thought no girlfriends allowed?

251
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,349
- Girlfriend?
- Apparently, they’re not dating.

252
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,850
So, it’s complicated?

253
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,410
Stop.

254
00:18:21,411 --> 00:18:24,109
Does Hiro talk about me with his friends?

255
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,549
Complicated, huh…

256
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,049
Hi, I’m Helen!

257
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,879
- Yes, this is Helen.
- It’s nice to meet you.

258
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,609
- This is Ericka. - Hi, Yanna! I'm Ericka.

259
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,510
It’s nice to finally meet Hiro’s friend.

260
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,009
Hey, hey, hey!

261
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,010
-And— -Elyse.

262
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,630
Well, we already know each other.

263
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,010
- This kid really hates me.
- All right, well let’s do this!

264
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,579
Help yourself. We have a lot of alcohol.

265
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,580
How ‘bout me?

266
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,150
Don’t worry, I got some for you.

267
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,450
You’re not allowed to drink.

268
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,449
Hey, guys! Join us! We’re
playing Never Have I Ever.

269
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,809
Join us, but we’ll be back
to zero since they just arrived.

270
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,079
-Okay. -Let’s do this.

271
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,250
Okay, start! Back to zero.

272
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,250
How about this...

273
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,780
Never have I ever liked someone.

274
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,179
Shot! Shot!

275
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,180
Shot!

276
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,350
All right… Here’s mine...

277
00:19:24,351 --> 00:19:27,350
Never have I ever sucked a dick.

278
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,209
Cheers! Cheers, yeah!

279
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,880
Yes, girl!

280
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,950
Don’t you dare lower a finger.

281
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,549
I got one!

282
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,280
Never have I ever had sex in a car.

283
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,049
Cheers! Looks like some
are lowering their finger...

284
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,550
Cheers!

285
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,379
How about this...

286
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,850
Never have I ever had
a model ex-girlfriend.

287
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,549
Who’s that? Who’s that guy?

288
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,849
That’s unfair.

289
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,909
Cheers! Wait a minute…

290
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,949
Listen to this...

291
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,949
Never have I ever flirted
with a Ms. Universe candidate.

292
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,149
Okay! What the hell, Bro?

293
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,109
Shots fired! Let’s go! Bro, cheers again.

294
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,549
Cheers! Cheers again, Bro!

295
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,779
Cheers!

296
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,479
Yes, sir! All right, okay!

297
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,480
My turn.

298
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,609
Never have I ever

299
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:29,479
denied or concealed my
feelings for my friend.

300
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,649
Hey! Okay.

301
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,879
It’s you, Bro! You lose, Hiro!

302
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,449
Go ahead, finish your drink.

303
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,409
What? Wait, we’re not done yet...

304
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:43,910
Bottoms up!

305
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,679
-Bro, that’s unfair. -Bottoms up!

306
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,650
Let’s go!

307
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,849
All right, good job! Good job!

308
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:56,309
Anyway guys, I think we don’t
have enough drinks and snacks.

309
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:59,149
So guys, boys, let’s buy some?

310
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,649
All right, go get it. Let’s go!

311
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,649
-Be right back, guys. -Let’s get us drinks.

312
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,650
Go!

313
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,049
Hey, hello!

314
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,709
So, were you the reason why Hiro was late?

315
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,209
Where did you guys even go?

316
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,249
We went to his condo to work on my project.

317
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,549
Oh my god!

318
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,949
You’ve been to Hiro’s condo?

319
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,210
Wait, wait! Have you slept on Hiro’s bed?

320
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,310
Oh my god!

321
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,750
Why?

322
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,380
So, what’s the real
score between you and Hiro?

323
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,350
We’re friends.
Bullshit!

324
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,649
He wouldn’t have brought
you here if you guys were just

325
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,650
“friends.”

326
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,680
-Wait… -Huh?

327
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,579
Who said you and Hiro are just friends?

328
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,150
Me. I did.

329
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,349
-Hiro’s fucking friend-zoned! -Cringe!

330
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,709
If you don’t want him,
then I’ll go after him.

331
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:59,780
Girl, stop it! You can’t
hit on your brother’s friend.

332
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,780
Go find somebody else. Someone your age.

333
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,350
I want someone who’s
taking an engineering course.

334
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,410
Quite specific, huh?

335
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,009
I heard Giselle wants to get back with him

336
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,909
but he rejected her.

337
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,910
I pity her. Hiro was a bit too much.

338
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,209
Maybe it’s not really his intention to hurt

339
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,510
his ex’s feelings.

340
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:22,610
I mean, we all know that he’s
leaving after graduation, right?

341
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,280
Right.

342
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,750
But you know, you should...

343
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,750
You should go easy on him, Yanna.

344
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:33,110
‘Cause it’s not obvious,
but he is kinda lonely.

345
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:37,649
Yeah, his dad’s kinda sick
that’s why he needs to go ASAP.

346
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,949
Elyse, shut up.

347
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,909
What? I’m telling the truth.

348
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,509
That’s why he needs to go to Florida,

349
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,510
like right after graduation.

350
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:50,580
Really? I had no idea…

351
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:57,309
Hiro knows a lot about my problems

352
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,180
but I never got to ask
him how he’s been doing.

353
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,050
Just basing this on my observation, but...

354
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,949
Hiro seems genuinely
happy when he’s with you.

355
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,180
I hope you know that.

356
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,650
Cheers to that, baby. Welcome.

357
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,149
I like you!

358
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,479
- Cheers! - I like you!

359
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,550
I like you! I like her! I’m kinda drunk.

360
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,550
Give her a shot.

361
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,550
You wanna shot?

362
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,109
I’m gonna get some more
drinks. You guys good?

363
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,150
You sure?

364
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,980
Excuse me.

365
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,150
Hi!

366
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,150
Hi!

367
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,480
Drinks?

368
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,050
- You good? - I’m good.

369
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,050
So…

370
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,979
how’s your dad in the States?

371
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,050
Does he have someone
to spend Christmas with?

372
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,750
I’m spending Christmas there.

373
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,450
Actually, Dad’s sick.

374
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,780
He’s not doing good.

375
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,710
So…

376
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,079
I’m really scared of what’s going to happen

377
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,580
in the next couple of months.

378
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,410
I’m just trying to focus
on spending time with Dad.

379
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,050
As much as possible.

380
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,650
I’ll pray for your dad.

381
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:42,850
I know I’m not the religious
type of person, but still...

382
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,680
I’ll pray for your dad.

383
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,110
So… where are you gonna
spend your Christmas?

384
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,150
In Laguna.

385
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,410
Any plans for the New Year?

386
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,850
I don’t know.

387
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,979
Maybe I’ll just stay home.

388
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:16,750
Aunty Isabel goes to her
friend’s house every New Year.

389
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,750
While Mama will surely be
spending it in the Town’s plaza.

390
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:29,510
I think I’ll be home before New year.

391
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,550
Do you wanna spend New Year’s day with me?

392
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,110
Don’t you have anyone
else to spend the day with?

393
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,750
No.

394
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,780
I’m planning to visit Coron

395
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,850
And...

396
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,610
I’d really love it

397
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,610
if you’ll go with me.

398
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,549
You should go easy on him, Yanna.

399
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,550
‘Cause it’s not obvious,
but he is kinda lonely.

400
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,010
I’m available then.

401
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,350
Really?

402
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,480
I’m excited, Yanna. Thank you.

403
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,450
He’s leaving anyway.

404
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:12,510
I’ll allow myself to enjoy for now.

405
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,850
So how are you there in the States?

406
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:32,549
It’s cold here. I think I need a hug.

407
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,380
Then go look for a foreign lady.

408
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:38,779
Hey, I meant from you. A hug from you.

409
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,350
You know I’m loyal to you.

410
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,750
Anyway, how are you? How about you?

411
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,480
I got into a fight with my friend.

412
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,510
Why? What happened?

413
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,009
She suddenly brought her partner
to our friends-only hangout.

414
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:57,150
We even had no idea she had a boyfriend.

415
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,480
Jeez, I know her personal
life is none of our business,

416
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,780
but we’re friends, so
why didn’t she tell us?

417
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:09,650
Besides, that boyfriend of
hers is a walking red flag.

418
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,980
I have a bad feeling
towards that bastard, Miguel.

419
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,480
I think he’s up to no good.

420
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,250
And now,

421
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,950
she’s not coming to
our Christmas celebration.

422
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,550
I can’t believe her.

423
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,410
I feel so hurt.

424
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:33,710
Maybe she is emotional too, and needs time.

425
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,810
I think it’s better if everyone
is calmer, you know? To talk.

426
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,310
It’s Christmas and you guys are fighting.

427
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,450
If I were you, I’d feel hurt too.

428
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,850
Hiro’s so kind and understanding.

429
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,410
We’re total opposites

430
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,150
so it’s impossible for him to like me.

431
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,550
So, when are you going back to Laguna?

432
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,079
I’m almost done packing.

433
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,750
I won’t be bringing much anyway.

434
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,450
When are you leaving?

435
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:08,309
After the Christmas
celebration with the girls.

436
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,180
Okay, enjoy.

437
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:14,010
Don’t drink too much
and take care going home.

438
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,650
Yes, boss.

439
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,310
Hiro: Please drink responsibly.
Don’t get too drunk.

440
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,909
Message me when you leave for Laguna

441
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,280
and when you get there. Take care.

442
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,950
YANNA: Wow. Am I your girlfriend?

443
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,380
Is it wrong for me to think
that maybe he does like me?

444
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,180
Is it wrong for me to hope a little?

445
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,880
YANNA: Okay.

446
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,209
- Yanna, my dear! - Aunty!

447
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,409
You’re right on time.

448
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,509
I just finished preparing breakfast.

449
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,609
I’m sure you’re very hungry.

450
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:28,649
This is a lot, Aunty. I’ll
be so full after eating.

451
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,579
Of course! I make sure
that you’re always full

452
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,949
whenever you’re here.

453
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,909
I’ll never let you starve.

454
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,210
Thank you.

455
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,810
By the way…

456
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,749
Your mom went to the market.

457
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,050
She’s buying food for Christmas Eve.

458
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:49,410
Mama’s spending Christmas here?

459
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,979
Yes. But she was inviting me to that...

460
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,109
That party to welcome the New Year.

461
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,850
But I won't be here for New Year's.

462
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,750
I’m sure she’ll be with her friends.

463
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,280
Is she looking for a new boyfriend?

464
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,550
I’m glad

465
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,280
Hiro and I made plans, because

466
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:11,449
if not, I’d be alone this New Year.

467
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,709
I hope you understand your mom, Yanna.

468
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,810
She just wants to spend this
cold Christmas with someone.

469
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:22,010
How come you’re not looking
for someone else, Aunty?

470
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,980
Yanna,

471
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,309
everyone is different.

472
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:30,979
Your mom and I may be sisters
but we’re very different.

473
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,350
We’re not similar at all.

474
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:38,080
Why does she need to look somewhere else?

475
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,650
Am I not enough?

476
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,280
Hello!

477
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,279
Yanna’s here.

478
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,879
- Yes. - I’m right on time.

479
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,550
Come.

480
00:31:48,551 --> 00:31:51,080
Let’s all eat together.
I got us some sticky rice.

481
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,550
Let’s eat.

482
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,550
Eat while the food’s still hot.

483
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,710
Let’s eat.

484
00:31:57,711 --> 00:32:00,380
I’m excited for the sticky
rice, it’s my favorite.

485
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,710
Is it still raining?
Looks like it.

486
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:15,309
Ma, Aunty! Hiro said, Merry Christmas.

487
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,980
Tell him, Merry Christmas!

488
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:22,849
Why didn’t you invite
him over this Christmas?

489
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:25,209
Tell him to just come over

490
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,709
and your Aunty Isabel
and I will cook for him.

491
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:31,279
I think Hiro really likes our food.

492
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,950
Home-cooked meals are always the best.

493
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:37,250
Why don’t you always bring him here?

494
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,849
Wait a minute. I’m
just gonna get the drinks.

495
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,009
-Okay. -All right.

496
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,010
Excuse me.

497
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:53,350
Ma? We don’t have any
plans this New Year, right?

498
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,510
Can I go to Coron?

499
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,650
Coron? Who are you going with?

500
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,450
Hiro.

501
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,880
Is Hiro your boyfriend now?

502
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,250
Ma! No!

503
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,250
Why not?

504
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,079
Ma! Here we go again.

505
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,879
Hiro and I are just friends.

506
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,049
Friends but it’s just going
to be the both of you in Coron?

507
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,879
What’s so wrong about that?

508
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,950
Jeez, I know what’s happening here.

509
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,850
What?

510
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,910
But you know what, I’m all for Hiro.

511
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,310
Because I can see how he cares for you.

512
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,850
It’s pretty obvious too that he likes you.

513
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,050
It’s also obvious that you like him.

514
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,780
You know how to choose a man,

515
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,379
Unlike me who always chooses the losers.

516
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,180
Guys who leave me in the dust.

517
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,679
It’s true, though.

518
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,510
Anyway…

519
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,450
Merry Christmas.

520
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,010
Here’s mine.

521
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,750
Thank you, Ma.

522
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,110
Let’s see.

523
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,910
Surprise!

524
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,949
- Flight attendant? - Right?

525
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,749
Of course!

526
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,680
-Merry Christmas! -Merry Christmas, Ma!

527
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,079
It’s so pretty!

528
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,679
Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas!

529
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,349
- Merry Christmas! - Drinks are here.

530
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,350
Okay!

531
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,550
Yanna!

532
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,349
You have a visitor.

533
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,350
You do have a visitor!

534
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:14,580
It’s a surprise, I’m not
gonna say that it’s Hiro!

535
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,050
-Hi Aunty! -Hi Hiro!

536
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,879
Look, he has souvenirs for us!

537
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,549
- Souvenirs! - Chocolates and perfumes.

538
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,550
Let me choose first!

539
00:35:21,551 --> 00:35:23,749
You’re so sweet! I never
would’ve expected this.

540
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,550
These are my Christmas gifts.

541
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,479
I’ll have this. Look at all these.

542
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,179
Look who’s here.

543
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,750
Where were you?

544
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:36,610
Just around the corner. Fresh from the U.S.

545
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,250
Wait! I stink...

546
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,580
Who cares?

547
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,180
I missed you.

548
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:56,850
Have this.

549
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:58,209
- I don’t want that. - We’ll have one each.

550
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:59,550
Wait, are you packed already?

551
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,279
Our flights today.

552
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,280
Is the flight today?

553
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,150
Didn’t I tell you?

554
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,210
Shit! Wait!

555
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,279
- Hi! Good morning!
- Welcome back, Mr. Juarez!

556
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
Thank you!

557
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,749
The room reservation, for me?

558
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,450
Here’s your keycard for your room.

559
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,750
-Thank you! -You’re welcome.

560
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,149
You’re really going for it.

561
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,710
Why? Do you feel uncomfortable?

562
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:58,410
Not at all!

563
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,580
So, do you want more?

564
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,450
Yes, give me more.

565
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,080
You said you want more… Here’s more.

566
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,350
Jacuzzi?

567
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,280
It’s so beautiful!

568
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,549
Don’t tell me you paid a fortune for this?

569
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,050
No. I pulled some strings.

570
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,250
Paradise…

571
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:31,780
I think you’ve spoiled me too much.

572
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,010
Why?

573
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,280
You keep bringing me to
these beautiful places.

574
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:42,610
I wouldn’t even experience
this if it weren’t for you.

575
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:46,550
Don’t worry.

576
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:49,609
When you become a flight
attendant, for sure,

577
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:52,050
you’ll get to visit more beautiful places.

578
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:57,910
But for now, the pleasure is all mine.

579
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,649
I wouldn’t wanna go
to these beautiful places

580
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,080
with anyone else, anyway.

581
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,150
I want to stay like this forever.

582
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:16,980
Fuck,

583
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:18,850
I lost.

584
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,080
I definitely lost.

585
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:07,750
So…

586
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:09,980
What are we gonna do next?

587
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:16,950
Should I cancel my flight Yanna?

588
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,950
One word from you, Yanna, and I’ll stay.

589
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:08,149
Time flies so fast, Yanna.

590
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:11,949
I wish I had met you sooner. I
wish I had more time with you.

591
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:16,249
But what if that's our
role in each other's lives?

592
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,349
Just a quick layover

593
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:20,809
before heading to the final destination?

594
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:23,979
What’s this? You’ll be flying this?

595
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:24,980
I’m getting nervous.

596
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:30,179
Hi Dad! Just wanted to show you this.

597
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,779
This is Captain Juarez speaking.

598
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,309
I have an answer now… to your question...

599
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,749
Do you want me to cancel my flight?

600
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,079
Finish what you started.

601
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:41,350
Yanna— you’re my only reason to stay here.
