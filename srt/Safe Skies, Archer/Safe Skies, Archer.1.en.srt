1
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:18,833
Take care.

2
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,291
I’ll try to be home for christmas.
I’ll try to be home for christmas.

3
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,583
This is it, friend!

4
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:27,041
Yes! I hope we can see the cherry blossoms.

5
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:28,541
Right, I’m so excited!

6
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,291
Sir, your wife is right beside you.

7
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,000
Shame on you.

8
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,208
I’ll be home in a few hours.

9
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,708
Can’t wait to see you all.

10
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,958
Sir, I’m practically the same age as your
grandchild.

11
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,375
Hello, baby girl! Why are you crying?

12
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,583
Are you lost?

13
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:36,041
Yes, I cannot find my daddy.

14
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,166
All right then. Don’t worry, baby girl.

15
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,625
We’ll look for your daddy.
We’ll look for your daddy.

16
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,708
I’m Ate Yanna and I
work here in the airport.

17
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:45,791
What’s your name?

18
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:46,833
I’m Lily.

19
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,458
Lily, let’s go find your daddy?

20
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:50,791
Let’s go.

21
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,250
All good now, ma’am.

22
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,041
There’s a man who reported that his
child was missing.

23
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,583
We’ve contacted him.

24
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,458
Thank you.

25
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,291
No problem.

26
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,750
Lily, we’ve found your daddy.

27
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:03,958
Really?

28
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,958
Yes, he’s on his way here.

29
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,000
So you don’t have to cry anymore, okay?

30
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,375
Thank you.

31
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:12,583
Wait.

32
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:15,666
Here you go.

33
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,291
Do you like candy, too?

34
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,416
Do you like candy, too?

35
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:23,750
Someone gave this to me
so that I won’t miss them too much.
Someone gave this to me
so that I won’t miss them too much.

36
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:25,958
Ate Yanna?

37
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:26,250
Yes?

38
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,875
Why are you wearing pretty clothes?

39
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,416
This?

40
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,083
You like it?

41
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,375
This is my uniform.

42
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,750
I’m a flight attendant.

43
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,125
What’s that?

44
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:44,541
I help passengers, like you,
to have a comfortable flight.

45
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:48,333
And you help kids like me find their daddy?

46
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,125
Yes!

47
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:53,083
And in exchange, I get to travel the world.

48
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,916
Wow! I want to be just like you.

49
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,291
Lily!

50
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:58,958
Daddy!

51
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,666
I’ll go ahead, sir.

52
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,541
- Thank you!
- Bye, Lily.

53
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,083
Girls!

54
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,708
We have a last-minute change with our pilot today.

55
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,500
They said he’s so handsome!

56
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,916
Is it that Captain Juarez guy?

57
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:23,750
- Yes!
- Yes!

58
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:30,208
The other flight attendants said that even the voice of Captain Juarez is hot.

59
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,000
OMG!

60
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,916
Hey, I’ll bring the food later to the cockpit, okay?

61
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,375
No, you won’t. I’m assigned for that.

62
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:38,541
- Come on, please…
- Wait a minute—

63
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,750
No! Not at all!

64
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,250
Wait a minute, Yanna.
Wait a minute, Yanna.

65
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,208
Do you want to check out Captain Hottie, too?

66
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,541
Let’s put a bit of spice back into your life.

67
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,875
She’s right.

68
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:48,916
Juarez?

69
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,333
Maybe they’re just the same last names.

70
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,333
Pass. Not interested.

71
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:04,541
Back in college, you would never let such
a hottie pass you by.
Back in college, you would never let such
a hottie pass you by.

72
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,500
Where’s the Yanna back then?

73
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,000
Come on.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,416
“Yanna back then.”

75
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:16,958
She’s right. I even used to compete with these two.

76
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,666
But those days are over.
But those days are over.

77
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,500
I’ve outgrown her.

78
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,041
Come here!
Come here!

79
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,916
So embarrassing.

80
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,083
Is the universe playing tricks on me?

81
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,833
Are you okay?

82
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,125
It's Hiro.

83
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,000
When playing billiards,

84
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,416
the break shot sets the tone of the game.

85
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,875
You can easily strategize if you make a good shot.

86
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,208
If not, you’ll be having a hard time.

87
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,208
The same applies in the art of flirting.
The same applies in the art of flirting.

88
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:07,583
You have to make a good first impression
to get what you want.

89
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,875
You must be good at playing billiards.

90
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,916
I’m average.

91
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,041
Would you mind if I…

92
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:17,208
help?

93
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:18,875
Sure.

94
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,500
It might be better if…

95
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,791
you make your shot here.

96
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,666
May I?

97
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,625
How to flirt responsibly.

98
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,083
Rule number one

99
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
You need to look your best

100
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,958
from head to toe all the time.

101
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:39,083
So that you’re always ready for action
when there’s a hot guy spotted.

102
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,000
I’m Harold, by the way.

103
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,416
What’s your name?

104
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,541
Scarlett.

105
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,125
Rule number two
Rule number two

106
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,041
Never give your real name.

107
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,875
You’ll be screwing around,
not falling in love.

108
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,791
Besides, you don’t want them
getting attached to you.

109
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,333
What’s your next class?

110
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,958
It’s at 1:30 but…

111
00:11:35,314 --> 00:11:36,689
I can just cut class.

112
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:38,970
No need.

113
00:11:38,995 --> 00:11:41,787
If you wanna make out,
just say the word.
If you wanna make out,
just say the word.

114
00:11:41,991 --> 00:11:44,991
Time’s running out.

115
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,625
Rule number three

116
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,794
Don’t dilly-dally and
just get to the point.

117
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:51,258
Just tell them what you want.

118
00:11:51,283 --> 00:11:53,950
Too much chit-chat would
just be a waste of time.

119
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,083
Time's up!

120
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,291
I need to go.

121
00:12:05,316 --> 00:12:06,149
Wait!

122
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:07,424
I’m not done yet.

123
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,750
I already have a hard on.

124
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,375
You’re a big boy now.

125
00:12:12,634 --> 00:12:13,875
You can take care of yourself.

126
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,625
Wait Scarlett, can
we meet again soon?

127
00:12:19,474 --> 00:12:20,541
Rule number four
Rule number four

128
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:22,441
Fuck and go.

129
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:24,633
Just like they say, eat and run.

130
00:12:24,658 --> 00:12:26,741
Can I have your number or IG?

131
00:12:26,766 --> 00:12:30,155
Don’t give out your socials or number
especially if you’re not that into him.

132
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,458
Bro, your turn.

133
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,125
You go ahead.

134
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:33,666
Bro.

135
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,083
You first.

136
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:38,291
Hey!

137
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,916
Well? What’s up?
Well? What’s up?

138
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:41,958
All good.

139
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,708
Looks like you left him hanging.

140
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,333
Someone’s gonna go
crazy for you again, Yanna.

141
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,500
I’ll be late for class. Besides,
why should I exchange my studies for a guy?

142
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,916
Are you gonna head back to school?
I’ll take you there.

143
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:55,750
Wait a minute.

144
00:12:56,125 --> 00:13:00,390
Hey you bastards, don’t you dare
give my real name to that guy, okay?
Hey you bastards, don’t you dare
give my real name to that guy, okay?

145
00:13:00,415 --> 00:13:01,540
We know the drill.

146
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:05,188
All right then.
Gotta go, don’t wanna be late.

147
00:13:05,213 --> 00:13:06,046
You sure?

148
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:07,000
Take care!

149
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,500
Gotta go, bye!

150
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,750
I’m kinda hungry.

151
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,166
Let’s eat later?

152
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,458
Why is Yanna late again?

153
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,583
Oh boy!

154
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,250
Here she is, speak of the devil.

155
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,916
Where were you? Billiards?

156
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,833
At least I made it.

157
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,958
Look at yourself,
what happened to your uniform?

158
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,250
I’ll do it, let me do it.

159
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,291
I’ll do it.

160
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:37,875
Seriously…

161
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:38,500
Jeez.

162
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,000
I knew it...
I knew it...

163
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,166
I’m sure she’s been
screwing around again.

164
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:45,692
Of course, just like her mother.

165
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,958
This woman keeps talking smack!

166
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,791
These bitches have their eyes on me again.

167
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:56,791
If you’re jealous…

168
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,416
just close your eyes.

169
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,166
As if…

170
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,916
Now, that’s our friend!

171
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,708
Go girl!

172
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,250
Okay, class.

173
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,875
I’ve finished checking
your first practical exam.

174
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,541
I’m quite disappointed with your grades.

175
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,208
Didn’t you listen during my lecture?
Didn’t you listen during my lecture?

176
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,166
Ms. Fernandez is the
only one with a high score.

177
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,458
Yes!

178
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,666
Keep up the good work.

179
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:32,291
Can’t be helped if you’re
both pretty and smart.

180
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,375
Yes!

181
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,125
That’s our girl.

182
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,416
I’m just that good.

183
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,416
Yes, beauty with brains!

184
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,708
Yanna, don’t you dare be late for my birthday party tonight!

185
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,750
Yes! I’m already getting ready.

186
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,125
How could I miss out on the alcohol?
Calm down.
How could I miss out on the alcohol?
Calm down.

187
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:04,000
Okay. Are Luna and Kierra picking you up?

188
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,541
Yes.

189
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,125
They texted already. They’re on their way.

190
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,708
So just chill out. We’ll be there.

191
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:15,166
Okay, good. Free-flowing drinks for you!
Come here quick!

192
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,000
Okay, then. Bye!

193
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,083
Surprise!

194
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:27,791
Hey!

195
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,916
Wow!

196
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,958
This is perfect, it’s so hot today!

197
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:35,291
The party hasn’t even started
but my makeup is already melting.

198
00:15:35,316 --> 00:15:36,982
It really is hot today.

199
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,583
- You’re right.
- Open it.

200
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,000
Wow!
Wow!

201
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,166
This looks good.

202
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,342
That’ll help you cool down.

203
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:46,492
It’s your favorite, strawberry.

204
00:15:46,517 --> 00:15:48,308
Thank you!

205
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,337
Strawberry!

206
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:53,291
By the way, there’s a
package here for you.

207
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,083
Huh?

208
00:15:54,543 --> 00:15:56,001
I didn’t order anything online though.

209
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:58,485
Maybe it’s from one of your boys.

210
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,653
Have you been giving our address away?
Have you been giving our address away?

211
00:16:01,957 --> 00:16:05,415
Of course not! I would never
give out our dorm address.

212
00:16:05,684 --> 00:16:06,684
That could be dangerous.

213
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:07,376
Such a nice box.

214
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:08,401
What could it be?

215
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,208
Looks fancy.

216
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,291
Open it!

217
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,583
Open it already!

218
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,041
Looks beautiful.

219
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,916
Such a pretty color!

220
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,375
It looks really fancy.

221
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,875
Like the ones for rich people.

222
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,916
Girl, it matches your outfit!

223
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,083
Who was it from?
Who was it from?

224
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,916
I guess it’s from one of her rich boys.

225
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,000
I don’t like the style.

226
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,708
Are you serious?

227
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,416
It’s really beautiful.

228
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,875
- It really is.
- Right?

229
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,083
What I bought from
divisoria is still prettier.

230
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,500
You’re choosing the
divisoria bag over that?

231
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:57,958
Give it to me! Let me borrow it.

232
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:58,833
See, how pretty.

233
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,375
Go ahead and try it.
Go ahead and try it.

234
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,416
It smells nice!

235
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,166
Doesn’t suit you! Take it off!

236
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:14,541
Happy birthday, Sam!

237
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:19,750
Thank you, girls! I love you all!
Let’s enjoy the night!

238
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:23,208
Damn! There’s unlimited hot guys
and unlimited drinks!

239
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,250
And I'm up for unlimited
flirtation tonight!

240
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,416
You better slow down, Luna.

241
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,791
We don’t want you getting
lost again once you’re drunk.

242
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:30,750
You never know what could happen.

243
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,500
Is there something wrong? What happened?

244
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:36,416
And seriously, why are you planning to
flirt with guys if you already have one?

245
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:39,916
Excuse me, I’m very single right now.

246
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,125
The bitch is heart-broken.
The bitch is heart-broken.

247
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,000
W-What?

248
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:44,984
Yes! You ghosted Kalix, you’re not
responding to any of his texts or calls.

249
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:47,133
Excuse me, I did not ghost him.

250
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:48,494
I’m just avoiding him.

251
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:51,181
Besides, let’s not talk about someone
who’s not even here.

252
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,923
I invited Kalix, though…

253
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,791
But he said he might not come.

254
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:57,733
Jeez, let’s hope he doesn’t show up

255
00:17:57,758 --> 00:17:59,466
because I don’t wanna see him.

256
00:17:59,668 --> 00:18:01,585
Come on, let’s party.
Come on, let’s party.

257
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,833
Wait, let’s make a bet…

258
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:06,025
Who’s gonna be the first to score a hottie?

259
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,208
But before that…

260
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,958
Let’s dance!

261
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:11,791
Hurry!

262
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,291
Oh my gosh, I love this music!

263
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,500
It’s the guy you ghosted.
It’s the guy you ghosted.

264
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,250
And he’s here with that girl, too.

265
00:18:29,383 --> 00:18:32,062
And this is exactly why I don’t
want any feelings involved.

266
00:18:32,215 --> 00:18:33,757
It just ruins the mood.

267
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:35,583
Come on, Luna.

268
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:37,145
Just chill out.

269
00:18:38,093 --> 00:18:39,375
Hey, where are you going?

270
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,375
Oh well, I’ll just enjoy the night.
Oh well, I’ll just enjoy the night.

271
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,291
Hey, wait!

272
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,833
Yanna, hey!

273
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,791
Sam, bye!

274
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,916
- Okay…
- Hey, wait for me!

275
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,666
Hi, Amy!

276
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:49,458
Happy birthday!

277
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,333
Thank you for coming.

278
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,250
Okay, he’s cute.

279
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,625
He smellls good and
has this rich boy vibe, too.
He smellls good and
has this rich boy vibe, too.

280
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,250
Fuck! He's such a bad kisser!

281
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,291
I’m tired.

282
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,708
I’ll go back to my friends now.

283
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,458
One Long Island.

284
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:35,333
My friend’s on fire tonight

285
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,041
Aren’t there any good guys around here?
Aren’t there any good guys around here?

286
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,750
Feels like all these
boys are just for show.

287
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,708
1926 double shot.

288
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,125
Target locked.

289
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,958
Look at that face.

290
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,958
He’s so hot.

291
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,708
And he seems…

292
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,458
experienced.

293
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,833
Well, well, well. Those eyes…

294
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,875
Like what you see?

295
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,375
I’m sure he’s big.

296
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,791
You’re fucking delicious!

297
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,291
Fine! I’ll make the first move!

298
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,708
You’re too hot for me to let go.

299
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,125
Wow!

300
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,333
You’re still here.

301
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,833
Your game is kind of weak today.

302
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,208
It’s hard to flirt with the guy I’m eyeing.

303
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,416
He keeps socializing.

304
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,958
Who’s your target?

305
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,875
Guy with the dark blue long sleeves.

306
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,041
OMG, girl.

307
00:22:58,041 --> 00:22:59,125
That’s Hiro!

308
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,416
You’re a tourism student,
you should know him!

309
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:06,500
What? Why should I know him?

310
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:10,333
Girl, his family owns FlyAsia.
You know, the airline?

311
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,458
Like THE FlyAsia?

312
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,416
The top airline in the Philippines?
My dream airline?

313
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:17,166
Yes!

314
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:19,833
He’s actually a mechanical
engineering student.

315
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:22,681
As far as I know, he’s
also a student pilot.

316
00:23:22,706 --> 00:23:24,540
I heard he already has a license.

317
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:28,875
I don’t know much about his personal life
though, but we have a lot of common friends.

318
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,750
So he’s a rich kid?

319
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:31,666
Yes.

320
00:23:33,106 --> 00:23:34,356
Hard pass on that.

321
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,791
It’s so hard to flirt with rich kids.

322
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:40,208
I can’t relate with them and I don’t
want them speaking English to me.
I can’t relate with them and I don’t
want them speaking English to me.

323
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:45,041
It’s too bad though! Look, he’s so hot!

324
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,333
Well, it’s your call.

325
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,166
Let’s just get drunk!

326
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:52,125
Good idea,
I’m not into anyone here anymore.

327
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,208
Let’s just get drunk.

328
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,541
Here you go.

329
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:56,125
Let’s go—

330
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,583
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

331
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:58,583
Happy birthday!

332
00:23:58,583 --> 00:23:59,708
Thank you!

333
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:01,166
Let’s dance?

334
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,125
Let’s go!

335
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,458
Huh? Where did they all go?

336
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:29,458
Oh well, I'm just gonna
continue partying here!

337
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,958
Damn it, I’m so dizzy.

338
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:21,750
I won’t drink anymore. I’ll behave.
I won’t drink anymore. I’ll behave.

339
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,750
That’s a promise, Lord.
This is the last time.

340
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,708
Fuck this life.

341
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:46,833
Damn alcohol.

342
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,750
Wait a minute–

343
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,125
This isn’t Sam’s room.

344
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:04,958
Oh my god! Did we have sex?

345
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:06,958
Did I just break rule number five?

346
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,583
Never have sex when you're drunk.

347
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:12,083
What if it was unprotected?

348
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,666
What if I get a disease?

349
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:16,666
This is definitely not
flirting responsibly.

350
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:32,916
There’s no condom here.

351
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:45,083
You’re awake.

352
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:48,125
Oh, it’s him.

353
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:51,333
Good morning.

354
00:26:52,041 --> 00:26:54,125
What was his name again?

355
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:56,541
Oh yeah, Hiro.

356
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,375
The bathroom’s over there.

357
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,166
Thanks.

358
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:12,791
What’s with that face?

359
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:15,250
How could I look like a mess
when there’s a hot guy close by?

360
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,458
Did I break rule number one?

361
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:19,458
But wait, I was able to remove
my makeup in my drunken state?

362
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:22,458
Damn, I’m good.

363
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:55,125
You’re Hiro, right?

364
00:27:55,853 --> 00:27:56,853
Yes.

365
00:27:57,398 --> 00:27:58,398
How’d you know?

366
00:27:59,541 --> 00:28:00,541
From Sam.
From Sam.

367
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:04,583
You talked about me.

368
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,166
I saw you at the club.
Do you remember?

369
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:08,166
I do.

370
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:10,541
You were checking me out.

371
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:13,625
I was.

372
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:15,666
I won’t deny it.

373
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,291
I’m Yanna, by the way.

374
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,625
Why did I give my real name?

375
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,833
How could I forget about rule number two
just because of a hangover?

376
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:36,875
How did I get here?

377
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:38,750
I drove you here.

378
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:40,375
Why?
Why?

379
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,416
Because your phone was dead

380
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:43,916
and I don’t know where you live.

381
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,750
How did you find me?

382
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,000
The last thing I remember…

383
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:48,958
I was—

384
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:50,000
You fell on me.

385
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:53,916
It’s getting late.

386
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:55,375
Come on! Just one more drink.

387
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:58,250
I’ll drive.

388
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,083
No, you have a driver.
No, you have a driver.

389
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:16,416
Dude, is she okay?

390
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,375
She’s dead.

391
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,791
Oh well, she fell on you.

392
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,750
So she’s your responsibility now.

393
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:28,916
I’ll go back inside.

394
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:29,625
The hell…

395
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:30,500
You did say you’re done drinking.

396
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,416
Good luck.

397
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:32,231
Shan!

398
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:33,041
Good luck, Bro.

399
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:33,875
Shan!

400
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:49,000
Well…

401
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,250
At least I know how to
choose a person to fall for.

402
00:29:55,937 --> 00:29:56,958
So…

403
00:29:58,242 --> 00:29:59,750
did we have sex?

404
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:07,541
No.

405
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:10,875
Why not?

406
00:30:12,226 --> 00:30:13,226
Too bad.

407
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,291
Woman, you were dead.

408
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,208
What were you expecting?
What were you expecting?

409
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:24,125
Oh yeah, right.

410
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:26,208
No sex if I’m not sober.

411
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:28,416
Sorry, my emotions got the best of me.

412
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:29,666
He’s just so hot.

413
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:32,000
But—

414
00:30:33,852 --> 00:30:34,977
what if I wasn’t drunk?

415
00:30:40,892 --> 00:30:41,892
If—

416
00:30:42,635 --> 00:30:43,750
If I wasn’t drunk

417
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,333
and you weren’t drunk…

418
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:49,333
would there be a chance?

419
00:31:26,578 --> 00:31:27,578
Of course.

420
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,333
Now, wear this.

421
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:33,458
I’ll drive you home.

422
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,583
Wow.

423
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:38,333
You’re giving me your hoodie?

424
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:42,666
Why? Are my boobs bothering you?
Why? Are my boobs bothering you?

425
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:56,833
All done.

426
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:47,916
Smells so good.

427
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:50,458
It’s turning me on.

428
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:00,166
You don’t have a girlfriend, do you?
You don’t have a girlfriend, do you?

429
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:02,583
I don’t.

430
00:33:02,705 --> 00:33:04,289
Awesome! He’s single!

431
00:33:05,427 --> 00:33:06,427
You?

432
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:08,041
Me?

433
00:33:09,126 --> 00:33:10,875
I don’t do boyfriends.

434
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:13,208
I’m glad to hear that.

435
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:18,458
That’s why he’s single, he
just wants to play around. Same.

436
00:33:18,981 --> 00:33:21,398
I heard from Sam that
you’re an engineering student.
I heard from Sam that
you’re an engineering student.

437
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,458
How about you?

438
00:33:28,145 --> 00:33:30,458
Third year. Tourism.

439
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:35,000
So you wanna be a Flight Attendant?

440
00:33:35,543 --> 00:33:36,918
If I’m lucky.

441
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:39,166
If not…

442
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:43,583
I’ll just be someone’s sugar
baby or a non-showbiz girlfriend.
I’ll just be someone’s sugar
baby or a non-showbiz girlfriend.

443
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:48,791
I thought you don’t do boyfriends?

444
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,625
I don’t think it would sound good to be a
non-showbiz fuck buddy, right?

445
00:33:55,414 --> 00:33:57,125
You’re enjoying too much.

446
00:33:59,035 --> 00:34:01,535
Well, you’re funny and so direct.
Well, you’re funny and so direct.

447
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:05,833
Are all the girls from
your school like that?

448
00:34:06,916 --> 00:34:07,875
Not at all!

449
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:09,166
Just me.

450
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:10,750
The one and only.

451
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:17,500
My dorm’s right there.

452
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,166
You can drop me off here.

453
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,141
Okay.

454
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:22,166
Wait.

455
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,083
When can I see you again?

456
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:51,958
Whenever you want.

457
00:34:57,958 --> 00:34:59,458
How are you gonna contact me?

458
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,541
Okay.

459
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:19,333
Thanks.

460
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:23,875
See you.

461
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,541
Kierra: Luna is with Kalix.

462
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:15,833
Via: Great. Where’s Yanna?

463
00:36:16,281 --> 00:36:19,697
Sam: Idk maybe she's already
hooking up with the student pilot guy.

464
00:36:19,722 --> 00:36:21,056
Via: Who’s that?
Via: Who’s that?

465
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:23,291
What if something happens to her?

466
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:25,791
Why are you guys always
missing when you get drunk?!

467
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:28,666
Sam: I'll look for her.
You guys go ahead.

468
00:36:28,691 --> 00:36:30,399
Sam: Shoot I can't find Yanna.

469
00:36:30,424 --> 00:36:32,966
Guys, please try to call her.

470
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:42,250
They’re even more
worried than my own mother.
They’re even more
worried than my own mother.

471
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:50,666
Yanna: I just got back
to the dorm. Don’t worry!

472
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:56,375
I’m safe. Worry about my pussy
that wasn’t taken care of last night!

473
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:58,416
Damn it.

474
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:12,958
I’ll taste you soon enough.

475
00:37:37,916 --> 00:37:39,041
You’re taking too long, Yanna.

476
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:40,833
No matter what you do,
it’s still gonna be a bad shot.
No matter what you do,
it’s still gonna be a bad shot.

477
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:43,666
Fuck you! Shut up or I’ll fuck you up.

478
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:44,458
Wow.

479
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:46,083
I don’t swing that way, bro.

480
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:48,708
I’ll take over.

481
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:51,958
It went in! I told you.

482
00:37:53,916 --> 00:37:55,416
Are you free later this afternoon?

483
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:57,583
Why? Where are we going?

484
00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:59,250
Nothing, just to chill.

485
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,875
With them?

486
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,208
No.

487
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,291
Just us.

488
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:10,500
Do you have a crush on me?

489
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:19,887
You don’t have a crush
on me. You’re just horny.

490
00:38:19,912 --> 00:38:20,875
Yanna—
Yanna—

491
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:22,666
I’m not free later, Chris.

492
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:26,583
- Why?
- We’re friends, you know that.

493
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:27,833
- We’re friends!
- We’re friends…

494
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,166
Friends.

495
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:30,500
Yeah, friends!

496
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,000
Friends.

497
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,083
Rule number six.

498
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:34,916
Don’t hook up with friends.

499
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:38,541
The value of friendship is too important
to be ruined merely by carnal desires.

500
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:40,125
Friends.
Friends.

501
00:38:41,541 --> 00:38:42,500
Guys! Guys!

502
00:38:42,626 --> 00:38:43,585
Good news!

503
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:46,708
- What now?
- I saw this treasure in my Papa’s room.

504
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:47,375
What treasure?

505
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:49,291
Look at this.

506
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:51,708
What is this all about?

507
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:53,125
Fuck this is good!

508
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:54,583
I don’t think they sell these anymore.

509
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:58,125
Hide it!

510
00:38:58,125 --> 00:38:58,708
Why?

511
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:00,083
That’s Yanna’s mom!
That’s Yanna’s mom!

512
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,333
Don’t be a spoilsport!

513
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:02,708
I said that’s Yanna’s mom.

514
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,750
That’s my mom on the cover. Why?
Gotta problem, bastards?

515
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,416
Sorry.

516
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:08,166
I didn’t know. But—

517
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:11,291
honestly, she’s pretty. Just like you.

518
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:12,375
Fucker.

519
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:13,500
What the fuck?

520
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:17,375
It’s okay, Jeez. She’s sexy, huh?
Where do you think I got all this from?

521
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,233
Stop thinking with your dick, Dennis.

522
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,375
Come on, let’s just play.
Come on, let’s just play.

523
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:23,500
You’re always horny.

524
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,458
Dennis the boob lover.

525
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:25,166
Dennis the boob lover.

526
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:26,666
These two—

527
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,564
So you’re Dennis the boob lover.

528
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:34,625
Hiro: My friend rented a
place for a house party tonight.

529
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:36,958
Sam's invited. Did she invite you too?

530
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,333
Hey fuckers, I gotta go somewhere.
Hey fuckers, I gotta go somewhere.

531
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:41,458
You guys keep playing.

532
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:42,500
I just have somewhere to go.

533
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,958
She’s leaving again.

534
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:45,000
Jeez!

535
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:51,416
Hiro’s friend invited you to a
party and you didn’t tell me?

536
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:52,125
Come on!

537
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:13,000
Hi Kylie!

538
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,250
You look good.

539
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:16,416
Hi guys, how are you?

540
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,375

you owe me big time, Samantha.

You’re here already anyway.

You look familiar.

553
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,833
You’re the girl who passed out
at the bar last time, right?

554
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:52,541

Who’s winning?

573
00:41:22,916 --> 00:41:24,750
“Who’s winning?” Us, of course.

574
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,500
Right.

575
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,375
Okay, so…

576
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:28,291
All right, let’s go Sam.

00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:42,291
My turn.

583
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,416
Drink!

584
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:06,666
Damn, baby girl. That ass.

585
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:09,125
You’re just exactly my type.

586
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:10,958
Wanna give me some head?

587
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:12,041
Fucking bastard.

588
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:13,916
I know you fuck around.

589
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:16,625
You don’t have to pretend.

590
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:18,625
What did you say?

591
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:20,708
I know you—
I know you—

592
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:24,791
Problem?

593
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:28,166
Hiro… Bro…

594
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:30,916
Fuck off.

595
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:36,750
I’m sorry.

596
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Are you okay?

597
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:52,208
You’re late.

598
00:42:54,666 --> 00:42:55,666
So…

599
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:57,791
You were waiting for me.

600
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:11,750
What’s that for?

601
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,375
My thank you.

602
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:16,583
And also for helping me last time.

603
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,125
Come on!

604
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:24,125
- Let’s go down, they’re playing beer pong.
- No.

605
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:27,708
Let’s stay here.

606
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,208
Fuck me.

607
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:20,250
Hiro: Are you home?
Hiro: Are you home?

608
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:23,916
He wants an update?
Is he my boyfriend now?

609
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:26,708
Samantha Maureen Vera.

610
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:28,583
Did you sell me out to Hiro?

611
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:30,333
Uh- What? Hello, Yanna?

612
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:32,083
I can’t hear you, the line’s breaking…

613
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:35,500
How do you like your steak, sir?

614
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,458
Medium-well.

615
00:45:36,458 --> 00:45:37,583
How do you like your steak?

616
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:38,708
Wet…

617
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:41,208
Uh! I mean…
Uh! I mean…

618
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:44,083
Well-done.

619
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:44,875
Okay!

620
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:53,458
You want me to be your fuck buddy?

621
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,291
Wanna try it out?
