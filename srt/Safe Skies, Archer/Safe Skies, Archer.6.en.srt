1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,899
Never have I ever denied
or concealed my feelings

2
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,069
for my friend.

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,449
Hiro seems genuinely
happy when he’s with you.

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,330
I’m planning to visit
Coron and I’d really love...

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,370
if you’ll go with me.

6
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,509
I think you’ve spoiled me too much.

7
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,589
When you become a flight
attendant, for sure,

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,300
you’ll get to visit more beautiful places.

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,120
I want to stay like this forever.

10
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,350
Good morning!

11
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,380
Good morning.

12
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,350
I ordered breakfast.

13
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,689
Let’s get up.

14
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,479
It’s almost the New year.

15
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,860
We should end this year on a happy note.

16
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,570
I’m ready.

17
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,369
I’m so ready to make more

18
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,040
amazing memories with you.

19
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,360
Memories before we forget each other?

20
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,690
Memories that we’ll treasure forever.

21
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,010
Cringe!

22
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,350
I’m only leaving the Philippines.

23
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,270
Six months left.

24
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,100
What are you talking about?

25
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,710
Six months more!

26
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,740
That’s a long time!

27
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,890
More time for you to keep pissing me off.

28
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,830
Let’s talk about that next time.

29
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,460
Let’s just enjoy Coron.
Come on, let’s have breakfast.

30
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,909
I used to feel okay

31
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,499
with how things would
end between Hiro and I.

32
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,340
That our relationship will
just end once he leaves.

33
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,450
But...

34
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,050
lately I’ve been thinking…

35
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,760
What if...

36
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,470
we just become a couple?

37
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,270
What if Hiro can just stay here?

38
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,190
Does Hiro also want that?

39
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,610
He asked me if I didn’t want him to leave.

40
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,530
And what did you say?

41
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,820
I haven’t given him a response.

42
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,660
But what do you want?

43
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,620
I want...

44
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,010
I want him to reach his dreams.

45
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,130
But...

46
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,930
I also want to be with him.

47
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,140
Why not do both?

48
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,810
By being in a long-distance relationship?

49
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,970
Hiro’s parents broke up because of it

50
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,820
so he wouldn’t want to be in one.

51
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,020
I don’t think I could handle it either.

52
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,440
So what’s your plan?

53
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,240
I don’t know.

54
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,579
All I know is that

55
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,750
I’ve never felt this happy before.

56
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,209
Especially during this vacation,

57
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,920
I’m happier when I’m with him.

58
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,430
What if I tell him not to leave?

59
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,780
Yanna, I want you to be happy.

60
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,050
I love seeing you happy.

61
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,569
But you are on vacation.

62
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,149
Everything feels magical.

63
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,899
When you go back to Manila
and face reality again,

64
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,200
things aren’t going to be easy.

65
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,029
What I am trying to say is

66
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,999
don’t decide when you’re
in this euphoric bubble.

67
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,410
Decide when you’re facing reality.

68
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,210
Think of everything that
you and Hiro will sacrifice.

69
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,209
Take time and think about it

70
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,380
because that’s a big decision to make.

71
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,060
Hiro’s calling me. I’ll
call back later, okay?

72
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,350
- All right, bye! - Bye!

73
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,540
I know you hate cheesy stuff...

74
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,460
But just for once, can you let this slide?

75
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,550
Wow!

76
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,890
It’s so beautiful.

77
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,600
Thank you.

78
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,310
Too romantic, though.

79
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,360
Cringe!

80
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,190
I know…

81
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,859
Please?

82
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,450
Just once, can we be like this?

83
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,580
Will you be my New Year’s Eve date?

84
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,510
Yes.

85
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,010
Not like I have a choice.

86
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,930
Thank you for this surprise.

87
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,940
I’ve never experienced this before.

88
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,900
Thank you too.

89
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,570
I know it’s a bit over the top,

90
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,110
but I need to say this.

91
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,740
Thank you for everything.

92
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,040
You made this trip more special.

93
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,060
Let’s eat?

94
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,980
How’s your beef?

95
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,310
Wet.

96
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,810
I mean, well-done.

97
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,190
Are you excited?

98
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,650
Excited for?

99
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,410
Going to Florida.

100
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,240
I was.

101
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,900
But now I feel lonely.

102
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,380
Time flies so fast, Yanna.

103
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,550
I wish I had met you sooner.

104
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,680
I wish I had more time with you.

105
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,850
I feel the same way.

106
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,480
But what if...

107
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,360
that’s our role in each other’s lives?

108
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,249
Just a quick layover

109
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,960
before heading to the final destination?

110
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,830
If this is just a layover, Yanna...

111
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,220
I wouldn’t mind staying
here and missing my flight.

112
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,760
Me too. Just stay here. Let’s stay here.

113
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,480
Time flies so fast.

114
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,650
I’m not ready yet.

115
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,499
Let’s just enjoy our time now

116
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,630
instead of feeling sad for
what’s going to happen soon.

117
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,170
I don’t want to leave you, Yanna.

118
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
There it is!

119
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,830
Happy New Year!

120
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,000
Happy New Year!

121
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,610
What’s this?

122
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,140
You’ll be flying this?

123
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,980
Yes!

124
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,580
Do you trust me?

125
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,570
I’m getting nervous.

126
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,170
Just trust me.

127
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,400
So, how many ladies have you brought here?

128
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,780
There is always a first
time for everything.

129
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,620
Yeah, right!

130
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,120
Are we getting close?

131
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,840
Approximately 30 minutes.

132
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,150
Can I request something?

133
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,969
Can you take a video of me?

134
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,390
- I’ll send it to Dad. - Of course.

135
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,950
I’m sure he’s gonna be proud of this!

136
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,020
Recording?

137
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,570
Hi Dad! Just wanted to show you this.

138
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,689
This is Captain Juarez speaking,

139
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,199
and our estimated time of arrival in Manila

140
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,160
is around 1:35 PM local time.

141
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,039
The weather in our route is good

142
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:44,170
and we’re expecting good
and nice, uneventful weather.

143
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,710
Now sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight.

144
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,710
Hey!

145
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,130
You okay? Something bothering you?

146
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,130
It’s nothing.

147
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,760
Come on. Tell me.

148
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,139
I said it’s nothing.

149
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,099
I don’t think it’s nothing.

150
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,180
Tell me, come on. I’ll listen.

151
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,809
Really?

152
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,690
Yeah, what’s bothering you?

153
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,439
I have an answer to your question now...

154
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,450
About whether I want you
to cancel your flight or not.

155
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,489
What? Do you want me to cancel my flight?

156
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,040
Tell me, I’ll...

157
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,630
No, Hiro.

158
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,840
I’m not gonna stop you from leaving.

159
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,640
While you were flying the plane earlier,

160
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,590
I saw how passionate you were.

161
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,940
You’re meant to be a pilot.

162
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,689
I can’t forgive myself if

163
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,529
you don’t get to reach your dreams

164
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,360
just because I stopped you.

165
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,290
So, you should go to the States.

166
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,160
Finish what you started.

167
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,170
You don’t have...

168
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,300
You don’t have any reasons to stay.

169
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,089
Yanna, you’re my only reason to stay.

170
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:00,680
Don't abandon your plans because of me.

171
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,929
Go and reach for your dreams in Florida.

172
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,310
Do it for yourself.

173
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,600
Do it for your dad.

174
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,190
But...

175
00:18:09,191 --> 00:18:11,060
You want me to be happy, right?

176
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,440
I would be happier if you push through.

177
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,920
Can you promise mes omething?

178
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,720
What is it?

179
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,010
Can we make my last few
months here memorable?

180
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,979
I wanna bring as many great memories

181
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,890
as possible before I leave.

182
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,110
Can we?

183
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,770
Yes.

184
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,410
Let’s go.

185
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,140
Surprise.

186
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,140
For me?

187
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,140
You like it?

188
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,680
Yes.

189
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,600
I feel so bad for Ke.

190
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,030
I didn’t realize how hard
it is to transfer phone files.

191
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,160
Especially since I have a lot of photos.

192
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,270
I still need to download my apps.

193
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,870
Why? You got a new phone?

194
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,410
Yes.

195
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,660
Raymond gave it. Mama’s new boyfriend.

196
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,560
It’s been a few days
and it’s still not done.

197
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,429
Hey! Can you check this…

198
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,390
Taste this if it’s okay.

199
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,760
Okay, let’s have a taste of your adobo.

200
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,880
It’s too sweet.

201
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,190
What?

202
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,050
Add more salt.

203
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,049
That would balance the
sweet and salty flavor.

204
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,300
All right.

205
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,179
That’s enough.

206
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,850
Okay! Let’s do this again.

207
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,899
It’s good.

208
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,149
Okay. Can I taste it?

209
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,860
Sure, go ahead. Taste it.

210
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,909
It is good.

211
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,000
Is it?

212
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,790
Of course, I taste good.

213
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,590
Okay, so you’re the one that’s good?

214
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,049
Most of the time.

215
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:53,010
So what about the other times then?

216
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,870
I don’t know.

217
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,190
What about the other times?

218
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,220
- Wait! I’m ticklish!
- What about the other times?

219
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,990
What am I good at?

220
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,980
I wonder…

221
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,860
What are you good at?

222
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,040
You don’t know?

223
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,870
Wait!

224
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,080
Are we gonna do it here?

225
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,380
Mama and Aunty aren’t here yet.

226
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,270
Yanna: Sam, I have a problem…

227
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,569
Sam: Hey, what is it?

228
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,319
Yanna: I forgot my pills in
Coron when Hiro and I went there

229
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,279
Now I haven’t been able to take them

230
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,829
since we came back to Manila. I’m worried…

231
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,660
Sam: Oh no, Yanna.

232
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,720
Happy graduation!

233
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,099
I’m so proud of you.

234
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,390
Thank you!

235
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,849
Come, I saved you a seat.

236
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:23,850
Meet my family.

237
00:24:23,851 --> 00:24:25,939
It’s okay. I’m fine here.

238
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,019
I wouldn’t want to intrude.

239
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,740
I just came here to
personally congratulate you.

240
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,160
Thank you for making time.

241
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,739
But… how about my farewell party later?

242
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,910
Are you coming?

243
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:45,870
No?

244
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,339
I’m sorry…

245
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,049
I have plans.

246
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,509
Luna called an emergency meeting

247
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,550
so we’re all meeting at Sam’s condo.

248
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:00,809
Besides, we have a hiking
trip two days from now, right?

249
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,390
I’ll make it up to you then.

250
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:06,310
Okay. That will be our last trip.

251
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:12,610
Our last trip before I leave.

252
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,050
It still hurts.

253
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,929
Fuck!

254
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,020
Fuck all men.

255
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,980
Fuck all cheaters.

256
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,980
Fuck them all!

257
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,529
You’ve been through a lot, Luna.

258
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,649
He doesn’t deserve your tears.

259
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,449
What the fuck was that?

260
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,450
I gave him everything, didn’t I?

261
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,120
But why...

262
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,249
Why is it not enough?

263
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:09,919
Luna, the time will come when we will love

264
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,749
and be loved

265
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:17,259
by the right person,
even more than we deserve.

266
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:21,600
When that time comes, they won’t let us go.

267
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,430
They won’t leave, they won’t hurt us.

268
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,750
Why did you walk out?

269
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,160
Is it because of Hiro?

270
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,750
I knew it.

271
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,420
Whenever you walk out,
it’s always because of Hiro.

272
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,510
What are you gonna do?
He’s leaving next week.

273
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,600
I’m trying to forget it but
you just keep reminding me.

274
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:10,770
Aren’t you going to tell them about Hiro?

275
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,649
Maybe they have something to say

276
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,730
that would ease up your feelings.

277
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,110
Next time.

278
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,029
But you got mad at Kierra

279
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:21,659
because she didn’t tell us
about her boyfriend, Miguel.

280
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,620
But I was right about that bastard Miguel.

281
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,410
It’s just that…

282
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,210
I’ll tell them next time.

283
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,330
You know, you don’t look so good.

284
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,090
Have you eaten?

285
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,840
Here, I brought you food.

286
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,470
What is that smell?

287
00:27:41,471 --> 00:27:44,760
Take it away from me. It stinks,
that doesn’t smell right anymore

288
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,550
What?

289
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,020
It’s smell okay.

290
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,980
Wait a minute, I think...

291
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,320
What happened to Yanna?

292
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,290
I think she just didn’t like the wine.

293
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,379
Yanna…

294
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,630
Yanna?

295
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:25,010
Via and Luna just left.
How are you feeling?

296
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,849
I feel better.

297
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:29,930
Are you sure?

298
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,810
Yes, don’t worry.

299
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,190
Your period’s delayed?

300
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,360
How long has it been?

301
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,370
Five days.

302
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,420
Take these.

303
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,930
The last thing I want right now is a kid.

304
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,640
I don’t want to risk it.

305
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,400
Actually, I don’t want
to have a kid at all.

306
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,930
Oh my god…

307
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,310
Oh my god, Yanna…

308
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,980
What is this? What am I going to do?

309
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,280
Wait Yanna, calm down.

310
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,780
Okay? Calm down.

311
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:53,830
I’ll call my doctor to have
you checked immediately so we know.

312
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,449
I don’t want this Sam.

313
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:00,669
Hiro doesn’t want this.
I can’t have a baby now.

314
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,210
Yanna, let’s go to the clinic first, okay?

315
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,090
Don’t be scared.

316
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,010
I’m here with you.

317
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,170
Be strong, Yanna.

318
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,550
It’s okay… It’s okay.

319
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:34,409
There you go. Sinigang with fish

320
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:37,370
Okay. Go ahead and eat.

321
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,869
- Let’s go. - Go ahead and eat.

322
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:41,959
Let’s eat.

323
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,370
Start eating, dear.

324
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,960
- Here. - Give me some water.

325
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,210
Ma.

326
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,260
What is it?

327
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,680
Sorry…

328
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,220
Sorry? For what?

329
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,990
I’m pregnant, Ma.

330
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:23,160
Huh? What do you mean you're pregnant?

331
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,460
I did a pregnancy test
and it came out positive.

332
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,380
Sam even brought me to the doctor.

333
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,180
Yanna… Yanna...

334
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,320
Come on, Yanna…

335
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,770
Who got you pregnant?

336
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,310
Is it Hiro?

337
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,480
N-No.

338
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,109
Who?

339
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,609
I don’t know.

340
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,110
Come on, Yanna…

341
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:57,660
What do you mean you don’t know? Huh?

342
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:03,869
Yanna, can’t you see
how hard I’ve been working

343
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:06,170
just to provide for us?

344
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,999
So that I can pay for your tuition

345
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,340
and so you’ll have extra
to buy whatever you want…

346
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:14,299
Now, you’ll be adding more to the problem?

347
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,380
Aren’t you thinking straight?

348
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,970
I’m sorry, Ma. I didn’t
mean for this to happen.

349
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,470
What do you mean?

350
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,439
Get an abortion. We
don’t have enough money.

351
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,190
Anne…

352
00:33:29,191 --> 00:33:30,439
Get an abortion.

353
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,609
Wait, Anne.

354
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,570
Don’t make any rash decisions now.

355
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,690
You need to calm down.

356
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,430
What do you want me to do, Isabel?

357
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:45,120
Do you expect me to jump
for joy with this news? Huh?

358
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:50,000
Can’t you see your niece
hasn’t even graduated yet.

359
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,839
Go look for a solution for that.

360
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,550
Find ways to earn money.

361
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:59,340
Can’t you see Raymond and I just broke up?

362
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,930
Remember? Yanna?

363
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,179
How are you gonna feed that?

364
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,690
How are you going to
take care of that? Huh?

365
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,940
With Grandma...

366
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,940
What?

367
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,030
With Grandma? Huh?

368
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,159
In Nueva Ecija?

369
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,659
You think your Grandma will
help you if you go there?

370
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,449
I can’t go with you there

371
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:27,909
because your Grandma is mad at me

372
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:29,290
for having you!

373
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,380
Anne…

374
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,000
You’re being too harsh on your child, Anne.

375
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,990
She’s experiencing the same...

376
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:40,590
The same circumstances as you did.

377
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,969
Look for the father.

378
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:45,560
Ask him for money.

379
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,729
There are days...

380
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:53,050
There have been days when
you’re disgusted with me

381
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,820
for what I’ve done.

382
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:01,030
Now, you’re doing the same thing.

383
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:04,280
The same thing...

384
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,410
You did the same thing.

385
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,290
You’re just like me!

386
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,920
I’m nothing like you!

387
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,220
Because I’ll take care of my child.

388
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,520
I will love it and give my
full attention to it, unlike you!

389
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:38,780
I did everything to make
sure you’ll live well.

390
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:43,490
Then you should have just killed me.

391
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,870
How could you say that?

392
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,420
I’ve been keeping my
emotions to myself for so long.

393
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,589
Yes, I’m mad at you but not
for what you did in the past.

394
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:05,090
I’m not mad at you
because you were working.

395
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,180
You wanna know what hurts me?

396
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:16,560
Ma, you weren't by my side
when I needed you the most.

397
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,040
I wasn’t by your side?

398
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,539
Did you know that I was
being bullied and insulted

399
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,790
almost every day since grade school?

400
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,629
I didn’t have any friends

401
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,130
because they were disgusted with me.

402
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,300
They said you were a mistress.

403
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,560
They said you were a slut.

404
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:54,100
They keep telling me a
lot of things about you.

405
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,480
I’m so sorry...

406
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,950
But I just cry by myself.

407
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,739
I never show them my weak side

408
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,410
because I was trying to
make myself seem strong.

409
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:29,300
I carried myself when I was
young, with Aunty’s help.

410
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,690
That’s when I realized

411
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,520
that no one would...

412
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:46,150
No one will share the pain with me but me.

413
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:56,370
I keep getting into fights in school.

414
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:03,250
I often come home with a lot of wounds.

415
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,470
Because I’d always fight for you.

416
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:11,180
But once I’m in a place

417
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:16,310
with no one around…

418
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,020
that’s when I cry.

419
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,950
It’s so hard, Ma.

420
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,740
It’s so hard to be alone.

421
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:42,000
It’s so hard to be alone and in pain.

422
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,590
I’m sorry…

423
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:54,349
Now you’re telling me
that you did all those...

424
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:57,680
You did all those jobs for me
that’s why you were always away.

425
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,190
Because you wanted me to live well.

426
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,439
Didn’t it cross your
mind that I needed you?

427
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,110
I needed a mother.

428
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,950
I needed you, Ma.

429
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,280
I’m so sorry.

430
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,120
I’m sorry…

431
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,250
I’m sorry for getting angry.

432
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,049
I may not be the best daughter to you,

433
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:29,170
but you must admit that
you were not the best too.

434
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,010
I grew up angry with you.

435
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,760
Until now…

436
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:41,189
Because you keep choosing someone else

437
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,940
instead of spending time with me.

438
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,150
I’m used to it, though,

439
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,320
I just don’t get it…

440
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,449
Are you always leaving

441
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,570
because you didn’t want to see my face?

442
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,790
Do you even see me as your child?

443
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,710
Am I a mistake? Am I just an accident?

444
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,290
No…

445
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,550
None of those are true.

446
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,140
I’m sorry, Yanna.

447
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,180
I’m sorry if I'm not always around.

448
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,770
I’m sorry for not spending time with you.

449
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,850
I never once

450
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:30,189
thought of you as an accident,

451
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,400
as a mistake.

452
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,489
I thought everything was okay because…

453
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:39,870
because I was doing it for you.

454
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,250
Because I was working hard for you.

455
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,790
I’m really sorry, my dear.

456
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,840
I never realized that you
were going through so much.

457
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,220
I’m sorry…

458
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,770
I’m sorry, Yanna.

459
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,499
Let her cool off for now.

460
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,129
Let’s give her space. Don’t worry, Anne.

461
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:34,260
I’ll talk to her, okay?

462
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,550
I’ll talk to her.

463
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,480
I feel better.

464
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,730
I was able to say
everything I wanted to say.

465
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,790
She apologized but I don’t
think it’s gonna be easy

466
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,660
to forget everything.

467
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,410
It’s not even easy to forgive.

468
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,579
I understand.

469
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,499
Things won’t magically get fixed overnight.

470
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,209
But you took a big step
and I’m proud of you.

471
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:11,669
Everything will be okay in time.

472
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,259
But for now don’t be stressed, okay?

473
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,709
I asked our doctor

474
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,969
and I was told that you
shouldn’t get stressed.

475
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,970
Stress is bad for the baby.

476
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,969
Also, get enough sleep
and have a healthy diet.

477
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,979
Keep the baby healthy, okay?

478
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:28,389
I’ll have fruits and
vitamins delivered there.

479
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:29,480
Wow.

480
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:32,859
The baby is not even out yet

481
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,070
but they’re already getting
spoiled by their godmother.

482
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:40,110
Of course! I can’t wait
to spoil my first inaanak.

483
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,330
Thank you, Sam.

484
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,580
I appreciate everything you’re doing.

485
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Come on!

486
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,670
You do the same for me.

487
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:58,720
Yanna… Are you planning to tell Hiro soon?

488
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,430
I want to.

489
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,640
But I don’t know how.

490
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:12,020
Maybe you can tell him
tomorrow during your trip.

491
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:19,700
I’ll call you back later, Sam. Bye!

492
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:24,620
Yanna…

493
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,460
Do you plan to continue
with your pregnancy?

494
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,970
If you’re sure about it,

495
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,600
I’ll go with you to Nueva Ecija.

496
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,430
Let’s stay with your grandma

497
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,480
while you’re pregnant.

498
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:58,070
She would be able to
help with the expenses.

499
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,480
You know Yanna,

500
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:06,200
even if your grandma is mad at your mom,

501
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,870
I'm sure

502
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:15,670
that she would still
accept you with open arms.

503
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,120
All right then.

504
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,870
I’ll let you be.

505
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,329
Don’t cry anymore.

506
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:01,050
It will affect the baby. Okay?

507
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:19,020
Hiro: Good night, Yanna.
Excited to see you tomorrow.

508
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:23,319
Would he still be excited

509
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,990
if he learns that I’m
pregnant with his child?

510
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,150
You okay?

511
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:04,990
Could this be the right time to tell him?

512
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:08,360
That I’m pregnant with our child.

513
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,039
I shouldn’t have let you do this.

514
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,210
Sorry, I just wanted to see the sunrise.

515
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,669
What are you talking about?

516
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:19,919
You don’t have to apologize.

517
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,710
I might be just a little dizzy.

518
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,510
Let’s just enjoy this.

519
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,010
Are you sure?

520
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:28,800
Of course!

521
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:33,849
I wanna see the sunrise with you.

522
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:36,059
Okay! Let’s go!

523
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,520
Let’s go, let’s go!

524
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:17,350
We’re a bit early for the sunrise, but...

525
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:21,400
You have some water first.

526
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:28,230
While I prepare for this. Ta-dah!

527
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,490
How are you feeling?

528
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:38,949
You’ll easily find someone
that would marry you in the States

529
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:41,670
if you’re this caring.

530
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:43,380
Huh?

531
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:46,590
Okay…

532
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,430
You get to choose by then.

533
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:00,310
Let’s not talk about that right now.

534
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,689
Hiro, it would be much better for you

535
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:09,109
if you’ll find a partner in the States.

536
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:10,820
That way, you won’t have a hard time.

537
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,200
Let’s not talk about that right now.

538
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:22,539
What about having kids?

539
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,790
That’s not included in my plans. Why?

540
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:29,000
Good thing I didn’t tell him.

541
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:32,090
I already know that he doesn’t want one.

542
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,970
It’s best that I just keep this to myself.

543
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:38,010
Nothing, I was just curious.

544
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:43,060
I feel the same way. I don’t— I plan...

545
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,480
I don’t plan to have kids.

546
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,650
Why not?

547
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,110
I think you’ll be a great mom.

548
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,540
Really? Do you think so?

549
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:04,250
Of course! You’re brave.

550
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,119
You’re the type of person

551
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,210
that would sacrifice
everything for her child.

552
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:09,840
I see that in you.

553
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:16,590
Really?

554
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,350
I hope so.

555
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:26,230
I’ll do my best when the time comes.

556
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:44,830
The sun’s here.

557
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:49,540
There! There it is!

558
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:03,810
It’s beautiful, Yanna.

559
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:10,480
I’m happy just seeing him happy.

560
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:15,240
It’s so nice to see him
like this, not sad at all.

561
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:17,860
Like he has nothing to worry about,

562
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:23,580
like he’s not leaving, like
he won’t leave me behind.

563
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,960
Like he won’t leave us behind.

564
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,840
Florida, here I come!

565
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:38,590
I can’t wait to pursue my dreams, Yanna.

566
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:42,720
And I can’t wait for you, too.

567
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,520
To pursue your dreams as well.

568
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,610
I hope we can stay like this.

569
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:08,330
I hope so, too.

570
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:18,630
I'll be fine on my own, right?

571
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:34,940
Of course!

572
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,530
At least we have something in common.

573
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:47,830
We'll look at the same sky
every day, but in different colors.

574
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:56,670
You know…

575
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,130
right now…

576
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:07,060
I just really want to tell
you that I am so proud of you.

577
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,390
I know that you’ll
definitely reach your dreams.

578
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:15,900
Come on.

579
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,780
Don’t say goodbye yet.

580
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,870
Your daddy’s embracing you, baby.

581
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:57,650
There are things I'm not telling you.

582
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:04,840
I hope you understand that
I'm only doing all this for you.

583
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:08,120
Like what?

584
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,580
Nothing. Nothing really…

585
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:25,720
That I love you and
our future child so much.

586
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:13,120
I’ll leave you these and this sweatshirt.

587
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:15,100
Too much space in my luggage.

588
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,300
Try it on.

589
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:18,810
This is too much.

590
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:21,360
This one?

591
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:25,660
“The future is written in stones.”

592
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,449
- This is so me. - Just try it on.

593
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:29,910
Okay, wait!

594
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:36,410
This smells good.

595
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,080
- Looks good on you. - Does it suit me?

596
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,299
And...

597
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,920
Here, also this…

598
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,139
What is this? A donation?

599
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:53,219
No! I’ll just buy another one.

600
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:57,140
In case you miss me or miss
smelling me, at least spray it.

601
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,639
Get over yourself!

602
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,810
Why?

603
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,520
You won’t miss me?

604
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,779
Why? Did I say I won’t?

605
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,610
I’ll miss you too.

606
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:17,790
Let’s reserve this
drama for tomorrow. Okay?

607
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:23,460
Please put these in my
bag before I forget it.

608
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,800
And charge my phone, please.

609
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,759
The charger is inside my bag.

610
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:29,760
Okay.

611
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,590
Thank you!

612
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,169
Yanna…

613
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:07,379
Yes?

614
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,710
What’s this?

615
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:10,220
What?

616
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:19,560
I saw it inside your bag.

617
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:23,440
Hiro...

618
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,690
Give it to me...

619
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:40,790
Are you pregnant?

620
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:50,960
Am I the father?

621
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:31,339
Hiro, come on— Stop it.

622
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:32,920
What the fuck, Yanna?

623
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,929
Don’t waste your life here.

624
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:39,300
Yanna, don’t lie to me.

625
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:46,899
I’m scared that you
guys would get mad at me.

626
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,519
We’re sorry that you felt you had to hide

627
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,480
your pregnancy from us.
