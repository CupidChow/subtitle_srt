1
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,090
Stop it.

2
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,770
What the fuck, Yanna?

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,150
This baby isn’t yours.

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,050
So don’t waste your life here.

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,650
I love you, Yanna.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,040
I love you.

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,100
- Mommy!
- Hello!

8
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,690
Here.

9
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,600
Did I mention that he’ll be our
pilot for our flight to Japan?

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,850
Your dream country.

11
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,560
- She is so stressed.
- You got this!

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,770
Cheers!

13
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,570
I’m happy that you’re
a FlyAsia flight attendant.

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,450
Me too.

15
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,580
I’m glad you’ve
reached your dreams.

16
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,130
-Uh… What…
-Yes…?

17
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,710
Yo— You…
You— You— You…

18
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,070
You’re stunned?

19
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,510
You’re in a daze?

20
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,530
Or are you attracted?

21
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,660
Huh?

22
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,600
What are you talking about?
He forgot

23
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,810
what he bought earlier so
I just brought it here with me.

24
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,320
Thank you, Miss Fernandez.

25
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,790
You’re welcome.

26
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,210
Nice save.

27
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,620
Okay Caleb, stop.

28
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,960
Thank you.

29
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,680
Why was I staring at him anyway?

30
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,240
I’m so unprofessional!

31
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,020
This is embarrassing!
He might think badly of me.

32
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,280
So, Miss Fernandez, how was it?

33
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,400
How was your view last night?

34
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,550
What view?

35
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,040
You don’t have to pretend.
You were staring, remember?

36
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,660
I don’t know
what you’re talking about.

37
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,870
- Wow, attitude!
- What’s this about?

38
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,650
Well, let’s just do this…

39
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,460
Let’s take a selfie so we
look like really close friends.

40
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,710
Come on, come on.

41
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,960
Guys, come closer.

42
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,840
Do I stink?

43
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,550
Let’s stick together so

44
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,300
we look like really good friends.

45
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,470
One, two, three,
Ariga-cheese!

46
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,560
There you go. Nice shot!

47
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,640
- I’ll get your socials.
- Tag me!

48
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,730
I already have your socials.
Cap, what are your socials?

49
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,410
- @akihiro
- @akihiro. Followed!

50
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,030
- You, Miss Fernandez?
- @ashiannakim

51
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,200
but I’m not really active.

52
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,200
- @ashiannakim…
- She’s not really active.

53
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,410
So...

54
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,850
you and Capt. Hiro have been
following each other?

55
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,250
And Capt. Hiro,

56
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,920
you even liked Miss Fernandez's
post from five years ago?

57
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,050
Huh? No way?

58
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,620
Really?

59
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,440
Wait! What is the
meaning of this?

60
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,840
Is there something I don't know
about the two of you?

61
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,560
You guys have been
friends for a long time.

62
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,690
Five years actually.
Why didn’t you tell us?

63
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,980
What is this?
A precinct interrogation?

64
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,240
We just know each other.

65
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,650
- Really now?
- Oh yeah? How?

66
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,720
What should I tell them?

67
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,000
How much detail can I say?

68
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,750
We met at a party.

69
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,630
We have mutual friends back then.
I asked for her socials,

70
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,800
then we followed each other.
That’s all. We’re friends.

71
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,450
Yes! We just know each other.
That's all.

72
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,560
- Okay guys.
- Yeah. We just know each other.

73
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,430
They just know each other—
for five years.

74
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,680
They just know each other.

75
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,840
Okay, you just know each other.

76
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,600
We just know each other?
I guess this is for the best.

77
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,530
I guess it’s best that
they don’t know the truth.

78
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,820
They’ve just known each other
for five years.

79
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,550
- Yes.
- They’re just acquaintances.

80
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,030
- Nothing more…
- Nothing. Just acquaintances.

81
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,620
Whatever guys.

82
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,160
Okay, let’s stop it.
Our ride is here.

83
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,710
We don’t need
to make it a big deal.

84
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,790
They just know each other.

85
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,740
- No need to make it a big deal.
- They just know each other!

86
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,790
Quit it you guys!

87
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,010
No biggie. We are aware that
you just know each other.

88
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,890
Hey! Hurry up.

89
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,770
You guys are so slow.
Don’t you wanna go home yet?

90
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,850
I’m getting hungry.

91
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,860
- Okay.
- Bye!

92
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,520
Bye, my car's here.

93
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,320
- I’ll go ahead.
- Bye, Cap. Take care.

94
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,320
- Take care.
- All right.

95
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,780
Be careful, everyone. Take care.

96
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,740
Miss Fernandez.

97
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,840
- Yes?
- About what I said earlier,

98
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,200
about our past—

99
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,590
It’s for the best I guess.

100
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,580
No need to overthink about it.

101
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,090
Okay. How are you gonna go home?
Is your car okay?

102
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,180
Yes!
My car is fine.

103
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,430
But it’s becoming a headache,
it keeps breaking down.

104
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,350
Do you need a car?

105
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,230
I think so.

106
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,050
It seems like anytime soon,
my car’s just gonna give up.

107
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,970
Maybe you know
someone selling a car?

108
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,830
Or maybe you’re selling a car?

109
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,520
Hopefully at an
affordable price.

110
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,270
I can sell you my Benz,
it's still in good condition.

111
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,690
The name is already
expensive, you know?

112
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,470
Ah, no. I can sell it
at a friendly rate.

113
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,000
Really?

114
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,630
I appreciate it.

115
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,330
How much?

116
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,060
I’ll message you
once I have the figure.

117
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,630
Okay, but
I’ve changed my number.

118
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,190
That’s why you weren’t
replying to my messages.

119
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
What did you say?

120
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,300
Nothing, I’ll just get
your new number

121
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,700
if that’s okay with you.

122
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,790
Okay, no problem.

123
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,300
Is this the sunrise
we saw when we went hiking?

124
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,370
He made it his wallpaper?

125
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,060
- Just text me.
- Sure.

126
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,220
There.

127
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,580
That’s me.
That’s my personal number.

128
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,720
I’ll just message you once
I have the figure.

129
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,810
I'll go.

130
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,280
Take care.

131
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,810
Okay, Cap.

132
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,670
Mommy, are you going home now?

133
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:31,090
Mommy, I’ll wait for you so
we can eat dinner together.

134
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,380
Mommy, where are you?

135
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,580
Where’s Avi? Is she still up?

136
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,810
Oh you’re here.
She’s sleeping already.

137
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,390
She fell asleep on the couch
while waiting for you.

138
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,810
She didn’t want to go to bed

139
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,310
in case you came home earlier.

140
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,610
Avi might turn out just like me.

141
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,070
She might grow up
holding a grudge against me

142
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,660
because I'm not always around.

143
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,460
Avi’s smart.

144
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,920
And I know that
she understands your job.

145
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,340
But you’re right, Yanna.

146
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,050
You need to spend more time
with her when you can.

147
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,100
It’s so hard being
a single mother.

148
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,720
I’m so glad you, with Luna
and the others, are around

149
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,600
to take care
of Avi when I’m gone.

150
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,180
Especially you.

151
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,730
Thank you, Sam.

152
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,170
I promised you that I’ll be
here for you and Avi always.

153
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,280
Stop it.
You’re going to make me cry!

154
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,450
Not too loud.

155
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,740
Did you both stay in the condo
all day?

156
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,840
I had a photoshoot earlier
so I left her at Luna’s office.

157
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,710
Sevi was the only one there
so he took care of her.

158
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,720
Jeez, Sevi might have
brought her on site.

159
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,260
She might tell me tomorrow
that she dreams

160
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,220
of becoming an engineer.

161
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,770
- Why not? It suits her.
- It keeps changing.

162
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,440
When she was with Luna, she
wanted to become an architect.

163
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,600
When she was with you,
she wanted to become a model.

164
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,610
She’s still young,
she’ll figure it out

165
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,530
when she grows older.

166
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,650
Don’t worry about it. Enjoy it
while she’s still a baby.

167
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,780
When she grows up, you’ll
definitely miss this phase.

168
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,650
Of course.

169
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,540
But whatever Avi aspires to be,

170
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,830
I’m all for it!

171
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,330
If she wants to become
an astronaut on Mars

172
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,750
or if she wants to be
a Mariana Trench diver,

173
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,760
I’ll support her no matter what.

174
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,170
As long as Avi’s happy.

175
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,070
I want to give you everything
that will make you happy, baby.

176
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:04,030
I wish I can give it all to you.
How I wish…

177
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,860
- Mommy!
- Hi baby!

178
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,630
- I missed you!
- I missed you too.

179
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,800
Mommy look,
I got a lot of stars.

180
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,350
Wow! Good job!

181
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,050
Very good, Avi.

182
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,070
Avi, Mommy, Daddy.

183
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,710
That’s great, baby.

184
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,590
Thank you!

185
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,510
Please give it to Daddy
when you see him.

186
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,500
Okay, Avi.

187
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,020
Because you earned a star,

188
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,140
I have a surprise for you.

189
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,100
Close your eyes.

190
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,980
- Don’t peek.
- Close your eyes.

191
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,530
No peeking.

192
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,030
Wait a minute…
Wait.

193
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,300
Wait...

194
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,240
Okay, open your eyes!

195
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,290
Wow! Princess Ola!

196
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,830
- Surprise!
- Wow!

197
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,670
I like it mommy!
Thank you, I love you.

198
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,510
Your daddy bought it.

199
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,720
I’m sorry I can’t tell you yet.

200
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,800
You’re welcome, baby.

201
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,000
Let’s sit.

202
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,870
Mommy, why were you away
for so long?

203
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,930
Sorry, baby.
Mommy had a flight in Japan.

204
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,080
Is Japan a nice place, Mommy?

205
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,070
It sure is.

206
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,300
Mommy promises to bring you
there next time, okay?

207
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,500
Look here.

208
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,660
- Pretty, right?
- Yes.

209
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,000
- There.
- It’s you, Mommy.

210
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,960
Yes, that’s me.

211
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,830
Who’s this, Mommy?

212
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,340
He—

213
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,890
He's our pilot.

214
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,760
What's a pilot, Mommy?

215
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,680
A pilot is someone

216
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,190
who drives an airplane to
bring people to their families.

217
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:45,980
They’re often accompanied by
flight attendants like mommy.

218
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,870
Wow! I want to be a pilot
when I grow up.

219
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,250
You'll be the flight attendant
and I'm the pilot.

220
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,620
We’ll fly together someday…

221
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,500
I’ll be the pilot

222
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,750
and you’ll be
my flight attendant.

223
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,590
You and your dad said
the exact same thing.

224
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,380
Sure! As long as you do well
in school, okay?

225
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,590
Okay, baby. Go to your room so
you can change your clothes, go!

226
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,690
How are you going to
introduce Avi to Hiro?

227
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,310
Have you thought about it?

228
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,110
I don’t know.

229
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,150
I guess I’ll wait
for the right time?

230
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,910
Is there really a right time
for such a thing?

231
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,330
Avi is growing up day after day.

232
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,620
Every day that goes by,

233
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,500
is time they could have spent together.

234
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,000
You’re right.

235
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,710
But I still worry about
Hiro’s reaction.

236
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,970
What if he doesn’t accept Avi?

237
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,050
What? That’s impossible.

238
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,430
How can anyone resist Avi?

239
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:59,390
I asked him a lot
of times before, Sam.

240
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,270
He said he didn’t
want to have kids.

241
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,480
Yanna, That was five years ago.
People change.

242
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,530
But I agree, that’s
a big decision

243
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,070
so you really should
think about it first.

244
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,410
By the way… Should we go
see some car dealers?

245
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,080
Not for now.

246
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,370
I saw some online.
I can’t afford it yet.

247
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:27,130
I need to save up first
for Avi’s tuition fee next year.

248
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,590
I might go for a second hand
car for now.

249
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,880
You know Yanna,

250
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,170
if Hiro knows about Avi,

251
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,180
I’m sure he will gladly
share all the expenses

252
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,970
and you don’t have to shoulder
everything by yourself.

253
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,640
Even if Hiro learns about Avi,

254
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,640
I wouldn’t want to just share
expenses with him.

255
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,290
I want her to grow up

256
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,060
with a father.

257
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,840
To fasten your seat belt,
push the ends together.

258
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,360
To tighten,
pull the loose end of the strap.

259
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,850
Your life vests are
found under your seats.

260
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,100
Remove sharp objects from your body,

261
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,380
slip vest over your head.

262
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,380
Take tape around your waist,
push end to buckle.

263
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,650
Pull waist tape to tighten.

264
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,650
When outside the aircraft,

265
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,270
pull down sharply the two
inflation cords at the lower end.

266
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,830
If life vest fails to inflate,
blow into mouth tubes.

267
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:39,110
In the unlikely event that
emergency oxygen is required,

268
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,560
oxygen masks will
drop from above you.

269
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,360
Grab the mask and
pull firmly towards you.

270
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,550
Put over your nose and mouth,
pull elastic band for a snug fit

271
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,110
and breathe normally.

272
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:54,020
The emergency exits are
marked throughout the cabin.

273
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,390
Locate the exits nearest you.

274
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,630
For further information,
please study the safety card

275
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,470
found in the seat pocket in front of you.

276
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,670
- We are about to take off.
- Seat belt, please.

277
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:07,340
Ensure your seat belts
are securely fastened,

278
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,080
- seatbacks in upright position,
- Window up, sir.

279
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,590
- window shades open,
- Window up.

280
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,130
and your tray tables should be stowed.

281
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,610
- Once again, welcome to FlyAsia.
- Seat belt, ma'am.

282
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,740
Miss Fernandez,
do you want to announce?

283
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,410
Really?

284
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,420
- Sure.
- Go ahead.

285
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,300
Ladies and gentlemen,

286
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,510
the Captain has turned on
the Fasten Seat Belt sign.

287
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,510
If you haven't already done so,

288
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,180
please stow your carry-on
luggage underneath the seat

289
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,060
in front of you or
in an overhead bin.

290
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,270
Kindly take your seat
and fasten your seat belt.

291
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,360
Please also make sure your
backrests and folding trays

292
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,240
are in their full
upright position.

293
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:02,700
Good job, Yanna.

294
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,160
Do the landing announcement
as well, okay?

295
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,990
Really?

296
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,210
Thank you, ma’am. Thank you!

297
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,620
Let’s prepare for take-off?

298
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,890
Good evening, sir.
Serving your dinner.

299
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,310
Thank you, Miss Fernandez.

300
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,560
Thank you!

301
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,150
Congratulations, by the way,
on the announcement.

302
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,980
You did a good job.

303
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,530
You noticed my announcement?

304
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,530
How did you even
know it was me?

305
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,490
You knew it was my voice?

306
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,120
Thank you, Cap.

307
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,080
Have you eaten?

308
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,580
What?

309
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,290
Have you guys eaten?

310
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,460
We will later.
Thanks for asking.

311
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,650
Dang Cap…
Smooth moves you got there.

312
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,910
More snacks!

313
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,370
- I’ll have that!
- Thank you.

314
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,280
That’s my favorite!
Thank you so much.

315
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,410
- Thank you, Sam.
- Oh my god, as I was saying—

316
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,620
Oh yeah, you were saying…

317
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,620
So this guy showed up.
I asked him,

318
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,080
how old are you?

319
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,370
Girl, he was younger than me!

320
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,920
- I was like, you're so young!
- She's open to dating now.

321
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,590
I’m starting to feel old…

322
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,170
Well, well, well…
What are you all doing here?

323
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,050
Why are you here?

324
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,500
Hey, where’s my kid?
I went to your office,

325
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,680
no one told me you guys
were all going to be here.

326
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,600
She’s at the mall with Sevi.

327
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,350
Wow…
She’s really getting spoiled.

328
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:00,360
Hey, so why are you all here?
What’s up? What’s the news?

329
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,110
You’re the news.
Start talking, Sis!

330
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,360
Tell us what happened.

331
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,660
We heard you and Hiro

332
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,830
were together on your flight?
So, what’s going on?

333
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,080
What’s going on with you guys?
Hurry up!

334
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,460
Wait a minute!
We have a complete set here.

335
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,160
You’re— Maricar,
the friend who just arrived

336
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,830
but is never late for
the latest gossip.

337
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,340
- Of course.
- Yes! And you—

338
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,460
You’re Marites,

339
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,300
the friend asking for
the latest gossip.

340
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,090
You’re Marisol, the instigator.

341
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,180
- Marichu!
- Marichu?

342
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,310
- The friend who fuels the gossip.
- Fuels, huh?

343
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,480
You’re talking too much!

344
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,940
You better start talking about
what really happened.

345
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,150
Well, we’ve been
together on a flight.

346
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,730
But we’ve just been
professional towards each other.

347
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,360
Professional…

348
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,530
So how was it? Was it awkward?

349
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,530
It’s okay, we weren’t awkward.

350
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:51,490
He even congratulated me.
He said he’s happy

351
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,790
I was able to reach my dreams.

352
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,040
That’s great!
If you can be friends now,

353
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,370
it would be easier to
co-parent in the future.

354
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,580
- Really?
- Right?

355
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,170
Aren’t there any feelings left?
No sparks?

356
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,670
- Nothing…
- Any electricity or something?

357
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,590
There’s nothing! You all know
that Avi’s my priority,

358
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,720
not my lovelife.
You all know that, right?

359
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,830
Besides,

360
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,860
I’m not even sure
if Hiro’s single or married.

361
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,900
- Why do you look sad?
- Hey…

362
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,440
No!

363
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,400
It’s just that I need to
know about it

364
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,980
once I introduce Avi to him.

365
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,980
Because, if he has a girlfriend

366
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,840
or if he already
has his own family,

367
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,780
where would Avi fit in his life?

368
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,710
Well, I heard rumors that he
and Giselle got back together,

369
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,570
but not confirmed.
Hiro’s such a private person.

370
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,770
You look sad again.

371
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:44,920
Don't pile up your
problems all at once.

372
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,300
Babe, listen.
Just focus on the first step—

373
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,010
- introduce Avi to her dad.
- Okay.

374
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:54,350
Now— whatever reaction
Hiro would have,

375
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:57,270
you won’t have any
control over it, Sis.

376
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,310
As long as you
tell him the full truth

377
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,520
that you owe him
all these years.

378
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,690
If Hiro doesn’t want Avi,
then so be it.

379
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:10,030
Let’s leave him alone.
You and Avi are loved.

380
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,500
We will never make Avi feel

381
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,000
like there’s something
missing in her life.

382
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,610
Who do you think we are?

383
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,430
Thanks, girls.

384
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,960
They say that it takes a village
to raise a child.

385
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,390
- It’s all of you!
- It’s all of us!

386
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,860
- You’re my village!
- It’s all of us!

387
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,370
- I’m the house!
- I’m the plant!

388
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,590
I’m one of the flowers.

389
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,970
Are you the nice scented flower,
or the big one, or—

390
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,260
- She’s blossoming…
- A fresh flower.

391
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,010
Hey, that’s a different
kind of flower.

392
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,140
Let’s just drink.

393
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,980
- Since she served the food…
- Cheers, guys.

394
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,940
- Cheers!
- Wow! Okay!

395
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,160
SEVI: Let’s just meet here
in the mall,

396
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,030
Avi doesn’t wanna
go home yet.

397
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,200
Who’s your favorite uncle, Avi?

398
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,090
Uncle Sevi!

399
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,340
There you go!

400
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,860
I think you’re ready
to have your own kid.

401
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,100
- You think so?
- Yes.

402
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,810
I think I wanna
have one already.

403
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,470
Are you ready to see
some little Sevis?

404
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,790
Oh no! Nevermind, we’re okay
with just one Sevi.

405
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,800
Okay, go down for now.

406
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,460
Here you go.

407
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,850
Yanna?

408
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,290
Oh, Ericka!

409
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,030
- Hey!
- Hi!

410
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,390
- Yes, OMG! It’s you!
- Oh my god!

411
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,130
How are you?
It’s been so long.

412
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,720
It’s been like, what?
Five years?

413
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,470
Yes! I’m okay. How are you?

414
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,470
I’m good. I mean,
life’s good, right?

415
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,520
Mommy, can you open this?

416
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,910
- Okay—
- Come on, Avi.

417
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,440
Let me open it. Your mom’s
talking to someone.

418
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,130
- Your daughter?
- Yes.

419
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,170
Wow, congratulations!

420
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,300
Thank you.

421
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,210
Are you done
with your groceries—

422
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,990
Sorry, I have to go.

423
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:24,260
- Oh yeah, sure! Go ahead.
- Bye. It was nice to see you!

424
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,330
Nice to see you!
Take care.

425
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,530
Engineer, thank you.
We were able to make use

426
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,330
of those arms of yours
for the groceries.

427
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,740
No need to thank me,
this isn’t for free.

428
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,140
- 1,500.
- Hey!

429
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:44,560
I almost slipped
a swear word but—

430
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,900
All right Avi, say goodbye
to your Uncle Sevi.

431
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,200
Thank you, Uncle Sevi.
I love you.

432
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,950
You’re welcome. Be a good girl.
Give me a hug.

433
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,330
Before I forget...

434
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,490
Oh!

435
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:06,250
I actually forgot
that I have a car.

436
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,460
- I’ll go ahead. I parked there.
- Be careful.

437
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,960
- Bye, take care.
- Take care.

438
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,880
Okay.

439
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,420
Get inside, go.

440
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:21,800
You’re really being spoiled
by your Uncle Sevi.

441
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:24,680
You’ve been eating junk again.

442
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:28,920
You really should be
eating your vegetables.

443
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,310
Let's go.

444
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,390
Wait. I have to text someone.

445
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,820
YANNA: How’s it going?
Any update with the car?

446
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:03,760
Flights to Incheon are canceled
due to the bad weather

447
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,470
so you guys can go home, okay?
See you on the next flight.

448
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,320
Captain, were you able to
receive my messages

449
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,570
about the car?

450
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:19,650
I’m planning to buy it already
since my car’s giving up soon.

451
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,950
- Sorry if I’m being stubborn.
- Why do you still need it?

452
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,870
So that I have something to use.

453
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,310
Doesn’t your husband have a car?

454
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:34,000
Husband? What husband?

455
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,830
Nevermind, if you still wanna
buy the car, just tell me

456
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,720
so I can start
preparing the papers.

457
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,720
Of course! I’ll take it.
At the right price.

458
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,520
Not too expensive
and not too cheap.

459
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,230
200k.

460
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,120
I’ve been looking online and
noticed the model you’re selling

461
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,790
is still a bit expensive.

462
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,320
Isn't he selling it too cheap?

463
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,900
500k?

464
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,750
Send me your account number

465
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,030
so I can deposit the payment,
ASAP.

466
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,660
Okay.

467
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:33,990
Yanna!

468
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,650
- Hey!
- Glad I was close by.

469
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,780
Sam’s busy so
she can’t pick you up.

470
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:43,740
Captain, this is
Engineer Sevi Camero.

471
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,200
Sevi, this is
Captain Hiro Juarez.

472
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,810
What’s up, bro?

473
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,090
Do you have a flight tomorrow?

474
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,210
Wait, let me check…

475
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,750
She doesn’t have
a flight tomorrow, bro.

476
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,540
We’re going out.

477
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,960
I didn't ask you.

478
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,220
No.
I don’t have a flight tomorrow.

479
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:16,470
I’ll just message you
regarding the car

480
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:19,500
and I’ll give you the papers
when we see each other again.

481
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,700
- Let me help you.
- Thank you.

482
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,230
Who was that? I’m hurt.

483
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,610
Don’t be,
he might be just tired.

484
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,990
I’m offended.

485
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:10,580
- You’re already offended?
- I’ll wait for him by the gate.

486
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,440
Are you some high school bully?

487
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,840
Anyway, are you going to

488
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,020
Sam’s party this Saturday?

489
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,940
Huh? What’s happening?

490
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,760
Nothing… Just a weekend party

491
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,910
but she’s inviting
all her friends.

492
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,510
I’ll have to check because
you know, I have Avi…

493
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,830
Hey, Sam told me that Aunt Anne
visits you

494
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,190
every first weekend
of the month.

495
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,720
- So don’t make any excuses.
- You even know about that.

496
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:41,710
- Of course.
- You know too much.

497
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,730
Hey…

498
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,320
HIRO: Send me your
personal information.

499
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,060
I’ll prepare the deed of sale.

500
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,390
YANNA: Okay, I’ll send it now.

501
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,880
HIRO: And I apologize
to your engineer.

502
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,930
There. Don’t feel hurt anymore.
Cap’s apologizing.

503
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,200
It’s fine.

504
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:09,970
YANNA: My engineer said
“it’s fine.”

505
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,720
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go!

506
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,020
Cheers!

507
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,650
Yanna, glad you came.

508
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,440
It’s good that you’re here.

509
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,110
Yes.

510
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:30,280
Of course, I had to wait
for Avi to fall asleep.

511
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,320
I’m sorry, guys.
I just remembered that

512
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,160
I have a project I need to
revise, tomorrow’s the deadline.

513
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,000
I have to go, okay?
Bye!

514
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,710
- Take care!
- Take care, okay?

515
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,420
Ke! Let’s go down,
I need to pee.

516
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,630
-Come on. Wait for us.
-Okay.

517
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,630
Don’t you guys need to pee?

518
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,550
No, go ahead.
We’re good.

519
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,170
I didn’t know
that Hiro’s invited.

520
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,820
Is he really back together
with Giselle?

521
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:04,240
I heard she’s dating
a non-showbiz fling.

522
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:08,260
Why? Don't tell me
you're seeing him again?

523
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,750
Like dating?

524
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:12,900
Not at all! I was just curious.

525
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,750
You invited Kalix?

526
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,010
Yeah, I invited him.

527
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,090
Good thing Luna just left.

528
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,090
Right…

529
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,970
That was funny.

530
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:39,350
But Avi got another
five stars in school.

531
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,180
Amazing right? She’s so smart.

532
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,940
She really takes after me.

533
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:47,360
- I'll get more.
- Okay, get me one, too.

534
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,360
- Yanna.
- Shan.

535
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,860
- Drink?
- My friend’s getting me one.

536
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,450
I heard that you’re a
flight attendant for FlyAsia.

537
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,410
How did you know?

538
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,170
I, uhm…
I saw you on flight.

539
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,750
You should've approached me.

540
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,670
With all my flights, I can't
remember each passenger.

541
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,800
Next time.

542
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:17,680
So how are you?
I heard you're already married.

543
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,390
Huh?

544
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,500
I’m not married, I’m single.

545
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,440
- Really?
- Yes.

546
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,520
I mean— You’re not? Why?

547
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,000
Nothing, I’m invested in my job.

548
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,320
I see.

549
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,660
Anyway, I’ll go ahead. Enjoy!

550
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,310
You too. Cheers!

551
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,760
Miss Fernandez.

552
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,230
Cap!

553
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,300
Why are you here?

554
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,590
Why not? I’m also invited.

555
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:04,680
I mean why aren’t you
with Giselle?

556
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,980
Well, nothing.

557
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,480
So, where’s your husband?

558
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,820
- Sorry, I’m late.
- There he is.

559
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,880
The traffic was bad.

560
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:20,330
Hey! You better have some
shots, you can’t skip.

561
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:23,370
Black Label is all that’s left?
Damn, I don’t like that.

562
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,860
- Jeez!
- We can buy more bottles.

563
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,830
I didn’t ask you.

564
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,180
Sure, go ahead and order bro.

565
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,000
What do you want?

566
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,540
A drink you can’t handle.

567
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,240
None.

568
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,910
All right then,
let’s go with this.

569
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,100
Okay.

570
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,130
Let’s do it.

571
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:05,990
Still good?

572
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,960
Easy.

573
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,460
You already look drunk
after one shot.

574
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:15,250
If you only know what
we drink in Dapitan.

575
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,130
This is nothing.

576
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:29,180
What’s with these two?
An ego contest?

577
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,080
Okay, let’s go.

578
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,480
One more.

579
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,510
So, you’re an engineer?

580
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,130
Yes.

581
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,830
And you’re a pilot?

582
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,770
Pilot-engineer.

583
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,050
Sorry.

584
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,900
Can you keep up?

585
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,280
Of course.

586
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,440
Okay.

587
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,090
Don't worry.
We’re just starting.

588
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,980
Hey, stop it both of you.
This is alcohol poisoning.

589
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,710
Stop acting like kids!

590
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,260
Your wife’s mad at you.

591
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,200
Wife? What the hell!

592
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,610
Fuck this. Why am I
always dragged into this?

593
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,430
Why is it always me?

594
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,740
I’m out of here.

595
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,020
Hey!

596
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,610
Hey.

597
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,860
He’s not your husband?

598
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,860
Huh?

599
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,280
No. I’m not married.

600
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,430
Miss Fernandez.

601
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,600
Can we talk?

602
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,950
Sure. About what?

603
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,570
I’m sorry for
what happened last night.

604
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:45,220
And I wasn’t able to
find your engineer, Sevi.

605
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,530
Could you please
tell him I’m sorry?

606
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,580
Okay.

607
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,730
Is that all?

608
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:58,130
And also, I have
something for you.

609
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,830
Here you go.

610
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,970
Deed of sale?

611
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:10,620
Wow! Perfect timing,
I had to commute today.

612
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,320
Actually the car
is parked already.

613
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:17,600
You can use it once we get back.
And it’s in full tank.

614
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,270
Wow!

615
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,930
Thank you very much.

616
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,200
What happened?
Why is he suddenly so kind?

617
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,740
Anyway.

618
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,740
Let’s go. We can’t be late
for our flight to Japan.

619
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,300
That’s Princess Ola.

620
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,170
Her favorite doll, right?

621
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,930
Huh? Her favorite doll?

622
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,900
You know Avi?
You know your child?

623
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,500
I’ll make mommy
look like Princess Ola.

624
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,820
You look cute.

625
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,310
You're coming to my party, right?

626
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,240
It’s for her.

627
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,200
A special gift.

628
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,970
Wear this.

629
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,780
That’s a gift from your daddy.

630
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,970
Really, Mommy?

631
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,470
Avi, your mommy.

632
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,330
Sam, I have a problem.
I don’t know what to do.

633
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,480
What is it?

634
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,800
Hiro’s the pilot.

635
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,050
I like your hair clip.

636
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,680
Thank you,
my daddy gave it to me.
