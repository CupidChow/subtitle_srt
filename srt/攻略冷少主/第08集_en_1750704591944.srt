1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,720
My rear may feel Nue Island holding me

2
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,260
Totally

3
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,700
I can only baby

4
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,900
Feel it

5
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,100
estate

6
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,560
Leave me alone

7
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,380
They will not regret this life

8
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,540
Chin isuk BC

9
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,780
Let's fight and soon

10
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,900
Meeting

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 16

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Why are you laughing?

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I thought you were a great woman.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I didn't expect that Chu's kiss skill

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
is just like that.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What are you talking about?

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This is a beautiful scenery.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Chu really doesn't understand the scenery.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Are you crazy?

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I...

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I can teach you.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll teach you a bad thing.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Have you seen enough?

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Still not kneeling?

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm going to the toilet.

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You little bastard.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You didn't do anything to me.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're so unprofessional.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But what did I say?

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I can teach you.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This big devil.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Just called himself my son.

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And called me Sister Chu.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Could it be that

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
someone is in the house?

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The one who is in the house is you.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The one who is in the house is you.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's weird.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Why is the light off?

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Don't come over.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Chu Chu.

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Are you OK?

44
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
My wife means a lot to me.

45
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And she's trying to get back.

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Dream on.

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're stupid.

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Chu Chu,

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
12 knots.

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
They've broken the knot already,

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
but they actually have a lot of energy.

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's open now.

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't tell anyone.

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
They can steal.

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
No one can steal.

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,200
When do you have time to joke?

57
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,640
Master, Madam,

58
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,360
I wish you two a happy wedding.

59
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,400
This is the fish I caught for you.

60
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,040
Brother Lin, why are you here?

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Brother Lin, don't!

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Brother Lin!

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Brother Lin!

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Brother Lin, don't!

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What are you yelling for?

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm not dead.

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What happened to me just now?

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You were dreaming about your pants?

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Brother Lin,

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I had a nightmare just now.

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It was so scary.

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I dreamed that you took a knife...

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Brother Lin!

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Where are you going?

75
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's too boring.

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm going out for a walk.

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Then why are you holding a sword?

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
A martial artist doesn't need a sword.

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What about a fish fork?

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Don't! Don't!

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What do you want to do?

82
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
My heart suddenly feels so unsteady.

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It hurts.

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Wake up.

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Don't fall asleep.

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Madam, I'm afraid I can't.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
This...

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But I have one last wish.

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Tell me.

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Listen to Madam.

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Call me...

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
...the husband.

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay.

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Husband. Husband.

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
As long as you're fine,

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll call you like this every day.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Okay.

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Okay.

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Then I'm blessed.

100
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You're not hurt.

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You lied to me.

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I didn't lie to you.

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
There was someone outside the bed just now.

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
There was someone outside the bed.

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What happened just now?

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
According to the agreement,

107
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
after our wedding,

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Feng Yu Valley will hand over the Xiao Yao Trial to you.

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The wedding night is so unbearable.

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It seems that someone really wants to stop this.

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You mean,

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
the one who wants to kill you is Feng Yu Valley's people?

113
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
They're too bad.

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Too bad?

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I accidentally revealed my weakness just now.

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I hit him.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Now,

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I've already made a fool of myself.

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It depends on whether I can get the fish or not.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Then I'll leave this to you.

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'll go back first.

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
On the day of the wedding,

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
the red candle hasn't been lit.

124
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Husband is seriously injured.

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't know how many eyes will be staring at this house tonight.

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So,

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
you can't go back.

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Uncle Xian,

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
we're just acting today.

130
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You can't cross the thunder.

131
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Even if it's acting,

132
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll be there.

133
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'll be there.

134
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll be there.

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'll be there.

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll be there.

137
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Even if it's acting,

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
you have to act it out.

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Or,

140
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
you have to attract more people's attention.

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Don't be so stubborn.

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Don't worry, Madam.

143
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'll

144
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
protect you.

145
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
He's acting like me again.

146
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Someone is there.

147
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'll go.

148
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You're leaving?

149
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You can't go back?

150
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
No one was there just now.

151
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You're so stubborn.

152
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Sorry.

153
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I forgot that your chest was injured again.

154
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's okay.

155
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'll be fine after a rest.

156
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Just now,

157
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
it wasn't a miscalculation, right?

158
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He's so disheveled.

159
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
He suddenly

160
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
became so cold.

161
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Are you okay?

162
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yes.

163
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Listen.

164
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's so windy tonight.

165
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It must be cold outside.

166
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Don't go out for a walk tonight.

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
How about

168
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
we drink some wine together to cool down?

169
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We've known each other for so long.

170
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But we haven't had a drink together.

171
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Drink.

172
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Are you sure?

173
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Don't drink if you can't.

174
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Lin.

175
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I know you're sad.

176
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Are you crazy?

177
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Why should I be sad?

178
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You can't beat him.

179
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Him?

180
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What do you want to say?

181
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Nan Chuimeng.

182
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
My master.

183
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You can't beat him.

184
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I know you like my teacher.

185
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But...

186
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But I don't want to see you die.

187
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You stopped me today.

188
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Just for this?

189
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You're my brother.

190
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm afraid you'll be sad.

191
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I didn't expect this kid to be so loyal.

192
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Why are you up so early?

194
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Did I wake you up?

195
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
No.

196
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I just found that after I woke up,

197
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
you were gone.

198
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I thought you didn't want to take responsibility.

199
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Nonsense.

200
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I didn't do anything last night.

201
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So you want to do something to me.

202
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
All right.

203
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
All right.

204
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You're still injured.

205
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Go inside and rest.

206
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Go inside.

207
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I made you some soup.

208
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You drank it.

209
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's good for your brain.

210
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm sorry, brother Lin.

211
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Last night, I was afraid you were too sad

212
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
because of your wife's wedding.

213
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So...

214
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Drink it.

215
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What?

216
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Are you afraid I'll poison you?

217
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
No, no.

218
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm thinking

219
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
you're good at martial arts.

220
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You take good care of people.

221
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You're so careful.

222
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
If you were a woman,

223
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
what would you do if I were a woman?

224
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I was thinking

225
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
if you were a woman, I would like you.

226
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
If Nan Chuimeng is hit by your Yunshui Palm,

227
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
he will die.

228
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Then everyone will think

229
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
the people of Jingyun Villa killed Nan Chuimeng.

230
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's a good chance.

231
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I think that boy

232
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
wishes you two a happy wedding.

233
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You're so polite.

234
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Brother Nan,

235
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
what's wrong with you?

236
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Why are you injured?

237
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
To be honest,

238
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
last night,

239
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
when I was in the wedding room with Chuimeng,

240
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I was attacked by an assassin.

241
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I was injured by the assassin.

242
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I didn't expect that

243
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
this kind of thing would happen

244
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
in the Wind and Rain Valley.

245
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't know if you

246
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
can see the assassin's face clearly last night.

247
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I can send someone to investigate this matter.

248
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's a pity

249
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
that it was late at night

250
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
and I didn't see the assassin's face clearly.

251
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But

252
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
looking at the palm,

253
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
it looks like the kungfu of Jingyun Villa.

254
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Kungfu?

255
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Nan Chuimeng,

256
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
do you think I sent someone to attack you?

257
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Don't worry, Madam.

258
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Even if it's the kungfu of Jingyun Villa,

259
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
it may not be the people of Jingyun Villa.

260
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You're slandering me.

261
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Brother,

262
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
tell me,

263
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
do you think I would do

264
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
such a hurtful thing?

265
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
No, no, no.

266
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
In order to avoid any conflict,

267
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'll investigate this matter now.

268
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Thank you, Brother.

269
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Nan Chuimeng,

270
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll fight with you in the court.

271
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Finally, the mystery is solved.

272
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It turns out that the assassin last night was Zhou Heng.

273
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Zhou Heng is not good at martial arts.

274
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That palm is a perfect match for him.

275
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It can't be him.

276
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Then,

277
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
that's Bai Wuxian.

278
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You're so smart.

279
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Don't talk nonsense.

280
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
There's no one here.

281
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Why should we play a game?

282
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
There's a flower on your hair.

283
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's a lotus flower.

284
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But the flower season has passed.

285
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Lotus flower?

286
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Lotus flowers bloom

287
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
every year.

288
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
They are all in the lotus season.

289
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Every year,

290
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
let's enjoy the flowers together.

291
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Well,

292
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
did you want to hold my hand just now?

293
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You want to?

294
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What are you waiting for?

295
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Let's go.

296
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Let's go.

297
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Yan,

298
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
what's good about it?

299
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What are these?

300
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
These weapons and secret weapons

301
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
are all fighting stuff.

302
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Aren't they fresh?

303
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What's going on?

304
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The pattern on the jade pendant

305
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
and the workmanship

306
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
look like the Linglang Pavilion in the Dream City.

307
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yan,

308
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
who sent this jade pendant?

309
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The pattern looks strange.

310
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I've never seen it.

311
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
The gift list...

312
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm here to congratulate you, Master.

313
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Congratulations on your 100th year of marriage.

314
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
We'll be together forever.

315
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
This jade pendant

316
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
is given by the Star of Baili.

317
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Star of Baili?

318
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Madam,

319
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm the eldest son of the Master of the Dream City,

320
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Star of Baili.

321
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
That's right.

322
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's this young man.

323
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I was so sleepy

324
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
that I didn't know how far I was from him.

325
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I remember before I lit the incense

326
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I was still a little princess.

327
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
The Star of Baili

328
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Qian,

329
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
have a try.

330
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
No, no.

331
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The incense you gave me last time

332
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
made me think I was a man

333
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
after using it.

334
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I almost entered the South Wing.

335
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Greetings, Princess.

336
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
These are the jewelry you ordered

337
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
for your meeting with the Master of the Dream City,

338
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Mr. Di.

339
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
This bracelet is specially made

340
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
with the best jade.

341
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
The texture is glossy and the taste is good.

342
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Princess, why don't you try it?

343
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I remember now.

344
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
He is my 65th blind date.

345
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
He is quiet and introverted.

346
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
He only knows how to laugh.

347
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
He is different from others.

348
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What are you doing?

349
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Ask Princess.

350
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Can you eat well?

351
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Princess,

352
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
can you eat well?

353
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Very tasty.

354
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I like to eat many dishes.

355
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
How did you know?

356
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What...

357
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What did you ask?

358
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What did you ask?

359
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I just want to know

360
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
if you like it.

361
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
What did you ask?

362
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
This is fate.

363
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
No, no.

364
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
This is fate.

365
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I like everything

366
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
that you like to eat.

367
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Today, we met for the first time.

368
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
My name has been spread

369
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
all over the Dream City.

370
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
No need to count.

371
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Why don't you introduce yourself?

372
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I am Bai Li Xing Chen,

373
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
the eldest son of the Master of the Dream City.

374
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I came here today

375
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
to find a suitable woman to get married.

376
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I wonder if you...

377
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
What do you think is suitable?

378
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
What kind of woman do you like?

379
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Marriage

380
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
should be in line with the family.

381
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Just like you,

382
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
you are like my family.

383
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
As for...

384
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
As for...

385
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
As for...

386
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
A woman,

387
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
what kind of woman?

388
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Right.

389
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
My mother said

390
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
a married woman should marry someone

391
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
who is good at everything.

392
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's better not to show yourself.

393
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You should be at home

394
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and open a business for my family.

395
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
How can you say that

396
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
in front of me?

397
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Apologize to the princess.

398
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Mother,

399
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
you said that yourself.

400
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I...

401
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Hello, Princess.

402
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Hello, Madam.

403
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Mr. Bai Li,

404
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
what else did your mother say?

405
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
If you want to marry into our family,

406
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
it's better to close the Ningxiang room

407
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
that is not allowed to enter.

408
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It's not good for girls to stay outside.

409
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Right, mother?

410
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
My mother also said that

411
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
you are still young and not married.

412
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You must be a strange and arrogant person.

413
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Princess,

414
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I am not a strange person.

415
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I am a man of good character.

416
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Princess,

417
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I didn't mean that.

418
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You are.

419
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I am not.

420
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You are.

421
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Madam,

422
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
what you did today

423
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
and what your son said

424
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
really made me open my eyes.

425
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But

426
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I still want to thank you two

427
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
for testing this earth incense for me.

428
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The effect is not bad.

429
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Princess.

430
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Princess.

431
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
This...

432
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
What are you doing?

433
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Mother, you are fat.

434
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Get out of the way.

435
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Get out.

436
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Why does she look like this now?

437
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
After the blind date,

438
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
she came out to work after the marriage.

439
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
White Star.

440
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Madam,

441
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
did you hear my name?

442
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:22,100
I am just a

443
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
White Star,

444
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I have something to ask you.

445
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Come with me.

446
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
No.

447
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Master.

448
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You know each other.

449
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
We know each other.

450
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Why don't you know each other?

451
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Madam.

452
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
We haven't met before.

453
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Master,

454
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
since I have sent the gift,

455
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I will leave now.

456
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Stop.

457
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Madam, you are so self-righteous.

458
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
You really mistook me.

459
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
What are you doing?

460
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
He is my partner in the dream city.

461
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I have to ask him

462
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
how he came here

463
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and how I should go back.

464
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Partner?

465
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Stop.

466
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Song.

467
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
What are you doing here?

468
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I know him.

469
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
He is my roommate.

470
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
You have met him before.

471
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Did he say anything strange?

472
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Did he do anything strange?

473
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You fool.

474
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
There are too many strange words and actions.

475
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Why are you asking this?

476
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
He is my previous partner in the marriage.

477
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
But he doesn't remember me.

478
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But I have something

479
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
very important to ask him.

480
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I can't let him run away.

481
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Why are you so careless?

482
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It's a stormy place.

483
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
If you get too close to other men,

484
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
it's hard to make people doubt you.

485
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Sister, you didn't say I almost forgot.

486
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Last night,

487
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
someone deliberately led me away.

488
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Then they used the trick of the mountain villa

489
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
to kill Nan Chuimeng and give you the dowry.

490
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Mr. Nan said

491
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
he was Bai Wuxian.

492
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
He is really losing his temper.

493
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I'm afraid he will force it.

494
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
But I really have something important to ask him.

495
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Can you help me ask him out tonight?

496
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
He is your partner in marriage.

497
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
We don't like each other at all.

498
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's all my mother's arrangement.

499
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Don't worry.

500
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Tonight at dawn,

501
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I will bring the stars to the court.

502
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
The Heart-Saving Skill,

503
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
it's really useful to deal with the poison in your body.

504
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
If you can learn the whole book,

505
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
your injuries may be cured.

506
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Little Cicada,

507
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
they must not want to teach Chuimeng to be a good girl.

508
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Little Cicada,

509
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
they must not want to teach Chuimeng to be a good girl.

510
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
In order to stop her from learning martial arts,

511
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Bai Wuxian

512
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
should have other moves.

513
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
The letter.

514
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I think they have seen it.

515
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Should we

516
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
use the snake to move?

517
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Bai Xun's Chu's martial arts are good.

518
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
If you can

519
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
send the Heaven's clan back in five days,

520
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
no one will know that you assassinated Nan Chuimeng.

521
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Otherwise,

522
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I will make Bai Xun lose his reputation.

523
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Master,

524
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
what should we do?

525
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You went to see Nan Chuimeng today.

526
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Did he say anything to you?

527
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
He said that the skill was made by Jingyun Villa.

528
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
But he has feelings for Chu Mengdie.

529
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So he took it over.

530
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Did he say that

531
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
someone else knows about it?

532
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You go and do something.

533
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
The Flower Festival next year,

534
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
let's enjoy the flowers together.

535
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I just found out that you are a devil.

536
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Why did the star of Baili appear?

537
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Could it be the will of God?

538
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It's time to go back.

539
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I haven't separated from him yet.

540
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I have to go back.

541
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I have to go back.

542
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Why can't I part with him?

543
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Lin, why did you ask me to meet here?

544
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
What do you want to say?

545
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Madam,

546
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
why are you here?

547
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
You won't...

548
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Sheng and Lin,

549
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
you two...

550
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
You are a jerk.

551
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I'm here to see you.

552
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Okay.

553
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I know.

554
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It's not convenient for you to say it in the daytime.

555
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Now you and I are alone.

556
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Just say it.

557
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
What do I say?

558
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
When did you come?

559
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Do you know how to go back to Zimeng City?

560
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Have you seen my mother before?

561
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Is she okay?

562
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Sheng Ying, what are you talking about?

563
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I don't understand.

564
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Are you still pretending to be stupid?

565
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I ask you,

566
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
how did you come?

567
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm asking you.

568
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I came here.

569
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I'm not asking you this.

570
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm asking you how you came here.

571
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I walked here.

572
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I...

573
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Okay, I'll change the way.

574
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
How did you come here?

575
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I walked here step by step.

576
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
There was a waterway in the middle.

577
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Waterway?

578
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You also came from Hu Xin Ting?

579
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Madam,

580
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I don't have a pavilion at home.

581
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I came by boat.

582
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Enough.

583
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Qin Chen,

584
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
you don't plan to tell me the truth, right?

585
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I...

586
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Okay.

587
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'll go to Nan Chui.

588
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I told him that you were bad-mannered.

589
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You asked me out on purpose.

590
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You have thoughts about me.

591
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I'll make you lose your master.

592
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
No, Madam.

593
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
What do you want to do?

594
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I'll agree to it.

595
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
That's right.

596
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
But can you

597
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
not say bad things about me?

598
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Then you answer my question seriously.

599
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
After all, only when you tell the truth

600
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
can we find a way to go back.

601
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Where?

602
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'm sorry.

603
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000

I'm sorry.

609
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I'm sorry.

00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I'm sorry.

621
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I'm sorry.

622
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'm sorry.

623
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm sorry.
