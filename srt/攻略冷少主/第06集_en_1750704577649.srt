1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,280
My fingers are like the dust on the ground.

2
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,480
I'm not willing to leave you.

3
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,560
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,880
I only love you.

5
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,920
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,240
You're the only one I can love.

7
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,320
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,640
I regret this life.

9
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,680
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,160
I'm willing to sacrifice myself for you.

11
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,280
I'm willing to witness it.

12
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 16

14
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,840
I think you're a ghost.

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,560
Lin... Lin Shu?

16
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,840
What... What are you going to do?

17
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,520
What do you think?

18
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,600
I...

19
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,480
You...

20
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,040
Young Master San San?

21
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,000
He's Chong Meng Tie?

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,160
Tell me.

23
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,200
Who are you?

24
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,960
I...

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,800
I'm your...

26
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,840
Calm down.

27
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,160
Heroine Lin,

28
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,640
since the last competition,

29
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,080
I've been thinking about your voice.

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,240
Your movements,

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,600
your expression,

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,440
and your body shape.

33
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,560
I have to think about it every night

34
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,200
several times before I can sleep.

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,960
I've made up my mind then.

36
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,040
I must find a chance

37
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,000
to be your woman.

38
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,480
You know I'm a woman?

39
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,280
You said it yourself.

40
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,720
You said I pretended to be you,

41
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,360
and your three-color bracelet was exposed.

42
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Then when you see me here,

43
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,680
aren't you afraid that I'll kill you?

44
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,320
No, of course not.

45
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,400
Heroine Chu,

46
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,520
your name is Yuan Yang.

47
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,600
How can you kill someone

48
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,880
who can't even hold a sword?

49
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,280
Right?

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,160
Why did you pretend to be me?

51
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,200
Did I know I was wrong?

52
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,800
I didn't pretend on purpose.

53
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,600
It was that Gu...

54
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,640
The man who only cares about killing people, Nanchui Meng.

55
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,880
He forced me

56
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,280
to pretend to be you

57
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,840
and help him get the Bracelet.

58
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,560
If I don't agree,

59
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,560
he'll kill me.

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,960
He even forced a man

61
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,800
who is cruel

62
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,920
for his own sake.

63
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,440
If I marry him,

64
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,080
he'll probably kill me too.

65
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,160
Exactly.

66
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,400
If I had other choices,

67
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,560
I wouldn't take the risk.

68
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Am I right?

69
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,200
Nanchui Meng

70
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,520
is really a traitor.

71
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,800
Yes.

72
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,520
Miss, don't worry.

73
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,520
I'll think of a way for you.

74
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,800
You'll learn the new method

75
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,880
in a few days, right?

76
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,880
Yes.

77
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,760
I'll write a new method

78
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,640
that will make you feel no mistakes.

79
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,480
After Nanchui Meng's cultivation,

80
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,400
he'll die from the fire.

81
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,440
Then you can get rid of him.

82
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,840
Is this a help from God?

83
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,040
I really don't know how to deal with Gu Yuan now.

84
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
Okay.

85
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,240
Thank you, Miss.

86
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,760
Gu Yuan

87
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,320
Thank you, Lin.

88
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
I'm exhausted.

89
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
No, no.

90
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,320
Lin.

91
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,320
Light it up for me.

92
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,480
Light it up, Lin.

93
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,480
What are you doing?

94
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,960
Lin, you don't know.

95
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,080
I came to see my master just now.

96
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,720
I didn't want to fail,

97
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,160
but he did.

98
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,800
But I believe

99
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,520
that he's testing me.

100
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
Come on. Light it up.

101
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,760
Lin.

102
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,560
How about this pose?

103
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,640
Light it up for me.

104
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,960
After my master sees it,

105
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,640
he'll be moved by my pose.

106
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
Then he'll take me as his apprentice.

107
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,440
Lin.

108
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,360
Master.

109
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,360
This is the lunch meal made by your order.

110
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,720
Are we really going to give the

111
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
Xiaoyao Bureau to Chu Mengdie?

112
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,720
Is there no other way?

113
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,720
Mu Hua.

114
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
What your father-in-law taught her

115
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
is just the new method of entering the school.

116
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Entering the school?

117
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
The real secret

118
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
has been sealed for more than 20 years.

119
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,720
It's not that easy to learn.

120
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,720
So you mean

121
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,720
the skill is gone?

122
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,720
I don't know where the paper is.

123
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
As for the paper,

124
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,720
Chu Wuya took it away.

125
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
I think it's been destroyed long ago.

126
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
He took it back with great effort

127
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
and destroyed it.

128
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
You were just fooling around.

129
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,720
I'm not.

130
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
There are some things

131
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
that are not there

132
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
and more important than there are.

133
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
Do you understand?

134
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,720
No.

135
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Then help me to fold the quilt.

136
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Master.

137
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
How is it, master?

138
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,720
Do you feel comfortable?

139
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
I'm fine.

140
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Did he see me and Chu Mengdie?

141
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
It's hard to tell.

142
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Are you in such a hurry?

143
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
He just said

144
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
he would sign my new method tomorrow.

145
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
I don't know martial arts.

146
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
I'll recite it and copy it for you.

147
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
Just in case,

148
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
wear these tomorrow.

149
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Your clothes are so heavy.

150
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Put it on.

151
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
You know it's dangerous.

152
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
I should take the risk to learn the Demon-slaying Trial.

153
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,800
So why do you need to care about me with these things?

154
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
This is the contract between us.

155
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
The Demon-slaying Trial is very important to me.

156
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
I'm not afraid of it.

157
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
But the Demon-slaying Trial is very important to me.

158
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
I must get it.

159
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,880
Of course,

160
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,880
I will do my best to protect you.

161
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
Devil,

162
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,880
I'm going to hurt you.

163
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
Don't be nice to me now.

164
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Okay, thank you.

165
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,880
Protect yourself tomorrow.

166
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,880
Wow,

167
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,880
your wedding dress is so beautiful.

168
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,880
Didn't you just go to see Li?

169
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,880
How is it?

170
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,880
Did she give you a fake one

171
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,880
in return?

172
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,880
I didn't ask for it.

173
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,880
I was concerned about her.

174
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,880
She should be moved by me.

175
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
Besides,

176
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,880
the Demon-slaying Trial is useless to her.

177
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,880
I don't know what to do with her.

178
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,960
She doesn't know how to use martial arts.

179
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,960
She won't lie to me in this matter.

180
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Brother Nan,

181
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,960
are you asleep?

182
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
I miss you.

183
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
I have something to ask you.

184
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,960
Is this the wedding dress we're going to wear when we get married?

185
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
It looks good.

186
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,960
Why are you here?

187
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,960
I forgot. I'll try it on first.

188
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
How is it?

189
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,960
Is it good?

190
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
What's that expression?

191
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,960
Is it good?

192
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,960
It's good.

193
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,960
Forget it.

194
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,960
I don't want to argue with you,

195
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
a person who doesn't know beauty.

196
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,960
If this is in our Dream City,

197
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,960
I don't know how many people are

198
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,960
trying to get into this business.

199
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
I'm afraid that

200
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
you can't get into it.

201
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
I'm afraid that

202
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,040
I don't know how many people are

203
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,040
trying to get into this business.

204
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,040
What?

205
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
You miss home?

206
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
Who wouldn't miss home?

207
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
But I can go back soon.

208
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Go home?

209
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,040
Master,

210
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
he's here.

211
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,040
Xie Sheng Fang

212
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,040
killed someone.

213
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,040
What did he say?

214
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,040
It's ridiculous.

215
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,040
Could it be the new law?

216
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,040
He said goodbye.

217
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,040
He said goodbye.

218
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
He sold his house to the East Yin.

219
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
He sold his house to the East Yin.

220
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
He sold his house to the East Yin.

221
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,120
Feng Chi

222
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,120
is in a bad mood.

223
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,120
He's going to say good things to me.

224
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
He's going to say good things to me.

225
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,120
He's going to say good things to me.

226
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,120
He's so good at painting,

227
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,120
he's so good at painting.

228
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,120
So good.

229
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,120
That's it?

230
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
It seems that

231
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,120
Xiao Yao's new law is not difficult.

232
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Thank you for teaching me the new law.

233
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,200
I'll leave now.

234
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Shi Zhi,

235
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
you haven't taught me the new law.

236
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Why are you leaving?

237
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,200
Didn't you just teach me the new law?

238
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,200
I was reading the dinner last night.

239
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
I'm here.

240
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,280
Xiao Yao's new law is here.

241
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,280
In order to avoid being incited,

242
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,280
you can't be greedy.

243
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,280
You can only have one night a day.

244
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,280
You have to keep a record.

245
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
Thank you, Master.

246
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
I understand.

247
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Can you understand?

248
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,360
Meng Die,

249
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,360
how many more days do I need?

250
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,360
No rush.

251
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,360
No rush.

252
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,360
No wonder he was able to become a hero.

253
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,360
He's so good at talking.

254
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
Ordinary people can't understand.

255
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Okay.

256
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
Okay.

257
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
Okay.

258
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
Okay.

259
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
Okay.

260
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,440
Okay.

261
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,440
Two little girls.

262
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
They were all in a daze.

263
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Suddenly, they saw a mountain.

264
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,440
Chu Meng Die really did this.

265
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,440
Absolutely true.

266
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,440
I saw it with my own eyes.

267
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
Chu Meng Die must be trying to blend

268
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
the upper and lower joints of the xiao yao jue.

269
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,440
Master,

270
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,440
the lower joints of the xiao yao jue

271
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,440
are indeed indescribable.

272
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,440
I just gave up on the action

273
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,440
and felt my body was sore.

274
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,440
Go and record Chu Meng Die's actions one by one.

275
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
Come back and show me again.

276
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,520
In case of any mistakes.

277
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
It's time for the xiao yao jue

278
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
to learn from its own people.

279
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,520
Yes.

280
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
Xiao yao jue.

281
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,520
Xiao yao jue.

282
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,520
Xiao yao jue.

283
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,520
Xiao yao jue.

284
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,600
Xiao yao jue.

285
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Xiao yao jue.

286
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Done.

287
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,600
This set is a combination of action and fusion.

288
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
The mind is so clear.

289
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,600
The method of memorizing the body is really great.

290
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Although the xiao yao jue is difficult to understand,

291
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,680
it's too difficult to learn.

292
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,680
I can learn it in less than three days.

293
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,680
You're so good.

294
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,680
Wait.

295
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,680
I can't see the beauty of things.

296
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,680
Let's enjoy the whole set of soup together.

297
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,680
I won't eat it anymore.

298
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
Meng Die.

299
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,760
Thanks to Sun Si Miao's gold and silver,

300
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,760
he left this jade dragon.

301
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
If you keep it like this,

302
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
you're not only the best heroine in the world,

303
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,760
but also the most beautiful woman in the world.

304
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
It's good.

305
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
It's okay not to want it.

306
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,760
What?

307
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,760
Can't it be that someone in the world has already accepted it?

308
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,760
It's Princess of the Sun Moon Palace, Gu Yuan.

309
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,760
She?

310
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
A beauty?

311
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
The world is also a beauty.

312
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,680
Everyone is a beauty.

313
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,680
It is said that Gu Yuan has dragon hair and phoenix hair.

314
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,680
The moon is hot and the spring is long.

315
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,680
The spring is cold and the spring is cold.

316
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,680
It is said that

317
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,680
she is a devil who can't eat and can't shoot.

318
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,680
That's right.

319
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
Even this kind of beauty

320
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,680
is hard to cover for her evil deeds.

321
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,680
Gu Yuan is a demon.

322
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,680
He is cruel and ruthless.

323
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,680
Before, the righteous sects of the world joined forces to entangle the demon sect.

324
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,680
After Gu Yuan escaped,

325
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
he killed four big sects.

326
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
Many innocent people died.

327
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,680
It's so miserable to be a demon.

328
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,680
In the script,

329
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,680
he was written into such a dead man.

330
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,680
The wedding dress he gave me yesterday was pretty good.

331
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
It's a pity.

332
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,680
I'm going home.

333
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
You are so cool.

334
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,680
Right?

335
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,680
I'm going.

336
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
Song.

337
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,680
Why are you here?

338
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,680
You called me that.

339
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,680
Are you crazy?

340
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,680
You and that Lin Shu

341
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,680
are having an open room in the inn?

342
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,680
No.

343
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,680
When he and I came out,

344
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,680
we just ran into each other.

345
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,680
And Lin Shu is a man.

346
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,680
How could I live with him?

347
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,680
You two

348
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,680
are holding a box.

349
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,680
What are you doing here?

350
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,680
This is the wedding dress you ordered.

351
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,680
The young master asked me to show it to you.

352
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
I'll just go back and see.

353
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
Why do you bring it here?

354
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
What about this?

355
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,680
Open it yourself.

356
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,680
Open it yourself.

357
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,680
Open it yourself.

358
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,680
Open it yourself.

359
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
Han Yan said you like this kind of cake.

360
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,680
But the cooks here

361
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,680
can't make animal's female dishes.

362
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
So I specially...

363
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
What's wrong?

364
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,680
So Han Yan specially asked someone to make it.

365
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
To help you get along with each other.

366
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,680
He obviously wants to be nice to me.

367
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
And he didn't say it.

368
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Open it yourself.

369
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,680
It really tastes like the most strange.

370
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
It's not good.

371
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
It's so bad.

372
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,680
Then don't eat it.

373
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
Our Gu...

374
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,680
Young master Nan.

375
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,680
I advise you not to do these things to please me.

376
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,680
You'd better practice hard.

377
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,680
Send me home early.

378
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,680
Okay.

379
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
Open it.

380
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,680
Men are all like this.

381
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,680
Using some little kindness and little kindness,

382
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,680
they think they can buy others.

383
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,680
Let me learn the dance for him.

384
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,680
Actually, they even sent someone to spy on me.

385
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,680
Even come out to soak a soup.

386
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
Li Song.

387
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,680
He's using you.

388
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,680
He's not sincere at all.

389
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,680
Today, Nan Chun Meng has already noticed.

390
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,680
Don't meet him directly in the future.

391
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,680
Let's contact in a different way.

392
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,440
Don't getopolitical.

393
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,840
Gotit.

394
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,920
The manuals areITTES.

395
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,680
It can also read and read.

396
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,680
Now, sister Li starts using attunments.

397
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,680
She can't understand it,

398
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,680
And she can't make an attunment at a glance.

399
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,680
It should be tube-cut like this.

400
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
Brother Lin.

401
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,520
I'm back.

402
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,360
Tell me.

403
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,120
How can I defeat Master?

404
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,000
Nanchui Meng is a man of style.

405
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,480
He's not a man of good character.

406
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,960
Why do you insist on him?

407
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,320
Isn't it good?

408
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,240
He promoted me as his disciple.

409
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,360
He taught me martial arts.

410
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,840
I taught him to be a man.

411
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,640
You're so stubborn.

412
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,720
Hmm?

413
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,800
A star.

414
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,520
What are you looking at?

415
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,680
Nothing.

416
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,200
We're partners in the first group.

417
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,640
You can't hide your feelings.

418
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,640
Don't touch other people's stuff.

419
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,480
Let me see.

420
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,600
Why are you so petty?

421
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
Sleep.

422
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,600
The air is deep and the earth is sweet.

423
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,480
Get up.

424
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,720
Shake.

425
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,240
Hit.

426
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,920
What kind of martial arts are you practicing?

427
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,520
Chu Mengdie did it.

428
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,160
I've never seen anyone who practices martial arts.

429
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,720
They know it's a rose and a drop.

430
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,280
You're so insolent.

431
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:47,800
Get out.

432
00:23:49,680 --> 00:24:09,640
、

433
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,680
Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu, can you hear me?

434
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,680
Song'er, listen to me.

435
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,920
I've changed the heart method you gave me.

436
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,520
As long as you teach him,

437
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,960
let him rest in peace,

438
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,720
he will definitely be able to get through it.

439
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,200
Mengdie, you're so reliable.

440
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,560
Be careful.

441
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,280
Lin Xiu, hug me.

442
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,240
Lin Xiu, hug me.

443
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,240
Braised spinach with strong ginseng,

444
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,440
stir-fried mung bean sprouts with green beans,

445
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,680
cold green bamboo shoots,

446
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,840
and green bean porridge.

447
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,160
I made this for you.

448
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,320
Please try it.

449
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,480
Why don't you eat?

450
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,240
Do you know your current identity?

451
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,960
My identity?

452
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,040
Did he find out

453
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,760
the secret plan between me and Chu Mengdie?

454
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,520
You're my wife,

455
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,320
who's still single.

456
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,360
Today, you're in the Feng Yu Valley

457
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,800
and you're chatting with another man.

458
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,520
If others see you like this,

459
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,680
what will they think?

460
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,240
Chatting?

461
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,000
Are you talking about me and Lin Shu?

462
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,200
No wonder you made a table of green dishes.

463
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,560
So that's the reason.

464
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,520
During the contract,

465
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,880
you're my wife

466
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,640
and you went to meet another man.

467
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,960
I signed the contract,

468
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,880
but I didn't sell it to you.

469
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,720
I can't meet another man.

470
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,000
Don't be angry.

471
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,000
The new law of Xiaoyao is all in your mouth.

472
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,560
When I get the upper hand,

473
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,920
you have to send me home.

474
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,640
But Lin Shu

475
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,200
is really a man of his word.

476
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,440
It's a common thing.

477
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
Why not?

478
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,720
Just let him do it.

479
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,160
You're a little strange today.

480
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,240
What's strange?

481
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
Today,

482
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,240
I think I added more flavor to the dishes.

483
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,240
I added more vinegar.

484
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,280
You can put in more orange juice if you want.

485
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:51,920
Thanks.

486
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:03,880
Finally.

487
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,760
It works!

488
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,160
I went to the place where Master practices martial arts

489
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,160
and practiced with him.

490
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,280
Finally,

491
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,560
Rong Hui got it through.

492
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,120
I named him

493
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,040
Soul Hall.

494
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,640
Soul Hall.

495
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,040
Sounds like a evil palace.

496
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,520
The name doesn't matter.

497
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,640
What matters is

498
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,480
power.

499
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,360
Hero Lin.

500
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,280
Write it down.

501
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,240
No, I just want to ask

502
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,240
Master.

503
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,640
Subtiles aresnapped in your group chatroom.

504
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,440
Don't just put Steven's friends there.

505
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,000
Go and tell them how you tried at the lights.

506
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,320
Okay, sure.

507
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,800
Don't try to stop me.

508
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,240
It's not fine.

509
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,320
I promise

510
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:07,760
you,

511
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,000
I won't break any relationship

512
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,800
I was wondering why you were so angry

513
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,960
that you couldn't even eat.

514
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,240
You were jealous.

515
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,120
I just broke the contract.

516
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,040
I didn't want her to be suspected in the country.

517
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,840
Tell her

518
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,160
the contract has been changed

519
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,720
and she can remember it.

520
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,760
You are so honest.

521
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,720
You are just like the script.

522
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,760
The script is so bad.

523
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,800
Go.

524
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,600
Go.

525
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,240
Go.

526
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,000
But, Your Highness,

527
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,840
do you really believe Li Song'er?

528
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,000
Even if Li Song'er didn't lie,

529
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,920
would Nan Wentian

530
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,680
really give up

531
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,400
the real novel to the script?

532
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,160
Your Highness,

533
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,720
please think twice.

534
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,320
It's true or false,

535
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,840
we'll know it after we practice.

536
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,440
Mengdie,

537
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,160
your room is a little too...

538
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,040
How could there be a man?

539
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,600
Will he be exposed?

540
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,480
He's just a fool.

541
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,400
He got me beaten up a few days ago.

542
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,240
I guess he won't wake up in two days.

543
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,240
Sit.

544
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,760
How's your progress?

545
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,760
It's a little bit unstable,

546
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,320
but he didn't wake up after reading the novel.

547
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
If nothing goes wrong,

548
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,760
he will be able to

549
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,800
get out of the fire

550
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,360
and die in the fire

551
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,720
at the dawn of the night.

552
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,200
At the dawn of the night?

553
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,040
What's wrong?

554
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:45,920
Nothing.

555
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,440
I was thinking

556
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,720
that it would be quick if we succeed.

557
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,120
Wish you a good luck.

558
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,120
I've brought some wine.

559
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,520
Let's drink first.

560
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,720
Your plan is about to succeed.

561
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,040
Why don't you look happy?

562
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,600
I won't.

563
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,080
When he got into the fire,

564
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,160
it was the day I got home.

565
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,240
I'm very happy.

566
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,440
But if he dies,

567
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,800
the valley master will suspect you.

568
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,920
You will also be in danger.

569
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,320
Don't worry, Sister Chu.

570
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,320
I've already thought of a way.

571
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,200
It's okay.

572
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,320
Even if you are in danger,

573
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,920
I will protect you.

574
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,480
Mengdie.

575
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,080
Thank you.

576
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,120
I will miss you.

577
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,720
Die!

578
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,840
Martial arts.

579
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,720
Just get used to it.

580
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,040
Okay.

581
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,960
I'll go to the toilet.

582
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,560
I'll go to the toilet.

583
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,440
I'll go to the toilet.

584
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,280
I'll go to the toilet.

585
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,040
I'll go to the toilet.

586
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,520
Wait here for me.

587
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,080
I'll go to the toilet.

588
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,480
Here you go.

589
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,400
I got you that ring.

590
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,160
Of course I have to try it.

591
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,880
You are not going to be really happy

592
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,240
It's almost night.

593
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,120
Why are you still dressing up?

594
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,800
I'm bored.

595
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,120
I'm just spending time.

596
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,480
I understand.

597
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:48,360
You're doing this for the

598
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,440
I'm sure you'll be surprised.

599
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,360
Yan.

600
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,800
What if your princess is killed by the enemy?

601
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,280
What will you do?

602
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,960
Of course I'll avenge our princess.

603
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,240
I was just a lonely child.

604
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,160
If it weren't for the princess,

605
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,120
I would have starved to death by the roadside.

606
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,440
I've been with the princess for many years.

607
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,440
I've never seen the princess kill people.

608
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,960
Every time she did it,

609
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,960
it was for self-protection.

610
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,160
I've never seen her kill people.

611
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,160
I've never seen her kill people.

612
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,960
I've never seen her kill people.

613
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,400
I'm innocent.

614
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,880
Actually, the last time I buried you in the soil,

615
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,840
the princess was trying to scare you.

616
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,440
These years,

617
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,640
the princess has been going through a lot

618
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,080
to get back the Pillar of Demons.

619
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,960
All she's doing now

620
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,520
is to avenge her.

621
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,120
Get back the Pillar of Demons?

622
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,800
To avenge her?

623
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,240
Yan.

624
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
What does that mean?

625
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,520
The Pillar of Demons is mine.

626
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,520
It's a pity that everyone in the underworld is so secretive.

627
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,360
They not only took the Pillar of Demons,

628
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,360
but also killed the princess's parents.

629
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,320
They framed us for being the demon sect.

630
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,920
Of course we have to avenge them.

631
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,200
Yan.

632
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,440
Wu Yuan.

633
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,080
Zhangр

634
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,520
I'm afraid I can't help it.

635
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,520
I don't know how to turn back.

636
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,520
Maybe you're looking at me.

637
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:36,520
I'm afraid I can't help it.

638
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,520
Winter flowers are in full bloom.

639
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,520
Spring comes and the love is still here.

640
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:49,520
I'm afraid I can't help it.

641
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,520
Why don't you stand up and dance?

642
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,520
I'll write for you.

643
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,520
I can't wait for the day to come.

644
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,520
I don't want to leave.

645
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,520
I'm going to be a man.

646
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,520
I'm not going to let go of the past.

647
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,520
Why don't you look at me like you used to?

648
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
Red eyes and yellow eyes.

649
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,520
The whole world is a journey.

650
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,520
This life is a journey.

651
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,520
You are the one who returns.

652
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,520
This life is a journey.

653
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,520
You are the one who returns.
