1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,480
My fingers are like the dust on the ground.

2
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,520
I'm not willing to leave my love.

3
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,600
I'm not willing to leave my love.

4
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,920
I only care about my lover.

5
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,960
I'm not willing to leave my love.

6
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,640
You only care about me.

7
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,280
I'll wait.

8
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,360
Please forgive me.

9
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,680
I regret this life.

10
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,720
I won't forgive you.

11
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,840
I'll be with you forever.

12
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,240
I'll be with you forever.

13
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,480
I'll be with you forever.

14
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 18

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,000
Wu Yuan.

17
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,160
Duanmu Tong.

18
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,160
Duanmu Tong.

19
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
Don't scare me.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,440
I shouldn't have believed what others said.

21
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,640
I thought you were a bad person.

22
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,000
If I knew you had your reasons,

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,760
I wouldn't have treated you like this.

24
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,040
You're actually nice to me.

25
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,040
You care about me all the time.

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,120
You even observed my preferences

27
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,480
and bought me good food.

28
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,600
Thank you.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I just want to go back.

30
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,600
I want to say goodbye.

31
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,000
I hope someone can bury you.

32
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
Is this the light that calls me back?

33
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,000
Wu Yuan.

34
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,400
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,760
If you want to hang up,

36
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,680
hang up on the old man who told me.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What old man?

39
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,920
It's...

40
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
It's a dead body.

41
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,520
What dead body?

42
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,840
I'm fine.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,600
Thanks to your words,

44
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,600
I've become the new servant of the Taoism Grandmaster.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,520
Young Master.

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,600
Are you okay?

47
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
Oh, no.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,240
He knows all this.

49
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,560
Brother Lin.

50
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,120
Who are you?

51
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,400
What's wrong with you?

52
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,960
Step away.

53
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,200
Cool down.

54
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,000
Now I will kill you.

55
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,400
I guess I've just been possessed.

56
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,920
I must come for help.

57
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,260
No.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,760
I'm promising

59
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,620
to be before all this.

60
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,660
As seldom as when we were best friends!

61
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,380
Fighting!

62
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,120
Eliminate him!

63
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,700
I made it!

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Li Song'er, you let me down.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Our princess is so good to you.

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You can be so cruel to kill her.

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Fortunately, the princess has the divine power.

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
She can be used to do everything.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Otherwise, if something really happens,

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I will...

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I know I was wrong.

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Princess, do you want to go to the palace?

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I want to see the princess.

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I want to see her.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I want to see her.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I want to see her.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I want to see her.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I want to see her.

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I want to see her.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I want to see her.

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Princess, do you want to kill her?

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Or lock her up.

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And let her starve for three days and three nights.

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Go back.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Princess.

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You've been in the tent for a night.

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You've been punished.

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Punished?

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Go back.

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm tired.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You don't blame me.

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You don't have to be so hard on me.

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
As long as you keep your promise,

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
our debt will be paid off.

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I will never break my promise.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Then I will take you home.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I swear.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm leaving.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No more second thoughts.

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If I break my promise,

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I will be beaten to death.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Han Yan.

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Send her back.

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yes.

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Li Songer doesn't know martial arts.

106
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Will there be someone else

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
to teach her the new skill?

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No way.

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm so powerful.

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It hurts so much.

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm cold.

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You're cold?

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Come on.

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
How is it?

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh, no.

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Lin Xiong, you were beaten by me, right?

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Come on.

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Drink some hot water.

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
How do you feel now?

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Cold.

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Forget it.

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This is the only way.

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Since we've been living together for so long,

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I will sacrifice my body to warm you up.

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Listen.

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Hey.

128
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Lin Xiong, you're awake.

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I was so scared.

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But I have to remind you something.

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Although you're strong,

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
but your body is too weak.

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You need to exercise more.

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Baili Xingchen, you...

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Lin Xiong, why are you angry?

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
How dare you!

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You're in a good shape.

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You're so strong.

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You're my good wife.

140
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's my fault.

141
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I won't say it anymore.

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Come on.

143
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Go away.

144
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Don't catch a cold.

145
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm fine.

146
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Eat something.

147
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
This is for skin.

148
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Drink some water.

149
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Jinxia, who doesn't know

150
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
that eating eggs is good for skin?

151
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Really?

152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't know.

153
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The first time I ate eggs

154
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
after I left the fishing village

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
was when I ate skin.

156
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Here.

157
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You didn't eat eggs when you were a kid?

158
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
No.

159
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
We ate fish when we were kids.

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
There was no fish.

161
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I didn't eat fish when I was a kid.

162
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I didn't eat fish when I was a kid.

163
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I didn't eat fish when I was a kid.

164
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I didn't eat fish when I was a kid.

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I didn't eat fish when I was a kid.

166
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I didn't eat fish when I was a kid.

167
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I didn't eat fish when I was a kid.

168
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But fish can make eggs.

169
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We only eat fish eggs.

170
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's very delicious.

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
If you have a chance,

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll let you try it.

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You don't want to eat it?

174
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Come on.

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But to be honest,

176
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Lin Xiong, you're too weak.

177
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
How about

178
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I teach you

179
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
the trick of my soul?

180
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll teach you.

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
How's that?

182
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Fortunately, before I entered the valley,

183
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
the trick of the soul of the West Kingdom

184
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
was suppressed by the fire in the body.

185
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Otherwise,

186
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I would have been killed by the fierce fire.

187
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Where are you going?

188
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm going to practice.

189
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Mengdie,

190
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
are you okay?

191
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm fine.

192
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm fine.

193
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You said you were fine.

194
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You look so miserable.

195
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's all my fault.

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Did I remember the wrong mouthpiece

197
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and make you like this?

198
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Don't blame yourself.

199
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I've been practicing since childhood.

200
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm fine.

201
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
There must be something wrong with this new mouthpiece.

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm fine.

203
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
There must be something wrong with this new mouthpiece.

204
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Something wrong with the new mouthpiece?

205
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It seems that

206
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Nan Chui Meng's spirit is getting better.

207
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It seems that

208
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
someone did touch the new mouthpiece.

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We learned the opposite before.

210
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You mean

211
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Nan Chui Meng just got back to the right way

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and learned the right new mouthpiece.

213
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But it's good.

214
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
This kind of misbehavior

215
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
can remove Nan Chui Meng's suspicion of you.

216
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Actually, it's not.

217
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I accidentally said it out loud.

218
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But he didn't punish me.

219
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And he made a promise with me before I went on a trip.

220
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Actually, he's a good person.

221
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Don't believe him so easily.

222
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
This kind of old world

223
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
is best at using others' side-views.

224
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But he's very serious.

225
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I don't think it's fake.

226
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I get it.

227
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Nan Chui Meng

228
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
doesn't like you, right?

229
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
He doesn't want to hurt you easily.

230
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
He's always thinking deeply.

231
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I didn't expect that

232
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
he would be fooled by love.

233
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Don't talk nonsense.

234
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
He might...

235
00:12:43,000 --> 00:13:04,080
He didn't get the

236
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
right to be the one.

237
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What's wrong?

238
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Don't you believe in love?

239
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Let's go.

240
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I didn't expect that

241
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Lin Xiong found a blind date in a few days.

242
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I was wondering why he was so anxious.

243
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It turns out that the couple is in love.

244
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You're still afraid of me.

245
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's my mom.

246
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
No way.

247
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
How is it possible?

248
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Master,

249
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
why did you ask me to come here?

250
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
How is Chu Mengdie now?

251
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Someone just reported that

252
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
he was teasing Lin Shu by the lake.

253
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
He wanted to

254
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
make Nan Chui Meng

255
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
a new man.

256
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So that's the reason.

257
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Did he see

258
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
the flaw in the statement?

259
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Master,

260
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
what do you mean?

261
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The statements I sent him

262
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
were all false.

263
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What's wrong with your eyes?

264
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What's wrong with your ears?

265
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Master,

266
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I was teasing you yesterday.

267
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Oh, my god.

268
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's said that Chu Mengdie

269
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
is in a coma now.

270
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Could it be that

271
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
the time has not come yet?

272
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Wait.

273
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm in a coma.

274
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Peng,

275
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
find a chance

276
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
to investigate.

277
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Okay, master.

278
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Master.

279
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Help me.

280
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Help me.

281
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Help me.

282
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What?

283
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Help me.

284
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Master,

285
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm going back.

286
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm going back.

287
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm going back.

288
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Master.

289
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You're a playboy.

290
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What a coincidence.

291
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You're practicing here too?

292
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I was practicing here too.

293
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I've been practicing for a long time.

294
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The sword you just practiced

295
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
is bright red and bright yellow.

296
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It looks very handsome.

297
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I wonder

298
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
what kind of sword it is.

299
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's a sword

300
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
that can be used to cut through the darkness.

301
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's a sword

302
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
that can be used to cut through the darkness.

303
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Didn't I teach you before?

304
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yes.

305
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I didn't react.

306
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I shouldn't have taught you

307
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
the wrong way of thinking.

308
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Although the result is good,

309
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
it can't hide my heart of hurting people.

310
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
No need.

311
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
This matter has passed.

312
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
No need to mention it again.

313
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You can practice

314
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
what I taught you.

315
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Okay.

316
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Why didn't you hide just now?

317
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Your hand.

318
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I gave you the chance to kill me.

319
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But this time,

320
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
you...

321
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What are you thinking?

322
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Are you still angry?

323
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Do you care about me so much?

324
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Of course I care.

325
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Okay.

326
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
In that case,

327
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
promise me one thing

328
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
and I'll forgive you.

329
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You practiced the wrong way of thinking.

330
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The wrong way of thinking

331
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
is now

332
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
in your hands.

333
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The person who secretly shot you

334
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
will come to see you

335
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
to confirm if your body is okay.

336
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's good that you're injured now.

337
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Why don't you pretend

338
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
that you're seriously injured?

339
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Let's see who comes to see you tonight.

340
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Who will be relieved

341
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
from this matter?

342
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Sister Cheng.

343
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Shizhi.

344
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Shizhi.

345
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
How did this happen?

346
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
How could you be

347
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
so angry?

348
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
When Sister Chu was practicing yesterday,

349
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
she was in a bad mood.

350
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
If I hadn't arrived in time,

351
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm afraid that

352
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
her heart would have been injured.

353
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Brother Liang.

354
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
If you weren't here last night,

355
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I would have

356
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
been...

357
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Uncle Bai.

358
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I feel like

359
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
my heart is burning.

360
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Did you give me

361
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
the new method?

362
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That's impossible.

363
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I must have taught you

364
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
the new method

365
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
in one word and one sentence.

366
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Uncle Bai.

367
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I didn't mean

368
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
to blame you.

369
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But now,

370
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm afraid that

371
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
someone here is deliberately

372
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
destroying the relationship

373
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
between Jingyun Villa and Fengyu Valley

374
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
and is provoking it.

375
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Sister Chu is getting hurt

376
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
from practicing martial arts.

377
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
If it gets out,

378
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
it will cause suspicion

379
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
in Jingyun Villa.

380
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's inevitable

381
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
that the two factions fight.

382
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
This is a trap

383
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
that the evil sects

384
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
set up.

385
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Mr. Nan.

386
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Keep this a secret.

387
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I will

388
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
find out the truth.

389
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Thank you, Uncle Bai.

390
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's my pleasure.

391
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Why is Brother Zhou

392
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
also looking for trouble?

393
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Did he also

394
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
fall into the evil sect's trap?

395
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Last night,

396
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I was in the room

397
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
and I...

398
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I cooked some chicken soup.

399
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Right?

400
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Have fun.

401
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Let's go.

402
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I will go back and tell Brother

403
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and I will definitely tell you.

404
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
How was it?

405
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Did I act like I was sick?

406
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You acted well.

407
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You are very good at it.

408
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
What do you mean by acting?

409
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
My wrist really hurts.

410
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Okay.

411
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
If your wrist really hurts,

412
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
stay here

413
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
before the wedding.

414
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You are not allowed to leave.

415
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
This way,

416
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
you can avoid the suspicion of the Wind and Rain Valley.

417
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Didn't you say

418
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
you forgive me?

419
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You asked me to come back

420
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
just to help you play this scene.

421
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
But you are so soft.

422
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
How do you want me

423
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
to forgive you?

424
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Okay.

425
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You are so stubborn.

426
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
The ice is cold and the bones are cold.

427
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Everything is quiet.

428
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Everything is quiet.

429
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
My heart is calm.

430
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
My heart is calm.

431
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I hope I am the only one.

432
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I hope I am the only one.

433
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I hope I am the only one.

434
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Everything is quiet.

435
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What nonsense is this?

436
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Baili Xingchen,

437
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
is this the Heart-Solidification Skill

438
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
you are going to teach me?

439
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Brother Lin,

440
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
the martial arts of people who practice martial arts

441
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
are important.

442
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
But the practice of heart-solidification

443
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
is more important.

444
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
The Heart-Solidification Skill

445
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I taught you just now

446
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
works like this.

447
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What do you want to do?

448
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Then I

449
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
will stop playing with my feet.

450
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You are just a knife on your head.

451
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
We people who walk in the martial arts world

452
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
are particular about the meaning.

453
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You can't ruin your future

454
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
because of your feelings.

455
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
What do you mean?

456
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I know you have a

457
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
uncivilized relationship with Brother Lin.

458
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You are shameless.

459
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I don't want to break through.

460
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I hope you can be happy.

461
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Uncivilized relationship?

462
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Shameless?

463
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Is this fool

464
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
seeing me and Lin Meimei

465
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
playing around the lake?

466
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Don't worry.

467
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
This is impossible.

468
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Since you said it's impossible,

469
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm relieved.

470
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But the Heart-Solidification Skill

471
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
needs to be learned.

472
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Everything...

473
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
If you don't want to be beaten,

474
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
just shut up.

475
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Even if I get beaten,

476
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I have to teach.

477
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
In order to make Brother Lin calm,

478
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
even a little bit of injury

479
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
is nothing to be afraid of.

480
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Come on.

481
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You beat me and you learn.

482
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Ice cold and bones cold.

483
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Everything is quiet.

484
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Done.

485
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Ice cold and bones cold.

486
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Everything is quiet.

487
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Ice cold and bones cold.

488
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Ice cold and bones cold.

489
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Everything is quiet.

490
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Everything is quiet.

491
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Heart-Solidification Skill.

492
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
How is Chu Xianzhi

493
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
doing now?

494
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Brother.

495
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
South Xianzhi has been transferred to the palace for him.

496
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
He can recover in a few days.

497
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
From now on,

498
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
you can take the position of the leader.

499
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Master.

500
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Father-in-law.

501
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Master did this

502
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
for the sake of the Wind and Rain Valley.

503
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
This Heart-Solidification Skill

504
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
is ours.

505
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
How can we let outsiders learn it?

506
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
The leader

507
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
has the merit of the woman.

508
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Today's matter

509
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
is the support of the sect.

510
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
In the future,

511
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
if anyone wants to harm others,

512
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
we will deal with him.

513
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Father-in-law.

514
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I know my fault.

515
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
If there is nothing else,

516
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I will leave first.

517
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Father-in-law.

518
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Your handwriting is smooth

519
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
and smooth as the cloud.

520
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I can see

521
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
your softness

522
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
in this handwriting.

523
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Tomorrow

524
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
is your brother's wedding day.

525
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You give him the lotus.

526
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
It's also

527
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
a token of my love.

528
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
He will be happy

529
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
to see this gift.

530
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I am a little jealous

531
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
to get your old skill.

532
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
To be honest,

533
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I am a little jealous.

534
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Then

535
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I will give you a few times.

536
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Then I

537
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
thank you here first.

538
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Here.

539
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Haven't you said

540
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
you are the master of Su הם?

541
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:20,880
Her

542
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,440
You want to be my teacher.

543
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,080
What about your sincerity?

544
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,240
I only have one teacher in my life.

545
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,920
I'm not sincere.

546
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,880
Forget it.

547
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,040
You and I

548
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,880
should not have the names of the teachers and disciples.

549
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,400
Otherwise, the wedding day

550
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,120
will be a mess.

551
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,240
It's just a formality.

552
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,000
But,

553
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,720
what is the standard of your Dream City?

554
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,640
If you have any special request,

555
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
you can tell me.

556
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,840
I'll ask Han Yan to do it.

557
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,000
You want to marry me in the style of a princess?

558
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,880
That's a big price.

559
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Tell me.

560
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,760
In our Dream City,

561
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,760
no matter which girl marries,

562
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,760
it's a very lively and grand thing.

563
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,560
Forget it.

564
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,280
If it's too luxurious,

565
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,600
it's not good for Bai Wu Xie to find out your identity.

566
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,440
What is the Dream City

567
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,360
exactly like?

568
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,840
I've never heard of it before.

569
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,800
It's a very far place.

570
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,440
You can't go there just like that.

571
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,120
No matter how far it is,

572
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,040
I'll definitely send you there.

573
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,000
I won't break my promise.

574
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,680
It's so beautiful.

575
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,920
Who would have thought

576
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,360
that my wedding in the Dream City

577
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,600
is in the unknown place?

578
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,240
My mother is not with me.

579
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,680
She's the devil who married Hua Ben Li.

580
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,960
Actually, she's not bad.

581
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,000
Who'd have thought that

582
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,400
I'd meet she on the street?

583
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,600
But at home,

584
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,280
she has to live here no matter what.

585
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,840
At home,

586
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,720
I'm better off living alone.

587
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,560
This is a great Ni shove.

588
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,000
Meeting her is the best decision

589
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,280
of all my sisters.

590
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
First bow, five sons.

591
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
Is this a wedding or a wedding ceremony?

592
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,000
The first bow is to be a son of martial arts.

593
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,560
I hope you two can cultivate together

594
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,520
and spread the light of the righteous sects in the world.

595
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,000
If you are evil and evil,

596
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,520
you will be punished by the righteous sects.

597
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,840
Second bow, hidden gun.

598
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,120
This is a famous weapon of the Southern Formation of Qian Gu City.

599
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,600
I hope you two can prove it with your elders

600
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,120
and share the same heart and virtue.

601
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,040
Exchange the token.

602
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,520
Bow to the senior.

603
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,840
The senior is the witness.

604
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,520
Ten sons are connected by blood.

605
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,800
Love is two steps apart.

606
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,200
Good.

607
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,320
My son.

608
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,040
You must take good care of Chu Xian Zhi in the future.

609
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,120
If he is wronged

610
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,400
and is dissatisfied with Jingyun Villa,

611
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,560
I won't protect you.

612
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,720
Uncle, don't worry.

613
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,640
I will protect Meng Die well.

614
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,320
I won't let her be hurt at all.

615
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,200
That's good.

616
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,240
Bow to each other.

617
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,240
The ceremony is over.

618
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,880
It is a miracle that I am alive.

619
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,520
Thank you very much for always taking care of me.

620
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,960
You have changed a lot.

621
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,760
I am back with a child.

622
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,980
Father, I知 good news for you.

623
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,000
I know.

624
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,080
Since then,

625
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,600
we can twist the situation like this.

626
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600
Do you know what my future is?

627
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,360
A son and daughter are like brothers to each other.

628
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,160
I'm willing to do everything for them to always be there for each other.

629
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,120
I haven't had a proper meal for a day.

630
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,120
Don't worry.

631
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,080
You...

632
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,680
Drink the wedding wine.

633
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,960
Isn't he acting?

634
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,160
Why is he acting so seriously?

635
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,280
Yes,But it can't be him.

636
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,760
Madam.

637
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,600
What's' up?

638
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,120
The last time you slept in the wedding room,

639
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,400
You've been very restless.

640
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,400
I'm not nervous.

641
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
You were so picky

642
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
when you were in the wedding dress.

643
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,400
Why are you so nervous today?

644
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
What's wrong with me today?

645
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
I'm not nervous today.

646
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
You...

647
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
Why are you so close to me?

648
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
What's wrong with you?

649
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,400
Nothing.

650
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
Did you think

651
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
I was going to kiss you?

652
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
No.

653
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
I just think you were so close to me

654
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,400
that you were going to hit me.

655
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
You must have thought wrongly.

656
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
What?

657
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
Because

658
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,400
I

659
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
just want

660
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
to kiss you.

661
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,400
The wind blows towards the river

662
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,400
and I dance with you

663
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
The wind blows towards the river

664
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,400
and I dance with you

665
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,400
The light of the sword

666
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,400
shines through the night

667
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,400
The light of the sword

668
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
shines through the night

669
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
The wind blows through the mist

670
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,400
and I look at you

671
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,400
and I look at you

672
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,400
Don't forget me

673
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,400
Don't forget me

674
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
Don't forget me

675
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Don't forget me

676
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,400
Don't forget me

677
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
Don't forget you

678
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Don't forget you

679
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,400
Don't forget who you are

680
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,400
Don't forget who you are

681
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,400
Don't forget

682
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Don't forget who you are

683
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:18,300
