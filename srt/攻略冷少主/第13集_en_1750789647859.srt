1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,100
Her hair, sunscreen go well with gold-colored lipstick

2
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,380
I simply feel embarrassed

3
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,840
I know that kind is lovely

4
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,200
Does it feel good to kiss her

5
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,500
cough

6
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,700
and assemba

7
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,760
is it cool?

8
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,800
Not go to lowDon.

9
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,040
she is % of society

10
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,260
Acting strong

11
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,260
not compromise

12
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,920
girls who fall in love

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,920
My Girlfriend is an Alien

14
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,920
Episode 16

15
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Brother Na, open the door.

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,920
I have something to tell you.

17
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,920
It's okay if you don't want to see me.

18
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,920
I just want to ask you one thing.

19
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,920
Did you still keep your words

20
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
about liking me?

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,920
You are so cruel to me.

22
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
How could I be a member of the Gu Yuan?

23
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,920
I really am the enemy sent by the Chu Meng Tian Sect.

24
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,920
I am fake.

25
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,920
But my feelings for you are real.

26
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,920
The door is not closed.

27
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,920
Is Brother Na okay?

28
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,920
I played well, right?

29
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,920
Young Master Na doesn't want to see you now.

30
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,920
Since you chose to deceive him,

31
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,920
you should expect today.

32
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,920
Can I see him again tomorrow?

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,920
Please go back.

34
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,920
Is the man and the woman really not related?

35
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
Or are they acting with me here?

36
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
He doesn't know what happened.

37
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,920
He thought you were acting with him.

38
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
Your Highness, can't you make more efforts?

39
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,920
You will get more poison every time you make more efforts.

40
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
Your life will be in danger.

41
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
Okay.

42
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
You have the time to persuade me.

43
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
You should keep the people in the valley safe.

44
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,920
Don't let them cause trouble for Sang Er.

45
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Go.

46
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
Go.

47
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
Go.

48
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
Put it down.

49
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
No, Brother Li.

50
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Sister Li, I'll do it.

51
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,920
No need.

52
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,920
I always do it myself.

53
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,920
Bai Li Xing Chen.

54
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
Bai Li Xing Chen.

55
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,920
What do you want?

56
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
And my surname is Chu.

57
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Sister Chu.

58
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
Look.

59
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,920
You have a eagle's eye.

60
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,920
And a short sword in your right shoulder.

61
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,920
So the woman in the picture you showed me before

62
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920
is you.

63
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,920
And you said you had a fish in your hand.

64
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,920
I've been hiding from you lately.

65
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,920
I'm not a man.

66
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,920
I don't know what to do to return your sword.

67
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,920
Anyway,

68
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,920
thank you for taking care of me these days.

69
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,920
I heard that there is a rumor in the world

70
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
that you are the daughter of a man.

71
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,920
There is a rumor in the world

72
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,920
that lovers are loyal to each other.

73
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,920
Lovers are loyal to each other.

74
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
What?

75
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
Brother and sister.

76
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Yes, brother and sister.

77
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,920
I think you're talking about us.

78
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,920
Since you've recovered your daughter's body,

79
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,920
I'm your brother from now on.

80
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,920
I'll cut your head off.

81
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,920
Greetings, Young Master.

82
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,920
Young Master, please come to the hall as soon as possible.

83
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Baili, come here.

84
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,920
I've been exploring a few days ago.

85
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,920
The one who can get back to Xiaoyao Pavilion

86
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,920
is the future master of Fengyu Valley.

87
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Yesterday, someone has already handed over the secret book.

88
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,920
He is Baili Xingchen.

89
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,920
He promised to take the world by the sword.

90
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
From today on,

91
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,920
he is the Young Master of Fengyu Valley.

92
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,920
Master, Young Master.

93
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,920
Young Master.

94
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
He looks like a man.

95
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
He's so handsome.

96
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
He's so handsome.

97
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
He's so handsome.

98
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
He's so handsome.

99
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
Baili,

100
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,920
you'll be the Young Master from now on.

101
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,920
I've entrusted you with all the small things

102
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,920
in the valley since I was young.

103
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,920
I...

104
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,920
Of course,

105
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,920
your Uncle Bai will also be there to help you.

106
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,920
I hope you won't let me down in the future.

107
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,920
Protect the century-old foundation of Fengyu Valley.

108
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
Master, I...

109
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,920
Do you remember what I told you yesterday?

110
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
Zhong Mengdie,

111
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,920
although Jingyun Villa has an agreement with Fengyu Valley,

112
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
after you and Nan Chuimeng get married,

113
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,920
you'll learn the Xiaoyao Pavilion.

114
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,920
But because you asked someone to replace your identity and learn martial arts,

115
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
you can't do it.

116
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
So,

117
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
we'll cancel the agreement.

118
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,920
Are you really going to go back on your word?

119
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
Miss Chu,

120
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,920
you heard it.

121
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,920
This is the decision of our Young Master.

122
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
You just promised to marry the world.

123
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,920
Now you're going back on your word.

124
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Are you still a man or not?

125
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Chu Mengdie,

126
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
you can't learn the Xiaoyao Pavilion.

127
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,920
Master,

128
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
Yin Bin can't leave.

129
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,920
We'll tell him.

130
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
Okay.

131
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Very good.

132
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Congratulations to Young Valley Master and Fengyu Valley for getting married.

133
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
Goodbye.

134
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
I'll go.

135
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
You're in a hurry.

136
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,920
What happened in the villa?

137
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
Miss,

138
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
a few days ago,

139
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
my junior and I were on the escort.

140
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,920
The devil came to the valley for a night.

141
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,920
Many disciples were injured.

142
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
Valley?

143
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,920
The devil came this time

144
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
to come to the Xiaoyao Pavilion.

145
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,920
He didn't get the secret book.

146
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,920
He'll definitely come to the villa.

147
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,920
Now the master is traveling around.

148
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
If you don't go back to the main stage,

149
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,920
the junior and junior don't know what to do.

150
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,920
How dare you!

151
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
How dare you

152
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
come to my mansion?

153
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,920
You three

154
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,920
go to the guest house and stay overnight.

155
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,920
It's late.

156
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,920
Let's go together.

157
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Yes.

158
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
It's you, sir.

159
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
What are you looking at?

160
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,920
I'm looking at your husband.

161
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,920
Don't mention that ugly man.

162
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,920
He's a rich man.

163
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
If it weren't for him,

164
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
I wouldn't have been kicked out.

165
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Now that I think of him,

166
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,920
I want to kill him.

167
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,920
I understand.

168
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
Don't be angry.

169
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
I'll choose the best room for you in the second floor.

170
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
You can sleep.

171
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
By then,

172
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
you'll be out of breath.

173
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
Please.

174
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
Please.

175
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
Hurry up.

176
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,920
Wait.

177
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
My husband is coming.

178
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
Why don't you say anything?

179
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
I...

180
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,920
You scared me.

181
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
I thought it was Feng Yougu's trap again.

182
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
I know

183
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,920
you've been wronged these days.

184
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
How is it?

185
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,920
Song, have you thought it over?

186
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
I can't.

187
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,920
These are your favorites.

188
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,920
I'll make some for you.

189
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Wine and rice cake,

190
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,920
osmanthus cake, peach blossom cake.

191
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
You don't know

192
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,920
how tired I am in Feng Youguo.

193
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
I just act every day.

194
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,920
They even let me live in that grass house.

195
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
It's so shabby.

196
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,920
I don't know how Mengdie can stand it.

197
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,920
Why are you locking the door?

198
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
Open the door.

199
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
What should I do?

200
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,920
Are you doing something in there again?

201
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
Hurry up.

202
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
What are you doing?

203
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,920
I'm coming.

204
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,920
You don't do anything wrong.

205
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
You're not afraid of being knocked down.

206
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Are you guilty of locking the door?

207
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,920
Why do you care about me?

208
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
Uncle Qiong,

209
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,920
you're following me.

210
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
Who's following you?

211
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
Who's following you?

212
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
I'm just asking.

213
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,920
A murderer

214
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
lives in such a good house.

215
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,920
Why do you care about my house?

216
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
Uncle Qiong,

217
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
what are you doing here?

218
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,920
This is yours.

219
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,920
For the sake of Chu Nvxiang,

220
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,920
the chief of the South Valley,

221
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
I've packed it up and sent it to you.

222
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,920
If I were you,

223
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,920
I would have found a place to bury it.

224
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,920
Are you done with your nonsense?

225
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
Get out if you're done.

226
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
You're in such a hurry to drive me away.

227
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,920
Are you hiding someone in the house?

228
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
Uncle Qiong,

229
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,920
you broke into the girl's room at midnight

230
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
and ran to my bedside.

231
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
Are you trying to get into my beauty?

232
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,920
I...

233
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
You...

234
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,920
What beauty?

235
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
Someone broke into the room.

236
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
You...

237
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
What are you doing? Don't...

238
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
Someone broke into...

239
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
I'll let you go today.

240
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
Don't talk nonsense.

241
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
You're so naughty.

242
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
You're even playing with me.

243
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,920
Be careful.

244
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,920
If...

245
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,920
If they kill a horseback horse,

246
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,920
it won't be good.

247
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Lai Fu,

248
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,920
you're getting more and more relaxed.

249
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,920
So sweet.

250
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,920
You're a rabbit.

251
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,920
I was thinking about it.

252
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,920
This is really not a place to stay for long.

253
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
We have to leave as soon as possible.

254
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
Okay.

255
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
You go first.

256
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
I'll go back.

257
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,920
In case they suspect it.

258
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Okay.

259
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,920
I've traveled through three thousand worlds

260
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
Okay.

261
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
Let's go.

262
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,920
I'm so tired.

263
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
A few times, I was confused.

264
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,920
A few times, I was lost.

265
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,920
I only know how to speak.

266
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
I only know how to write.

267
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,920
I only know how to read.

268
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,920
I see the prosperity and the youth.

269
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,920
It would be great if I could take Gu Yuan back to Dream City.

270
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
Without these grudges,

271
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,920
is that life?

272
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,920
The most important thing now is to find the protagonist first.

273
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,920
Can't let the story end badly.

274
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,920
I'll go.

275
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
Yan.

276
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
I'm a little selfish

277
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,920
for doing this.

278
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,920
Why are you asking suddenly?

279
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,920
But what did sister Lin say?

280
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,920
Now the situation is dangerous.

281
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,920
But I only keep her alone.

282
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
She has to live with the people of Feng Yu Valley.

283
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
Princess.

284
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,920
I believe sister Lin will understand you.

285
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,920
And sister Lin can be so familiar with Chu Meng Die.

286
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,920
It's an old world.

287
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,920
The male and female protagonists in the storybook

288
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,920
have to go through these hardships.

289
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,920
Finally, they get a perfect ending.

290
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
I hope so.

291
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,920
Chu Meng Die

292
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
Chu Xian Zhi.

293
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Don't blame me for yesterday.

294
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,920
The rules of the world are not easy to break.

295
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,920
I don't want to teach you,

296
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,920
but I don't want to force you.

297
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,920
Just tell my father when I go back.

298
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,920
Wu Ya Xiong is out of the coffin.

299
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,920
It's a great joy.

300
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,920
Yes.

301
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,920
I'm worried that the evil sect is winning.

302
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
The righteous sect is in danger.

303
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
The masters are down.

304
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,920
Wu Ya Xiong is out of the coffin.

305
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,920
The evil sect will be eliminated.

306
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,920
It's coming.

307
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,920
It seems that he is still afraid of father.

308
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
Master Nan, please rest assured.

309
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,920
It's not easy to eliminate the evil sect.

310
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,920
But this time,

311
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,920
Meng Die is in the Feng Yu Valley.

312
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,920
I'm afraid I'll have to figure it out in the future.

313
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,920
Meng Die, goodbye.

314
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,920
Then you don't wait for Chu Meng?

315
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
No need.

316
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,920
I'm not married to her.

317
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,920
It's a helpless situation

318
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,920
to make a promise.

319
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
Goodbye.

320
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,920
Miss, what's wrong?

321
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,920
Nothing.

322
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,920
I had too much breakfast.

323
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
I'm a little hungry.

324
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,920
I'll just walk around.

325
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,920
The same thing as leaving your husband

326
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,920
and leaving your lover.

327
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Why are you here?

328
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
It's not a bad thing

329
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
for a couple to say goodbye to you.

330
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,920
I'm here to see you off.

331
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
I'm here to see you off.

332
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,920
I'm here to see you off.

333
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
It's not a bad thing.

334
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
Nan Chuimeng,

335
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,920
don't betray Song'er.

336
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,920
You two are close sisters.

337
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Don't have a problem for me.

338
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,920
Master Nan,

339
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,920
don't make those silly dreams.

340
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Just say it.

341
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
What do you want from me?

342
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,920
To be honest,

343
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,920
this time,

344
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,920
Song'er asked me to come.

345
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,920
Now Song'er has many incoherent actions.

346
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
She asked me to

347
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,920
write a letter to Chu Meng.

348
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,920
She also asked me to wait for Chu Meng

349
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,920
to return to Jingyun Villa

350
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,920
and make a bet.

351
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,920
I'm warning you.

352
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
These days I'm not here,

353
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
you must take good care of her.

354
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
Don't let her down.

355
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
Otherwise...

356
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
Don't worry.

357
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,920
I'm sincere

358
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
to Song'er.

359
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,920
I hope you're sincere.

360
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,920
If we don't send Chu Mengdie,

361
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,920
how can we let her go

362
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,920
to Nan Chuimeng's jade pendant?

363
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
But Chu Mengdie

364
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,920
got jade pendant and the three-color bracelet.

365
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,920
She must have got the Xiaquan of the Demon-repelling Trial.

366
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,920
Now the trust between Jingyun Villa

367
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
and the Wind and Rain Valley is already broken.

368
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
In order to protect

369
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,920
the foundation of Jingyun Villa,

370
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,920
if she knows where the Xiaquan is hidden,

371
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,920
she will definitely take it out.

372
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
Seek the snake out of the hole.

373
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,920
Your Highness, you have a good idea.

374
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,920
I think I understand.

375
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,920
Although these gangsters

376
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,920
are full of benevolence and morality,

377
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,920
there are not a few who really obey.

378
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
You guys hurry up.

379
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
We must arrive before she takes it away.

380
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
Yes.

381
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
Xiulian,

382
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,920
I still have a long way to go.

383
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,920
Only the invincible Gui

384
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
and the invincible loneliness

385
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,920
can

386
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
affect my speed of shooting.

387
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
Why am I a little sad?

388
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,920
Forget it.

389
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
No.

390
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
Lian Wu Jun.

391
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
I'm here.

392
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,920
I'm here.

393
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
I'm here.

394
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
What are you doing here again?

395
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
You demon girl.

396
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,920
You are arrested.

397
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
Come on.

398
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
Tie this demon girl up.

399
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
This time,

400
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
see who will help you.

401
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,920
Yes.

402
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
What are you doing?

403
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,920
What are you doing?

404
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,920
I...

405
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
Don't think that the valley master

406
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,920
let you be the young valley master.

407
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
You are acting every day.

408
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,920
Look at you now

409
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
living in this shabby house.

410
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
What do you think?

411
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,920
You are mixed with this Yan Ping.

412
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,920
Your thoughts are really narrow.

413
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
What's wrong with this shabby house?

414
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Is it a low-level?

415
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
I used to

416
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,920
live in a shabby house.

417
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,920
I lived in poverty and hunger.

418
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,920
At that time,

419
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
I always thought that

420
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
there was a high-level difference

421
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,920
between people.

422
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,920
But now I don't think so.

423
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,920
It's not wealth that separates people.

424
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,920
It's inner.

425
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,920
Do you know what it is

426
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
called to be ungrateful in private?

427
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
What's wrong with the shabby house?

428
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
Maybe

429
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,920
Bai Li will be a hero in the future.

430
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,920
Don't underestimate him.

431
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,920
I order you to leave

432
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,920
as the young valley master.

433
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,920
If you don't leave now,

434
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,920
you will violate the ancient rules.

435
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,920
Senior,

436
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
it seems to be raining outside.

437
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,920
What's wrong with the rain?

438
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
It's raining.

439
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,920
Let's go and pack our clothes.

440
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
Go.

441
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Miss Li,

442
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,920
you were right.

443
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
I'm flattered.

444
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,920
I'm always

445
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
a good kisser.

446
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,920
By the way,

447
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,920
you helped me just now.

448
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,920
Let me buy you a drink.

449
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
Miss Li,

450
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
I was still

451
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
with Lin...

452
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,920
I was still with Chu Ni

453
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,920
when I was washing my feet last time.

454
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,920
Wait.

455
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,920
What's this at the bottom of your feet?

456
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
This?

457
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
This is my birthmark.

458
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
I've had it since I was a child.

459
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,920
The mark of the opium.

460
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
I finally found you.

461
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,920
Come.

462
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,920
It's hard to predict

463
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,920
that this boy

464
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,920
has become the young valley master.

465
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,920
You should understand

466
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
why I let him

467
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,920
be the young valley master.

468
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,920
It's just chess.

469
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,920
We are

470
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,920
chess players.

471
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,920
I dare not.

472
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
You are a

473
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,920
fan of chess players.

474
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,920
I'm willing to

475
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,920
help you.

476
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,920
I'm willing to do anything.

477
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,920
You are my junior.

478
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
You should remember

479
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,920
to be careful when doing big things.

480
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
The world is dangerous.

481
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
We

482
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,920
should be careful.

483
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,920
I know

484
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,920
that

485
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,920
people get old

486
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
and get drunk easily.

487
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
These days,

488
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,920
I've been having fun.

489
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,920
Some fate is destined to be too shallow.

490
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,920
Don't be too sad

491
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,920
because of your wife.

492
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
Baili,

493
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
we should leave.

494
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,920
Leave?

495
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
Where should we leave?

496
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,920
Leave the Wind and Rain Valley.

497
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,920
You saw it just now.

498
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,920
You are the young valley master now.

499
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
But have they ever

500
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,920
considered you?

501
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
Actually,

502
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
it's not strange.

503
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,920
After all,

504
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,920
I'm good-looking,

505
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,920
talented,

506
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
and hardworking.

507
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,920
They look down on me

508
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,920
because I got

509
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
something they can't

510
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
pursue for the rest of their lives.

511
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
I'm not like them.

512
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
I'm

513
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
the soul of Gao Gui.

514
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
Idiot.

515
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
This is not

516
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
the most strange Baili Xing Chen.

517
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,920
Baili,

518
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,920
ask them with your conscience.

519
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,920
Believe what you said.

520
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
No.

521
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
It's normal that

522
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,920
they look down on me.

523
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,920
After all,

524
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
I'm good-looking,

525
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
and hardworking.

526
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,920
I got the best of luck

527
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
to get the best of Xiao Yao Jue.

528
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,920
You are not lucky.

529
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,920
Someone set you up.

530
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
What?

531
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
The hook-and-loop fight

532
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,920
in the Wind and Rain Valley

533
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920
is dangerous.

534
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
It's far more

535
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
than fighting with martial arts.

536
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
So I decided

537
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,920
to take you out of the valley in advance.

538
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
I will be the best

539
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,920
push you to become the valley master.

540
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,920
But you don't know martial arts.

541
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
Why do you go out of the valley with you?

542
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,920
I don't know martial arts.

543
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,920
But I stay with your master every day.

544
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
I'm a friend of Chu Nvquan.

545
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
I know martial arts.

546
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,920
Of course I know martial arts.

547
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,920
And I have a lot of experience.

548
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
How about it?

549
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,920
We work together.

550
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,920
We can do something.

551
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,920
It makes sense.

552
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,920
Then we will work together.

553
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
But

554
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
I have two conditions.

555
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
Please.

556
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,920
After I help you become the valley master,

557
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,920
you must be famous.

558
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,920
You will be a teacher for a day and a father for a lifetime.

559
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,920
No matter who he becomes,

560
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,920
you can't be his enemy.

561
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,920
And you can't do anything

562
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
to hurt him.

563
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
Get up now.

564
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,920
In this way,

565
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,920
if Baili really becomes the leader of the martial arts,

566
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,920
Guo Yuan and the whole martial arts battle

567
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,920
can be avoided.

568
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
I, Baili Xingchen, swear

569
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
that I won't hurt you

570
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,920
in this life.

00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,920
No matter what happens to you,

572
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,920
if you break the law,

573
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
I will beat you.

Young Master.

00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,920
Why are you here?

00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
Stop acting.

582
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
It's not dangerous now.

583
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920

584
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,920
