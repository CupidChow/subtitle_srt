1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,280
my fingers are like the dust on the ground.

2
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,480
From now on, I'll never leave you.

3
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,560
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,880
I only love you.

5
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,920
I'm sorry, Miss Wei.

6
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,240
I'll wait for you to leave.

7
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,320
I'm sorry, Miss Wei.

8
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,640
I regret this life.

9
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,680
I'm sorry, Miss Wei.

10
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,640
I'll wait for you to leave.

11
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,160
I'll wait for you to leave.

12
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,160
I'll wait for you to leave.

13
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,480
Episode 22

14
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,520
dopותtuLee will have setting sun artworks.

15
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,680
There's a hundred miles difference.

16
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,240
Go! Go! Go!

17
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,600
Go! Go!

18
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,080
The sun and the fish are in the water.

19
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,360
Go!

20
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,280
Go!

21
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,120
Great!

22
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,000
You finally succeeded.

23
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,280
The fish is stuck in the net.

24
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,920
The fish is stuck in the net.

25
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,000
How is it, King of Fishing?

26
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,360
I'm good, right?

27
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,120
Your fish is stuck in the net.

28
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,680
The fish is stuck in the net.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,760
It's been lit up.

30
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,160
You can fight the invincible fish village.

31
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,800
You can make a move.

32
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,920
Really?

33
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,200
Dad,

34
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,560
can I get into the martial arts world?

35
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,400
Don't worry.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,560
I'll make the martial arts of Baili Village

37
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,360
more famous.

38
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,960
Don't worry.

39
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,320
Let King of Fishing

40
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,560
make a sharp weapon for you.

41
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,440
No need, dad.

42
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,680
I can't wait any longer.

43
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,840
Didn't you say

44
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,640
the real master

45
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,760
doesn't fear the enemy's weapons?

46
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,240
I have him.

47
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,040
Easy.

48
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,120
Go!

49
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,360
You're a bad fisherman.

50
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,360
You think the skill of fishing

51
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
is a secret skill

52
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,920
for this silly boy?

53
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,920
He can play alone in our village.

54
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,360
You let him go out of the village?

55
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,280
If he dies outside,

56
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,280
the Baili family

57
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,880
will be a dead end.

58
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,840
Life and death are predestined.

59
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,160
Wealth is in the heaven.

60
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,040
He only wants to enter the martial arts world.

61
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,640
What I taught him

62
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,960
is enough to protect his life.

63
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,720
When he is beaten by the martial arts world,

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,680
he will come back to our village

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,680
and inherit my hundred-year fishing.

66
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,080
Keng, don't be like your father.

67
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,600
Wish him good luck.

68
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,840
Yes.

69
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,320
Be careful.

70
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,520
I asked you to investigate

71
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,120
the case between Nan Chui Meng and Chu Meng Die.

72
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,120
How did you investigate?

73
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,560
The...

74
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,160
Master,

75
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,920
Nan Chui Meng and Chu Meng Die

76
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,240
are engaged to play with toys,

77
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,920
but they haven't met each other since childhood.

78
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,160
So they don't have any details of their relationship.

79
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,440
But Nan Chui Meng

80
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,160
asked her about her hobbies.

81
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,600
Besides being good at silver,

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,040
she likes drinking when she is free.

83
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,640
She needs many people to accompany her

84
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,440
when she drinks.

85
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,280
To feed her?

86
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,280
No.

87
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,920
She is crying.

88
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,240
Nan Chui Meng said

89
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,480
there is tears and wine.

90
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,760
That's life.

91
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,600
As for Chu Meng Die,

92
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,680
from what people in the world know,

93
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,560
she is like a man after drinking.

94
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,000
She is a good girl.

95
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,000
She is very good at selling.

96
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,840
Your Highness.

97
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,800
Chu Meng Die may be ambushed.

98
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,240
Chu Meng Die can't die.

99
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,160
Feng Yu Valley is really a place for life.

100
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,240
Princess En is so big.

101
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,760
She has never walked

102
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,240
such a long way.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,640
Wait.

104
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,640
Help me to get on the sedan.

105
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,400
When we arrive at Feng Yu Valley,

106
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,960
I will give you 100 taels of silver.

107
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,760
Get ready to go.

108
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,440
Let's go.

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,160
I am talking to you.

110
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,120
I want you to help me to get on the sedan.

111
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,560
Your Highness.

112
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,520
You can't see this sedan.

113
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,600
There is a bride sitting inside.

114
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,280
Find a sedan and go somewhere else.

115
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,360
I can't walk anymore.

116
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,200
It's so dusty.

117
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,880
When can I get to Feng Yu Valley?

118
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,840
You are lucky.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,680
We are going to Feng Yu Valley to send off our relatives.

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,160
Follow us.

121
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,200
Hmm!

122
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,800
Go!

123
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
I'm just passing by.

124
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,840
I didn't see anything.

125
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
I won't talk again.

126
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
I'm rich and I can rule the country.

127
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
As long as you let me go,

128
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,840
I'll give you all the treasures.

129
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,840
Don't panic, miss.

130
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,840
Let me take a closer look.

131
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,840
If you have a good appearance,

132
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
I can consider

133
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,840
taking you back to your mansion to be my concubine.

134
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,840
I'm not worthy of being your concubine.

135
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,840
I'm not worthy of being your concubine.

136
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,840
You think I'm your concubine?

137
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Demon,

138
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,840
it's good that it's you.

139
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,840
You're so enthusiastic.

140
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
You scared me.

141
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
You...

142
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,840
You were possessed by a ghost?

143
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,840
I was scared to death just now.

144
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
It's all because of you.

145
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
If it weren't for you,

146
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,840
I wouldn't have been in this state.

147
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Since we're meant to meet again,

148
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
give me my antidote.

149
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,840
I only agreed to let you go.

150
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,840
I didn't promise you anything else.

151
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,840
If you want the antidote,

152
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,840
beg me.

153
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Demon,

154
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
why are you always like this?

155
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Young Master,

156
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
Chu Mengdie is dead.

157
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Young Master,

158
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,840
Chu Mengdie is dead.

159
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,840
It seems that we can't get her now.

160
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,840
How do you know that Chu Mengdie is dead?

161
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
And,

162
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
who said that Chu Mengdie is dead?

163
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
What... what are you going to do?

164
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,840
What are you going to do?

165
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
If you want to get the antidote from me,

166
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
from today on,

167
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
you're Chu Mengdie.

168
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Besides,

169
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,840
do you think you can get out of the city

170
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840
alive by yourself?

171
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,840
If what that old man said is true,

172
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,840
I can go back after killing this demon.

173
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,840
It's convenient to stay with him.

174
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
All right.

175
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Since you sincerely asked me,

176
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
I'll agree.

177
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
But I have one condition.

178
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,840
You have to give me the antidote immediately.

179
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
Then, ugly girl,

180
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
change your clothes.

181
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Why is the carriage so bumpy?

182
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
I...

183
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
You devil.

184
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
You're begging me now.

185
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
Let's see how I can eat it.

186
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
You don't want it anymore?

187
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
Beg me.

188
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
What?

189
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,840
If you want me to take the antidote,

190
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
please ask me.

191
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,840
Call me good sister.

192
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
If you feel soft,

193
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
maybe I'll eat it.

194
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,840
Eat it?

195
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,840
You're threatening me.

196
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
I...

197
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,840
Men and women are not related.

198
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
You're not a woman.

199
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
You're not related.

200
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
All right.

201
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,840
Since I've taken the antidote,

202
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
I won't be able to see Chu Mengdie.

203
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
You want to die?

204
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
Come on.

205
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
Kill me.

206
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
The demon was married that day.

207
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,840
He killed his wife.

208
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,840
It suits you.

209
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,840
What do you want?

210
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
Nothing.

211
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,840
I'm just being jealous.

212
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,840
You want me to take the antidote?

213
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,840
You almost got me.

214
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Chu Mengdie is a heroine.

215
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
From now on,

216
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
you'd better stop being so arrogant.

217
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
Otherwise,

218
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,840
I won't protect you

219
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
in the place

220
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
where the firecracker is.

221
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
Go.

222
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,840
Yun Wuxin has been married.

223
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,840
The bird has flown away.

224
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,840
Now it's back to the Wind and Rain Valley.

225
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
Senior Zhou,

226
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
you've been apart for years.

227
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,840
How are you doing?

228
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,840
It's been 20 years.

229
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,840
You've changed a lot.

230
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
I'm not a woman.

231
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
I'm a man.

232
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
I'm a man.

233
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
I'm a man.

234
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,840
I'm a man.

235
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,840
I'm a man.

236
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,840
I'm a man.

237
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
You're right.

238
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,840
You're more and more arrogant.

239
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
Junior Wen Tingnan

240
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,840
has caused great harm to the Demon's old grudge.

241
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
He's really powerful.

242
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,840
Compared to Senior,

243
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,840
Junior is far from it.

244
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,840
Otherwise,

245
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,840
he wouldn't let his fiancee

246
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,840
get assassinated on the way

247
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,840
and suffer too much.

248
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
I think this is

249
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,840
Chu Mengdie, the heroine of Chu.

250
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
No.

251
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,840
No.

252
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,840
Now I should call her sister.

253
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
I didn't expect that

254
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,840
she would meet such a disaster in the capital.

255
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
If I knew it,

256
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,840
I should have sent someone

257
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,840
to welcome you.

258
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,840
It's lucky that you came in time.

259
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Mengdie is safe now.

260
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,840
Please don't blame yourself.

261
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
It's good that she's fine.

262
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,840
Master is waiting in the valley.

263
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,840
Junior, Junior,

264
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,840
follow me to the valley.

265
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840
Please.

266
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,840
Master.

267
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
Senior Bai.

268
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
Xianzhi.

269
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,840
You're finally back.

270
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
You're back.

271
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
Okay, Xianzhi.

272
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,840
Xianzhi.

273
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
You came here

274
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,840
to see Master off for training.

275
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,840
You're his only nephew.

276
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,840
It's a pity that he can't see you.

277
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
He asked me

278
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,840
to welcome you.

279
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,840
Since Chu Meng has come to the Valley,

280
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,840
it's not too late to see him

281
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,840
after he leaves the Pass.

282
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Thank you for your hospitality.

283
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Your father died when you were a child.

284
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
He was sent to the Western Regions at the age of four.

285
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,840
He came back after more than 20 years.

286
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840
Your uncle and I

287
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,840
are your only family.

288
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,840
It's our duty to take care of you

289
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
for your father.

290
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,840
Don't bother.

291
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,840
I heard that

292
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,840
you were the one who set the devil's head

293
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,840
and made the world go wild.

294
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,840
Even our Feng Yu Valley

295
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,840
is under your control.

296
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,840
If your father knew about it,

297
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,840
he would be very happy.

298
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,840
It's all in the past.

299
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,840
Chu Meng's impression of my father

300
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,840
has been blurred.

301
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,840
But I still remember

302
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,840
how much he treated me.

303
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,840
If I hadn't been too naughty

304
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,840
and played with fire in his room,

305
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,840
he would have been crushed by the beam.

306
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,840
If not,

307
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,840
my uncle wouldn't have sent me to the Western Regions.

308
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,840
Chu Meng's achievement today

309
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,840
is all thanks to my uncle.

310
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,840
Master,

311
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840
you're being too kind.

312
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,840
I remember that

313
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,840
your hand was burned.

314
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,840
I think I remembered it wrong.

315
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,840
The one who burned his hand

316
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,840
was the left hand.

317
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,840
Look at my memory.

318
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
Bai Wu Xie

319
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,840
seems to be suspecting the devil.

320
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,840
But the devil is well prepared.

321
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,840
Miss Chu,

322
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,840
I heard that you were attacked

323
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,840
in the Feng Yu Valley.

324
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,840
Master is in seclusion.

325
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,840
As the leader of the agency,

326
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,840
I must find out the truth

327
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,840
and explain it to you.

328
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,840
Wait.

329
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,840
This is a letter

330
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,840
from my father to you.

331
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,840
I think it's just a word of care.

332
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,840
I can't show it to you.

333
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,840
I didn't expect

334
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,840
such an unexpected surprise.

335
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,840
I didn't expect it.

336
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,840
Every time this woman appears,

337
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,840
some changes will happen.

338
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,840
Miss Chu, don't worry.

339
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,840
I'll be sure to keep my promise

340
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,840
after the bet is over.

341
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,840
After you get married,

342
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,840
I'll give you a good marriage.

343
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840
Thank you, Leader Dai.

344
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,840
Xian Zhi,

345
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,840
I've prepared some food

346
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,840
to welcome you.

347
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,840
Thank you, Leader Dai.

348
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,840
I'm Bai.

349
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,840
My surname is Dai.

350
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,840
Just call me Leader.

351
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,840
I know.

352
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,840
I mean, I'm Dai Li's Da.

353
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
Leader Dai.

354
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,840
Master,

355
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,840
Meng Die just had a big battle.

356
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,840
She's not feeling well.

357
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,840
I'm afraid she can't eat.

358
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,840
Zhi Er...

359
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,840
I'm dizzy.

360
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,840
I'm sorry.

361
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,840
I'm sorry.

362
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,840
I'm dizzy.

363
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,840
Please forgive me.

364
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
Go.

365
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,840
You're really a real Chu.

366
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,840
You're really a real Chu.

367
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
Don't throw it.

368
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,840
You're going to learn the Demon-slaying Skill from me?

369
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
If you throw me away,

370
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,840
how will you learn it?

371
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,840
I've prepared for you.

372
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,840
You can't just throw me away.

373
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
I'll teach you a lesson.

374
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,840
I'll teach you a lesson.

375
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,840
I'll teach you a lesson.

376
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
I'll teach you a lesson.

377
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,840
I'll teach you a lesson.

378
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,840
I'll teach you a lesson.

379
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,840
From now on,

380
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,840
you're not allowed to mention

381
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,840
the word I am.

382
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
I am?

383
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840
I'm the Princess.

384
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
What's the point of that?

385
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,840
Okay.

386
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,840
You can mention it.

387
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,840
Put the food on the table.

388
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,840
I have a lot to say

389
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,840
to you and Sister Chu.

390
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,840
You scared me.

391
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
What?

392
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,840
You can't even talk properly now?

393
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,840
You're too tired.

394
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,840
Tang Cuoyu?

395
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,840
It's really Tang Cuoyu.

396
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,840
Don't look for it.

397
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,840
Don't look for it.

398
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,840
Your fish is not here.

399
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,840
It will appear at the right time.

400
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,840
It must be Tang Cu.

401
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,840
What that old man said is true.

402
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,840
I'm going back

403
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,840
to get rid of the evil people around me

404
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,840
and make everything go back to its place.

405
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,840
This person is Gu Yuan.

406
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,840
Didn't you just say

407
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,840
I can mention the conditions?

408
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,840
Then tell me.

409
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,840
My condition is

410
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,840
that after you get the secret,

411
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,840
you have to send me back to Drunken Demon City.

412
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,840
Okay.

413
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,840
Chief,

414
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,840
Chu Mengdie and Nan Chui Meng

415
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,840
have arrived at Fengyu Valley safely.

416
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,840
During the contract,

417
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,840
Li Song'er

418
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,840
must know

419
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
all the actions

420
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,840
in Fengyu Valley.

421
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
She is not allowed to call herself Princess.

422
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,840
She is not allowed to drink in private.

423
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840
She must have a noble background in front of others.

424
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,840
She is not allowed to learn from Xiao Yao Jue.

425
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,840
You guys are quite funny.

426
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,840
I won't learn

427
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,840
even if you give it to me.

428
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,840
You can't call yourself Princess.

429
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,840
You broke the contract.

430
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,840
Your Lordship

431
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,840
has mentioned so many conditions.

432
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,840
I only have one condition.

433
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,840
Why does he have to mention so many conditions?

434
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,840
You are not allowed to have any

435
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,840
negative thoughts about the Lordship.

436
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,840
I'll see

437
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,840
if this contract is invalid.

438
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,840
Liu Ying Ying.

439
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
Okay.

440
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,840
I...

441
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,840
Mengdie, I understand.

442
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,840
I also have to mention some conditions.

443
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
Say it.

444
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,840
First,

445
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,840
during the July trip,

446
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,840
you need to bathe in the incense every day.

447
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
The food you brought me

448
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,840
must be the best.

449
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,840
You need to pick the fish bones to bring it here.

450
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,840
I only eat vegetables.

451
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,840
The food must be the latest

452
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,840
and different from the usual.

453
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,840
The fresh flowers I brought you every day,

454
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,840
I can use them when I take a bath.

455
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,840
And...

456
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
See you.

457
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,840
Okay, okay.

458
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,840
That's all.

459
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,840
I'll wait for you to...

460
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
I'll tell Mr. Nan

461
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
when I figure it out.

462
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,840
Since we are getting married,

463
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,840
you always call me Mr. Nan.

464
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,840
Is it too much?

465
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,840
Then what should I call you?

466
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,840
Your husband?

467
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,840
How about

468
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,840
I call you Sister Chu?

469
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,840
You can call me...

470
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,840
Brother Nan.

471
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,840
You can go back now.

472
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
Brother Nan?

473
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
Brother Nan?

474
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
Brother Nan?

475
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,840
Brother?

476
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,840
Brother?

477
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
Brother?

478
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,840
Brother?

479
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
You are good at acting

480
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,840
in the play.

481
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,840
Anyway,

482
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,840
you can just watch

483
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,840
my acting.

484
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,840
I will never let

485
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,840
anything happen to you.

486
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,840
So close.

487
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,840
But now,

488
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,840
we still need to have a tea break.

489
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
Only then can we use our inner strength

490
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,840
to force the poison out.

491
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,840
Hong Meng Dian.

492
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,840
I failed to kill you

493
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,840
in the flower sedan chair.

494
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
This time,

495
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,840
I will definitely

496
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,840
let you die in the imperial palace.

497
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,840
I didn't expect that

498
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,840
the girl who sent her family

499
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
was killed by them.

500
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,840
Just die.

501
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,840
Let go.

502
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,840
Just die.

503
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,840
Let go.

504
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,840
That girl.

505
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,840
If you have the ability,

506
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
you can just

507
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,840
take the risk.

508
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,840
You are just a hero

509
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,840
who is taking advantage of the situation.

510
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,840
Who are you?

511
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,840
Who am I?

512
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,840
I don't know you.

513
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,840
I only know that

514
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,840
after three breaths,

515
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,840
you will die

516
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,840
under my paper boat.

517
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,840
You...

518
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840
Shoot.

519
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,840
Shoot.

520
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,840
Shoot.

521
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,840
Are you okay?

522
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,840
You are not allowed

523
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840
to be righteous

524
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,840
by taking the risk.

525
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
Your martial arts are so low-level

526
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,840
but you are so sharp.

527
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,840
It's rare.

528
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
This is the martial arts world.

529
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,840
This is

530
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,840
the world of

531
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
the martial arts world.

532
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,840
This is

533
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,840
the world of

534
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,840
martial arts world.

535
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,840
Is this

536
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,840
the feeling of failure?

537
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,840
So happy.

538
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,840
Heroine.

539
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,840
To be honest,

540
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,840
I, Star of Baili,

541
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,840
am the best in the world

542
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,840
and aim to

543
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,840
go to a bigger world.

544
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,840
This trip

545
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,840
is to pursue the path in my heart.

546
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,840
I'm so lucky

547
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,840
to meet you.

548
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
You are the best

549
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,840
in the world.

550
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
You are so stupid.

551
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,840
Where are you going?

552
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,840
I'm going to

553
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,840
the place where the real masters are.

554
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
Then I will

555
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840
show my martial arts

556
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
to the world.

557
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,840
Heroine.

558
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,840
See you.

559
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,840
On this journey,

560
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,840
I have met countless assassinations.

561
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,840
It seems that this Wind and Rain Valley

562
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,840
doesn't want to give up

563
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,840
the Hall of Funeral.

564
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,840
Now,

565
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
I can only pursue the path.

566
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,840
The Hall of Funeral

567
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
I heard that

568
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,840
Chu Mengdie was assassinated in the prison.

569
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
But he was saved by Nan Chuimeng.

570
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,840
It's true.

571
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,840
In your opinion,

572
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
who did this?

573
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,840
I dare not to say.

574
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,840
Just say it.

575
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,840
It doesn't matter.

576
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
I think

577
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
it's done for the person

578
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,840
who has been in the prison

579
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
for hundreds of years.

580
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
What do you mean?

581
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
Just say it.

582
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
Because as long as Chu Mengdie

583
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
has an accident,

584
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,840
Xiao Yao Jue

585
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,840
will not be learned by outsiders.

586
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,840
If the secret is not spread,

587
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
I, Wind and Rain Valley,

588
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,840
will be the number one

589
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,840
sect in the world.

590
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,840
That's right.

591
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,840
So,

592
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,840
what should we do next?

593
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,840
What Master means is...

594
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,840
What Master means is...

595
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,840
Who told you to do it?

596
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,840
It's the Hall of Funeral.

597
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
I will definitely

598
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,840
finish the Hall of Funeral.

599
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,840
Stupid.

600
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,840
Master.

601
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,840
It seems

602
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,840
the only way to go back

603
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,840
is to kill the devil.

604
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,840
It's not working.

605
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
And

606
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,840
the rebels in the script

607
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,840
can't escape

608
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,840
a miserable fate.

609
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,840
They will die sooner or later.

610
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,840
How about

611
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,840
I pretend to be

612
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,840
his fiancee first?

613
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
I will be his fiancee.

614
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,840
I will be his fiancee.

615
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
I will be his fiancee.

616
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,840
I will be his fiancee.

617
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
Then he will let me

618
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
have some peace

619
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
and be content.

620
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,840
Is that all?

621
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
Not only is there no sweet taste,

622
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,840
but there is also a bitter taste.

623
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
It was clearly

624
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
the previous few days

625
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,840
that he came to nourish me.

626
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,840
Han Yan.

627
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,840
The Hall of Funeral

628
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
This lady

629
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
looks familiar.

630
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,840
Have I

631
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,840
seen you before?

632
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,840
The Hall of Funeral

633
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,840
Your Highness.

634
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,840
I have secretly

635
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,840
traveled around the whole Fengyu Valley.

636
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,840
When I arrive at the Hall of Funeral,

637
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,840
I will make a mess first.

638
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,840
When the eye line is opened,

639
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,840
you can take this road.

640
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,840
I have already tested it.

641
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,840
There are few disciples

642
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,840
in this small place.

643
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,840
On the Day of Funeral,

644
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,840
there are many people.

645
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,840
It's perfect for us to get together.

646
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,840
These half-finished checks

647
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,840
can be transferred.

648
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,840
Han Yan.

649
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,840
Is Li Song'er doing well?

650
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,840
Your Highness.

651
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,840
She doesn't do anything

652
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,840
that can make her feel at ease.

653
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,840
She wants these?

654
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,840
Do you know

655
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,840
what these are for?

656
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,840
Today, when I went to the market

657
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,840
to buy some things,

658
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,840
I asked the shopkeeper's mother.

659
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,840
The mothers said

660
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,840
these are all

661
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
on the face.

662
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
I guess

663
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,840
she must be thinking about

664
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,840
putting on some powder.

665
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,840
We found out

666
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,840
how she put on powder.

667
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,840
Now,

668
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,840
she must be thinking about

669
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,840
how to put on powder on her face.

670
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
Your Highness,

671
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
you must be careful.

672
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,840
Is this

673
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,840
a flower shop?

674
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,840
This

675
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
must be a hidden hidden item.

676
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,840
Your Highness, be careful.

677
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,840
This...

678
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,840
It looks like a flower shop.

679
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,840
Check these things

680
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,840
from beginning to end.

681
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,840
Especially these things

682
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,840
that look like powder.

683
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,840
Find a good doctor

684
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,840
and see if there's anything wrong.

685
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,840
If there's nothing wrong,

686
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,840
check it again.

687
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,840
If there's nothing wrong,

688
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,840
check it again.

689
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,840
If there's nothing wrong,

690
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,840
check it again.

691
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,840
If there's nothing wrong,

692
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,840
check it again.

693
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,840
Yes.

694
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,840
Recently,

695
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,840
I found that Chu Mengdie

696
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,840
has been ordering

697
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,840
the maids around Nan Chuimeng

698
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,840
to buy

699
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,840
cosmetics for her.

700
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,840
Jingyun Villa has always been a dance house.

701
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,840
It's said that Chu Wuya's daughter

702
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,840
has been dancing and playing with sticks

703
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,840
since she was young.

704
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,840
She's talented.

705
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
She's very talented.

706
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,840
She doesn't like the makeup.

707
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,840
Really?

708
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,840
I've heard that Chu Mengdie

709
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,840
is not convinced at all.

710
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,840
Heng,

711
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,840
go and find out the truth.

712
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,840
Yes, Master.

713
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,840
Why did you buy these things?

714
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,840
Chu Mengdie doesn't like

715
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,840
cosmetics that are usually used.

716
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
What if the people of Fengyu Valley

717
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,840
find out about you?

718
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,840
Then you should protect me.

719
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,840
You're good anyway.

720
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
You're good anyway.

721
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,840
If the people of Fengyu Valley

722
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,840
really catch me,

723
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,840
I'll get rid of you immediately.

724
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,840
Do you really think

725
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,840
you're irreplaceable?

726
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
I can find you

727
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,840
and say that you're fake.

728
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,840
Then I'll find someone to replace you.

729
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,840
Miss An Yan,

730
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,840
is your young master here?

731
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,840
Young Master has an important business

732
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,840
with Miss Chu.

733
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,840
Don't let anyone disturb him.

734
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
If your senior enters,

735
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,840
Chu Mengdie won't say anything.

736
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,840
I've seen you before.

737
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
It's late at night.

738
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,840
I didn't know you were here.

739
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,840
What's the matter?

740
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,840
It's a good night.

741
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,840
I can't sleep.

742
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,840
So I came out to take a walk

743
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,840
and came to see you two.

744
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
Heng,

745
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,840
what are you doing

746
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,840
in the middle of the night?

747
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
Senior, do you know that

748
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
in the martial arts world,

749
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,840
people are popular to practice martial arts.

750
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
It's called

751
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,840
the skill of practice and the martial arts of the handsome.

752
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
Moreover, recently,

753
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,840
Brother Nan and I

754
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,840
have been staying in the valley.

755
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,840
We didn't have a chance to learn in the martial arts world.

756
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,840
So we asked Han Yan

757
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,840
to buy some good-looking things.

758
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,840
Now,

759
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,840
Brother Nan and I

760
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
are studying

761
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,840
the popular things in the martial arts world.

762
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,840
Yes.

763
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,840
It seems that I lost to you again,

764
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
Sister Chu.

765
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
Brother Nan,

766
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,840
they all said that you should be the one to let Mengdie go.

767
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,840
Why don't you try it?

768
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,840
It's getting late.

769
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,840
Your sister-in-law should be hitting me.

770
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
She's staring at me with the lantern.

771
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,840
How is it?

772
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,840
What I just did was...

773
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,840
Sister Chu.

774
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,840
Brother Nan,

775
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,840
you just killed Mengdie.

776
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,840
Brother Nan,

777
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840
can you teach your martial arts skills

778
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,840
to your sister again?

779
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,840
Okay, Sister Chu.

780
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,840
It's getting late.

781
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,840
We have plenty of time.

782
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,840
She really has the right to do so?

783
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,840
I'll go back to find Fei Yan and try it.

784
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,840
Raise your head and ask for the moon.

785
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,840
Lower your head and ask for the moon.

786
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Even if Zhou Heng is outside,

787
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,840
can't you say something normal?

788
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,840
But I think I was particularly...

789
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,840
Demon, let me go!

790
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
These days,

791
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,840
you let Han Yan buy you this and that.

792
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,840
And she even gave you the color of rouge,

793
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,840
making everyone sleepy.

794
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,840
Today, I'm lucky to let you taste the pain of staying up late.

795
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,840
And let you know how to understand others.

796
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,840
Didn't you agree with me in the contract?

797
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,840
After four hours,

798
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,840
I'll learn to solve it naturally.

799
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,840
You're taking revenge!

800
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
Help me solve it!

801
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,840
Hey, can you help me roll up a cup?

802
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,840
A bottle of wine in the flower.

803
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,840
A single cup without a match.

804
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,840
Raise your cup and ask for the moon.

805
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,840
A match of three people.

806
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,840
Such a good color of the moon,

807
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,840
but you want to drink alone.

808
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,840
What a pity!

809
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,840
Boss, how was it when you saw them just now?

810
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,840
They said they were playing a popular boxing game.

811
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,840
What should we do?

812
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,840
Now Chu Mengdie has come to Fengyu Valley alive.

813
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,840
And Nan Chuimeng is there to help.

814
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,840
Should we avoid it?

815
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,840
What if they find out that we were the ones who buried the assassins?

816
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,840
Nan Chuimeng is a master of the old music.

817
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,840
Will we...

818
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,840
You useless thing!

819
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,840
Why are you panicking?

820
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,840
From my observation,

821
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,840
Chu Mengdie's skills may be a fake.

822
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,840
Let's find a way to test him.

823
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,840
Let's go.

824
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,840
I'm here.

825
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,840
I'm here.

826
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,840
I'm here.

827
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,840
I'm here.

I'm here.

830
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,840
I'm here.

00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,840
I'm here.

832
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,840
I'm here.

833
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,840
I'm here.

834
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,840
I'm here.

835
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,840
I'm here.

836
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,840
I'm here.

837
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,840
I'm here.

838
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,840

I'm here.

842
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,840
I'm here.

843
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,840
I'm here.

844
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,840
I'm here.

845
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,840
I'm here.

846
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,840
I'm here.

847
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,840
I'm here.

848
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,840
I'm here.

I'm here.

850
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,840
I'm here.

851
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,840
I'm here.

852
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,840
I'm here.

853
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,840
I'm here.

854
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,840
I'm here.

855
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,840
I'm here.

856
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,840
