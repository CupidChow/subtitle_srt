1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,040
but as the fingersmates, we fall in love

2
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,660
Just this time, be careful that you won't be vulnerable

3
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,060
Confession will be spent

4
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,340
I am stubborn and Valentine

5
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,520
Then I'll start over

6
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,020
What a bad guy

7
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,940
You make me detest my life

8
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,920
That's not true

9
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,440
When will I never fall in love

10
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,300
Un obten remember this

11
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,820
that when I fall in love, happiness will be made

12
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,680
Wei Jia

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,560
equals to proposal.

14
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,240
Tong.

15
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,800
Now,

16
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:26,660
secretly go into the

17
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,700
At once.

18
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,680
Never lie!

19
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,720
He can't get out of our F thingaa.

20
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
Give my order.

21
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,860
Get there

22
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,780
at once,

23
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,160
and look for eat!

24
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,080
Yes!

25
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,400
Protect your god!

26
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,260
There must be something waiting for us.

27
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,840
No matter how fierce it is.

28
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,820
Wuxia,

29
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,400
can you find theEr大家?

30
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,760
I can.

31
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,600
Last time,

32
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
you gave me one day.

33
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,520
This time,

34
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,280
I'll give you three days.

35
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,960
How about it?

36
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,520
Isn't it generous?

37
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
The Shaoyao Pavilion has been stolen

38
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,400
and has moved the whole Jianghu.

39
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
We, the Fengyu Valley,

40
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,240
will definitely investigate it to the end.

41
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,840
Our Jingyun Villa is not easy to bully.

42
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,280
I'll only give you three days.

43
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,400
Don't worry.

44
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,520
I'll definitely give you one day.

45
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,760
I'll give you an explanation.

46
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,200
You're talking nonsense.

47
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,480
Last time,

48
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,280
you were so arrogant.

49
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,720
This time,

50
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,800
you should at least give me a sign.

51
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,800
Or we can do it according to the rules of Jianghu.

52
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,400
You'll be cut off.

53
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,400
We'll believe you.

54
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,320
Chu Xianzhi.

55
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,280
Don't be rude.

56
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,960
Senior.

57
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,200
I've been in the world for twenty years.

58
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
I've never asked about the important things in the Jianghu.

59
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,160
I didn't expect

60
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,720
it would be like this today.

61
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,560
This matter concerns the security of Jianghu.

62
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,440
We can't let it out.

63
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,600
If someone can get the secret book back,

64
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,200
he will be the young valley master

65
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,960
of our Fengyu Valley.

66
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,640
Senior.

67
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,880
The young valley master's choice is important.

68
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,400
We can't let him go easily.

69
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,840
You still have the nerve to say that?

70
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,160
I can't

71
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,960
stand by and watch anymore.

72
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,040
From now on,

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,920
I'll destroy the evil sect with you

74
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,040
and give an explanation to Jingyun Villa and Jianghu.

75
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,160
Thank you, young valley master.

76
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,280
You need to find a proper reason

77
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,320
to go out to find the secret book.

78
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,400
I don't know who dares to pretend to be the princess

79
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,080
and want to get the secret book back.

80
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,200
I need to find the secret book.

81
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,200
There are more than five people

82
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,760
who can do this in the world.

83
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,400
More than five people?

84
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,720
Except Chu Wuya,

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,600
all the masters of Jianghu are here.

86
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,680
Is it really done by Jingyun Villa?

87
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,040
The people of Jingyun Villa are protecting Sister Li.

88
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,680
Isn't she also...

89
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,280
I think

90
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,000
it's Li Song'er who did this.

91
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,200
She said she would cooperate with us

92
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,640
just to make us relax and be alert.

93
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,200
So that Chu Wuya can take away the evil sect.

94
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
Okay.

95
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,520
I was worried about you.

96
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,240
You even secretly said bad things about me.

97
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,680
Do I need to be secretly?

98
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,040
I dare to ask you in person.

99
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,240
Li Song'er.

100
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,880
Are you Chu Mengdie's man?

101
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,720
Why am I her man?

102
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
Then why does Lin Shu come to you repeatedly?

103
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,000
Do you know

104
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,840
she is Chu Mengdie's secret man in the Wind and Rain Valley?

105
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,960
Lin Shu is the mole?

106
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,680
Instead of investigating me,

107
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,720
why don't you go to investigate that fake devil?

108
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,440
Liu Yingying.

109
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,480
Do you know what is the most important thing

110
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,320
between people?

111
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,840
Han Yan.

112
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,240
Let me tell you.

113
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,680
The most important thing between people is trust.

114
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,640
It's honesty.

115
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,920
If that person doesn't believe it,

116
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,760
it's useless to tell the truth.

117
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,640
If you want people to believe it,

118
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,240
you must prove it first.

119
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,400
Ask someone.

120
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,560
Has she never believed me?

121
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,800
Princess.

122
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,200
If Li Sister asks you,

123
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,800
you haven't believed her, right?

124
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,800
You also ask someone.

125
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,200
Princess asked me to ask you.

126
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,200
Didn't you want her to believe you?

127
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,320
Tell her

128
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,680
I'm precious and don't have time to lie to people.

129
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,720
You also tell someone.

130
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,160
Be honest with each other.

131
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,520
It's the basis of communication.

132
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,160
Princess said...

133
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,360
Li Sister said...

134
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,120
Stop talking.

135
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,600
Ah.

136
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,200
You won't believe anything anyway.

137
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,760
It's no sense to say it.

138
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,240
Brother Lin, you're here.

139
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
You're Gu Yuan?

140
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
It's you.

141
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
What do you mean?

142
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,080
It's said that Gu Yuan

143
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:11,140
stole the

144
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,680
Pellet of the Fiery-Eye.

145
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
What if it's me?

146
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
It's really you.

147
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
You...

148
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
You...

149
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
I...

150
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,680
I'm Gu Yuan.

151
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
Are you going to call someone?

152
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
Go.

153
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,680
Dad, I heard that

154
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,680
the master of the sect

155
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
broke into our valley

156
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
and took away the secret scroll.

157
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,680
Is that true?

158
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
We must find out soon.

159
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,680
Once the rumor spreads,

160
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,680
we'll be in trouble.

161
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
Dad.

162
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
You're right.

163
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
Father-in-law,

164
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,680
I'll find out the truth.

165
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,680
You hurt the devil today.

166
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,680
Have you seen his appearance?

167
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,680
Is he Gu Yuan's real body

168
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,680
or someone else's?

169
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,680
I didn't see it clearly.

170
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,680
Who do you think he is?

171
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
He's very skilled.

172
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
Isn't he Gu Yuan?

173
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,680
Heng,

174
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
I'm telling you.

175
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,680
Gu Yuan doesn't have the courage.

176
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
Even if he comes,

177
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,680
he will come quietly.

178
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
I'm wondering if he's still alive.

179
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,680
I suspect that

180
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,680
someone is pretending to be Gu Yuan.

181
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,680
One of them is

182
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
the dispute between us

183
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,680
and the Sun and the Moon Palace.

184
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
He's good at

185
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
competing with us.

186
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
The other one is

187
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,680
Xiao Yao Jue.

188
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,680
Everyone's eyes

189
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,680
are attracted to him.

190
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,680
No one will investigate him.

191
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,680
He can play the role of a man

192
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,680
and practice martial arts.

193
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
He's really

194
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,680
a vicious man.

195
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,680
I'm so worried.

196
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,680
Don't worry too much.

197
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
You and Zhou Heng...

198
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
Heng,

199
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,680
if you're worried,

200
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,680
share the burden for me.

201
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,680
Check the people in the valley.

202
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,680
If you can find Xiao Yao Jue,

203
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
I can also

204
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,680
give you the position of Young Valley Master.

205
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Yes, Father-in-law.

206
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,680
You're really Gu Yuan.

207
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
You want someone to catch me?

208
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,680
Brother Yan,

209
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,680
is the injury serious?

210
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
Let me see.

211
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,680
It's not serious.

212
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,680
It's just a small wound.

213
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,680
Let me see.

214
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,680
You're not afraid of me now?

215
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,680
Whether you are or not,

216
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,680
you're my brother.

217
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,680
Gu Yuan is a devil

218
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,680
who everyone wants to kill.

219
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,680
You want to be a knight.

220
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,680
You don't want to kill him

221
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,680
to avenge the people

222
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
and raise your reputation.

223
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Being a knight is not for fame.

224
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,680
I want to help Ruo Xiao

225
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
learn martial arts.

226
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,680
I hope I can help him

227
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
when others are hurt.

228
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,680
I won't kill the innocent.

229
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,680
So,

230
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
if there's no enough evidence

231
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,680
to prove that you're Gu Yuan,

232
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,680
I won't admit it.

233
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,680
Okay.

234
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,680
Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you?

235
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,680
Come on.

236
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,680
By the way,

237
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
take the fish fork

238
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,680
and take the body of the left hand.

239
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,680
The wind will blow the bones tomorrow.

240
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,680
You'd better change the bowl.

241
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
Wake up.

242
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,680
Do you really think I'm Gu Yuan?

243
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,680
Great.

244
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,680
I knew you weren't.

245
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,680
I'm not.

246
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,680
You said you didn't believe me.

247
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,680
Why are you still following me?

248
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,680
Go.

249
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,680
The world is full of clouds and clouds.

250
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,680
I just want to find you between the clouds.

251
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,680
Let me go.

252
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,680
Who allows you to hold me?

253
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,680
Song.

254
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,680
Since you promised me

255
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,680
to pretend to be Chu Mengdie,

256
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,680
we're both in the same boat.

257
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,680
I'm a little anxious today.

258
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,680
I'm afraid you'll be used by the people in Jingyun Villa.

259
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
Aren't you afraid that

260
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,680
I'll reveal your true identity?

261
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,680
I'm not that stupid.

262
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,680
Don't worry.

263
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,680
I promised you

264
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,680
I wouldn't tell anyone about your true identity.

265
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,680
I won't tell anyone.

266
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
Likewise,

267
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
I promised others

268
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
I wouldn't reveal his secret.

269
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,680
I'll keep my promise.

270
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
We should be honest with each other.

271
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
I want to know everything.

272
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,680
I just want to protect you.

273
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,680
You want to protect me,

274
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
I want to protect you, too.

275
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,680
If you want to protect me,

276
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,680
you won't be so sarcastic.

277
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,680
It's because I'm anxious.

278
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,680
If I didn't trust you,

279
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,680
how could I...

280
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,680
What did you say?

281
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,680
I said I trusted you.

282
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,680
I'm leaving.

283
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
I'm leaving.

284
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,680
I'm leaving.

285
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,680
I'm leaving.

286
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,680
I'm leaving.

287
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,680
Didn't you say you were acting?

288
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,680
Why did you pretend to be serious?

289
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,680
You said you were happy for me.

290
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,680
I know I'm charming.

291
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,680
You're too big.

292
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
You're under my influence.

293
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,680
You're a lovely woman.

294
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,680
Since you don't want to leave me,

295
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,680
I'll stay with you.

296
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,680
Wait.

297
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
In the book,

298
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,680
it's said that the devil is dead.

299
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,680
If I don't kill him,

300
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,680
there will be someone else.

301
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,680
The protagonist of this book

302
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,680
was not introduced by others.

303
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,680
He was buried in the Wind Valley.

304
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,680
He was unknown.

305
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,680
There's a bird-shaped birthmark at the bottom of his foot.

306
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,680
It's considered a natural martial art talent.

307
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,680
The devil was finally killed by the protagonist

308
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,680
with six sects.

309
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
The protagonist killed the villain.

310
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,680
It's not over.

311
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,680
No.

312
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,680
I have to find the protagonist quickly.

313
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,680
I can't let him kill the main character.

314
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,680
Senior.

315
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,680
How is it?

316
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,680
Any news?

317
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,680
Sun Moon Palace.

318
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,680
Sun Moon Palace.

319
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
Sun Moon Palace.

320
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,680
Sun Moon Palace.

321
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,680
Sun Moon Palace.

322
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,680
How is it?

323
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,680
I've investigated.

324
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,680
Recently,

325
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
Gu Yuan is not in Sun Moon Palace.

326
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,680
I think

327
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,680
the person who stole the book

328
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,680
is very likely to be him.

329
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,680
But the secret of Gu Yuan

330
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,680
is actually a matter of course.

331
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,680
Why are you investigating him?

332
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,680
You know nothing.

333
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
Father-in-law has been saying that I'm useless.

334
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
I have to prove to him

335
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,680
that he has the wrong taste.

336
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
Why do I feel

337
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,680
that he has the wrong taste?

338
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,680
Where is the external birthmark of the Wind Valley?

339
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,680
Go.

340
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,680
There's a book in the bookcase called Love and Affection.

341
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,680
Take a look when you're free.

342
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
Okay.

343
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
I lost the secret.

344
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,680
I have to go back to the manor immediately.

345
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,680
No.

346
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,680
If I leave now,

347
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,680
it's like escaping for the crime.

348
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
I'd better watch it first.

349
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
Mengdie.

350
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
You're leaving?

351
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,680
Li Mei, you're here.

352
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,680
I was going to go back to Jingyuan Manor.

353
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
But I met Bigu now.

354
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,680
I can't escape for the time being.

355
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
Damn Gu Yuan.

356
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,680
Don't let me see him again.

357
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,680
Otherwise, I must make him look good.

358
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,680
Is there a possibility

359
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,680
that Gu Yuan didn't steal it?

360
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,680
Whether it's true or not,

361
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,680
it's not a good thing.

362
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
Song'er.

363
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,680
What do you want to see me for?

364
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
I want to find someone.

365
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,680
There's a mark at the bottom of this person's foot.

366
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,680
But the foot is too secretive.

367
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,680
The Wind Valley is so big.

368
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,680
I don't know where to start.

369
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,680
What are you going to do with this person?

370
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,680
What?

371
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,680
It's a long story.

372
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
But you can understand that

373
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,680
finding this person

374
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,680
can solve all my troubles.

375
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,680
He should be in the Wind Valley.

376
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
You need to find someone

377
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,680
who has the power to help you.

378
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,680
After all, the political power of the Xiaoyao Pavilion

379
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,680
has been stolen.

380
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,680
It's a big problem.

381
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,680
If you act alone,

382
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,680
it's hard to get people to criticize you.

383
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,680
The Wind Valley

384
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,680
Brother Zhou.

385
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
Chu Mengdi.

386
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,680
Didn't you say you'd give us three days?

387
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,680
It's only been a day.

388
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,680
Please let me think about it.

389
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
I'm not here to urge you.

390
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
I'm here to help you.

391
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,680
I came up with a plan

392
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,680
to find the devil.

393
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
What plan?

394
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,680
Brother Zhou, do you remember

395
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,680
the glorious time when you hurt the devil's right foot?

396
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,680
Since then,

397
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,680
the Wind Valley has been closely monitoring people from all over the country.

398
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,680
We never found any intruders.

399
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,680
So,

400
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,680
Mengdi said,

401
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,680
this person must still be in the Wind Valley.

402
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,680
There's a spy in the valley.

403
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,680
The hero sees a little bit of the same.

404
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,680
I thought so, too.

405
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,680
But now there are many people.

406
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,680
If we investigate one by one,

407
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,680
I'm afraid it will hurt the reputation of the world.

408
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,680
That's not difficult.

409
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,680
We just need to find

410
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,680
the person with a wound at the bottom of the foot.

411
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
As for the method of finding,

412
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,680
it's not necessarily about the killer.

413
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,680
In my opinion,

414
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,680
Brother,

415
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,680
we can hold a hot-footed meeting

416
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,680
to win the iron foot that Brother Zhou passed on.

417
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,680
First, we can check the feet of the people.

418
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
Second,

419
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Brother Zhou can teach them their unique skills.

420
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,680
It helps to improve the reputation of Brother Zhou.

421
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,680
You are really smart.

422
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,680
Learning the devil's foot

423
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,680
is the responsibility of the Chu family.

424
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,680
I'm not going to tolerate it if I can't find the devil's foot.

425
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,680
Okay.

426
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,680
I'm going to prepare

427
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,680
the hot-footed meeting.

428
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Okay, over there.

429
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,680
Put it here.

430
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,680
Come on, hurry up.

431
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,680
Come on.

432
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,680
Why is the water so cold?

433
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
Change to hot water.

434
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,680
Go out.

435
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,680
What kind of wine does a man drink?

436
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,680
I don't drink.

437
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,680
Yes.

438
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,680
It's sunny.

439
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
How can a man take off his shoes?

440
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,680
It's too unethical.

441
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,680
Brother Zhou,

442
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
I want to soak.

443
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,680
But the foot is too smelly.

444
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,680
It's not good if the other brothers faint.

445
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,680
Brother Nan, you came just in time.

446
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,680
Your wife prepared the second head for you.

447
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,680
It's a bit noisy to take off your shoes in public.

448
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,680
When I was in the Western Regions,

449
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,680
every year at this time,

450
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,680
there will be a hot-footed meeting.

451
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,680
This foot bath

452
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,680
not only can connect the meridians,

453
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,680
but also can increase internal force.

454
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,680
Madam,

455
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,680
didn't you also make the foot bath powder?

456
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,680
You forgot to put it there.

457
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
I forgot.

458
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
I forgot.

459
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,680
I forgot.

460
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,680
I forgot.

461
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,680
I forgot.

462
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,680
I forgot.

463
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,680
I forgot.

464
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
I forgot.

465
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,680
I forgot.

466
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,680
Yes.

467
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,680
It can increase internal force.

468
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,680
I'll do it first.

469
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,680
I'll do it first.

470
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,680
I'll do it first.

471
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,680
I'll do it first.

472
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,680
Go back.

473
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,680
All have foot baths.

474
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
Why are you in a hurry?

475
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,680
Hurry up.

476
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
Hurry up.

477
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
Tell me.

478
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,680
Soak feet with the brothers.

479
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,680
It's really a special taste.

480
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,680
Brother's feet are smelly.

481
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,680
Please bear with it.

482
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,680
It's smelly.

483
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
Big foot.

484
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Give me one.

485
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
Come on.

486
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,680
What are you doing?

487
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
I'll tell you later.

488
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,680
Brother.

489
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,680
Is there more foot bath powder?

490
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,680
After I washed it,

491
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,680
I felt my body was sore.

492
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
I want to wash it for the second time.

493
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,680
After you were seen by Big brother,

494
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,680
you can't wash it for the second time.

495
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
What do you mean?

496
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
It's like this.

497
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
Soaking feet with the powder

498
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,680
will increase internal force.

499
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
If you soak it twice,

500
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,680
it will hurt your mind.

501
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,680
I can't.

502
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,680
I can't.

503
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,680
I didn't expect

504
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,680
your ability to make up stories

505
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,680
is so good.

506
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,680
What's going on?

507
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,680
Why do you have to

508
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,680
hold this foot bath party with Zhou Heng?

509
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,680
Because I'm looking for someone else.

510
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,680
Who?

511
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,680
Zhou Heng.

512
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,680
Zhou Heng.

513
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,680
Zhou Heng.

514
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,680
Who?

515
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,680
A very important person.

516
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,680
Only by finding him,

517
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,680
can I stay here with peace of mind.

518
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,680
And I can stay by your side with peace of mind.

519
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,680
What do you mean?

520
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,680
It's just...

521
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,680
I like you too.

522
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
You...

523
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,680
Big brother.

524
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,680
Big brother.

525
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
He's going to date someone.

526
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
Big brother, wait.

527
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
Brother Lin.

528
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,680
Brother Lin.

529
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,680
Come on.

530
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
Come and have a look.

531
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,680
Soak foot bath?

532
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
What are you going to do?

533
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,680
Today, the valley is going to hold a foot bath party.

534
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,680
All the brothers are going to soak their feet.

535
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,680
I heard that the foot bath water is very good.

536
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,680
Master brought it from the west.

537
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,680
The teacher put some

538
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,680
special salt-poured powder.

539
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,680
Master?

540
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
Is it hard to blow?

541
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,680
I don't want to soak it.

542
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,680
So I packed it for you.

543
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
I think

544
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,680
it should be good for your foot injury.

545
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,680
Come on.

546
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,680
I...

547
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,680
I'm coming.

548
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,680
Let me do it.

549
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,680
I...

550
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,680
I'll do it.

551
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,680
How do you feel?

552
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
I feel

553
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
a little strange.

554
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
Strange?

555
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Why is your face so red?

556
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,680
Is it hot?

557
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,680
Baili.

558
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,680
I ask you.

559
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,680
Before you came to the valley,

560
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,680
did you have a matchmaker?

561
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,680
What's that?

562
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,680
Have you ever had a lover?

563
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,680
Lover?

564
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,680
Lover?

565
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
Lin.

566
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,680
What are you talking about?

567
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,680
I...

568
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,680
I don't understand.

569
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,680
Lover is...

570
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,680
Lover is...

571
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,680
You want to be with this person

572
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,680
and stay with him forever.

573
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,680
Want to be with someone and stay with him forever?

574
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
That's you, Lin.

575
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
So this is Lover.

576
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,680
I'm so in love with Lin.

577
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,680
I don't know why

578
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,680
I want to be with this stupid forest

579
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
after thinking about it for a long time.

580
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,680
I'm a little reluctant.

581
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,680
Search carefully.

582
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,680
OK.

583
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,680
Where is it?

584
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,680
Where is it?

585
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,680
I don't know.

586
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
I looked over there.

587
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
I don't know.

588
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
Search carefully.

589
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,680
Brother.

590
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,680
You've been looking for a day.

591
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,680
There's no clue.

592
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,680
The brothers are very tired.

593
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,680
How about today?

594
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,680
OK.

595
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,680
I'll go ahead and have a look.

596
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,680
If there's no clue yet,

597
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,680
we'll go back.

598
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,680
OK.

599
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,680
I'll tell them.

600
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,680
Come on.

601
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
Stop looking.

602
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
Stand in front of me.

603
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,680
OK.

604
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,680
OK.

605
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,680
OK.

606
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,680
The wind blows towards the river,

607
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,680
I dance with you.

608
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,680
The face is covered with thorns,

609
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,680
the sword is in front of me,

610
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,680
the shadow is locked.

611
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,680
The wind blows,

612
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,680
the clouds are in front of me,

613
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,680
I dance with you.

614
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,680
I don't know why,

615
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,680
but I'm so in love with Lin.

616
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,680
I don't know why,

617
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,680
but I'm so in love with Lin.

618
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,680
I don't know why,

619
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
but I don't know why,

620
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,680
I don't know why,

621
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,680
I don't know why,

622
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,680
you shouldn't be like this.

623
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
Why don't you do it?

624
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,680
Why didn't you look at me?

625
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,680
Why didn't you look at me?

626
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,680
Why didn't you look at me?

627
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:19,680
I used to be so sad.

628
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,680
Why didn't you look at me?

629
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:59,680
The wind blows the rain down, you are the one who will return.

630
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:05,680
The wind blows the rain down, you are the one who will return.
