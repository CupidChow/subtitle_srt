1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,540
Think about it.

2
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,560
Fate Sonic is to move freely.

3
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,940
Only one person we know.

4
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:11,940
Kill him together.

5
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,320
Don't think anything, so let me do this.

6
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,280
Kill him!

7
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,640
With me, Team Delicious will be ruined.

8
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:27,400
Just

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 16

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Did you see it clearly?

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If this goes on,

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I won't wait for the sword skill to learn,

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
but I'll be in the gentle trap of the devil.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I once read a book.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
There is a love-sick sword in the book.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Could it be this?

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What are you talking about in the garden?

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Love-sick sword is the kind of

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
skill that can stab people.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You stabbed my heart.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Stop playing tricks.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Listen,

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
you have to practice this sword skill.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Although it's basic,

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
it's enough to protect you at critical moments.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Do you feel

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
that I'm kind-hearted

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and I don't want to hurt you?

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I just don't want to

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
make my plan to be ruined because of you.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Practice the sword skill well.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I just had the power of the red flower.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I really feel that my abdomen

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
is burning.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're burning

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
because of the wine?

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're good at nothing

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
but bragging.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What else can I do?

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm not a bull.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Can I go to heaven just by bragging?

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Then Nan Chuimeng

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
will kill Gu Yuan.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
How can he surrender?

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Are you stupid

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
or do you have a brain?

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I have a brain.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
No.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Boss,

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I've been planning this for days.

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I've invited ten killers.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
They're all on a fixed date.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Nan Chuimeng and Chu Mengdie

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
will go to the water to drink the wine.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'll ambush them on the way.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll kill them all.

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Idiot.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Gu Yuan is not Nan Chuimeng's match.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You can kill him

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
with a few money.

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Do you want us,

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
a righteous sect,

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
to be the host of justice?

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
even though we can't kill Nan Chuimeng,

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
it's a good thing to let him get hurt.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let him die while he's sick.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let him

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
suffer like this.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Suffer like this.

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Suffer like this.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Suffer like this.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Suffer like this.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Are you okay?

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Nail skin.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Go get the nail skin.

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Okay.

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I didn't expect

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I could comb my hair comfortably.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I can comb wherever I want.

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Unlike before,

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
even if I tell you,

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I can't tell you the right place.

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
In such a big place,

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
there's a girl as beautiful as this.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
No wonder that devil

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
taught me archery today.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He even looked at me with his eyes.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He must have

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
fallen in love with me.

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What a pity.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Your birthday

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
has become your birthday.

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm so happy.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm so happy.

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm so happy.

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm so happy.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm so happy.

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Your birthday has become your anniversary.

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
By then,

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll go to the wine.

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
He will poison the wine.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
How about I let Han Yan

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
fire Li Song'er

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and use his room

115
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
to find the poison?

116
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Don't worry.

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The poison

118
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
is probably hidden in the sachet.

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Tomorrow we go out,

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
he will ask to buy extra items.

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We have to keep an eye on him

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
to prevent him from sneaking away.

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes.

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Don't worry.

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'll get him.

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Go.

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Waiter.

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's me.

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Top master?

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Where are the others?

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You asked everyone to bring them here, right?

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm the only one here.

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No.

134
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,920
I'm a poet.

135
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,680
That's right.

136
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,920
I'm a poet.

137
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,480
Boss.

138
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,200
How can you do this alone?

139
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,920
You know,

140
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,040
he's a master of the Sun and the Moon Palace.

141
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,360
Boss.

142
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,160
It's too late to be afraid now.

143
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:54,960
Master Han,

144
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,680
the carriage is passing by.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,720
Boss.

146
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,760
Don't hit me.

147
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,400
What would you like to draw, sir?

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,200
We have many kinds of paintings.

149
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,280
We have the wife of Chichen Chang,

150
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,440
who is not good at martial arts.

151
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,760
We have the wife of Chichen Chang,

152
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,000
who is a beggar.

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,320
We have the wife of Chichen Chang,

154
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,320
who is a beggar.

155
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,440
We have the wife of Chichen Chang,

156
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:29,840
and...

157
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,560
I'm at your service.

158
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,560
Me too.

159
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,320
Okay.

160
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,280
Okay.

161
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
This way, please.

162
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,720
She's going to be gone.

163
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,080
She even brought me here to draw.

164
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,640
This way, please.

165
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,360
You'd better put your head

166
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,120
on the young master's shoulder.

167
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,480
The painting should be close to each other.

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,880
It's beautiful.

169
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,880
Then draw me a little better.

170
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,080
Smile.

171
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,000
I can't lose in the painting.

172
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,320
Boss.

173
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,120
Which side do you think I should draw better?

174
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,360
This side, okay?

175
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,320
Both sides are beautiful.

176
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,760
How about you sit here?

177
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,720
I'll draw this side.

178
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,080
Or which side do you think I should draw better?

179
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,880
A person who is as pure as a snake's blood.

180
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,520
No matter how you draw,

181
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,080
it won't look good.

182
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,720
Keep talking.

183
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,680
You won't last long anyway.

184
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,680
Let's start.

185
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,760
We're family.

186
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,200
Why are you so far away?

187
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,520
Young Master.

188
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,560
Smile.

189
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,200
Think about your wife.

190
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
She's so beautiful.

191
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,440
Smile.

192
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,480
Okay.

193
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,240
Don't move.

194
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
Okay.

195
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,840
Finally, we're on the right track.

196
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,480
Why are you staring at me like a ghost?

197
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,040
You scared me.

198
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,920
The wedding wine is ready.

199
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,000
Today,

200
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,280
you should treat Sister Chu well.

201
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,440
Where's the wine?

202
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,400
It seems that Sister Chu is waiting for the wine

203
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,960
just like me.

204
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,960
Pour the wine.

205
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,880
Finally, we're on the right track.

206
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,920
That's right.

207
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,600
With wine

208
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,920
and dishes,

209
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,040
we can call it a perfect banquet.

210
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,960
Please.

211
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,360
What?

212
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,680
Such a big bowl of wine.

213
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,280
I can't drink.

214
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
I can't drink.

215
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,120
Now,

216
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,160
we're all brothers here.

217
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,600
If you don't drink,

218
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,600
I'm afraid it's not appropriate.

219
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,760
Please.

220
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,040
Video tape before meeting

221
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,960
I successfully realized that

222
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,200
it didn't work so then.

223
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,200
has been very long

224
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,760
very long.

225
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,600
I'm salivating.

226
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
I'm done.

227
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,640
Demon,

228
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,440
I have a surprise for you.

229
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,680
I didn't expect

230
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,360
I would be so successful

231
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,040
in making noodles for the first time.

232
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,360
It must be delicious.

233
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,880
Otherwise,

234
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,120
the Demon will feel bad if I don't eat it.

235
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,320
It's so delicious.

236
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,920
The poison didn't come out of the ball.

237
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,720
So it was waiting for me here.

238
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,240
Happy birthday to my husband.

239
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,440
Look.

240
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,040
This is the surprise I prepared for you.

241
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,480
How do you know it's my birthday today?

242
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,920
I know everything.

243
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,440
I can do everything.

244
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,200
How is it?

245
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,400
Is it a surprise?

246
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,800
I never celebrate my birthday.

247
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,240
So?

248
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,400
I have a good idea for you.

249
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
You must remember

250
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,320
to celebrate your birthday

251
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,720
with your closest friend.

252
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,960
Then you will be happy.

253
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,720
Open it and have a look.

254
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,640
Hurry up.

255
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,600
How is it?

256
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,600
If today becomes my death day,

257
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,360
I think you will be happy.

258
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,600
You...

259
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,200
You think I poisoned it?

260
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,200
You know it well

261
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,640
if you poisoned it.

262
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,480
I...

263
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,200
I worked hard

264
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,000
to prepare a surprise for you,

265
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,080
but you turned me down.

266
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,160
Cheated me?

267
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,600
You neverolutions about me?

268
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,280
is another example of being beautiful.

269
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,160
Master Kongactian,

270
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,360
I'm sorry about what I've done.

271
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,640
I trust you.

272
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,880
Let's not stand on each other's feet.

273
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,320
I'll find confronted people

274
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,800
as he is today,

275
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,360
and as we get there.

276
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,080
That kind of slander

277
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,200
will never be forgiven.

278
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,440
Don't you think

279
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,920
we should love each other

280
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,440
more?

281
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,440
The more we love,

282
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,280
the more we'll get,

283
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,680
Today is your birthday.

284
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,520
That's why I let you go.

285
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But you

286
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,560
treated my kindness

287
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,880
as a green coffee.

288
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,040
I want to go home.

289
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,040
I want to go home.

290
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
I want to go home.

291
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,240
The noodles smell so good.

292
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,360
I put some orchid in it.

293
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,560
Of course it smells good.

294
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,120
Mother,

295
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,800
this taste

296
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,280
is so delicious.

297
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,600
I want to eat it for a lifetime.

298
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,520
A lifetime?

299
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,720
You are the one who wants to eat it.

300
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,200
Besides,

301
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,640
I will leave you one day.

302
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,520
But it doesn't matter.

303
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,640
I can give it to my future daughter-in-law.

304
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
Then our Yuan'er

305
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,600
can always eat this taste.

306
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,880
I want to go home.

307
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,040
Let's go.

308
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,280
Let's go home.

309
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,000
Let's go home.

310
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,400
Otherwise, people in the valley will be suspicious.

311
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,040
Suspicious?

312
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,280
That's even better.

313
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,880
I'm not acting anymore.

314
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,640
Do you hear me?

315
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,560
I'm not acting anymore.

316
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,000
Let's have some fun.

317
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
I'm not going to eat.

318
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,880
No.

319
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,080
I'm just curious.

320
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,680
You lost your tail just now.

321
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,280
Why are you still sleeping now?

322
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,280
You are a professional killer.

323
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
Why are you in a hurry?

324
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,080
Half a box of incense is enough.

325
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,280
What do you mean?

326
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,680
You only paid ten boxes of incense.

327
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,880
Now there is still half a box of incense.

328
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,280
I'll withdraw it when it's time.

329
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,080
I'll go.

330
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,880
I'll go.

331
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,680
I'll go.

332
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,480
I'll go.

333
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,280
I'll go.

334
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,280
No way.

335
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,680
I'm telling you.

336
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,880
If you fail,

337
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,680
you can't leave before dawn.

338
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,080
Don't think I can't see it.

339
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,080
You and I are both paid for work.

340
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,880
If you succeed,

341
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
the owner won't reward you.

342
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,680
If you fail,

343
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,280
you'll be punished.

344
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,480
That's true.

345
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,480
So I'm telling you.

346
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,480
Work is the most important thing for your health.

347
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,080
Don't think about the owner all the time.

348
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,880
By the way,

349
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,080
did the person who came to you tell you

350
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,280
that if you succeed,

351
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,480
you'll be rich and rich in the future?

352
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,880
How do you know?

353
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,880
My boss said so.

354
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,280
Right.

355
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,280
Coming.

356
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,680
Coming.

357
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,080
I'm coming.

358
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,080
Princess.

359
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,680
There seems to be a robbery ahead.

360
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,680
Who said I'm the princess?

361
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,680
I'm the princess.

362
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,680
чес

363
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,680

The hairstyle is messy.

369
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,640
Absurd.

370
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,280
Oh no.

371
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,140
It's time.

372
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,740
It's time.

373
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,500
He's home.

374
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,600
Alas!

375
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,940
Finish up.

376
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,940
I'm done.

377
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,940
What are you doing?

378
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,940
No.

379
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,940
At least, let's fight.

380
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,940
We agreed to only fight for ten shots.

381
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,940
Now it's time to finish the work.

382
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,940
A little later.

383
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,940
Wait.

384
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,940
Let's fight. I beg you.

385
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,940
Wait.

386
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,940
I'm done.

387
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,940
Let's fight.

388
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,940
I'm done.

389
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,940
No.

390
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,940
I...

391
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,940
Wait for me.

392
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,940
Senior Brother.

393
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,940
Senior Brother.

394
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,940
Senior Brother.

395
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,940
You called me here, but you're not here.

396
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,940
Such a table of dishes.

397
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,940
You're so old-fashioned.

398
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,940
After drinking the wine,

399
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,940
let's get on the road.

400
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,940
No.

401
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,940
Senior Brother.

402
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,940
Let me explain.

403
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,940
This is what you call a suicide.

404
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,940
You didn't even get a hair.

405
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,940
You even made a gold snake.

406
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,940
What's the use of me keeping you?

407
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,940
Senior Brother.

408
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,940
Although the South Dome didn't have a gold snake,

409
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,940
it's still a gold snake.

410
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,940
Senior Brother.

411
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,940
Although the South Dome didn't die,

412
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,940
but...

413
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,940
What are you doing?

414
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,940
Senior Brother.

415
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,940
This is the power of shock.

416
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,940
Imagine the moment when the crow was killed.

417
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,940
Although the South Dome wasn't hurt,

418
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,940
it was shocked in its heart.

419
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,940
It had a wound in its heart.

420
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,940
When you mention it,

421
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,940
don't say you killed it.

422
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,940
It... it just surrendered.

423
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,940
I'll let you go this time.

424
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,940
But we have to think of a new way.

425
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,940
Yes.

426
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,940
You said that it was a wound in its heart.

427
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,940
Does it work?

428
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,940
Did you scare me?

429
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,940
Forget it.

430
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,940
I won't be as sharp as you this time.

431
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,940
It really works.

432
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,940
A wound in its heart.

433
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,940
Wait.

434
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,940
Among the new disciples,

435
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,940
the fake disciples need to form a team with the Ding disciples.

436
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,940
They can eat and sleep together.

437
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,940
They are strong and weak.

438
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,940
If they form a team with others,

439
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,940
they may hide their bad identities.

440
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,940
Young Hero.

441
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,940
Young Hero Lin.

442
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,940
Pick me.

443
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,940
I'm the last one among the Ding disciples.

444
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,940
Pick me.

445
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,940
Pick me.

446
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,940
You should pick me.

447
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,940
Pick me.

448
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,940
Young Hero.

449
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,940
This senior brother.

450
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,940
Let me through.

451
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,940
Although he is so silly,

452
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,940
he is really a good man.

453
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,940
This little brother.

454
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,940
I invite you to be my one-on-one partner.

455
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,940
I can do it.

456
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,940
You should pick me.

457
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,940
I can do it.

458
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,940
I can do it.

459
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,940
Let me through.

460
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,940
Brother Lin.

461
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,940
Have we met before?

462
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,940
I have also met before.

463
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,940
Why did you come to Feng Yu Valley?

464
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,940
To be honest,

465
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,940
I was born in a fishing village.

466
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,940
I'm a martial artist.

467
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,940
But I'm a martial artist.

468
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,940
I want to make the martial arts of Baili family

469
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,940
more famous.

470
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,940
But I'm not good at learning.

471
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,940
I'm new to the martial arts world.

472
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,940
I'm not good at learning.

473
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,940
I'm not good at learning.

474
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,940
I'm not good at learning.

475
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,940
I'm not good at learning.

476
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,940
I was defeated when I first entered the martial arts world.

477
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,940
Then I asked around.

478
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,940
I heard that Feng Yu Valley is the most prestigious place in the martial arts world.

479
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,940
So I came here.

480
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,940
Clean up after you come here.

481
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,940
Of course not.

482
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,940
I have a dream.

483
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,940
My dream is to find a master with a great martial arts.

484
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,940
I will make martial arts famous in the future.

485
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,940
I saw a master in the valley that day.

486
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,940
I want to be his teacher.

487
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,940
But he never showed up.

488
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,940
What master?

489
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,940
What does he look like?

490
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,940
That day,

491
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,940
he flew over from my head.

492
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,940
Although I didn't see his face,

493
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,940
his body was as white as a mountain.

494
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,940
His body was as white as a mountain.

495
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,940
If I can be his teacher,

496
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,940
maybe you won't be my opponent in the future.

497
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,940
What this silly boy said is not a dream, right?

498
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,940
What are you doing?

499
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,940
Brother Lin, don't be impulsive.

500
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,940
I just want to thank you for taking me as your opponent.

501
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,940
I'll help you to get your back.

502
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,940
I learned it from my grandfather.

503
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,940
No need.

504
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,940
I have a good body.

505
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,940
I don't want to compete with others.

506
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,940
Then...

507
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,940
I won't be polite.

508
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,940
Brother Lin, are you sure you don't want to try?

509
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,940
It's very comfortable.

510
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,940
I heard that big brother and Nan Chuimeng have a competition in the ring.

511
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,940
It's a top competition.

512
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,940
You can't watch it if you go late.

513
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,940
Really? Let's go.

514
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,940
Let's go.

515
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,940
Sit down.

516
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,940
Did I do something wrong again, Brother Lin?

517
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,940
Of course you did.

518
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,940
Of course you did wrong.

519
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,940
I hate to do things that others do the most.

520
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,940
I'm so disloyal.

521
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,940
How can I not touch the bath?

522
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,940
Keep touching.

523
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,940
You're really naughty.

524
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,940
Princess, I've prepared what you want.

525
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,940
Give this letter to Zhou Heng.

526
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,940
I'll go see Li Song'er.

527
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,940
Princess,

528
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,940
you prepared this for her?

529
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,940
Yesterday, she was ambushed in the anti-village.

530
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,940
She's fine now.

531
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,940
It'll be better to give her a soft armor and bodyguards.

532
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,940
She's alive.

533
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,940
It's good for us.

534
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,940
Hit me.

535
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,940
This is a letter from Mr. Nan.

536
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,940
Congratulations, Mr. Nan.

537
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,940
Congratulations, Mr. Nan.

538
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,940
This man, Meng Dezhi, is so scared that he doesn't dare to come.

539
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,940
I didn't expect that this man, Meng Dezhi,

540
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,940
to compete with me,

541
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,940
and he admitted defeat.

542
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,940
It's a pity that I can't compete with him.

543
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,940
What a pity.

544
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,940
Boss,

545
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,940
he won the ancient circle before,

546
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,940
but he doesn't dare to fight now.

547
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,940
It means you've won him.

548
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,940
You're the best in the martial arts world now.

549
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,940
Low-key.

550
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,940
Low-key, Uncle.

551
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,940
It's a shame for Mr. Nan.

552
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,940
Although my martial arts are better than his,

553
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,940
he's good at writing.

554
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,940
It's good for us to pass the magic treasure.

555
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,940
But for Mr. Nan,

556
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,940
it's better not to let others know

557
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,940
that he's not good enough.

558
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,940
Come on.

559
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,940
Come and have a look.

560
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,940
Look.

561
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,940
Look at Meng Dezhi's dream.

562
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,940
Come and have a look.

563
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,940
Come on.

564
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,940
He's so good.

565
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,940
So good.

566
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,940
Uncle.

567
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,940
Low-key.

568
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,940
Where did he go?

569
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,940
Master.

570
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,940
I finally found you.

571
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,940
Who are you?

572
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,940
I'm Baili Xingchen.

573
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,940
Baili Xingchen once betrothed you to a floating body.

574
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,940
So I swear in my heart,

575
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,940
you're the only master of Baili Xingchen in this life.

576
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,940
I'm not your master.

577
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,940
I don't take any disciples.

578
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,940
No.

579
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,940
Master, you can't go.

580
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,940
I've promised to be your disciple.

581
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,940
Move away.

582
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,940
Master.

583
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,940
No, master.

584
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,940
Master, wait for me.

585
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,940
You've been in the valley for many days.

586
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,940
Are you used to the food and shelter?

587
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,940
Master, you're too serious.

588
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,940
I'm fine.

589
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,940
Chu Shizhi.

590
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,940
I once made an appointment with Brother Chu.

591
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,940
On the day you two get married,

592
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,940
I'll hand over the upper scroll of Xiaoyao to you.

593
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,940
But this martial art is too advanced.

594
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,940
I'll hand over the new law of Xiaoyao to you first.

595
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,940
Junior,

596
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,940
you'll take care of the rest.

597
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,940
Thank you, master.

598
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,940
Thank you, master.

599
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,940
Shizhi,

600
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,940
before you pass on your new law,

601
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,940
I want you to promise me two conditions.

602
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,940
One,

603
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,940
the first secret of the martial arts is the Xiaoyao Pavilion.

604
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,940
You must swear that you will never spread it,

605
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,940
including the South Fairy.

606
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,940
I, Chu Mengdie,

607
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,940
swear to the heavens in the name of Jingyun Villa.

608
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,940
If there's any rumour,

609
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,940
thunder will be struck.

610
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,940
I'm not Chu Mengdie anyway.

611
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,940
Thunder is always strong.

612
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,940
The second condition is that

613
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,940
the Xiaoyao Pavilion is very difficult to cultivate.

614
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,940
If you're not careful,

615
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,940
you'll be in trouble.

616
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,940
So,

617
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,940
I'll first explore your martial arts skills

618
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,940
and then I'll teach you.

619
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,940
It's my martial arts.

620
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,940
Master,

621
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,940
do you feel that

622
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,940
you can't sleep at night and sweat a lot?

623
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,940
Yes.

624
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,940
Do you also feel that

625
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,940
your memory is weak

626
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,940
and you can't concentrate on your energy during the practice?

627
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,940
That's right.

628
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,940
These are symptoms of body cold and body fatigue.

629
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,940
But if you take the five-spice powder,

630
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,940
it can not only cure the illness,

631
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,940
but also increase your martial arts.

632
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,940
You can know about body cold and body fatigue?

633
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,940
Now is the right time.

634
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,940
The most active nerves are also the best time to replenish the nerves.

635
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,940
I didn't expect that

636
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,940
you've already mastered

637
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,940
the skill of watching the sky and the earth.

638
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,940
I won't say more.

639
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,940
Master, hurry up and find someone to recite the magic.

640
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,940
Drink tea.

641
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,940
Drink tea.

642
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,940
Master, take care.

643
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,940
Fortunately, the leader doesn't know medical skills.

644
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,940
The magic is over.

645
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,940
It's too tiring to live here.

646
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,940
I'm testing my acting every day.

647
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,940
If I get caught,

648
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,940
I'll be dead.

649
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,940
You dare to pretend to be me to learn the magic.

650
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,940
I think you're a ghost.

651
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

652
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

653
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

654
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

655
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

656
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

657
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

658
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

659
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

660
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

661
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

662
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

663
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

664
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

665
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

666
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

667
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

668
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

669
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

670
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

671
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

672
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

673
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

674
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

675
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

676
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

677
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

678
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

679
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

680
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

681
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

682
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,940

I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

686
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

687
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

688
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

689
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,940
I'm afraid that you're not a ghost.

690
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,940
