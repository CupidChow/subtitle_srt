1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,480
My fingers are like the dust on the ground.

2
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,520
I'm careful not to get lost.

3
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,600
I'm not afraid of death.

4
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,920
I only care about you.

5
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,960
I'm not afraid of death.

6
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,280
You're the only one I can wait for.

7
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,360
Please send me away.

8
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,680
I regret this life.

9
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,720
I can't eat it.

10
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,200
I'm willing to sacrifice myself for you.

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,480
I'm willing to fight.

12
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,040
The Taoism Grandmaster

13
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,040
Episode 16

14
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,720
Master.

15
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,160
Master.

16
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,320
I found Gu Yuan.

17
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,320
What?

18
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,280
Only a mask?

19
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,680
What does it mean?

20
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,960
After Gu Yuan ran away,

21
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,800
I'm sure he won't run away.

22
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,440
The mask was found in the back hill.

23
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,840
It means he must be hurt

24
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,480
after he got hit by my flying dart.

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,680
So he can't run away.

26
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,200
He might even be hiding in the Wind and Rain Valley.

27
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
Teng.

28
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,080
I was right about you.

29
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,280
Your ability and strength

30
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,080
are the master's.

31
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,080
Keep looking for him.

32
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,040
Once you're done,

33
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,080
he'll be a great help to you.

34
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Brother Lin.

35
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
It's you.

36
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,280
I was wondering who it was.

37
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
He asked me to do martial arts.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I...

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,280
You're recovering well.

40
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
I knew it.

41
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,680
The water from the water bath is good for you.

42
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,480
Take it.

43
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,680
What is this?

44
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,040
Take it back.

45
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,040
I'll go back to you after I'm done.

46
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
I said...

47
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
Take it.

48
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
I...

49
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,720
I'll go back to you after I'm done.

50
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
Take it.

51
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
Okay.

52
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
I'll take it.

53
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
What is this?

54
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,280
You're looking for me to test my martial arts skills, right?

55
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
You've found the right person.

56
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,280
Give me...

57
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Love.

58
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
What does it mean?

59
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,120
There's a custom in our hometown.

60
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,120
If you meet a man you like after you're an adult,

61
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,120
you have to make a short sword for him.

62
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
I...

63
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,120
I heard that Brother Baili was missing a short sword yesterday.

64
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,120
So I gave it to you.

65
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,120
We're...

66
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,120
We're even.

67
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
When did we become friends?

68
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
You...

69
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,120
Why are you acting so silly now?

70
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
You told me yesterday that you...

71
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,120
You like me too?

72
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,120
I want to stay with someone all the time.

73
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,120
Isn't that you, Brother Lin?

74
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
So this is your heart.

75
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
I really like you.

76
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,120
I know that you've found my whereabouts.

77
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,120
I've heard that Brother Zhou is very smart.

78
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,120
If you promise me that you won't continue to investigate and destroy the mask,

79
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,120
we can work together to make a cooperation

80
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,120
and share the Xiao Yao Pavilion.

81
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Gu Yuan,

82
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,120
you underestimate me.

83
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,120
Even if I want to learn the Xiao Yao Pavilion,

84
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,120
I won't be a match for you, the demon.

85
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
You want to cooperate with me?

86
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,120
No way.

87
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,120
It seems that I'm getting closer to the truth.

88
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,120
Did you invent the way to soak your feet?

89
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
It's so comfortable.

90
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,120
I feel that my whole body is hot.

91
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,120
I'm making a fire.

92
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,120
I'll go to the other side.

93
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,120
I'll go to the other side.

94
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
I'll go to the other side.

95
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
I'll go to the other side.

96
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
I'll go to the other side.

97
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
I'll go to the other side.

98
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,120
When I was in Zuimou City,

99
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,120
I soaked my feet every day.

100
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,120
My skin was so good.

101
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
But

102
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,120
it's not a big deal if it's about beauty.

103
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120
I'll take you to the other side when I'm done.

104
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Okay.

105
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,120
But it's not possible these days.

106
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,120
I have someone to miss in Chixian City.

107
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,120
I don't want to go back for now.

108
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
Princess,

109
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,120
Zhou Heng said that he used a flying dart

110
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,120
to hit the person who stole the Demon-slaying Pavilion.

111
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
But at the foot bath,

112
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
I didn't see anyone injured at the foot.

113
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,120
Could it be that this person has escaped from Fengyu Valley?

114
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
Think about it.

115
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,120
Jia Guyuan has the ability to steal the secret book.

116
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,120
Is he not able to get the leaf?

117
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
If he's in the valley,

118
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
he must have hidden it.

119
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,120
It seems that the person you are looking for today

120
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,120
is another person.

121
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
As long as you believe me,

122
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
I'm doing this for your good.

123
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
I believe you.

124
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,120
But there is another possibility.

125
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,120
The bandits of Fengyu Valley are traitors.

126
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,120
Song'er is right.

127
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,120
The Demon-slaying Pavilion is a secret place that everyone has been looking for.

128
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,120
Now all the major sects in the world

129
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
hope that he can ask again.

130
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,120
Now this is because

131
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
in Fengyu Valley,

132
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
there are people who want to steal

133
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,120
and take it away.

134
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,120
People of Fengyu Valley don't want the Chu family

135
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,120
to learn the best martial arts.

136
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
That's right.

137
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
If it's really done by people of Fengyu Valley,

138
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
it will definitely show its feet.

139
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,120
Look at you,

140
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,120
sweating.

141
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
Madam,

142
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
let's sleep.

143
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
Sleep?

144
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,120
So fast.

145
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,120
Of course.

146
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,120
It's late and busy all day.

147
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Of course.

148
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
So it's...

149
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
What?

150
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
Nothing.

151
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,120
It's hot.

152
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,120
It's cool.

153
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,120
What's wrong with this demon?

154
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,120
I just finished confessing to him today.

155
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
Why didn't he even show his face?

156
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,120
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,120
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,120
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
I'm sorry.

161
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,120
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
I'm sorry.

167
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
I'm sorry.

168
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,120
You suddenly feel a little cold.

170
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,120
It's a long night.

171
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
Is it good?

172
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
It's hard to drink.

173
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
I won't let you drink.

174
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
In the past,

175
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
I always liked to eat something sweet.

176
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,120
At that time in the Dream City,

177
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,120
Qiao Qian would always make me a lot of delicious cakes.

178
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
You want to eat something delicious?

179
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,120
Of course.

180
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,120
I stay in this shabby valley every day.

181
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,120
I haven't eaten a delicate dessert for a long time.

182
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,120
Then I'll take you to a place.

183
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Where?

184
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,120
Chu Valley.

185
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,120
Exactly.

186
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,120
Now Meng Die and I have finished our wedding.

187
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,120
According to the agreement,

188
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,120
we should teach Meng Die martial arts.

189
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
But now,

190
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,120
the Demon Lord is taken away by the demon sect.

191
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,120
We have no other key in the valley.

192
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
It's just a wedding night.

193
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,120
I want to take Meng Die out for a walk.

194
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,120
Uncle,

195
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,120
if you have any difficulties,

196
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,120
we can also stay in the valley to rest.

197
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
Don't worry.

198
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
You know too much.

199
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Feng Yu Valley lost its secret.

200
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
It's a shame.

201
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,120
I'm ashamed of Brother Wu Ya.

202
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,120
Since you want to go out for a walk,

203
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,120
I'll arrange someone to prepare a meal for you.

204
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Thank you, uncle.

205
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,120
I promise you.

206
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,120
Feng Yu Valley will investigate the matter of Xiaoyao Pavilion to the end.

207
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Wu Xie,

208
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
pass on the order.

209
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,120
From now on,

210
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,120
we will investigate the clues of the Demon Lord's injustice.

211
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,120
Yes.

212
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Whoever can catch up with Xiaoyao Pavilion

213
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,120
is the new young valley master of Feng Yu Valley.

214
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,120
Father-in-law.

215
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,120
Master,

216
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
although I only found a mask this time,

217
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,120
I will definitely take it back next time.

218
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,120
And catch Gu Yuan alive.

219
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,120
You can be relieved.

220
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
That's great.

221
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
Uncle,

222
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,120
you can take care of the secret.

223
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,120
When Brother Nan and I return,

224
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,120
we can learn martial arts.

225
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
I'll go.

226
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,120
God is so kind.

227
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Last time I didn't find the main character at the foot-hanging meeting.

228
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,120
I was so worried about finding it.

229
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,120
I didn't expect the opportunity to come unexpectedly.

230
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,120
I can also protect the Demon Lord

231
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
with this opportunity.

232
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
What are you thinking?

233
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,120
I'm thinking

234
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,120
about my fragrance powder.

235
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
After all,

236
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,120
I'm also a career woman.

237
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
By the way,

238
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
I was just about to ask you.

239
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,120
What do you need this time?

240
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
We can do it together.

241
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
Can I buy anything?

242
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,120
I want to buy some fragrance powder's spice sachets.

243
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,120
And I want to hear some new clothes.

244
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,120
I've been wearing this for a long time.

245
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,120
And the snacks at Tianxiaolou.

246
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
And

247
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,120
is it a little too much?

248
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
It can be more.

249
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
You're so sensible.

250
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
I also want to eat

251
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
the sugar water at Piao Xiang Pavilion.

252
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
Their peach glue is really good.

253
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Oh, right.

254
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,120
And

255
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,120
the peach juice at the high-grade hall.

256
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Look.

257
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,120
The golden weapon, the protective vest.

258
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
How to sell this umbrella?

259
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
No, no.

260
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,120
I don't like it.

261
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
Let's go.

262
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,120
Two guests, please come in.

263
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,120
43 men and women.

264
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
They are not ordinary.

265
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,120
They are not picky.

266
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
It seems that

267
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,120
they really like Du Mingyue.

268
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,120
Boss,

269
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
do you have

270
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,120
black yamage fabric?

271
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,120
The guest has good taste.

272
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,120
Black yamage

273
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,120
is the most popular and hottest style now.

274
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,120
Not only beautiful,

275
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
but also can protect yourself.

276
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
When the young master goes out

277
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,120
and encounters some danger,

278
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
black yamage fabric

279
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
can effectively reduce

280
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,120
the resistance to wind.

281
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
Then you run fast.

282
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
I promise that the thief

283
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
will not catch up with you even if he runs to death.

284
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,120
Men go out

285
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,120
to protect themselves.

286
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,120
Why do I

287
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
listen to this?

288
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
Is it a trap?

289
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,120
This is the marketing technique

290
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,120
of Tao Xi Xi Sect

291
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,120
that we carefully summarized.

292
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,120
I joined this Sect when I was a child.

293
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,120
I have the essence of

294
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,120
the marketing of this Sect.

295
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
It's the first time I've heard

296
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
that there is a gang of people selling clothes.

297
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,120
We are all martial artists.

298
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,120
Of course there are sects.

299
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
Boss,

300
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,120
do you have

301
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,120
black yamage fabric

302
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,120
with the pattern of the fairy crane?

303
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
The guest is really good.

304
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
Please come in.

305
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
This is the best

306
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,120
fairy crane fabric in our shop.

307
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,120
Yama fabric is hard to sew and embroider.

308
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,120
Only our fabric

309
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
can make it look like a real one.

310
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,120
Fairy crane?

311
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,120
Yama?

312
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,120
Isn't this the clothes

313
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,120
that the devil wore before he died?

314
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,120
I didn't expect

315
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,120
that I would buy a tree coat with him.

316
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,120
No, no.

317
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,120
I can't let him buy this cloth.

318
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,120
Wait.

319
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
How about

320
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,120
we change to another one?

321
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
Isn't it always

322
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
the price of the goods that we buy?

323
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
Guests,

324
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,120
you can go to other shops to buy.

325
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,120
But the quality

326
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,120
of the clothes

327
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,120
is not as good as ours.

328
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,120
I just think

329
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,120
that the style

330
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,120
is too old-fashioned.

331
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,120
You can look ten years old in it.

332
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,120
If I walked on the street with you,

333
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,120
I would think that

334
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,120
you are my father.

335
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,120
Or I just think

336
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
that you are rich.

337
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
I want your money.

338
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,120
Madam,

339
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,120
you don't like my money.

340
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
What do you like about me?

341
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
Boss,

342
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,120
I want this cloth.

343
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
I'll pay you back.

344
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,120
Okay.

345
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,120
Waiter, I'll pay you back.

346
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,120
I'll pay you back.

347
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,120
You are so lazy.

348
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,120
I'll give you a discount tonight.

349
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,120
This cloth is of high quality.

350
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,120
It's not expensive.

351
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,120
It's rare to buy.

352
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,120
It takes a long time to make a contribution.

353
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,120
It's expensive.

354
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,120
It's really hard to sell.

355
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,120
But

356
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
an old man came to buy the goods a few days ago.

357
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,120
He has sharp eyes.

358
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
He is not tall.

359
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
He speaks fluently.

360
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
He bought this when he came up.

361
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,120
Look.

362
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
I said that

363
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
the old man wore it.

364
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
I think

365
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
the silk cloth is good.

366
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
It's much better than that.

367
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,120
Then wrap the silk cloth up.

368
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,120
Okay.

369
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
Master,

370
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,120
there is progress.

371
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
Heng,

372
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,120
you have been more and more busy recently.

373
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
Master,

374
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,120
do you still remember

375
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,120
the clothes that Gu Yuan wore that day?

376
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,120
I only thought about the secret of the secret.

377
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,120
I didn't notice any clothes.

378
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,120
What's wrong?

379
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,120
I thought about it seriously.

380
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
I thought about the black yama long robe

381
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,120
that Gu Yuan wore that day.

382
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,120
Black yama long robe.

383
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
This kind of clothes is not common.

384
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
So I looked around.

385
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,120
Finally, I found a store in Tianshui Town

386
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,120
that sells this kind of cloth.

387
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,120
Someone has bought this kind of cloth.

388
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,120
What are you going to do next?

389
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,120
I've been investigating

390
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,120
the weapon shop that makes this kind of mask.

391
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,120
I've checked the price.

392
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,120
I think it will be sold out soon.

393
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,120
I have a good idea.

394
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,120
Heng,

395
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,120
you did a good job.

396
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,120
I'm very relieved.

397
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
But I also thought

398
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,120
you could stop.

399
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,120
Stop?

400
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,120
Why?

401
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,120
I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

402
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
Gu Yuan is good at martial arts.

403
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,120
Everyone knows him.

404
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,120
If you really find him,

405
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
you'll be...

406
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,120
I think

407
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,120
it's over.

408
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
He will decide the clue

409
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
for you.

410
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
No.

411
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,120
Master,

412
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
father-in-law doesn't believe in my ability.

413
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,120
I finally have a chance.

414
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,120
I will do my best to make you believe that

415
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,120
I, Zhou Heng,

416
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,120
have the ability to take your place.

417
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,120
Why is it you,

418
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
stupid?

419
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,120
Come on.

420
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
This one.

421
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,120
I'll get it for you.

422
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,120
And this one.

423
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,120
Okay.

424
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
This one.

425
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,120
Okay.

426
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
And these.

427
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,120
All of them.

428
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,120
All of them are wrapped for you?

429
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,120
No.

430
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,120
Let me see.

431
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,120
Excuse me,

432
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
can you make this kind of sword?

433
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
Yes, I can.

434
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,120
But the soldiers who know how to play this kind of sword

435
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,120
can take a vacation and go home to have a rest.

436
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,120
You can make a custom.

437
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,120
But I have to say,

438
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,120
you have to pay the custom.

439
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,120
You can't return the custom if you pay it.

440
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,120
You're a devil.

441
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
Okay.

442
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,120
So you're here for the sword.

443
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,120
Excuse me, where is this craftsman?

444
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,120
He

445
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,120
is in a remote place.

446
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,120
Why are we circling around?

447
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,120
Do you know the way?

448
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
It seems that someone has been here.

449
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,120
We can't get out of here.

450
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,120
Good.

451
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,120
Young man,

452
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
you have a good eye.

453
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,120
How can you talk?

454
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,120
I'm scared to death.

455
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
I hope the craftsman can give us some advice.

456
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,120
Take us out of this Qi Men Town.

457
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,120
Qi Men Town

458
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,120
Since you see it as Qi Men Town,

459
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,120
since you want to ask for directions,

460
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
I'll sell this picture to you.

461
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,120
Five taels?

462
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
Why don't you go and get it?

463
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,120
I'm not stealing.

464
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,120
I'm just forcing myself to consume.

465
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,120
This is not a map.

466
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,120
Who are you looking for?

467
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,120
I didn't say it was a map.

468
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,120
As long as you pay,

469
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
I'll give you directions.

470
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,120
Then please give directions.

471
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,120
Go right from here.

472
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,120
Go to the head and hit the wall.

473
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,120
That bamboo forest is a barrier.

474
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,120
Just go through it.

475
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,120
Thank you.

476
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
Old liar.

477
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,120
I'll say it first.

478
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,120
That is a dead end.

479
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
Wait for me.

480
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,120
Jiu Jiu.

481
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
You must drink with me today.

482
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,120
Your sister-in-law went out to visit her family.

483
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,120
Let's drink happily today.

484
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
Come on.

485
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
Brother Shen.

486
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,120
Did my sister-in-law make you so painful?

487
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,120
Just this little thing?

488
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,120
What do you know?

489
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,120
I'm happy.

490
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,120
Brother, I'm going to have a daughter.

491
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,120
You have?

492
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
What are you talking about?

493
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,120
Why are you full of children's love?

494
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,120
Do you know what men want to do?

495
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,120
Do something great.

496
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,120
Let others look down on us.

497
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,120
I tell you.

498
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,120
I'm going to catch Gu Yuan.

499
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,120
I've been out for a few days.

500
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,120
Finally, I found the cloth store in Tianshui Town.

501
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,120
When I find out where his mask is made,

502
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,120
I can get rid of this old fox's tail.

503
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,120
Find out where he hides.

504
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,120
This is a good thing.

505
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
Brother, drink.

506
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
Jiu Jiu.

507
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,120
When this is done,

508
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,120
I'll be the new valley master.

509
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
By then,

510
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
You know.

511
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,120
Valley master Zhou Hai Liang.

512
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
You wait for me here.

513
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,120
That's a dead end.

514
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
Wait.

515
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,120
Did you come to these places today

516
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,120
with pre-planned plans?

517
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,120
To investigate the clues of the impostor?

518
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,120
You'll take me to buy things later.

519
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,120
And then investigate this and that.

520
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,120
You help me find the clue.

521
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,120
I'll go with you.

522
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,120
I'll go with you.

523
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
I'll go with you.

524
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
I'll go with you.

525
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,120
I'll go with you.

526
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,120
I'll go with you.

527
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,120
I'll go with you.

528
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
What do you think I am?

529
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,120
A tool man who can see people and hear people?

530
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,120
I'm the one who bought things.

531
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
The clues are also real.

532
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
Then you can investigate.

533
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
Why don't you tell me?

534
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,120
I'm also very good at it.

535
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
I'll show you

536
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,120
my ability to investigate the autumn oyster.

537
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
If you blame the old man,

538
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,120
you'd better believe it or not.

539
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,120
Pretend to cooperate with him first.

540
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,120
Then take him away.

541
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,120
The ground and the table are covered with dust.

542
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,120
It should be...

543
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,120
It should be a big meal outside.

544
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
The steamed buns

545
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,120
seem to have just eaten two bites.

546
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
No one is cleaning the table.

547
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
There's blood.

548
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,120
It seems that this is a dead end.

549
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,120
It's normal here.

550
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,120
Let's go first.

551
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
Wait.

552
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,120
There's blood.

553
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,380
He saw the

554
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,120
how to lure him away?

555
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,120
I order you now.

556
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,120
Take me out immediately.

557
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,120
There's someone in there.

558
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,120
Sasa.

559
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
Sasa.

560
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
Sasa.

561
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,120
Sasa.

562
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,120
Sasa.

563
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,120
Sasa.

564
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
Sasa.

565
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,120
It's true.

566
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,120
Only with a calm mind can you be at ease.

567
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:44,120
Now I'm at peace.

568
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,120
Nothing can affect me.

569
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
Why do I feel so empty

570
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,120
every time I see this sword?

571
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
Cheer up.

572
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,120
Wen Yu is a man of great words.

573
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,120
His father is a talented man.

574
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,120
His husband is a young man.

575
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,120
Who are you?

576
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,120
Little brother.

577
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,120
Who are you?

578
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,120
I'm Bai Li Xingchen.

579
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,120
I'm a disciple of the main branch of Wind and Cloud Valley.

580
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,120
Since you're a disciple of the main branch,

581
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,120
you've already fallen asleep

582
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,120
even if you're a disciple of the main branch.

583
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,120
But you're practicing martial arts here.

584
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,120
I want to sleep early too.

585
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
But I keep thinking about...

586
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
I think it's better not to sleep here.

587
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,120
I should practice hard

588
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,120
and become a martial arts hero early.

589
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
Sir, don't bother me.

590
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,120
I can't be disturbed by the outside world.

591
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,120
I'm practicing.

592
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
Practicing.

593
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,120
Seeing you now

594
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,120
reminds me of myself more than 20 years ago.

595
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,120
I'm also a young man with the latest martial arts.

596
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,120
What did you say?

597
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,120
Young man.

598
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,120
What's your goal?

599
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,120
My goal is to learn all the martial arts

600
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,120
and become a generation of martial arts masters.

601
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,120
Help everyone who needs help.

602
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,120
Good. Very good.

603
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,120
Young man, I wish you all the best.

604
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
Thank you, sir.

605
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,120
Sir.

606
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,120
You haven't told me what your name is.

607
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,120
Sir.

608
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,120
Sir.

609
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,120
I want to help...

610
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,120
The wheel!

611
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
Sir, your wheel fell off.

612
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,120
Sir!

613
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,120
Sir, the person you're looking for has come.

614
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,120
Good job.

615
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
This is for you.

616
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
Thank you, sir.

617
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,120
The person is waiting at the door.

618
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,120
But this person is deaf and mute.

619
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,120
He doesn't like to see people.

620
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,120
If there's anything you want to say,

621
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
you can write it on the note.

622
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
He'll understand.

623
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
You made this mask.

624
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
Do you remember

625
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,120
what that person in your mask looked like?

626
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,120
You don't remember anything?

627
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,120
Aren't you deaf and mute?

628
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
Then how did you hear

629
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,120
what I just said to you?

630
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,120
The wind blows towards the river

631
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,120
and the night is with you

632
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,120
We are in the same boat

633
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,120
The sword in front of me

634
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,120
is like a sword

635
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,120
that can cut through the darkness

636
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,120
The wind blows and the sun sets

637
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,120
Your eyes are in front of me

638
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,120
You don't care about me

639
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,120
I'll stay here for the rest of my life

640
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,120
I'll stay here for the rest of my life

641
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,120
I'll stay here for the rest of my life

642
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,120
I'll stay here for the rest of my life

643
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,120
I'll stay here for the rest of my life

644
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,120
I don't know when I'll be able to get back

645
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,120
How can I forget you?

646
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,120
My feelings are so deep

647
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,120
that I don't dare to take a step back

648
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,120
The flowers in winter are like a flower

649
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,120
The spring comes and the summer comes

650
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,120
I ask the wind for the wind

651
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,120
and the moon for the moon

652
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,120
I ask the wind for the wind

653
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
I'd rather dance in the air

654
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,120
and write for you

655
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,120
I can run to you in the future

656
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,120
I'd rather not be afraid

657
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,120
and never give up on my dream

658
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,120
I'd rather be a man of my word

659
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,120
and be a man of my word

660
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,120
and be a man of my word

661
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,120
I'll stay here for the rest of my life

662
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,120
and you'll be my enemy

663
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,120
I'll stay here for the rest of my life

664
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,120
and you'll be my enemy
