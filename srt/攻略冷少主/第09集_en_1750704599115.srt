6
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,280
Where are you going?

7
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,200
Master.

8
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,440
You didn't go back to your room in the middle of the night.

9
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,840
Where are you going?

10
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,840
Why are you here?

11
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,160
I found you were not here after I went back to my room.

12
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,000
I was worried.

13
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,200
So I came out to have a look.

14
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,240
I have something to ask this boy.

15
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,680
You go back first.

16
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,880
What's up?

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,920
You and him are getting married in Dream City.

18
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,160
Getting married?

19
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,920
I've never married a teacher.

20
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,840
Do you want to...

21
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,600
Shut up.

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,480
You're stupid.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,400
Now she's my wife.

24
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
You're lucky.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,400
Madam, it's late.

26
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,440
Let's go back to our room.

27
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,480
But I haven't finished talking to him.

28
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,080
Nan Chun Meng, you...

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,240
Help me down.

30
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,720
You...

31
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,720
I have something to say.

32
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,440
Help me down, Nan Chun Meng.

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,200
Help me down.

34
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,520
Master just said I was...

35
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,680
a fool?

36
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,800
He finally took me as his disciple.

37
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,000
He finally took me as his disciple.

38
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,320
You...

39
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,160
You're restricting my freedom.

40
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,080
You're restricting my freedom.

41
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,160
You're really dangerous.

42
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
Dangerous?

43
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,200
Is there anyone in the Feng Yu Valley

44
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,440
who is more dangerous than you?

45
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,720
We just got married.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,280
You met a man in the middle of the night.

47
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,120
How can you let others see you?

48
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,920
Not only did we get hurt,

49
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,520
but we also made others suspect

50
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,840
your real identity.

51
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,360
I don't think you're afraid of making others suspect you.

52
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,320
You're just pretending to be a priest

53
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,640
and competing with that man for the title of vinegar.

54
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,400
What is vinegar?

55
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,600
I've never been used to it.

56
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,080
You don't know vinegar,

57
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,800
but you know it's sour.

58
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
Fine.

59
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,560
I don't want to explain.

60
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,600
But I did

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,120
have something important to discuss with Baili.

62
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,760
What is it?

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,360
I'll be honest with you.

64
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,840
Baili Xing Chen

65
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,760
is the son of our Master Zui Meng Cheng.

66
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,120
We met once

67
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,400
because of the promise of parents

68
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,360
and the promise of Meishuo.

69
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,840
But I swear

70
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,080
we don't have any personal feelings.

71
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,120
I just want to ask him

72
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,040
how he got to Chiqian City.

73
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,760
Is my mother all right?

74
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,720
I know

75
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,880
you're feeling sad now.

76
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,440
But now

77
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,920
there's a big thing to do about your life.

78
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,400
About my life?

79
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,680
Is it possible that

80
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,640
someone is going to kill me?

81
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,080
You even forgot about the big thing

82
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,080
about marrying Xiao Yao Jue tomorrow.

83
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,640
I was confused

84
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,960
and forgot about the big thing.

85
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,240
Don't be mad at me.

86
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,160
You're apologizing

87
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,200
to take care of my mood?

88
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,560
I...

89
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,680
I'm caring about my roommate.

90
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,840
Your roommate?

91
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,560
Yes.

92
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,800
We live together.

93
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,240
We're just roommates.

94
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,240
I'm done.

95
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,400
I'm going to bed.

96
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,120
Lin!

97
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,480
I'm back!

98
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,280
Why are you packing?

99
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,000
Chu Jia.

100
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,720
Where are you going?

101
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,320
What do you want?

102
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,480
Lin.

103
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,040
I think Shiniang is weird.

104
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,960
She said

105
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,920
I was her partner.

106
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,440
Did you two

107
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,760
have a marriage?

108
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,440
How is that possible?

109
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,040
I have no impression of her.

110
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,440
But I suspect

111
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,000
she might be here to repay her kindness.

112
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,520
Reward?

113
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,000
Well.

114
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,400
You know

115
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,600
I'm a little hot-hearted.

116
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,960
When I was a kid,

117
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,560
I was a good student.

118
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,000
Shiniang

119
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,920
might be one of them.

120
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,880
Now I'm a man.

121
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,200
She wants to repay me.

122
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,440
So

123
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,280
she came to teach me martial arts.

124
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,280
But in my heart,

125
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,760
I already have my master.

126
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,320
How could I

127
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,640
lead others?

128
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,480
Master!

129
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,280
What's this?

130
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,920
Brother Lin.

131
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,600
Who's the girl on this painting?

132
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,560
What do you think

133
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,160
of the girl

134
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,680
on the painting?

135
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,240
See this one.

136
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,480
She's pretty and graceful.

137
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,440
She gets ב bracket surely.

138
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,200
Why not?

139
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,520
Look at her.

140
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,680
She's holding a sword,

141
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,680
but not a woman.

142
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,760
She's even hiding her position.

143
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,240
She's trying to steal it.

144
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,200
Brother Lin,

145
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,360
you can't give her away.

146
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,840
You haven't told me

147
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,040
who this woman is.

148
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,520
She's a fish you saved.

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,200
A mermaid.

150
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,080
The

151
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,680
Uncle.

152
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,480
Shizhi,

153
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,800
you haven't recovered yet, have you?

154
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,440
I asked someone to make some tonic soup.

155
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,520
I'll send it to your room later.

156
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,240
Thank you for your concern.

157
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,400
I wonder

158
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,080
why you called me here

159
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,680
so early in the morning.

160
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,240
The people from Jingyun Manor are here.

161
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,360
I didn't inform you in advance.

162
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,760
I sent an announcement at the foot of the mountain.

163
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,520
I was in a hurry.

164
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,240
Oh, no.

165
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,920
What's going on?

166
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,160
You mean

167
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,560
the people from the manor?

168
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,000
Of course it's the people from Jingyun Manor.

169
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:41,960
What's wrong?

170
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,960
Have you forgotten such an important thing?

171
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,080
Today, we're going to open

172
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,760
the secret door of the Xiaoyao Pavilion.

173
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,800
The people from Jingyun Manor

174
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,440
can't be absent.

175
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,920
How could Mengdie

176
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,400
forget such a thing?

177
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,200
Mengdie just wants to

178
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,680
prepare a surprise for you.

179
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,760
The people from Jingyun Manor are here.

180
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,800
Then my identity is not enough.

181
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,320
The disciples of Jingyun Manor,

182
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,280
Chu Jingshu,

183
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,240
meet you,

184
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,200
Mr. Bai.

185
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,840
You're so polite.

186
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,440
I'm no longer the leader.

187
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,040
I'm not far from you.

188
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,920
Please forgive me for my lack of hospitality.

189
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,040
Mr. Bai,

190
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,240
we've been friends for years.

191
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
You don't have to be so polite.

192
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,680
What?

193
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,640
You don't even know your leader?

194
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,440
You...

195
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,240
I...

196
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,400
I'm the first one.

197
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,520
You're the first one?

198
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,640
I'm the second one.

199
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,640
I'm the second one?

200
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,800
We're both...

201
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,520
I...

202
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,000
We're good friends.

203
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,760
Jingshu,

204
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,480
how are you?

205
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,560
It's been a few days.

206
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,040
You're still

207
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,840
so polite.

208
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,200
Sorry for your embarrassment.

209
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,080
This is a secret between us.

210
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,280
Jingshu,

211
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,280
how's everything going in the manor?

212
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,480
Everything is going well.

213
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,160
I received a letter from you.

214
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,240
I arrived at the Fengyu Valley at once.

215
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,160
Mr. Bai,

216
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,840
Mengdie hasn't seen her family for a long time.

217
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,920
She must be missing them.

218
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,560
She hasn't had time to tell us.

219
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,840
Why don't we talk alone?

220
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,200
Of course.

221
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,160
Please.

222
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,480
Thank you, Uncle.

223
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,200
Greetings, Uncle.

224
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,640
Chuimeng,

225
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,200
I have nothing

226
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,560
to hide from you.

227
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,360
Do you know

228
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,120
what this jade pendant is for?

229
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,800
I don't know.

230
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,080
I just know

231
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,240
it should be related to the Elixir of the Mind.

232
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,320
That's right.

233
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,280
This jade pendant

234
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,320
is one of the keys to the secret stone cave.

235
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,080
The other half

236
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,520
is the key to the secret room

237
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,000
in the Three-Colored Pagoda.

238
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,320
How dare you!

239
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,320
No wonder you're so unwilling to give me the jade pendant.

240
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,480
Twenty years ago,

241
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,480
in order to avoid the war between the world and the world,

242
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,560
Brother Chu and I

243
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,360
used the witness of the six sects

244
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,920
to divide the Wulin Treasure and the Elixir of the Mind

245
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
into two parts.

246
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,160
We hid them separately in the Fengyu Valley and Jingyun Villa.

247
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,080
We decided to never let them meet again.

248
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,480
But

249
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,920
now the evil sect is rising again.

250
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,040
We can't

251
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
let them meet again.

252
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,640
I'm so scared.

253
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,400
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

254
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
It was so sudden.

255
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,480
I heard that

256
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
many unknown people stopped them on the way.

257
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,480
It's not going well.

258
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,240
It must be the people from Fengyu Valley.

259
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,640
That Bai Wuxian

260
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,680
is so evil.

261
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,000
That's true.

262
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,680
But in order not to let you get in,

263
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,960
I came here today to give you the key.

264
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,480
The key?

265
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,400
The Three-Colored Pagoda?

266
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,920
The Three-Colored Pagoda?

267
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,640
It seems to be no different from mine.

268
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,440
You don't know that

269
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,440
my father Chu Wuya made this pagoda himself.

270
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
Only his inner power

271
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,480
can make this kind of pagoda.

272
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,640
There's only one in the world.

273
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,320
Li Mei,

274
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,920
where did you get this pagoda?

275
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,120
What a coincidence!

276
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,960
My father gave it to me.

277
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,080
But when I was six years old,

278
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,400
it disappeared.

279
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,400
Only this pagoda is left.

280
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,000
When my father Chu Wuya was young,

281
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,840
he also had the habit of picking flowers and making grass.

282
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,120
We were the same age.

283
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,440
Are you my...

284
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,400
No, no, no.

285
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,320
Impossible.

286
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,840
In short,

287
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,280
these two pagodas

288
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,520
may look the same on the surface,

289
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,480
but when you open the ten-door mechanism,

290
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,560
you must hide them.

291
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,120
Just in case,

292
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,360
you'd better take this one with you.

293
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,120
You can't enter the lady's room.

294
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,520
Don't be angry, young hero.

295
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,600
It's time.

296
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,880
I'm here to ask the Chu's lady to move.

297
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,960
Ask me?

298
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
Then you dare to break in.

299
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,120
Next time,

300
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,560
it's not her who moves.

301
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,920
Chu's lady, I'm sorry.

302
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,320
I'm sorry.

303
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,000
Chu's lady.

304
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,360
Uncle Qing, let's go.

305
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,080
The bracelet smells so good.

306
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,120
The wedding is over.

307
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,840
According to the agreement,

308
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,400
we, Feng Yu Gu,

309
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,360
will send the silk scroll to the Chu's lady.

310
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,560
And the key to open the secret door

311
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,360
is the trust between the two of you.

312
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,160
You two must keep it.

313
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,400
The mechanism is hidden in the South Wuntian's master's room.

314
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,360
Everyone,

315
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,640
the key to open the secret door

316
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,640
is the trust between the two of you.

317
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,440
The two of you must keep it.

318
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,680
The mechanism is hidden in the South Wuntian's master's room.

319
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,480
Everyone,

320
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,160
everyone,

321
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,320
today, I, Feng Yu Gu,

322
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,320
will start the wedding.

323
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,600
Mr. Nan, please.

324
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,400
The key to open the secret door is the trust between the two of you.

325
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,720
Oh, no.

326
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,400
Did I change the bracelet wrongly just now?

327
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,000
Chu's lady,

328
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,800
is this bracelet fake?

329
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,840
How could it be?

330
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,720
I think I'm wrong.

331
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
I'll try again.

332
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,760
It seems that

333
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,560
I can only eat now.

334
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,400
I seem to have taken the wrong bracelet.

335
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,840
You can eat and talk about anything.

336
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,720
Everyone in Chichen City knows

337
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,000
that it takes tens of metals

338
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,680
to make the Three-color bracelet.

339
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,680
Besides,

340
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,600
it takes a lot of inner energy

341
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,360
to make the Three-color bracelet.

342
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,560
How can you have two pairs?

343
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,400
You're right.

344
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,560
But this pair

345
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,480
was made by my father.

346
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:23,960
If you don't believe me,

347
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,720
you can check it yourself.

348
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,680
I'll show you.

349
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,440
Even if Chu Wuyia made it,

350
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,080
what can it mean?

351
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,760
Three-color bracelets are important.

352
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,440
I usually wear them.

353
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,720
It's inconvenient to walk in the world.

354
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,040
Especially I'm afraid of those who are evil.

355
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,200
Stealing them.

356
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:53,960
My father

357
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,680
made one more pair

358
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,760
to destroy the hall.

359
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,400
Don't look.

360
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,200
The bracelet looks the same,

361
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,080
but it's a thousand miles away.

362
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,080
I was in a hurry.

363
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,480
You took the wrong one.

364
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,400
It's a big deal.

365
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,280
It's about my reputation.

366
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,320
You're in the mountain village.

367
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,800
How can you play with it?

368
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,640
You're wrong.

369
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
We came here

370
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,400
to give you the real bracelet.

371
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,960
If it's a game,

372
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,960
why are you so serious?

373
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,160
That's right.

374
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,840
I'm the one who learned the school's bracelet.

375
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,120
I took a fake bracelet on purpose.

376
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,080
What's the benefit?

377
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,560
I said I took the wrong one.

378
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,600
I did.

379
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,320
Okay.

380
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,440
Since you took the wrong one,

381
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,960
it's time to go back to the room.

382
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,120
We'll wait here.

383
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,560
He took it now?

384
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,800
I don't know where Mengdie is now.

385
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,840
There's not enough time to go back and forth.

386
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,000
Uncle Xu.

387
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,200
Since it's past the auspicious time,

388
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,920
why don't you give Chu Wuyia some more time?

389
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,160
There are many outsiders in the valley now.

390
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,560
It's easy to cause trouble.

391
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Give me three more days.

392
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:05,880
No.

393
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,000
One day.

394
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,440
Tomorrow at this time,

395
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,840
I'll definitely open the stone.

396
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,480
Okay.

397
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,000
I'll give you another day.

398
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,200
If you can't open the stone tomorrow,

399
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,520
don't blame me for being ruthless.

400
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,960
It's urgent.

401
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,560
Why don't you help me?

402
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,560
If it's not...

403
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,280
What's your relationship with Chu Mengdie?

404
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,520
I have no relationship with him.

405
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,040
I don't know him.

406
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,120
You once told me

407
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,800
that you would never be disloyal.

408
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,080
Are you trying to make a fool of yourself?

409
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,280
I've never betrayed you.

410
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,760
Then tell me.

411
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,840
Why are the disciples of Jingyun Villa

412
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,200
always cheating you?

413
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,040
I'm not a traitor.

414
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,160
I'm just a student.

415
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,240
I'm not a traitor.

416
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,360
I'm just a student.

417
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,960
Why are the disciples always cheating you?

418
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,160
Why do they think you're Chu Mengdie?

419
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,720
Because I have three colors of bracelets.

420
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,600
They may have some plan

421
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,320
to use me.

422
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,080
I'm with you every day and night.

423
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,960
I don't have time

424
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,160
to know Chu Mengdie.

425
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,600
You knew where Nan Chun Meng was.

426
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,080
Now Chu Mengdie

427
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,440
is helping you secretly.

428
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,520
Li Song'er.

429
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,160
Who are you?

430
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,480
Who am I?

431
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,720
It's up to you.

432
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,080
Forget it.

433
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,160
You're not allowed to ask me.

434
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,360
Go back to your room tonight.

435
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,480
Liu Yingying and Han Yan

436
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,680
will be guarding you at the door.

437
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,040
You're imprisoning me.

438
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,520
I'm trying to protect you.

439
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,040
You've seen

440
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,880
how Bai Wu Xie is.

441
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,760
Now the people of Fengyu Valley

442
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,600
will let you go so easily.

443
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,320
You're lying.

444
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,160
You're suspecting me.

445
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,320
I'll find the real bracelet tomorrow.

446
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,560
He didn't open the stone today.

447
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,600
I suspect

448
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,880
he's not the real one.

449
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,200
This bracelet is enough to frame the needle.

450
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
It's really made by Brother Chu.

451
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,120
Brother Chu.

452
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,960
You're confused.

453
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,480
Chu Wuya left a trace.

454
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,280
He doesn't trust us.

455
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,280
Why should we

456
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,120
let him learn the secret?

457
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,520
It's about the safety of the martial arts world

458
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,240
and the dignity of the righteous sect.

459
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,840
Don't let the outsiders

460
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,120
hear these rumors.

461
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,560
Let's put it this way.

462
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,680
The first day he came,

463
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,480
I thought he was suspicious.

464
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,080
No solid evidence.

465
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,960
Don't make any conclusions.

466
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,360
If tomorrow

467
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,640
he still can't open the door of the secret,

468
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,320
what should we do?

469
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,600
If that's the case,

470
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,160
we can only

471
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,000
follow the rules of the martial arts world.

472
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
Okay, Brother.

473
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,200
Don't blame me

474
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
for being too harsh.

475
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,760
Master.

476
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,520
You...

477
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,640
Master.

478
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,360
I'm here to say goodbye to you.

479
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,640
This...

480
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,120
What's going on?

481
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,160
Xiao Yao is about to be taken away.

482
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,600
Fei Yan

483
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,120
is so angry with me

484
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,680
that he looks down on me.

485
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,840
He took all the key to the house

486
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,720
and took them back.

487
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,080
Master.

488
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,680
I'm not filial.

489
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,600
I'm not filial.

490
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,040
I'm here to serve you

491
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,640
after I've done so much.

492
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,240
Master.

493
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,120
Master.

494
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,520
Don't cry.

495
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,400
I feel bad

496
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,240
for you

497
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,760
to cry like this.

498
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,040
I told you

499
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,880
to coax Nan Fei Yan more.

500
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,280
Besides,

501
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,480
Nan Wentian is just a daughter.

502
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,120
These will be yours in the future.

503
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,040
What can I do if I'm born a good girl?

504
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,360
After Chu Mengdie

505
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,280
finishes reading the secret book,

506
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,960
he'll be a fool.

507
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,320
In fact,

508
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,440
Master will definitely give the position of the leader

509
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,680
to Nan Chuimeng.

510
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,080
They didn't take the secret book.

511
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,760
The door was not opened today.

512
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,400
It wasn't opened?

513
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,680
I told you

514
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,840
that you took the trick of tricking a kid.

515
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,360
Yes.

516
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,200
The mechanism hasn't been used for years.

517
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,760
It's been more than 20 years.

518
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,880
I'm afraid it's about to be done.

519
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,400
It seems that God gave me this

520
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,760
to prove myself to everyone

521
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,120
that this is the best chance.

522
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,800
Master.

523
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,120
I'm leaving.

524
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,840
Nan Feng Yan took your key, didn't he?

525
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,720
Yes, Master.

526
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,640
I can lead a level-headed man

527
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,640
to run away.

528
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,720
He's a rascal.

529
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,600
The princess required

530
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,000
Master have all the directed methods

531
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,560
from her to set up her private rule.

532
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,320
If sister Li can't fall asleep,

533
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,600
I wish I could hang out with you.

534
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,600
I'm sorry.

535
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,960
You're so stubborn.

536
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,520
I told you not to tell anyone.

537
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,600
But you didn't.

538
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,280
In this situation,

539
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,360
if I can't get out,

540
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,520
I won't be able to get the Three-color Handcuff.

541
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,560
Han Yan.

542
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,640
There's a noise over there.

543
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
No.

544
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,000
It's your side.

545
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,920
My side?

546
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,000
I'll go check.

547
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,000
I'll go check.

548
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,360
God bless me.

549
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,880
It must be Mo Ding.

550
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,360
Mo Ding is here to save me.

551
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,320
Why isn't Sister Lin out yet?

552
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,400
Did we

553
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,360
wait for long?

554
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,560
Her Highness said

555
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,240
someone was in the valley.

556
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,800
Before we entered the valley,

557
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,320
Chu Mengdie died in front of us.

558
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,520
Could it be that both Lord Cheng and Li Song'er

559
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,560
are his substitutes?

560
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,080
How do you know

561
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,520
there's only one handcuff in the world?

562
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,000
Your servant.

563
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,560
Copy this handwriting

564
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,520
and write another note to her.

565
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,320
Who did she meet tonight?

566
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,080
This person

567
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,400
is the receptionist of Jingning Villa.

568
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,200
Brother Lin.

569
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,600
Brother Lin, are you here?

570
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,520
Brother Lin.

571
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,920
Say something.

572
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,440
Don't just cough me to death.

573
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,720
I'm coming, Brother Lin.

574
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,320
Why are you here?

575
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,200
I haven't asked you yet.

576
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,880
What are you doing?

577
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,800
I dropped something.

578
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
Brother Lin.

579
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,160
It's a letter.

580
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,000
So I realized to do it earlier.

581
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,040
Make no mistake

582
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,600
that nothing happened.

583
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,720
Hence felt embarrassed in front of me.

584
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,840
And it happened unexpectedly.

585
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,560
This year,

586
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,880
you met Marquis Y Match jacked up his medicine.

587
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,840
In getting Whoa Bell this Muslims

588
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,960
It's late. Why are you here?

589
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,720
Brother Baili said you're his master.

590
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,200
You can...

591
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,880
I know you're from Jingyun Villa.

592
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,040
Please tell Chu Mengdie

593
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,960
that I'll give the last move of the Yao School

594
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,880
to Li Song'er as promised.

595
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,120
I won't reveal your identity.

596
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,360
But

597
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,400
I have a condition.

598
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,640
Please go ahead, Mr. Nan.

599
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,280
Before,

600
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,920
Chu Mengdie's substitute

601
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,160
died in front of me

602
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,240
before he entered the valley.

603
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,560
Now,

604
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,400
I don't care what you plan to do.

605
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,960
You can't hurt Li Song'er.

606
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,120
Otherwise,

607
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,440
I'll make a mistake

608
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,800
when it comes to the secret.

609
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,920
Don't worry.

610
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,120
I'll tell the First Miss.

611
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,200
But Chu Mengdie is a good fighter.

612
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,360
But he changed his substitute.

613
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,840
Is Chu Mengdie

614
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,200
ugly

615
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,640
and doesn't dare to show his true face?

616
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,400
The First Miss is beautiful.

617
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,840
If she doesn't show her true face,

618
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,240
she has her own plans.

619
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,080
Beautiful?

620
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,960
Then I don't mind

621
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,200
having another marriage.

622
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,400
If you're like this,

623
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,200
aren't you afraid of hurting Miss Li's friendship?

624
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,760
Just kidding.

625
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,800
Goodbye.

626
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,880
Goodbye.

627
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,920
Is there anything else I can do?

628
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,480
First Miss!

629
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,240
is an important person for your brother.

630
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,280
I can't stand her.

631
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,000
Is this Nan Chuimeng?

632
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,080
Nan Chuimeng

633
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,560
is aiththerer than Chu Mengdie.

634
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,480
Please think of me

635
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,840
as an enemy of Princess Li,

636
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,040
어느 � erhö

637
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,320
I'm afraid.

638
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,520
I'm afraid.

639
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,520
I'm afraid.

640
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,520
I'll show you

641
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,640
how a lovely girl

642
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,560
is forced into a desperate situation.

643
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,600
Heroine Chu, I'm here to deliver food.

644
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,840
Feng Yun Hu is really something.

645
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,680
She knew I couldn't get the bracelet,

646
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,640
so she even prepared a meal for me.

647
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,040
I don't want to eat.

648
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,520
I want to eat your rice.

649
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,680
I mean,

650
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,480
I'm here to deliver food for you.

651
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,280
I think I'm a little hungry.

652
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,800
But I need someone to feed me.

653
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,720
You must feed me.

654
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,440
Yes.

655
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,240
I knew you'd come to save me.

656
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,680
This...

657
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,160
What is this?

658
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,120
Is it because Nan Chu Mu is going to make things difficult for you?

659
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:05,640
No.

660
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,720
You're going to find a shortcut?

661
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,680
No.

662
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,120
He didn't make things difficult for me.

663
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:11,920
By the way,

664
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,160
you asked me to meet you at the same place last night.

665
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,560
Why didn't you come?

666
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,120
I thought you were...

667
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,880
Why did Nan Chu Mu suddenly come to me?

668
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,360
He came to you?

669
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,680
What did he say?

670
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,040
No wonder I opened the window last night

671
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,360
and saw him guarding the door.

672
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,600
What else can he say?

673
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,680
It's just some nonsense.

674
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,760
Nan Chu Mu is shameless.

675
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,120
He didn't just use his skills,

676
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,920
he even imprisoned you.

677
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,000
Li Mei,

678
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,600
are you hurt?

679
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,920
No.

680
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,560
He may just want to protect me.

681
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,960
After all, I don't have a key.

682
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,000
The people of Feng Yun Valley

683
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,720
will definitely do something to me.

684
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,280
What time is it now?

685
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,520
Why are you still helping Nan Chu Mu?

686
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,760
I was the one who lied to him at first.

687
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,840
I'm his accomplice on the surface,

688
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,240
but I'm your spy in private.

689
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,240
I even taught him the wrong way.

690
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,960
He should be

691
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,600
on guard.

692
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,800
If Nan Chu Mu

693
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,120
really wants to take you,

694
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,720
just tell him

695
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,880
that you're from the people of the Mount Jingyun.

696
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,920
I'll definitely protect you from now on.

697
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,000
What did you bring me to eat?

698
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,720
The key to the house.

699
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,520
apps

700
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,440
Meng Die,

701
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,200
when I get the clue,

702
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,360
can I tell you

703
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,000
each of the photos?

704
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,720
Yes.

705
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,280
Then I can dock hairy's head.

706
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,880
It's not ヅ beicus!

707
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:58,280
Tth

708
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,840
The sword of the jade.

709
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,120
Your Highness,

710
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,600
Lin Shu

711
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,200
has given the Three-color Handcuff to Li Song'er.

712
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,520
Did he make it hard for Li Song'er?

713
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,240
They are like snake and rat.

714
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,600
They are very good.

715
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,760
If we can't open the handcuff,

716
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,760
we may be exposed.

717
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,000
I'll find a way out.

718
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,240
If we can't get the secret,

719
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,280
we'll leave immediately.

720
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,400
No rush.

721
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,560
Since we know

722
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,760
the specific location of the secret,

723
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,360
we won't be afraid of not getting it.

724
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,720
At that time,

725
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,360
I'll open the handcuff

726
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,760
and you'll act accordingly.

727
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,200
I understand.

728
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,560
The Land of the hospital has been within me.

729
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,840
On the day I make it,

730
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,280
you'll study the Six bizes.

731
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,920
I still don't understand the deception record.

732
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,240
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

733
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,240
The light of the sword in front of me

734
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,240
is like the shadow of the sword.

735
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,240
The wind blows the mist,

736
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,240
and the sword in front of me

737
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,240
is like the mirror in front of you.

738
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,240
Don't forget me,

739
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,240
I'll spend the rest of my life alone.

740
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,240
I've never lost my love,

741
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,240
so why do I look for the light?

742
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:34,240
My love for you is so deep that I dare not to look.

743
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,240
The winter flowers are in full bloom,

744
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,240
the spring comes and the summer goes.

745
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:47,240
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

746
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,240
I'd rather spend the rest of my life with you.

747
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,240
I'll spend the rest of my life alone.

748
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,240
I'd rather not to be lonely,

749
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:02,240
and never give up on my dream.

750
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,240
I'd rather not to be lonely,

751
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,240
and never give up on my dream.

752
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,240
I'll spend the rest of my life with you.

753
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,240
You're my precious.

754
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,240
I'll spend the rest of my life with you.

755
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,240
I'll spend the rest of my life with you.
