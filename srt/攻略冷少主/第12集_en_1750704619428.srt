1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,480
My fingers are like the dust on the ground.

2
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,600
I'm not willing to leave this world.

3
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,680
I'm not willing to die.

4
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,920
I only love you.

5
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not willing to die.

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,280
You're the only one I can wait for.

7
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,360
I'm not willing to die.

8
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,680
I regret this life.

9
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,760
I'm not willing to die.

10
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,240
I'm willing to sacrifice my life for you.

11
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,480
I'm willing to witness it.

12
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 18

14
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,560
It seems we're still a step behind.

15
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,880
Is this the craftsman you're looking for?

16
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,960
There's a lock on the hand.

17
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,120
And the mark of being burned.

18
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,040
It seems the craftsman is right.

19
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,880
I was to move outside on purpose,

20
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,040
to find the owner of this thing.

21
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,160
It beastly!

22
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,960
I don't care about that!

23
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,640
Let's go here.

24
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,440
Did you see that?

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,360
and the Fengyi Valley.

26
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,240
My sister-in-law,

27
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,320
don't get me wrong.

28
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,240
These days,

29
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,880
she's been looking for the clue to the old abode.

30
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,240
Now, she's outside the city.

31
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,760
What's she doing there?

32
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,160
Of course, she's looking for the secret.

33
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,800
Don't worry.

34
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,240
I'll give you the ticket.

35
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,600
As long as my senior finds the clue,

36
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,120
the young valley master will be in a good position.

37
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,360
It's definitely her.

38
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,600
Fine.

39
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,080
It's rare for her to have that sense of duty.

40
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,480
Then I'll wait for the good news.

41
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,760
Let's see what she can do.

42
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,000
It's so hidden.

43
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,360
It can't be fake.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,080
There's no one here.

45
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,640
Let's take her away.

46
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,280
No.

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,760
If she comes back and sees our footprints,

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,200
she'll be shocked.

49
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,400
Are you going to carry her down?

50
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,880
Demon.

51
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,620
Demon Regard

52
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,360
Once she sees this Quails,

53
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,400
all her spirit will be lost.

54
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,640
Forget it.

55
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,960
Just keep practicing.

56
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,120
I'll guard her well today.

57
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,200
Han xiang

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,840
Sir,

59
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,400
please go and take a rest.

60
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,520
When the hero is not around,

61
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,400
ThrowingSecret Madness.

62
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,000
YourESS is going to be very tired.

63
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
You came back.

64
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,380
Stop.

65
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,600
I'm so tired.

66
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,440
Bai Li Xingchen,

67
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
you're good.

68
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,720
When I was sleeping, you practiced martial arts,

69
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,000
and when I was practicing martial arts, you slept.

70
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,200
When I was looking for you, you were sweeping the floor.

71
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,680
You were busy all day.

72
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,320
Why are you hiding from me?

73
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,960
You're afraid of the situation today.

74
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,440
What do you mean?

75
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,480
Lin,

76
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,960
I'm grateful for your care.

77
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,560
Focus.

78
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,320
Don't come over.

79
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,080
You...

80
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,200
You...

81
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,720
Stand there.

82
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,240
Say it.

83
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,760
Lin,

84
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,920
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,560
I only like women in my life.

86
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,000
Just like Song Bai in the snow.

87
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,080
Even if the snow is heavy,

88
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,000
I'd rather not be afraid.

89
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,120
Even if we're brothers,

90
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,600
I won't give up.

91
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,200
Bai Zi,

92
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,640
do you still think I'm a man?

93
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,400
No.

94
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,640
Why aren't you wearing clothes?

95
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,560
What's the matter, Lin?

96
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,840
What should I wear?

97
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,280
worse

98
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,680
Miss,

99
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,560
I'll beacasf you.

100
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,120
I...

101
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,920
He won't allow it anymore.

102
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,440
You can't get a guy like him.

103
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,680
Get away.

104
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,400
He's not good.

105
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,040
Yes.

106
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,000
I need to practice martial arts these days.

107
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,880
So I don't have time to accompany you.

108
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,640
I can accompany you.

109
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,440
What's your plan if you stay?

110
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,680
I'm hungry.

111
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,480
Where are you going?

112
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,640
I'm going to give you...

113
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,160
I'm going to find something to eat.

114
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,040
You practice martial arts first.

115
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,720
I won't bother you.

116
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,840
Even if I'm a woman,

117
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,440
you don't have to look at me for so long.

118
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,400
Lin Xiu.

119
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,160
You...

120
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,800
You...

121
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,200
You...

122
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,400
You...

123
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,560
You're really a woman.

124
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,640
Like a fake bag,

125
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,160
we're not related.

126
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,200
Lin.

127
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,160
Lin.

128
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,360
Lin.

129
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,680
Hello.

130
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,560
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,200
Now Gu Nian hates people who hide their anger.

132
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,760
You're dressed as a man.

133
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,480
If you're found out,

134
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,600
you'll be expelled from the martial arts and expelled from the valley.

135
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,880
This short sword is as sharp as a nail.

136
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,280
Take it to defend yourself.

137
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,200
Run down the mountain.

138
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,360
White Star.

139
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,320
This sword

140
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,400
is for you.

141
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,200
Yes.

142
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:49,160
My fish fork is too

143
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,720
I think I'm missing something too.

144
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,720
The duasar beÃ¡mangjia,

145
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,120
it's quite giant.

146
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,240
Do you know that

147
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,920
number ofaliae in this world

148
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,320
is not halfway to the eight weather.

149
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Number ofaliae low.

150
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,160
But they are always lower.

151
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,240
This photo is a little bit over Yoda.

152
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,040
The older brother of Yoda

153
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,040
I want to make it

154
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,520
Thank you.

155
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,240
Buns.

156
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,440
Buns.

157
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,080
Newly-made buns.

158
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,000
Hot and tasty.

159
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,640
Buns.

160
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,320
Buns.

161
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,840
Okay.

162
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,320
Miss.

163
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,520
How much?

164
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,360
Three taels.

165
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,280
Okay.

166
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,040
He looks like a man with a beautiful face.

167
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,080
He's a man with a beautiful face.

168
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,480
Sir.

169
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,720
I didn't see him.

170
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,440
Little Jiujiu.

171
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,160
Who is he looking for?

172
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,800
Sorry.

173
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,400
Sir.

174
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,320
Your buns.

175
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:55,840
Sir.

176
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,880
I want to ask you something.

177
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,320
Have you seen a man with about 70 cm high,

178
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,880
with eyes wide open,

179
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,400
and with eyebrows straight?

180
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,000
No.

181
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,040
No?

182
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,440
They also found out something.

183
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,920
The devil has to rest after training.

184
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,560
I'll go and have a look.

185
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,120
Ladies.

186
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,440
Have you seen a man with about 70 cm high,

187
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,720
with eyebrows straight?

188
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,560
Miss.

189
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,160
What are you doing?

190
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,240
I'm doing business.

191
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,400
Your Highness.

192
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,200
Your Highness.

193
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,040
This secret technique

194
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,480
is very violent.

195
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,360
I know

196
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,240
you want to take revenge.

197
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,680
But you're so trained.

198
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,680
It hurts your body.

199
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,600
Why don't we take it slow?

200
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,560
You have the business paper.

201
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,640
I've waited for more than 20 years.

202
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,960
How can I return it now?

203
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,920
If you have something to say,

204
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,360
go and see Li Song'er.

205
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,600
Just now,

206
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
she went out.

207
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,600
She said she would buy you breakfast.

208
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,720
It's noon.

209
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,320
I don't know why she hasn't come back yet.

210
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,680
Brother Zhou?

211
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,680
Brother Zhou.

212
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Brother Zhou.

213
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,240
She was killed.

214
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,240
Chu Mengdian.

215
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,600
Put down your weapon.

216
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,160
Heng.

217
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,480
Heng, what's wrong with you?

218
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,680
You...

219
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,960
You killed my beloved disciple.

220
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,000
It's a misunderstanding.

221
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,960
When I came here,

222
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,080
she was already like this.

223
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,880
Today, even if I die,

224
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,920
I want to avenge my senior brother.

225
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,400
I just passed by.

226
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,200
Heng.

227
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,680
Be careful.

228
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
She has a big move.

229
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,240
I caught Chu Mengdian.

230
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,520
No, Master.

231
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,760
She has no internal force in her body.

232
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,120
You're not Chu Mengdian.

233
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,760
Who said I'm not?

234
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,760
Chu Mengdian was a three-year-old martial artist.

235
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,880
She participated in the Chichen City Youth Martial Arts Competition at the age of six.

236
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,160
She defeated 150 contestants.

237
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,520
At the age of twelve,

238
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,760
Chu Wuya sent her out of the mountain villa to practice.

239
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,840
She challenged the leaders of all major sects.

240
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,120
She was defeated by none.

241
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,000
She was called the first female hero in the martial arts world.

242
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,840
How could she be

243
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,320
a scoundrel like you?

244
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,560
Take her back

245
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,800
and interrogate her.

246
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,320
Yes.

247
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,920
Take her away.

248
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,720
Go.

249
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,800
Let me go.

250
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,240
Go.

251
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,000
Let me go.

252
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,000
Go.

253
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Let me go.

254
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,520
It's fine.

255
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,760
Yuxi.

256
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,080
This is Jinxi.

257
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,840
You can go on.

258
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,200
Yes.

259
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,360
You...

260
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
certainly know...

261
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,600
these strips.

262
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,040
APPLAUSE

263
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,720
Save me!

264
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,120
My dear husband,

265
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,600
Her blood

266
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,240
is pure.

267
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,720
Master,

268
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,600
this woman disguised herself as Chu Mengdie

269
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,320
to be the spy of the Devil's Palace.

270
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,560
My Senior Brother died so tragically.

271
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,840
I don't know how much he suffered in his life.

272
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,040
I think she is the one

273
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,600
who secretly colluded with the Sun Moon Palace

274
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,000
to cooperate with the Devil's Palace

275
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,680
and stole my treasure,

276
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,360
the Man of the Demon.

277
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,640
Your Majesty.

278
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,880
I have the Three-Colored Handcuffs of the Manor.

279
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,680
My bracelet

280
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,520
also opened the mechanism of the hidden demon.

281
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,200
Why do you say I'm not?

282
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,280
The Three-Colored Handcuffs are in your hands.

283
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,160
That only shows

284
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,480
that Chu Mengdie has been killed.

285
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,440
Since you don't know martial arts,

286
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,160
that means

287
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,720
Chu Mengdie was killed by that devil Gu Yuan.

288
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,120
Then you were given the handcuffs

289
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,240
and you sneaked into the Wind and Rain Valley.

290
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,400
After you and Chu Mengdie get married,

291
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,640
you can take the treasure.

292
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,240
You should cooperate with the outside world

293
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,680
to help Gu Yuan steal the secret weapons.

294
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,160
After you succeed,

295
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,200
you can continue to stay in the valley

296
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,600
and be his spy, right?

297
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,400
Yes.

298
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,400
But you didn't expect

299
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,160
my smart and powerful Senior Brother

300
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,920
to know your true identity.

301
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,120
In order to avoid your plan from being destroyed,

302
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:35,880
you

303
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,840
brutally killed my Senior Brother.

304
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,720
Tell me.

305
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,720
Where is the Devil's Palace hidden?

306
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,240
Good guy.

307
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,760
I'm going to believe it myself.

308
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,560
I...

309
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,240
That's right.

310
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,400
I really didn't expect

311
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,920
that the lady I love

312
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,520
is a liar.

313
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,280
She wanted to steal the Peony Pavilion behind my back.

314
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,200
Tell me.

315
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,400
In the Wind and Rain Valley,

316
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,680
do you deserve to respect your beloved disciple?

317
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,200
You were so affectionate with me last second.

318
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,880
Why is this second not natural?

319
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,960
Did she deliberately act

320
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,320
to show the Peony Pavilion to someone?

321
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,200
You're so hard to fool.

322
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,560
I really misjudged you.

323
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,320
I didn't expect you to be such a person.

324
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,440
I misjudged you.

325
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,040
Who are you?

326
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,480
Who is the one who instructed you?

327
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,920
You're so confused.

328
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,560
You hired me.

329
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,240
Who are you acting to now?

330
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,920
You...

331
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,720
Nan Xian Zhi is a bunch of nonsense.

332
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,360
Master, she's a liar.

333
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,560
She and I

334
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,280
have never had anything to do with each other.

335
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,040
Master,

336
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,920
why would my nephew have the heart to steal books?

337
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,360
Please give me a clear explanation.

338
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
I haven't mentioned the people in the Wind and Rain Valley.

339
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
You kept talking about not teaching me martial arts.

340
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,360
I think

341
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,760
you stole this book

342
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,400
and made a fake devil yourself.

343
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,040
You!

344
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,760
You're making a big deal out of it.

345
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,040
I'll take the justice for you today.

346
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,280
I'm the one who ordered her

347
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,440
to fake my identity.

348
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,760
Who are you?

349
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,360
I'm Chu Meng Die.

350
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,760
Nonsense.

351
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,000
Aren't you Lin Shu?

352
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,080
It really seems to be Lin Shu.

353
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,720
Yes, it is.

354
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,880
With this weapon,

355
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,960
no one will be suspicious anymore.

356
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,160
I've made a statement as the Young Master of Jingyun Villa.

357
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,440
He has nothing to do with

358
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,680
the Young Master of South.

359
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,560
He's Chu Meng Die's best friend.

360
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,680
I was assassinated on the way to the marriage.

361
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,000
I had no choice

362
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,800
but to ask my friend to fake my identity.

363
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,760
I

364
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,040
sneaked into the Wind and Rain Valley

365
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,160
as Lin Shu

366
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,040
to find out the truth.

367
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,640
Are you really Chu Meng Die?

368
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,160
Then why did you do that?

369
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,400
I have to ask

370
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,560
those people who

371
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,560
did something evil in the dark.

372
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,680
That's right.

373
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,760
I think

374
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,720
you're just a dog and a dog.

375
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,280
That's why Brother Zhou Heng died in the alley.

376
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,600
I, Li Song'er,

377
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,720
am a straightforward person.

378
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,920
I don't know how to do

379
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,520
these sinister and vicious things.

380
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,120
Unlike someone,

381
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,560
I can do whatever I want.

382
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,200
Shut up!

383
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,560
Zhou Heng, drag her down!

384
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,960
Song'er is my best friend.

385
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,640
She's standing behind Jingyun Villa.

386
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,040
If you dare to disagree again,

387
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,080
don't blame me for being rude.

388
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,360
Sister Lin is fine now.

389
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,600
Chu Meng Die has taken her back to the grass house.

390
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,560
My identity is not changing now.

391
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,520
It's good that there are people

392
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,000
guarding her in Jingyun Villa.

393
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,160
But she is used to living there.

394
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,040
I don't know if she is used to living there.

395
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,280
Princess,

396
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,720
Chu Meng Die has really appeared.

397
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,840
We are now

398
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,560
on her side,

399
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,160
or maybe the Demon Lord has abandoned us.

400
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,960
Let's stay in the Fengyu Valley

401
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,360
and wait for their next action.

402
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,920
Heroine Chu.

403
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,560
Thanks.

404
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,080
Heroine Chu, you are married.

405
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,360
I also wonder why you have to get so noisy today.

406
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,080
Young Master Nan, don't you forget

407
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,480
that I supposed to be the one who should be married to you.

408
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,640
So now, I'm not the guest here,

409
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,440
but the master here.

410
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,120
Don't blame me to misbehave.

411
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,040
There's no one here.

412
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,760
You can say whatever you want.

413
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,880
Song'er is young and kind.

414
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,080
Even if someone

415
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,520
betrays him a thousand times,

416
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,160
if you give him a little bit of credit,

417
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,920
he'll be deceived by the same person

418
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,520
a thousand times.

419
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,200
I heard it right today.

420
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,240
Song'er, at a critical moment,

421
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,240
you just care about yourself

422
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,080
and sell him.

423
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,440
What you said to me before

424
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,560
is the same as today.

425
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,800
Whatever plan you have,

426
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,640
Shangji and Li Song'er

427
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,600
are enemies of Jingyun Villa.

428
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,360
This should be my residence.

429
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,480
Mr. Nan,

430
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,600
I won't see you off.

431
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,920
Please, Miss Chu.

432
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,440
You might fail in the name of vocÃª.

433
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,680
And you're Master Beimian.

434
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,400
Who didn't understand that?

435
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,840
Didn't aid me.

436
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,400
Littleassemble.

437
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,240
Has Wu Yan cleaned up this place?

438
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:35,840
She has.

439
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,720
Why are you so serious?

440
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,400
Shen Lushu is really a perverted person.

441
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,080
Your Highness.

442
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,720
We can talk about the most dreamy thing.

443
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,800
Say something, Baili.

444
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,760
I feel you're even more stupid

445
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,720
after you come here.

446
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,200
What are you looking at?

447
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,640
Don't touch it.

448
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,920
You're finally alive.

449
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,000
Is there anything to eat?

450
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,040
I'm starving.

451
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,600
Get me something to eat.

452
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,640
Go ahead.

453
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,120
I made this specially

454
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,680
for Lin Xiong.

455
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,080
Is this what you made for Mengdie?

456
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,720
Yes.

457
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,520
I made half of it.

458
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,680
Why does Mengdie live such a miserable life?

459
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,640
No.

460
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,040
You're so worried about Mengdie.

461
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,680
Do you like Mengdie?

462
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,800
What are you talking about?

463
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,600
How can I like you?

464
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,640
What are you talking about?

465
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,960
I'm Li Song'er.

466
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,640
Mengdie is the Chu Heroine.

467
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,360
She's the Lin Shu who lives with you.

468
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,000
Everyone knows it now.

469
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,320
I don't have to pretend anymore.

470
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,600
You mean

471
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,040
Lin Xiong is Chu Mengdie?

472
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,280
Yes.

473
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,880
You haven't told me

474
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,920
how you got here.

475
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,680
Then...

476
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
Lin Xiong is...

477
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,000
Yes.

478
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,400
She's your wife.

479
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,320
Then she won't be with my master.

480
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,760
Idiot.

481
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,160
What are you talking about?

482
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,160
Is your master that kind of person?

483
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,000
Of course not.

484
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,640
That's good.

485
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,600
So you have to trust your master.

486
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,720
Whatever he does,

487
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,360
there's a reason for it.

488
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,160
All right.

489
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,480
You can go out and watch.

490
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,680
You went out and watched.

491
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
You went back to the valley

492
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,560
to find Lin Xiong

493
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,920
to make a big mistake.

494
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,840
Yes.

495
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,920
Chu Mengdie is in the valley now.

496
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,000
It's not a good time to get married.

497
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,720
When you're done,

498
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,880
we'll think about it.

499
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,840
You've seen what happened today.

500
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,240
Now the country is in a crisis.

501
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,560
It's not easy to stay here.

502
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,480
We have to get the scroll

503
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,720
to get the whole secret.

504
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,240
But this time,

505
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,200
I'm sorry for Zong'er.

506
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,520
Your poison is spreading.

507
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,760
If you add more to the palace,

508
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,960
it will be more dangerous.

509
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,680
People are in the world.

510
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,920
Even if there's a mountain of knives and a sea of fire,

511
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,640
I have to get to the bottom of it.

512
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,280
But, Your Highness...

513
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,880
All right.

514
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,760
I've made up my mind.

515
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,960
WOW

516
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,080
Since I came to theachi boat,

517
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,400
I've reclaimed isolation from the bandits every day.

518
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,900
I've had enough ofï¿½ï¿½

519
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,560
to recieve the good news now.

520
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:48,900
.

521
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,940
It's ì¡ å.

522
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,120
You are awesome.

523
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:57,840
You even know how

524
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,520
to make scrambled eggs.

525
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,080
Do you know if

526
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,680
you will be02z plays

527
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,520
in the next day?

528
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,360
Let's eat.

529
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,640
I can't eat it anymore.

530
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,720
You care about your senior so much.

531
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,000
You can go down and cook for him.

532
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,360
You dare to talk back?

533
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,600
Listen.

534
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,680
I don't touch you

535
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,680
because I'm afraid of

536
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,080
Jingyu Villa.

537
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,480
But I'm not afraid.

538
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,680
Come with me.

539
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,200
Let's teach this witch a lesson today.

540
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,360
Let her go down and cook egg cakes for you.

541
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,960
Where are you going?

542
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,880
Chase her.

543
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,560
I didn't expect

544
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,520
you're my teacher.

545
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,080
We've been in the same bed for so many days.

546
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,200
I didn't expect

547
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,080
you'd be my teacher.

548
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,360
Maybe no one in the world

549
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,360
knows

550
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,720
how passionate Zheng Yunchang and his dagger were

551
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,360
and how bright the roses were.

552
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,400
But today,

553
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,640
I'm going to bury you all.

554
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,360
Today is your anniversary.

555
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,360
Let's bury it like this.

556
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,920
Our memories.

557
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,680
Let's bury it like this.

558
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,680
Our lost youth.

559
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,760
Let's bury it like this.

560
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,360
You loved me.

561
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,800
Let's bury it like this.

562
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,520
We'll never go back.

563
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,080
Brother.

564
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,360
Are you also

565
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,520
burying your secret?

566
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,800
Yes.

567
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,560
Who can hide a secret?

568
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,200
Brother.

569
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,320
They're trying to kill normal people.

570
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,280
Come on.

571
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,280
Don't come near me.

572
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,400
Where do you want to run to?

573
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,280
It seems that I'm sleeping while hibernating.

574
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,960
You can also call it fencing.

575
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,240
Cry out.

576
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,760
Take your life.

577
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,040
Brother Nan,

578
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,480
think it over.

579
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,240
He's not Chu Mengdi.

580
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,240
Why do you still want to help him?

581
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,520
Even if he's not Chu Mengdi,

582
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,600
he was once my woman.

583
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,880
Your woman?

584
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,520
You've...

585
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,400
Brother Nan,

586
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,000
you're like a poisonous snake.

587
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,920
It's fine if you don't want him.

588
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,720
How about this?

589
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,520
Give him to me.

590
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,520
I'll go to Ningxiang House

591
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,120
and find you a hundred of men like him.

592
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,560
Since he was once my woman,

593
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,760
I need to help him one last time.

594
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,200
If you don't leave,

595
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,680
don't blame me for not keeping my love.

596
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,880
I'm leaving.

597
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,800
Go, go, go.

598
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,480
Go, go.

599
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,080
Hurry.

600
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,080
Wait for me.

601
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,560
I knew you'd take care of me.

602
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,600
The words you said to me in the hall last time

603
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,800
were all on purpose.

604
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,840
Just to save me later?

605
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,520
Get lost.

606
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,320
Don't you understand what I said?

607
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,080
From now on,

608
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,920
you have nothing to do with me.

609
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,560
I understand.

610
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,200
I understand.

611
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,720
Oh, my.

612
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,200
How could you do this to me?

613
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,320
What is he looking at?

614
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,440
Then tell me.

615
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,240
This boy

616
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,920
hasn't paid for it.

617
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,480
Why has he stopped giving?

618
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,200
changes the defeat andð

619
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,840
Tuç palm

620
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,880
What's wrong with Xiao seed Market Pumpkin

621
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,880
I don't know where I am.

622
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,880
I don't know when I will be back.

623
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,880
Maybe you are looking at me.

624
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:28,880
I don't dare to make up my mind.

625
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,880
The winter is so beautiful.

626
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,880
The spring is so fragrant.

627
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,880
I want to ask you if you are still in love.

628
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,880
I'd rather dance for you.

629
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,880
I can run for the next life.

630
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,880
I don't want to leave you.

631
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,880
I won't let you down.

632
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,880
I'd rather be a man of my word.

633
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,880
I'll be a man of my word.

634
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,880
I'll be a man of my word.

635
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,880
I'll be a man of my word.

636
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:13,880
I'll be a man of my word.
