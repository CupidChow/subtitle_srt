Wait

Episode 16

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Everyone calls me a devil who kills people.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But I never knew

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I was a child who couldn't even hold a sword.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Dad, this sword is too heavy.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't want to practice.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
No, Li'er.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The most important thing for a martial artist is to hold on to it.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Father gave me martial arts.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But he didn't tell me how people in the martial arts world are.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Your father is going to travel to the Yuan Gate.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He won't be back for a long time.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I heard that he died under the sword of a friend.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Mother took me to hide and fight.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Mother, why don't you let me practice?

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We are far from the martial arts world.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But the martial arts world doesn't dare to let us go.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
In order to take away the family's school of medicine,

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
they killed my mother.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That was the first time I smelled blood.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That was the last smell of my family.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now I only feel happy when I hold the sword.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Because this is my only family.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's the Master of the Great Buddha. Run!

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Master!

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Master!

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Where are you going?

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm not going anywhere.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So I'm the thief of the Great Demon.

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
First, he let me go on purpose.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Then he took me to make a fishing rod.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He looks young.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But he is so cunning.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He will be bald in the future.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
My hair.

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Thank you for your concern.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You're welcome.

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Well,

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Your Highness,

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
are you here to thank me for catching Nan Chun Meng?

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
How can you come here in person?

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I have something to do.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'll go first.

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You want to do the same move again?

67
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's useless.

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But people are useful.

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Look,

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
if I didn't do it,

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
how could you catch Nan Chun Meng?

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But you've used up all your power.

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You useless person.

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Kill you.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Again.

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I told you.

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's really dirty.

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Who are you?

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Why do you know Nan Chun Meng is in Ningxiang?

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
If you're not Chu Meng Die,

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
why do you have his three-color bracelet?

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
If I tell this devil,

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I read it from the script.

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He will think I'm fooling him.

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I don't know what to do.

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I...

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I am...

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Little bitch.

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What are you looking at? Tell me.

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I really don't know Chu Meng Die.

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I've said it for eight hundred times.

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm the most beautiful little princess, Li Song.

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
My father gave me this bracelet.

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's Nan Chun Meng.

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Your Highness.

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Some men

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
just like to go to some feng yue places.

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Your Highness.

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm telling the truth.

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm not lying.

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Little liar.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Liar.

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Shut up.

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Little sister.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So you two know each other?

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No.

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Then why did you call me little sister?

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
All the beautiful women in the world are my little sister.

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I know my appearance is the best in the world.

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Indeed.

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I walk on the street.

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I also have many...

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No.

114
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Nan Chun Meng.

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Tell the devil.

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We have nothing to do with each other.

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Little sister.

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
How do you know my name is Nan Chun Meng?

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But five days later.

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm going to marry Chu Meng Die, the daughter of the head of Jing Yun Villa.

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Devil.

122
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Did you hear that?

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
He's going to marry Chu Meng Die.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm not Chu Meng Die.

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
After you said that.

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't think I've ever seen a girl from the Chu family.

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Are you...

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Right?

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Buried. Buried.

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let me die.

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Continue to interrogate Nan Chun Meng.

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Take her away.

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Put her in the dungeon.

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Keep an eye on her.

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Help.

136
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Help.

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I want to go home.

138
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I want to go home.

139
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I suddenly want to get drunk in Meng City.

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I don't know.

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
My favorite book.

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The queen ran away again.

143
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Where is the pen?

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Lv Xiang.

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Are you reading this book too?

146
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It doesn't matter.

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I also love reading love novels.

148
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I think this is the most relaxing time.

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But back to the point.

150
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I also know the author of this book.

151
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
When I go back.

152
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll invite her to my mansion.

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Tell me what the next plot is.

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You can come too.

155
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Really?

156
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay.

157
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Really?

158
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm not going.

159
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You be honest with me.

160
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The queen ran away again.

161
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I think.

162
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's related to the maid who came after that.

163
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Which maid?

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The one that the prince picked up on the road?

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yes.

166
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's her.

167
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Then do you know.

168
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Why did the queen run away again?

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Of course.

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Because the prince's men are too stupid.

171
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I can't keep an eye on him.

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The princess.

173
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:38,940
The

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
princess.

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The dreamy man's bag.

176
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
All of them are here.

177
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
He was sent to the Western Regions.

178
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He was in his prime.

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
For twenty years.

180
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But he's a man of character.

181
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
He has eight hands on his left.

182
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He likes to drink tea.

183
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Now the leader of Feng Yu Valley, Bai Wu Xie.

184
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He's unique.

185
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And Nan Chui Meng hasn't returned yet.

186
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
He must be suspicious.

187
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I've prepared the clothes for Nan Chui Meng.

188
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'll show you.

189
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Have a rest and practice martial arts.

190
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We'll be there soon.

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Send a letter to Feng Yu Valley immediately.

192
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Tell them that the Japanese attack is a big battle.

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Nan Chui Meng is in big trouble.

194
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
In a few days,

195
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
he'll arrive at Feng Yu Valley.

196
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What about Li Song?

197
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Chu Meng Die is in a bad shape now.

198
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Leave Li Song

199
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
to him.

200
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It'll be useful.

201
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Princess.

202
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Nothing.

203
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Princess.

204
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The cold poison in your body

205
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
has been activated again.

206
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
If it wasn't for Li Song

207
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
who touched me to heal your bones,

208
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
you must...

209
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It doesn't matter.

210
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The poison

211
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
has been with me for so many years.

212
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm used to it.

213
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Tomorrow morning,

214
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
we'll leave Feng Yu Valley immediately.

215
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yes.

216
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Han Yan.

217
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Move.

218
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Where are you going?

219
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The princess sent me out to do something.

220
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Move.

221
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You're blocking my way

222
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
and delaying my time.

223
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Can you afford it?

224
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
No.

225
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Han Yan.

226
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What?

227
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
How dare you ask about the princess?

228
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Han Yan.

229
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
How dare you ask about the princess?

230
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But...

231
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But...

232
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But...

233
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But what?

234
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Shut up.

235
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But...

236
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But...

237
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
This is a forbidden area.

238
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's full of gas.

239
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Why is there so much smoke here?

240
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's dangerous.

241
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Help.

242
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Help.

243
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Help.

244
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Help.

245
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Help.

246
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Help.

247
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Help.

248
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Help.

249
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Your Highness.

250
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The poison in the body is spreading faster.

251
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It may be triggered once every three months.

252
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'll seal your bones,

253
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
triceps, and intercostal blood

254
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
to ease your pain.

255
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Your Highness.

256
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Please forgive me.

257
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Li Song'er...

258
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
He ran away.

259
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Li Song'er.

260
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Li Song'er.

261
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Li Song'er.

262
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Mother.

263
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Mother.

264
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You don't even know

265
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
how much I've eaten here.

266
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Looks like this idiot has absorbed the poison of the organ.

267
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
If we don't take him away,

268
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'll be in trouble.

269
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So,

270
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I know you're hungry.

271
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I brought you your favorite

272
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
gongfuli bun.

273
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Look.

274
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What?

275
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Gongfuli bun.

276
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Why does it smell like strawberries?

277
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's going to change color.

278
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Hello.

279
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Hello.

280
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Hello.

281
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Hello.

282
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Hello.

283
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Hello.

284
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Hello.

285
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Hello.

286
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I was just angry.

287
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Otherwise, I wouldn't have done that.

288
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And...

289
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's obvious that...

290
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You're taking advantage of me.

291
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
If I'm being magnanimous,

292
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I can ignore you.

293
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But the premise is

294
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
you have to let me leave.

295
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm talking to you.

296
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
We did have many grudges before.

297
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But this time,

298
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
we can make up for it.

299
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The Demon King is sleeping.

300
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I should take the opportunity to sneak out.

301
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm really beautiful.

302
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But I don't think I'll fall in love with you

303
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
after biting him.

304
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Don't go.

305
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm sorry.

312
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm sorry.

314
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's hot.

315
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Are you sick?

316
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Who's the one who's been forgiven by Heaven?

317
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I didn't expect you to be a demon today.

318
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I just want to leave you here alone.

319
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Your enemy has found you.

320
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Kill him.

321
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What should I do?

322
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
There are many people here.

323
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
If you don't know the way,

324
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
you can't leave.

325
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
As long as you find me some herbs,

326
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'll let you go.

327
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Water.

328
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Water?

329
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm thirsty.

330
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I won't save you.

331
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm crazy.

332
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I even helped the demon pick herbs.

333
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'd better run.

334
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Oh, no.

335
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm so stupid.

336
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'll wait for the beauty to come out

337
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
after saving her life.

338
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I knew it.

339
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Even the herbs are so...

340
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Blood.

341
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's blood.

342
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I must be dead.

343
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm dead.

344
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm dead.

345
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm dead.

346
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm dead.

347
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm dead.

348
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm dead.

349
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm dead.

350
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm dead.

351
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm dead.

352
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm dead.

353
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm dead.

354
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm dead.

355
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm dead.

356
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm dead.

357
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm dead.

358
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm dead.

359
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm dead.

360
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm dead.

361
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm dead.

362
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm dead.

363
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm dead.

364
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm dead.

365
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm dead.

366
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm dead.

367
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm dead.

368
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm dead.

369
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm dead.

370
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm dead.

371
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm dead.

372
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm dead.

373
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm dead.

374
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm dead.

375
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm dead.

376
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm dead.

377
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm dead.

378
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm dead.

379
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm dead.

380
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm dead.

381
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I want to see elixir,

382
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
and it's gone police.

383
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,100
Listen,

384
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
do you want to see elixir?

385
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yes.

386
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What? Are you scared?

387
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Mom, why are you so stupid?

388
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You haven't found me yet.

389
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Mom!

390
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Mom!

391
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Mom!

392
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Mom!

393
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Mom!

394
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Mom!

395
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Mom, don't leave me!

396
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Mom!

397
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Mom!

398
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Mom!

399
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Mom, don't leave me!

400
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm very obedient!

401
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I don't want to go to the capital anymore!

402
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Give my mom back!

403
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
From today on,

404
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
there will be no more Sun Moon Palace!

405
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Mom!

406
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Mom!

407
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Mom?

408
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Did you have a fever and burn your head?

409
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Look carefully. Am I your mom?

410
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,720
No, no.

411
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Why aren't you speaking?

412
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,040
Are you

413
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,080
moved by my beautiful judgement and cryingestly?

414
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,080
It's unlike you!

415
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,080
The devil's eyes

416
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,160
The tears of a monkey

417
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,800
look like they're going to kill a peach blossom.

418
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,360
What?

419
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,960
You're so beautiful.

420
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
In the Dream City,

421
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,920
you're still single?

422
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,160
Nonsense.

423
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,080
I have so many.

424
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,800
I can't pick them out.

425
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,480
Really?

426
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,240
I thought they were all poisoned by your fish.

427
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,640
Is...

428
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,400
The fish I baked...

429
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,480
So delicious.

430
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,920
Have a bite.

431
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,320
What?

432
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,160
You think I poisoned it, don't you?

433
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,480
Take this.

434
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,480
I understand you're a patient.

435
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,480
So I want to roast a fish to give you some nutrition.

436
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,480
You didn't even have a bite.

437
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,480
You're a lowly woman who is trying to get a beauty's love.

438
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
Okay.

439
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,480
If you're honest,

440
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,480
it's okay to have a bite first.

441
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,480
I shouldn't be so nice to you.

442
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,480
Roast it yourself.

443
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,480
This whole piece is mine.

444
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,480
It hurts.

445
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,480
You even want to fight a fish with me?

446
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,480
I've never been unlucky since I came here.

447
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,480
It's so bad to eat a fish with a bone.

448
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
You can go now.

449
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,480
Turn right after you leave the cave.

450
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,480
You'll see a small path.

451
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,480
I'll go.

452
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,480
Are you serious?

453
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
I'll keep my word.

454
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,480
You help me find the herb.

455
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,480
I'll let you go.

456
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,480
You're kind.

457
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,480
If you have no other choice,

458
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,480
you can go to the Wind and Rain Valley to find me.

459
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
By then,

460
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,480
don't call me devil again.

461
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
What should I call you?

462
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,480
I don't care.

463
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,480
I'm leaving then.

464
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,480
See you in the Abyss.

465
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,480
I'm so ugly.

466
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,480
How did you walk?

467
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,480
What a place!

468
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,480
Although I've got rid of the devil,

469
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
how can I find my way home?

470
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,480
I'm so tired.

471
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,480
The devil is so generous to me.

472
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
Miss.

473
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,480
Don't touch me.

474
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,480
No.

475
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,480
I think the heroine is in a mess.

476
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,480
She wants you to go to our bathhouse to soak the grass.

477
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,480
Where is my princess?

478
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,480
It's all because of the devil.

479
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,480
He's been buying my princess' hair every day.

480
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,480
I've been buying her hair since then.

481
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,480
Go to the bathhouse to wash her hair.

482
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
Wait.

483
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:11,980
Art Hanging

484
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,480
Why are you fishing in bath house?

485
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,080
The water is hot.

486
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,720
Where did the fish come from?

487
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,680
There are fish in your heart.

488
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,240
You can catch them wherever they are.

489
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,320
You have no fish in your heart.

490
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,000
Of course you can't see them.

491
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,200
Don't look for them.

492
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,080
Don't look for them.

493
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,760
Your fish is not here.

494
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,640
It will appear at the right time.

495
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,240
You must be hungry after a long time of hard work.

496
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,400
May I ask what kind of fish you want to eat?

497
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,520
Sweet and sour.

498
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,840
It must be sweet and sour.

499
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,720
Childe, I see you are not happy.

500
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,080
This is the sign of a great disaster and a great joy.

501
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,840
I'm not a childe.

502
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,040
I'm a girl.

503
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,560
Princess.

504
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,960
You are so beautiful.

505
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,560
This is the sign of a great joy.

506
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,280
You must be blessed with happiness.

507
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,480
No.

508
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,360
You are the old man who drew me that day.

509
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,920
That's why I'm here.

510
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,600
Tell me.

511
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,760
How can I go back to the original world?

512
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,520
You are a boy.

513
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,200
But you want to be a girl.

514
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,040
I'm not.

515
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,880
You still don't say damn.

516
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,800
You must care about my happiness.

517
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,760
What is happiness?

518
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,080
What's wrong?

519
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,400
Why does my voice become like this?

520
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,780
Did you suffer some teachers' punishment today?

521
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,320
Just get rid of it.

522
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,080
everything will be back to normal.

523
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,520
You will

524
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,000
be blessed

525
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,400
and return to the Holy Land.

526
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,360
Is this a dream?

527
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,320
My face, my voice.

528
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
How did it become like this?

529
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
The illusion of the five senses.

530
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,320
It must be that hand.

531
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,320
Gu Yuan, you're a bad guy.

532
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,320
When I wake up in the morning,

533
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,320
I will find the person who wrote the script

534
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,320
and write you into the worst and worst ending.

535
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,320
I will make you be killed by birds.

536
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,320
No.

537
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,320
I will make you a woman

538
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,320
and then be killed by birds.

539
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,320
What did that old man say just now?

540
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,320
Wash the medicine and use it to wash the worms.

541
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,320
Could it be that I will make the devil

542
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,320
a sweet and sour fish?

543
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
As long as it is removed,

544
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,320
everything will be back to normal.

545
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,320
You will be blessed

546
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,320
and return to the Holy Land.

547
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,320
Isn't this the devil Gu Yuan?

548
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,320
Gu Yuan,

549
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,320
you better hope that

550
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
what this weird old man said is false.

551
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,320
Otherwise, I will kill you.

552
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
You don't need to write the script to help me.

553
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,320
Just cut your own hand.

554
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
When I wander to such a place,

555
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,320
I only have beauty and wisdom left.

556
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,320
Even if I have to see you again,

557
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,320
I have to take good care of myself.

558
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
If you have no way out,

559
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
you can go to the Wind and Rain Valley to find me.

560
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,320
No wonder he said that.

561
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,320
It turns out that he had a plan.

562
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,320
Now, I can only go to the Sun and Moon Palace to make a living.

563
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,320
Why don't I go to the Wind and Rain Valley to wait for him?

564
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,320
I will wait for him.

565
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,320
Sir,

566
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,320
how do I get to the Wind and Rain Valley?

567
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,320
Thats why, there must be no tablet for him.

568
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,320
Is this brush used to peel off holes in paper?

569
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,320
Why don't you call the TC fired from the exists Hijali?

570
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,320
I'll see if it works.

571
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,520
Beggar Han of the Others

572
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,240
Your Highness, Xiangyang?

573
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,600
Xiangluoyang?

574
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,240
Nanchui Meng said

575
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,800
she would marry Chu Mengdie at the mouth of the valley

576
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,520
and then dance with her.

577
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,080
Feng Yu Valley had to obey the promise

578
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,680
and let her learn the art of dancing in the valley.

579
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,560
When we received Chu Mengdie,

580
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,800
it would be easy to get the secret scroll back.

581
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,800
You are really good at planning.

582
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,000
You are not just a soldier

583
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,880
but also a master.

584
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,400
This plan...

585
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,400
Liu Yunying.

586
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,600
Yes, Your Highness.

587
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,360
A man is like a jade,

588
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,760
a man is like a frost.

589
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,400
In the future, please call me

590
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,480
Childe Nan.

591
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,680
Come.

592
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,680
I'll stay with you in the future,

593
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,720
never looking back,

594
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,120
I'll stay here for the rest of my life.

595
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,520
I look back, but I still need to go back.

596
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,920
Perhaps I'm lost and I don't know where I am.

597
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:18,520
The deep love I feel for you makes me afraid to take a step back.

598
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,920
The winter flowers are in full bloom,

599
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,120
the spring comes, and I miss you.

600
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:31,120
I want to tell you all my feelings.

601
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,920
Why don't we start over again?

602
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,720
I'll count down for you and run for the next life.

603
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Why don't we never meet again?

604
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,320
I'll never give up on my dream.

605
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,320
Why don't we meet again?

606
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,920
We'll be together forever.

607
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:58,720
We'll meet again when we meet again.

608
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:05,120
We'll meet again when we meet again.
