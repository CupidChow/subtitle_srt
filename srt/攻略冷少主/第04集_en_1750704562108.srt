1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,640
For the four-tailed geese that kiss on the north pond

2
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,480
Don't even dare to test my courage

3
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,220
It's all my fault

4
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,420
You know that maybe love

5
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,520
I will pack it up

6
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,260
It's my fault

7
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,600
You must never forgive me

8
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,380
The vicarious folk monkeys will not forgive me

9
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,020
The house, house, and the dependence will not cool down

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The King Of Blaze

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 16

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,240
None of you can fight.

13
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,000
Anyone else wants to challenge?

14
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,000
Boss.

15
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,800
Did you see that man?

16
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,000
That move was so smooth.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,400
It was so quick.

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,800
Of course.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's not as good as yours.

20
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,000
He's a talent.

21
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,600
I think a talent like him

22
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
is like a tiger

23
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,200
in your eyes.

24
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,000
You're right.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The Day of Sky is coming.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,400
I have no one to fight with.

27
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,200
I didn't expect

28
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,000
a martial arts master to come out.

29
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,200
God bless me.

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,600
God bless me too.

31
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,000
Go.

32
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,600
Go.

33
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,200
Go.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,600
You're so rude. Who are you?

35
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,200
I'm Star of Baili.

36
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,800
I won the award for

37
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
the best martial arts

38
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,600
in Baili River.

39
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,400
And...

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,200
What did you do?

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,000
I left Daguang Mountain

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and came to Wind and Rain Valley

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,200
to make Bigu proud.

44
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,000
Now,

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,600
please accept me

46
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,800
as your father.

47
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,000
Come.

48
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
You...

49
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
You said you were

50
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,800
working?

51
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,400
Yes.

52
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,200
Chaiwang.

53
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,800
Someone is here to see you.

54
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,600
Thank you.

55
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,400
Greetings, Uncle.

56
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,000
Greetings, Father-in-law.

57
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,600
In a word,

58
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,600
we have not seen each other

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,200
for more than 20 years.

60
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,200
I have no children.

61
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,800
You're the only man

62
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,600
in our Nan clan.

63
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,400
I can only let you

64
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,400
marry me and Brother Chu.

65
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,000
Uncle.

66
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,200
I'm willing to marry you.

67
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,800
Good.

68
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,000
Now you're back safely

69
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,000
and you're still practicing martial arts.

70
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
I've

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,600
made an explanation

72
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,000
to your father.

73
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,800
I've been away from the official recently.

74
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,000
Do you have any juniors in the valley?

75
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,600
Everything is going well in the valley.

76
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,400
I've sent someone

77
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,600
to arrange the ceremony for Tiankuang Festival.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,200
Everything is ready.

79
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,600
Go get the sword.

80
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,400
You'll be the one

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,800
to attend the ceremony tomorrow.

82
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,600
Yes, Father-in-law.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,600
You...

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You

85
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,200
should practice martial arts

86
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,400
when I'm not around.

87
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,000
Don't worry about

88
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,200
the valley affairs.

89
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,600
Uncle.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm willing to marry you.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,400
I'll take the sword to test my skills.

92
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,600
Don't be too arrogant.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,400
They'll be suspicious.

94
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Uncle.

95
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,400
It seems that you still need to improve your martial arts.

96
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,600
Brother, please have a look.

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,800
Your Highness.

98
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,600
The new method of the Apothecary House is here.

99
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,200
You'll suffer

100
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,600
the pain of cutting bones.

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,800
It won't be a few days.

102
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
But the longer you live,

103
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,400
the longer it will hurt.

104
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,000
And when you're sick,

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
you'll be unable to sleep.

106
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,600
You'll be unable to sleep all night.

107
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
For the sake of the new method,

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,600
for the sake of the Apothecary House,

109
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,600
is it worth it?

110
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Let's begin.

111
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,600
Heng.

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,200
Don't embarrass me

113
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,000
in the festival.

114
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,800
Yes, Master.

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,800
Shi Zhi.

116
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,200
You'll be responsible for

117
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,600
the mission of escorting the new method to the firewood factory.

118
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
Don't miss it.

119
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,600
Yes.

120
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,600
Leave.

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,800
Leave.

122
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,600
Senior brother.

123
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,000
This is the young hero I mentioned to you.

124
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,200
Young hero.

125
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,400
This is the senior brother

126
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,800
with the best martial arts in our valley,

127
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,600
Zhou Heng.

128
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,400
I've heard that you're good at martial arts.

129
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,800
I'm really impressed by your skills.

130
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,800
This is my name card.

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,600
I hope I can get some advice from you.

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,200
I'm just kidding.

133
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,000
The first time I saw you,

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,800
I thought you were different.

135
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,800
You were a young hero.

136
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,000
You're so young,

137
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,400
yet you have such skills.

138
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,600
I, Zhou Mouren,

139
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,200
admire you.

140
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,400
This sword

141
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,000
is from the ancient master of the Wind and Rain Valley,

142
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Nan Wentian.

143
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,600
He's my father-in-law.

144
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,200
He gave me this sword.

145
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,800
If you can use it for me,

146
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,600
you'll be a great friend.

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,800
I won't let you down.

148
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Young brother.

149
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,800
Your name is Lin...

150
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,000
Lin...

151
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
I'm Lin Shu.

152
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,200
Yes.

153
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
I know this character.

154
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,200
Isn't it written separately?

155
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
To be honest,

156
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
I really want you to join the valley.

157
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
There are so many disciples of the Wind and Rain Valley.

158
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,400
I'm afraid I'll be buried by talents like you.

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,200
But I have a way

160
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,000
to make you

161
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,200
rise in the valley quickly.

162
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,400
What's the way?

163
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,200
The Day of Sky is coming.

164
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,000
Chu Mengdie from Jingyun Villa

165
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,600
will also come to worship.

166
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,200
If you can

167
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,400
fight against the disciples,

168
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,400
and beat him a little bit,

169
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,400
why don't you...

170
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Young brother.

171
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,600
Don't talk nonsense.

172
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,600
I'll do it.

173
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,600
I'll do it.

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,200
But

175
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,200
the Chu Heroine has been famous in the martial arts world for a long time.

176
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,000
I'll fight against her.

177
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I'm afraid I can't

178
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,400
be sure of her

179
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,800
against me.

180
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,000
Don't worry.

181
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Just do your best.

182
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Yes.

183
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,600
The new tea just brewed.

184
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,200
Please make yourself at home.

185
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,800
It's really the assassin sent by the Wind and Rain Valley.

186
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,400
But who is the one who disguised as me now?

187
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,000
It seems that I have to watch this play to the end.

188
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Young Master.

189
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,000
I was going to make you a pot of jia fish soup.

190
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,800
Focus.

191
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,600
But the back is on fire.

192
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Junior brothers.

193
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
You'll be responsible for escorting the Demon Lord.

194
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,200
You must be extra careful.

195
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
If you make any mistake

196
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,400
and uncle blames you,

197
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
it will be bad.

198
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,400
Brother Nan, you're good at martial arts.

199
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,800
Only you can bear the consequences.

200
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,600
Leave the fire to us.

201
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,000
Thank you, junior brothers.

202
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'll go now.

203
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Senior Brother Nan,

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,400
you're really good at martial arts.

205
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,000
You're really good at martial arts.

206
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,400
I have two junior brothers.

207
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,200
It's too late. Let's go.

208
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,800
Princess.

209
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
You made it.

210
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,600
I've packed my luggage

211
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
and prepared a carriage.

212
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It can take at most half an hour

213
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,600
from Hanyan.

214
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,400
Let's leave as soon as possible.

215
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Where's Li Song?

216
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,200
Are we taking him with us?

217
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,200
I saw that

218
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,600
Zhou Heng took him to the martial arts field.

219
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
How long has it been?

220
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
A while.

221
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,000
It seems that he hasn't died yet.

222
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
Let's go and have a look.

223
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,800
Today is the Tian Kuang Festival of the Wind and Rain Valley.

224
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,200
I think you all know

225
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,800
how to get

226
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
a peaceful and stable life.

227
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,800
Now that the spirit has passed away,

228
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,800
I can only use the Demon-repeating Token to remind you

229
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,000
not to forget

230
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,000
the heroes who died because of the demon.

231
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,400
The dead have passed away.

232
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
I hope you

233
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,600
don't be too sad.

234
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,000
Today,

235
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,000
the Chu Heroine is also here to watch the ceremony.

236
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,600
The younger brother hasn't sent the Demon-repeating Token yet.

237
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,000
Why don't we

238
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,400
first see the Chu Heroine's beauty?

239
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,200
How about it?

240
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,800
Good.

241
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,400
I've long wanted to see the Chu Heroine.

242
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,200
Yes.

243
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,800
That's right.

244
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,600
Yes.

245
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,800
There is a risk of being a substitute.

246
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,800
I must be careful in the ceremony.

247
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,200
This Gu Yuan has killed me.

248
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
This is a very poisonous heart.

249
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,000
If I show my feet,

250
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,600
I'll be dead.

251
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,800
Since everyone is so enthusiastic,

252
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,200
then...

253
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,600
Then I

254
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,000
can only

255
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
play freely.

256
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,200
I'll show my face.

257
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,400
How come I haven't seen this before?

258
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
How come I haven't seen this before?

259
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,400
Do you know what kind of martial arts this is?

260
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,200
What is this?

261
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
It's a sword.

262
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,600
I don't know what it is.

263
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
But it looks amazing.

264
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
Yes.

265
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
It looks amazing.

266
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
Everyone, come together.

267
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,800
Which family's boxing skills

268
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,600
can capture people's hearts

269
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,600
and make everyone move with it without any hesitation?

270
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,800
Chu Lu Nian

271
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,000
is really incredible.

272
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,200
What are you doing?

273
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Are you clapping?

274
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,600
I didn't expect that

275
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,400
I was assigned to

276
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,200
such an important task.

277
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
They must have found out that I'm a martial arts genius.

278
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,800
So they arranged me to be a sweeper.

279
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,600
They told me to guard the back of the Wind and Rain Valley.

280
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Chu Lu Nian

281
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,400
Chu Nian is really incredible.

282
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
This martial arts move

283
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
is beyond my comprehension.

284
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,200
Amazing.

285
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,000
Amazing.

286
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,200
Amazing.

287
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Everyone, stop it.

288
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,800
Since I'm done with my dance,

289
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
I'll...

290
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm Lin Shu.

291
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,400
I heard that Chu Nu Xia is good at martial arts.

292
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
So I'm here to ask for your advice.

293
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,200
I won't take the risk.

294
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
I won't compete with you.

295
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
I won't compete with you.

296
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,600
Just compete.

297
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,200
Everyone, do you want to see

298
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,400
Chu Nu Xia compete with this little brother?

299
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,600
Let's have a match.

300
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Yes.

301
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
In that case,

302
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,200
I'll show my hatred.

303
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,000
Wait.

304
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,800
I'm good at martial arts.

305
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,600
Aren't you afraid that I'll hurt you?

306
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,200
Chu Nu Xia, don't be polite.

307
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,800
Just show your hatred.

308
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,600
I can't see the blood.

309
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,000
This useless person disguised as me

310
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,800
is really embarrassing.

311
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,400
Where is that devil?

312
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,000
He said he would protect me.

313
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Come and save me now.

314
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,200
What's wrong with him?

315
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,600
Xiao Yao Jue escorted you late.

316
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Don't blame me for being late.

317
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Let's go.

318
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,200
He has such strong internal force.

319
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Senior Brother.

320
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Senior Brother.

321
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,600
Come and save me.

322
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Save me.

323
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Senior Brother.

324
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Heng,

325
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,600
why are you dressed like this?

326
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,600
Get up.

327
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Did you touch Xiao Yao Jue?

328
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm so embarrassed.

329
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,200
I'm so embarrassed.

330
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm so embarrassed.

331
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You want to learn the martial arts of Xiao Yao Jue?

332
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,600
Get on the position of Lord.

333
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,400
I'm so embarrassed.

334
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm so embarrassed.

335
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You've been based on the position of Lord for a long time.

336
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,400
It's really not.

337
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,600
Heng,

338
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,200
you're so stupid.

339
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,200
You're the only one who the Lord trusts the most.

340
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,200
The Lord's position will always be yours.

341
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,800
Why are you looking for it?

342
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,800
I'll tell you the truth.

343
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,400
That Xiao Yao Jue

344
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,000
is fake.

345
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,000
I made a trick on it.

346
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,200
I wanted to test Nan Chuimeng.

347
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,800
Who knows you?

348
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,400
The real Xiao Yao Jue

349
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,600
is not what we can see.

350
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,800
What we want to do

351
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,600
is to open the door of the secret base

352
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,600
after they get married.

353
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,200
Master.

354
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,800
That Xiao Yao Jue

355
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,400
is fake.

356
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,000
Fake?

357
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,400
I remember when I was a child,

358
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,000
I poured the tea on the Xiao Yao Jue.

359
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
And the wooden box of Xiao Yao Jue

360
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,600
had no words.

361
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
On the cover,

362
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,800
it was sprinkled with poison powder.

363
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,800
I was wondering

364
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
how Zhou Heng fainted in the smoke

365
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,000
after he touched the Xiao Yao Jue.

366
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It seems that the secret body of Xiao Yao Jue

367
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,000
was hidden in the Feng Yu Valley.

368
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So,

369
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,800
you're going to use Li Song?

370
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,000
Who is this idiot?

371
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,000
He's so good at it.

372
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,200
He even disguised himself as a fireman.

373
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,600
The assassin before

374
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,000
didn't look like he sent him.

375
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,200
I'll observe him for a few days

376
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,800
and see what he's going to do.

377
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,000
This place is too dangerous.

378
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,600
I'd better go back to the cabin.

379
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Wait.

380
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Come in.

381
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,200
I brought you something.

382
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,000
I brought you something.

383
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,400
You're a little kind.

384
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,600
You know I can't sleep.

385
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,000
So you sent me a incense stove.

386
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,400
Sister Chu.

387
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,400
Childe Nan.

388
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,200
I didn't expect you to be so elegant.

389
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,000
Yes, Sister Chu.

390
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,200
If I could read your mind,

391
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,800
I would be very happy.

392
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,000
Sister Chu.

393
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
What you said is disgusting.

394
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm getting goosebumps.

395
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,800
It's so ugly.

396
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,600
It's not pure gold.

397
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,600
I'll take it for free.

398
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
You're so kind.

399
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,800
Since you have the incense stove,

400
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,400
you should rest in peace.

401
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,000
Don't cause unnecessary trouble.

402
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
Demon,

403
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,400
I met so many dangers today.

404
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I want to leave this place.

405
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,000
When can you prepare for the wedding?

406
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
Don't worry.

407
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,400
I won't keep you waiting.

408
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,600
Demon.

409
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,400
Give me a deadline.

410
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,600
Let go.

411
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,600
The wind blows like a river.

412
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,600
The night and the clouds are in my dream.

413
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,400
The light in front of me

414
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,200
shines brighter than the sky.

415
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,000
The wind blows like a mist.

416
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,800
It's so lonely.

417
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,600
I'm with you.

418
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,000
You want to escape?

419
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,200
You saw what happened today.

420
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,400
I'm here to stay.

421
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,600
I don't know if I can survive

422
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,600
or not.

423
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,400
You won't leave?

424
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Everyone knows you're Chu Mengdie.

425
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,200
Do you think you can escape?

426
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,800
But you don't know martial arts.

427
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,600
It's easy to expose your identity.

428
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
From tomorrow,

429
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'll teach you.

430
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
Let's go.

431
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Demon.

432
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,600
How's he doing?

433
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
I did a good job.

434
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Today,

435
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,800
he saved my life.

436
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Li Song, don't laugh!

437
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,960
He did this

438
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,920
because he was afraid of revealing his identity.

439
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,400
He has nothing to do with you.

440
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,760
There is a demon Gu Yuan in the Sun Moon Palace.

441
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,560
He was born in Chiyuan for three years.

442
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,880
He was born in the seventh month.

443
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,600
Three days later,

444
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,560
it's his birthday.

445
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,400
Sun Moon Palace

446
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,120
Let me do that.

447
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,520
Lord Brother

448
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,520
You are so extra九

449
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,280
You used herbsBill?

450
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,840
Sure

451
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,760
You are welcome

452
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,560
You drink it?

453
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,600
So nosy

454
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,760
I ate it for a whole day

455
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,320
I see

456
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,040
Now the dream of southrer manchmal

457
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,280
Keeps me safe

458
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,120
I'm sorry.

459
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,000
But I'm a man of honor.

460
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,160
How can I drink your...

461
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
...soy sauce?

462
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,880
What soy sauce?

463
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,320
I made it to boost my internal energy.

464
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,520
For it,

465
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,480
I often plead for you in front of my father.

466
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,600
Then I'll drink it now.

467
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,520
And I can't drink it at all.

468
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,840
Slow down.

469
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,400
Don't worry, Madam.

470
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,800
I've improved my internal energy.

471
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,560
I think,

472
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,920
except for Father-in-law,

473
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,560
I have no enemies in the whole Feng Yu Valley.

474
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,800
What about Nan Chuimeng?

475
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,760
He's not a threat.

476
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,600
That's good.

477
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,440
I'll write a war letter to him in your name.

478
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,880
Mr. Nan, this is your war letter.

479
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,000
Mine?

480
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,400
Thank you.

481
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,440
You're welcome.

482
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,920
Mr. Bai,

483
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,760
Brother Zhou wants to have a match with me.

484
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,920
This bastard,

485
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,960
he doesn't know how to dance.

486
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,200
What kind of war letter is this?

487
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,840
Mr. Nan,

488
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,640
you must be kind to him.

489
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,080
Mr. Bai,

490
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,680
I'm willing to do so.

491
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,200
But...

492
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,160
I'm just feeling weak recently.

493
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,040
You're feeling weak?

494
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,200
Is there really something

495
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,360
that's hard to say?

496
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,200
Brother Nan,

497
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,080
you're still young.

498
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,280
If you have any problems,

499
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,600
we must tell you.

500
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,640
If you're sick,

501
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,600
we must treat you.

502
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,880
Treat me?

503
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,120
How come?

504
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,080
Look at you.

505
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,840
You young people are so secretive.

506
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,360
I can't even

507
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,600
understand you.

508
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,200
But,

509
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,640
I must say this.

510
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,160
Since you're in love,

511
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,200
the wedding should be held on a day.

512
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,640
When the wedding day comes,

513
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,600
I'll drink with you.

514
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Okay.

515
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,040
If you need any help,

516
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,280
just tell me.

517
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,600
Thank you, Uncle.

518
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,440
Here, have some tea.

519
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:36,960
Here.

520
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,840
Have some tea.

521
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,880
Chu Nv Xiang.

522
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,240
Chu Mengdie.

523
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
Lin Shu.

524
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,840
What do you want?

525
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,320
I admire you

526
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,440
for your style that day.

527
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,960
I was practicing martial arts.

528
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,680
What's so hard about that?

529
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,720
Lin,

530
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,320
you're so good at martial arts.

531
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,000
Don't always focus on martial arts.

532
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,280
Remember to enjoy yourself.

533
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,120
Life is short.

534
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,040
Good advice.

535
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,520
But I heard from the rumors that

536
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,160
Chu Nv Xiang doesn't like to dress up.

537
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,680
Today,

538
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,840
it's not as good as the rumors.

539
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,320
Rumors?

540
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,840
Of course, it's not reliable.

541
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,240
But I can tell you.

542
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,120
I'm really practicing a new martial art.

543
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,000
I'm pretending to be a chess player.

544
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,240
Especially, I'm good at fighting against the opposite sex.

545
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,080
It's quite interesting.

546
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,920
I'm just a little bit inexperienced.

547
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,000
What's there to be experienced?

548
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,800
I...

549
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,480
I'm a...

550
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,840
I'm not as good as my opponent.

551
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,240
Do you have any questions?

552
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,760
I have something else to do.

553
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,680
I'll leave now.

554
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,640
Nan Chu Meng gave me this.

555
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,560
But I don't know why she didn't tell me the reason.

556
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,680
I don't know why.

557
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,800
Zhou Hun has lost the war again.

558
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,040
She asked you to play on the stage the day after tomorrow.

559
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,960
Leave her alone.

560
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,560
What is Li Song'er doing?

561
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,680
She said she went to Tian Shui City

562
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,840
to buy wedding supplies.

563
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,120
Your Highness.

564
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,280
Why does Li Song'er

565
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,800
care about marriage so much?

566
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,640
Is it a trap?

567
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,040
I know.

568
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,800
She must have fallen in love with you.

569
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,040
That day, you protected her on the stage.

570
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,640
You saved her life and she fell in love with you.

571
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,960
It's all written in the script.

572
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,640
The most important thing now is to get the Little Demon Lord back.

573
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,040
Since the script on the Sky Miner is fake,

574
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,360
we have to push our Chu Nu Xia

575
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,440
to practice the real one.

576
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,160
I've done it.

577
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,480
What?

578
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,080
Now the devil has put down his guard against me.

579
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,400
As long as I have a chance,

580
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,920
I'll let him take the poison

581
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,720
containing Lan Xin Grass.

582
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,240
Even if I have to go through all the trouble,

583
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,680
it's hard to save the immortal.

584
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
Devil.

585
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,880
Tomorrow is your birthday.

586
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,440
It's also your death day.

587
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,960
What are you doing?

588
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,880
I...

589
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,160
What are you doing again?

590
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,560
I... I'm...

591
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,000
You asked me, but I haven't asked you.

592
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,760
Why did you come to my room without saying anything?

593
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,600
What are these?

594
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,560
These are the tools I use to make spices.

595
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,720
Don't forget your identity.

596
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,920
Chu Meng Die doesn't like to use the powder.

597
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,320
Are you done?

598
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,880
No.

599
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,720
Change your clothes.

600
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,200
I'll take you to practice.

601
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,160
Luckily, I'm smart.

602
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,640
I didn't get caught by the devil.

603
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,480
才 voidas

604
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,640
So what, devil?

605
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,400
Did I make you flutter?

606
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:05,960
Killing a fleeting love

607
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,160
Keep it.

608
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,120
Should I thrash you?

609
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,800
Then I'll give it to you.

610
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,680
Spare me.

611
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,040
Yeah.

612
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,040
Raise it up.

613
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,320
It's a little heavy.

614
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,040
The light of the sword is still there.

615
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,040
The wind blows away the mist.

616
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,040
The sun rises and sets.

617
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,040
The clouds are right in front of me.

618
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,040
I look back.

619
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:08,040
This life and death are the same.

620
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,040
I never look back.

621
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,040
I look for the past.

622
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,040
I look for the past.

623
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:21,040
The thousand of love and death make me not dare to stop.

624
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,040
Did you see it clearly?

625
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,040
No.

626
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,040
If this continues,

627
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,040
I won't wait for the sword to learn,

628
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,040
but rather to fall into the devil's gentle trap.

629
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,040
I once read a book.

630
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,040
There is a set of love and death in the book.

631
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,040
Could it be this?

632
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,040
What are you talking about?

633
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Love and death is the kind of move that hurts people.
