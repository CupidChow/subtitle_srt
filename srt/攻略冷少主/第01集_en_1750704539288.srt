00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,580
I, Li Su

5
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,080
was born in G victa Lenin's dream

6
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,340

at my birth

10
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,260
Since I entered my major's childhood,

11
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,260
and he's a good man.

12
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,700
He never does anything out of the house.

13
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,940
You little brat!

14
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,500
Get down!

15
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,100
I'm so good at

16
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,420
communicating with my mother.

17
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,940
If you can't find that bad guy,

18
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,100
don't come back!

19
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:01,900
Yes.

20
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,580
Song.

21
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,540
Mother.

22
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,100
I will never allow your husband

23
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,060
to leave like your father.

24
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,900
Since then,

25
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,340
the man who proposed to me

26
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,860
has been afraid of breaking the doorstep of the Li family.

27
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,980
But my mother gave herself to me for my father's sake.

28
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,180
How can I let this

29
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,620
happen to me?

30
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,620
Those men

31
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,780
can only return with disappointment.

32
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,580
Great.

33
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,260
You don't like me?

34
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,100
God is watching.

35
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,060
That year,

36
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,300
I founded the first house in Dream City,

37
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,900
Lin's House.

38
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,260
The house owner who ruined my dream

39
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,100
was blocked

40
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,980
because of that mistake.

41
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,980
I'm hurt.

42
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,220
It hurts.

43
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,980
Who disturbed the princess's carriage?

44
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,140
It's a waste of our good matchmaker.

45
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,180
It hurts.

46
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,820
Take it down.

47
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,820
Wait.

48
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,340
I'm afraid I'll be beaten to death by you.

49
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,180
Qian,

50
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,380
give her some money.

51
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,140
Princess.

52
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,580
It's rare that I'm in a good mood today.

53
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,580
That's good.

54
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,100
Yes.

55
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,540
Princess.

56
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,340
You look so happy.

57
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,660
It's a good omen.

58
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,260
Don't be so stingy in the future.

59
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,740
Miss.

60
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,060
Wait.

61
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,900
There's happiness

62
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,540
and there's good fortune.

63
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,700
This book

64
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,100
will help you solve your problem.

65
00:03:47,580 --> 00:04:13,080
The Thinking

66
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,540
What is the title of the painting?

67
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,500
There is a bird-shaped egg on the foot.

68
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,460
It is thought to be born with a martial art skill.

69
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,700
What kind of love story is this?

70
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,220
It's so silly.

71
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,260
Why is the princess in a daze?

72
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,540
Don't talk about the protagonist.

73
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,900
Where are the others?

74
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,620
Found it.

75
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,540
There is a demon in the Sun Moon Palace, Gu Yuan.

76
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,660
It was born in the third year of the Chiyuan period,

77
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,100
in the seventh month of the seventh month.

78
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,620
It is very hot and decisive.

79
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,060
It is the most popular title

80
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,020
in the world's first-class sect, Jingyun Villa, Chu Wuya.

81
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,860
There is another protagonist in this book.

82
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,140
Nan Chui Meng.

83
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,740
This child is born with a temperament.

84
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,500
He loves the Chichen City and the first floor of the Qinglou.

85
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,020
Ning Xiangfang.

86
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,220
What a bad painting!

87
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,020
The first room of the Dream City

88
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,340
that I founded

89
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,460
is written as the Qinglou.

90
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,100
Investigate.

91
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,340
Find out who is the person who made the painting.

92
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,940
I'll investigate it now.

93
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,900
Assassins!

94
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,340
What should we do, Princess?

95
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,100
Who sent you here?

Dry them up.

My magic powder can't be used anymore.

00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,140
Gu yuan, you devil.

00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,780
You will die due to death here.

114
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,300
Why have you come back now?

115
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,360
I think you'd better ask my father-in-law for helpnamely.

116

Let's go.

117

Your Highness,

119
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,340
They must be soonging each other in nature.

120
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,220
Are you done reading?

121
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,300
Let me help.

122
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,900
I'm not afraid of you.

123
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,980
Three-color bracelet.

124
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,140
You're Chu Mengdie?

125
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,500
What three-color bracelet?

126
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,180
What Chu Mengdie?

127
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,900
Where am I?

128
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,300
Why am I here?

129
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,740
I'm at Hu Xinting.

130
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,580
Why is it daytime?

131
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,740
Atene.

132
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,580
Let go of me.

133
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,700
Or I'll go back and find someone to take you to the grave.

134
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,620
Are you serious?

135
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,700
It's so quiet.

136
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,020
Young Master.

137
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,100
Do you think I can live as Chu Mengdie

138
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,580
or not?

139
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,300
Cut the crap.

140
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,740
I'm not.

141
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,180
Let me tell you the truth.

142
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,420
I'm Li Song'er.

143
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,140
Leave now.

144
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,820
I'll double the price of you killing Chu Mengdie.

145
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,540
Chris.

146
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,540
Adam.

147
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,500
Are you kidding me?

148
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,900
I didn't kiss Adam.

149
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,940
Why aren't the graduate students here?

150
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,900
Z PROCESS L. 960

151
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,660
I don't have any status

152
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,100
just for my turnover.

153
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,020
Yeah.

154
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,700
Forget it!

155
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,380
Just try your best.

156
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,820
When I get back to the city,

157
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,820
I'll be driving on your neck.

158
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,660
No, I'll be driving on your neck.

159
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,860
I must get off.

160
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,740
If you don't run, you'll be killed.

161
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,980
You're a kid.

162
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,700
Are you painting powder?

163
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,780
You've entered the Qianji Town.

164
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,380
As long as you step on it,

165
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,700
you'll trigger the bamboo thorns buried underground.

166
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,300
Så it will shock every body.

167
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,740
Well.

168
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,740
You are really evil.

169
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,460
You even practiced with your wife

170
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,300
to concerted little kids

171
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,580
to ruin my career.

172
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,860
How dare you!

173
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,920
How dare you!

174
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,060
So mean!

175
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,860
How dare you!

176
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,060
Okay, you what?

177
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,340
What?

178
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,500
Jub limp!

179
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,300
Let's have this donation pop up showing

180
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,500
I'm not a fool.

181
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,100
I'm a fool.

182
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,100
I'm not a fool.

183
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,500
You stepped on the thread of Qianji Town.

184
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,500
You think I'm stupid?

185
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,100
You want to trick me?

186
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,100
I think

187
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,700
Qianji Town is specially for

188
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,900
people who bully girls like you.

189
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,300
I have the power of the heavens since I was young.

190
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,500
You want to catch me?

191
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,300
You're a fool.

192
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
You can't.

193
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,100
You deserve it.

194
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,900
You're a fool.

195
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,700
You can't.

196
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,300
Get up.

197
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,900
Are you sure?

198
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,500
I need to borrow some strength.

199
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,300
Let me see your face.

200
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
I'll go back and send someone to catch you.

201
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
Don't touch me.

202
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,940
I thought it was a

203
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,100
mean and evil look.

204
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,300
It actually suits me.

205
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,300
What a bad guy.

206
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,900
No.

207
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,100
What time is it?

208
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,500
Po Chen.

209
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,300
Yes.

210
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,500
What are you doing?

211
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,100
Let me out.

212
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,700
I really don't know anything.

213
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,100
I fell down from the sky.

214
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,100
I was chased by you.

215
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,700
Now you're trying to bury me alive.

216
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,100
Why do you treat me like this?

217
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,500
No one has ever treated me like this.

218
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,300
I can die.

219
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Can you stop burying me?

220
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,900
It's really dirty.

221
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,500
Who are you?

222
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,900
Who are you?

223
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,100
What does it have to do with Jingyun Villa?

224
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,300
If you're not Chu Mengdie,

225
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,700
why do you have her three-color bracelet?

226
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,700
What Jingyun Villa?

227
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,100
I'm Li Song'er.

228
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,900
The little princess of Zui Meng City.

229
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,700
Zui Meng City?

230
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,100
Little princess?

231
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,100
Nonsense.

232
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,500
Princess.

233
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,300
If this girl didn't appear suddenly,

234
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,900
Nan Chuimeng wouldn't have followed her.

235
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,500
I guess they're a team.

236
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Do we want to...

237
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,700
Princess?

238
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,100
Nan Chuimeng?

239
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,900
In the Sun Moon Palace, there's a demon Gu Yuan.

240
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,900
He's very cruel and cruel.

241
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,100
Nan Chuimeng was born in Chiyuan for four years.

242
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,900
His son is a man of good character.

243
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,700
He's loved by the Chiyuan City.

244
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,700
He's the first dragon to visit Ningxiang.

245
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,500
You're Gu Yuan?

246
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,500
Do you know that the people who call our princess's name

247
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,100
are all dead?

248
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,100
He's really Gu Yuan?

249
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,900
If you're really Gu Yuan,

250
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,100
then the first-class sect of the world,

251
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,300
Jingyun Villa, Chu Wuya, is your enemy?

252
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
How can your father's dog-thief

253
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,900
deserve the title of the best in the world?

254
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,100
Father?

255
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,700
Chu Wuya, Chu Mengdie.

256
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,100
They're father and daughter?

257
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,900
You're asking two questions.

258
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,900
This must be a dream.

259
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,700
No, I have to wake up quickly.

260
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,700
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

261
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,700
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

262
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,900
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

263
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,700
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

264
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,500
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

265
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,700
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

266
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,500
I know where that Nan Chuimeng

267
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,900
you're talking about is.

268
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,460
The

269
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,460
The

270
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,460
The

271
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,460
The

272
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,460
The

273
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,460
The

274
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,500
Princess.

275
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,500
Li Song'er, who claimed to be Princess Yicheng,

276
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,500
was locked in the bedroom.

277
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,100
I've arranged for her to be kept in check.

278
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,900
Her guards are all withdrawn.

279
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,100
This woman has nothing to do with

280
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,500
the Fengyu Valley in Jingyun Villa.

281
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,100
But she knows the whereabouts of Nan Chuimeng.

282
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,500
And Chu Mengdie's three-color bracelet.

283
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,500
Nan Chuimeng hid her new favorite

284
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,100
in Ningxiang's room.

285
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,500
Only she can solve

286
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,300
the problem of the person who knows.

287
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,300
When she escapes,

288
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,100
you follow her immediately.

289
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,100
I understand.

290
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,100
If she really has a conspiracy with Nan Chuimeng,

291
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,500
I'll follow her

292
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,700
and find out.

293
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
The

294
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,100
Did she really

295
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,500
get into the painting book I read alone?

296
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,500
Mingling was reading the painting book

297
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
just now.

298
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,100
I should have remembered it earlier.

299
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,900
The most urgent thing is to escape.

300
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
The Princess's Residence

301
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,900
Today,

302
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,900
our Princess is in seclusion.

303
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,100
All the servants in the palace

304
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,900
were expelled from the palace.

305
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,300
There is no guard or guard now.

306
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,100
No one will come to see you tonight.

307
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,700
So

308
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,700
you'd better not think of escaping.

309
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,300
Do you understand?

310
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,700
Say it again.

311
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,100
I said...

312
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,100
I got it.

313
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,700
The Princess's Residence

314
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,500
There must be a trap here.

315
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,500
Empty City Chicken?

316
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,300
Then I'll

317
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,300
play a trick.

318
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,300
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

319
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,900
I was thinking

320
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,300
that it's already the best to enjoy the moon on the roof.

321
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,500
But it's not as beautiful as the Princess.

322
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,100
It turns out

323
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,900
that the color of the moon in the basin

324
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,100
is more like you.

325
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,100
You're enjoying the moon.

326
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,100
You want to escape, right?

327
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,700
If you don't take my order into account,

328
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,700
I'll be in trouble.

329
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,100
The Moon in the Basin

330
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,300
You want me to kill you?

331
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,300
No, no, no.

332
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,300
It's a misunderstanding.

333
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,300
I can leave right away.

334
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,100
And I will never make

335
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,300
such a mistake again.

336
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,500
Princess, you're in the bath now.

337
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,900
If you kill me

338
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,700
and make the water in the basin red,

339
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:10,900
then you'll

340
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,500
take a bath for nothing.

341
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,100
And...

342
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,500
Get out!

343
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:14,900
Okay.

344
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,700
I'll leave right away.

345
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,300
Wait.

346
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,500
Get out of there.

347
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:22,700
Okay.

348
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,500
You can't even escape.

349
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,100
How can you be so stupid?

350
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,700
The Moon in the Basin

351
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,500
Li Song'er really escaped.

352
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,900
She's so clumsy.

353
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,300
You should follow her.

354
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,300
Don't let anything happen

355
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,100
and delay our plan.

356
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,300
Yes.

357
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,100
The Moon in the Basin

358
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,500
The Heaven-Sky Weapon Star Armor.

359
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,300
It's a must-have item.

360
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,500
Take a look.

361
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,700
It's a must-have item.

362
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,700
It's a must-have item.

363
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
This is a must-have item for the royal family.

364
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,900
Great!

365
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,900
It's a must-have item.

366
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,700
Great!

367
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,700
Great!

368
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,500
One more time.

369
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
One more time.

370
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:13,900
Great!

371
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,900
Great!

372
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,100
Great!

373
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,700
The people in the West are so clever.

374
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,300
When can I go back to

375
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,100
the most dreamy place in the mortal world?

376
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,300
Fighting, fighting,

377
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,500
and being rude.

378
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
It's all dirty and smelly.

379
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,900
What a place this is!

380
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,500
Oh my god.

381
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,100
I miss my rouge, flower powder,

382
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,900
and rose fragrance.

383
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,900
Oh, Miss Chu.

384
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,300
You're here.

385
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,500
What's the matter?

386
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,100
What?

387
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,300
I'm Miss Chu.

388
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,900
Miss Chu.

389
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,100
It seems that I can disguise myself

390
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,700
as Chu Mengdie with these three-color bracelets.

391
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,300
I'll get some food first.

392
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,300
Let's go, Miss Chu.

393
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,700
Come on, let's have a talk.

394
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,700
Come on.

395
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,900
Come to my house for dinner.

396
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,100
Come on, come on.

397
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,300
Come and have a seat.

398
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,500
Why didn't you say hello to me

399
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,700
before coming here?

400
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,300
But is there anything

401
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,300
you want to do?

402
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,700
I...

403
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,500
I've heard that

404
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,900
the girls in Ningxiang House

405
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,300
are all very attractive.

406
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,700
So,

407
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,100
I want to get some concubines

408
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,700
for my fiance.

409
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,500
We'll go to the Wind and Rain Valley together

410
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,700
and have a dinner for him.

411
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,500
I didn't expect that Miss Chu

412
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,100
is not only good at martial arts,

413
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,900
but also has a broad mind.

414
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,700
To be honest,

415
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,500
later,

416
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
Mr. Chu Meng will come to our place.

417
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,900
How about you two go together?

418
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,500
No, no, no.

419
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,100
We usually don't fight.

420
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,700
I'll prepare a surprise for him.

421
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,500
I know.

422
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:16,900
Hey.

423
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,300
Mr. Nan likes

424
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,900
Ningxiang's meat and wine snacks.

425
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,500
We're getting married soon.

426
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,700
I have to know his taste first.

427
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,700
I know.

428
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,100
It's his hobby.

429
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,500
Mr. Chu is really smart.

430
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,500
Come on.

431
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,700
Dear guests.

432
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,500
Mr. Chu from the Mountain and the Mountain.

433
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,900
He's visiting us in Wusong.

434
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,900
Good wine, good dishes and snacks.

435
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,300
I'm finally going to get married.

436
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,500
Yes.

437
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,700
Chu Mengdie is really useful.

438
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,700
It's a pity.

439
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,900
He's married to a man

440
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,700
who loves flowers and flowers.

441
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,300
He's really unreliable.

442
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,100
If you have any skills,

443
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,500
just tell me.

444
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,700
The two best ones

445
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,300
can join me in the Phoenix Valley.

446
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,900
Mr. Chu only cares about food.

447
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,300
He doesn't care about us.

448
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,300
Does he look down on us?

449
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,300
You're wrong.

450
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,700
I'm glad you're teaching me.

451
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,900
This hammer looks good.

452
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,700
It's a good match for you.

453
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,900
But your fish tail pattern

454
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,100
really shows your age.

455
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,300
A white dress and a female heroine are not ordinary.

456
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,900
Her bones are light and her face is sweet and beautiful.

457
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,300
But her hair is thick and thick.

458
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,300
Her skin color is not even.

459
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,700
It's really a good match.

460
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,300
This lady.

461
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,700
Her skin is not fair enough.

462
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,900
Her skin color is not bright enough.

463
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,700
Her nose is oily.

464
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,100
It's a problem of the skin.

465
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,900
It's a pity.

466
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,100
It's a pity.

467
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,700
You're only one step away

468
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,100
from being a good dancer.

469
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,700
The Chu Lady is teaching herself.

470
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,500
Welcome to the Chu Lady's

471
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,300
School of Secret Studies.

472
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,700
Don't miss the Furu Ning's mouthwork.

473
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,900
The front grass is called the dragon's lung grass.

474
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,300
The back grass is called the half lotus.

475
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,700
The letter is made of the honey and the honey is made of the honey.

476
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,500
Remember it.

477
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,100
Remember to be considerate.

478
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,100
You don't understand, do you?

479
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,100
I mean,

480
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,700
fate is fated.

481
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,100
The image is born from the heart.

482
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,100
Walking in the world,

483
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,500
the image is born.

484
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,100
So,

485
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,100
sisters,

486
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,700
how can we let our opponents

487
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,900
know our age and cultivation?

488
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,300
Simply put,

489
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,100
we need to care about our image

490
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,900
to make our opponents

491
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,100
a good match.

492
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,300
Everyone,

493
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,900
I've written down the secret of cultivation and health.

494
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,500
Just copy and paste it.

495
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,900
Hurry up.

496
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,100
Why is it so hard

497
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,700
for me to eat?

498
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,900
I just want to fill my stomach.

499
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,100
Chu Nixia.

500
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,300
Did you have fun just now?

501
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,500
All the good sisters are waiting for you

502
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,900
for a long time.

503
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,300
Please show us a trick

504
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,500
to make you look good.

505
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,300
Come on.

506
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,900
Let's go.

507
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,300
Well...

508
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Mr. Nan,

509
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,300
I heard that your fiancee, Chu Mengdie,

510
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,500
has also come to your room.

511
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,700
Would you like to have a look?

512
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,300
My fiancee?

513
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,300
I'm only married to her,

514
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,300
but I haven't seen her once.

515
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,700
It's good.

516
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,300
I'm going to say hello to her now.

517
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,300
Come on.

518
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,500
Make sure it's Chu Mengdie.

519
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,900
I'll ask her to come here at once.

520
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,500
You can see my face later.

521
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,100
Nan Chu.

522
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,100
Come on.

523
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,100
Come on.

524
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,100
Come on.

525
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,100
Come on.

526
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,500
Chu Nixia.

527
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,500
Come on.

528
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,300
Today, I'm here to welcome

529
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,300
Chu Mengdie, the first female heroine in the martial arts world.

530
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,900
I'm going to show you a trick.

531
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,700
Are you all convinced?

532
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,300
Great.

533
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,100
Chu Nixia, please.

534
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,300
Come on.

535
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,500
I can't continue.

536
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,300
Chu Mengdie, why are you so miserable?

537
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,300
I'm dead.

538
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,300
The devil came to catch me on the second day.

539
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,300
I have to punish him this time.

540
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,900
Look, everyone.

541
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,900
The devil is here.

542
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,900
It's him.

543
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,300
Your Majesty.

544
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,300
Your Majesty.

545
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,300
Your Majesty.

546
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,300
Your Majesty.

547
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,300
Your Majesty.

548
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,300
Your Majesty.

549
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,300
Your Majesty.

550
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,300
Your Majesty.

551
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,300
Your Majesty.

552
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,300
Your Majesty.

553
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,300
Your Majesty.

554
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,300
Your Majesty.

555
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,300
Your Majesty.

556
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,300
Your Majesty.

557
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,300
Your Majesty.

558
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,300
Your Majesty.

559
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,300
Your Majesty.

560
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,300
Your Majesty.

561
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,300
Your Majesty.

562
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,300
Your Majesty.

563
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,300
Your Majesty.

564
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,300
Your Majesty.

565
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,300
Your Majesty.

566
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,300
Your Majesty.

567
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,300
Your Majesty.

568
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,300
Your Majesty.

569
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,300
Your Majesty.

570
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,300
Your Majesty.

571
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,300
