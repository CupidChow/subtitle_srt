1
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,640
Sir!

2
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,840
Help me! Sir!

3
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,560
Help!

4
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,080
Sir!

5
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,360
<i>In 1565, during the reign</i>
<i>of King Maha Chakkhapat,</i>

6
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,640
<i>there was a great epidemic.</i>

7
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,360
<i>It was brought</i>
<i>by Iranian and Portuguese ships.</i>

8
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,040
<i>It spread quickly in every direction.</i>

9
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,440
<i>So many people lost their lives to it.</i>

10
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,960
<i>Countless corpses littered the land.</i>

11
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,040
<i>The people called it the plague.</i>

12
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,360
<i>But actually, it wasn't the plague.</i>

13
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,800
<i>It was an illness never seen before.</i>

14
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,560
<i>It was far worse than the plague.</i>

15
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
Don't.

16
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,959
Mien.

17
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,600
Do you see that merchant ship?

18
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,200
I want us to travel together
to the north and south.

19
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,520
So do I.

20
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,280
But you know it's impossible.

21
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,880
Are you afraid?

22
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,440
I'm not scared of anything.

23
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
But you're

24
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,080
out of my league.

25
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,560
How much do you think I'm worth?

26
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,520
Let me show you.

27
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,800
- What is this?!
- We're just coming from our prayers.

28
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,760
- Bastard!
- Can't you restrain yourself?

29
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
Father.

30
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,320
Father, no.

31
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,320
You bastard! I hope you drown.

32
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,760
- Father…
- This is a sanctuary.

33
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,160
What's the matter?

34
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,400
Your apprentice harassed my daughter.

35
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,120
- That's not true.
- Shut up.

36
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,720
If he wasn't the abbot's apprentice,

37
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,480
I'd have chopped his head off by now.

38
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,560
It's my fault
for not teaching him what's right.

39
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,200
I apologize on his behalf
for offending you.

40
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,920
If you should punish anyone,

41
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,440
please punish me, because I'm to blame.

42
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,440
Come on.

43
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,280
Let's go.

44
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,840
Bua Kwan.

45
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,880
These days, all the men are being drafted
to fight at Hongsa.

46
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,240
Even the blacksmiths
are being recruited to make swords.

47
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,080
I was just passing by.

48
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,080
I noticed you working
and decided to drop by.

49
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,200
The debts your father incurred
before he died

50
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,080
were quite significant.

51
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,160
I'm willing to waive it all off
on the condition that you become my wife.

52
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,720
- My master is not for sale!
- No, don't.

53
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Bua,

54
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,400
I won't make you work in my brothel.

55
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,000
But it's hard to find
a good diligent girl these days.

56
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Toon.

57
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,880
Back off, or lose your head.

58
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,880
Bastards like you
are the reason why I'll never marry.

59
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,440
I mean well Bua.

60
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,200
Can't believe I risked my life
for a few coins.

61
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
Damn. Talk about bad debt.

62
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,040
What are you looking at?

63
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,880
Get out of here!

64
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,560
What a nuisance.

65
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,640
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

66
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,360
Where did she go?

67
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,840
She was right here.

68
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,000
I wonder where she went.

69
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,520
What the hell?!

70
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,680
Help!

71
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,520
Help!

72
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,640
A wild beast must have eaten his flesh.

73
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,680
I don't think so.

74
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,560
These aren't the bite marks
of a wild animal.

75
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,400
It must have been a monkey or a gibbon.

76
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,920
Go home, it's late already.

77
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,440
Your wife and children must be waiting.

78
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,840
Don't let me down.

79
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Where's your new girl?

80
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,080
Here she is.

81
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,240
Her name is Ploy.

82
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,680
You've never smoked opium before?

83
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,760
Give me the pipe.

84
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,440
Talk to me, Ploy.

85
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,760
It's unusual for lovebirds to be silent.

86
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,840
Damn it.

87
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,240
You've ruined my night.

88
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,840
Money doesn't come easy these days.

89
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,120
Sooner or later, someone will defile you.

90
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,120
I've told you before. Reach for the stars,

91
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,520
and fall in the mud.

92
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,800
Why should it matter to anyone
if I'm in love with Mien?

93
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Her father doesn't seem happy.

94
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,880
Haven't you noticed?

95
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,520
He wants her to marry someone else.

96
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,240
What happened to you?

97
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,240
Rotten luck.

98
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,960
My comfort girl was a deaf mute.

99
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,560
I felt bad, and let her go.

100
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,240
Who's buying the liquor tonight?

101
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,560
Don't worry about that.

102
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,360
Consider it my treat.

103
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,520
Bless your soul!

104
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,440
It's not every day
that you buy me a drink.

105
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,800
Must be my lucky day.

106
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,560
Don't push it. I might change my mind.

107
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,960
Just kidding, old man.

108
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Guys…

109
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,520
See that drunkard?

110
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
He's alone.

111
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,240
His name is Thep.

112
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,640
I've heard stories about him.

113
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,520
They say he was a fierce warrior
who fought many battles.

114
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,920
I have no idea why he's a drunkard now.

115
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,920
I've been seeing him for a while now.

116
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,120
He stays there all day long.
Just as you see him now.

117
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,880
How could that drunkard be a warrior?

118
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,640
If you really want to know,
challenge him to a duel.

119
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,560
Then you'll find out if he's for real.

120
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,000
Are you crazy?
Who would challenge a drunk?

121
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,640
I've had enough to drink.

122
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,680
- Let me go.
- Bua.

123
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,400
Let go!

124
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,240
How dare you!

125
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,720
Let me go.

126
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,120
This blade is razor-sharp.

127
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,680
If you don't mind,

128
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,840
I'd like to test it on his neck.

129
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,880
Let's go.

130
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,720
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it, ma'am.

131
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,920
I have a favor to ask of you, though.

132
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,040
What is it?

133
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,480
May I have two swords?

134
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,880
I need weapons.

135
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Sure.

136
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Come out!

137
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,200
Show yourself!

138
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,920
What's going on?

139
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,840
It's Bua. It's all her fault.

140
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,920
Don't lie to a monk, Kwan.

141
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,440
- You're the liar.
- Calm down.

142
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
Bua,

143
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,480
tell me what happened.

144
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,320
Why are you two fighting?

145
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,800
I woke up to a noise in the jungle.

146
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,680
It was a very strange noise.

147
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,120
Then I found the corpse of Toon.

148
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,120
Kwan thought
you were eating Toon's dead body.

149
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,760
Is that why you're fighting?

150
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,240
You're just a silly girl.
Who's going to believe you?

151
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,280
I can make your friends suffer
excruciating pain.

152
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,560
Come now.

153
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,400
How many corpses have you seen
including Toon's?

154
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,720
Six.

155
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,480
What do you think happened
to these people?

156
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,280
The plague.

157
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,040
Look at Toon's corpse.

158
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,960
His skin is rotting,
it's got sores and blisters.

159
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,600
Not to mention
the wounds inflicted by wild beasts.

160
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,120
I believe it's the plague.

161
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,480
That's what we've heard.

162
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,840
The abbot is right.

163
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,520
The other corpses have similar wounds.

164
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,720
What should we do?

165
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,480
We must inform all the villagers.

166
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,880
Both of you, go warn the people.

167
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,400
Tell them to leave this place immediately.

168
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,080
Either that, or to stay indoors.

169
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,680
If anyone steps outside,

170
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,680
they'll surely die a terrible death.

171
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,160
I must speak with the abbot myself.

172
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,160
It's a matter of life and death.

173
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,440
Kong!

174
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,200
Do you want to run away with me?
The ship has arrived.

175
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,760
Where will you run to?

176
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Do you remember the merchant ship?

177
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,680
The plague has reached the village.

178
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,840
Everyone's running for their lives.

179
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,320
The merchant ship is our only hope.

180
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,040
Where are you going?

181
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,720
Father, don't.

182
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,920
You ungrateful child.

183
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,680
Father, let him go.

184
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,600
No, Mien.

185
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,000
Then kill me instead.

186
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,400
I forbid you from seeing him ever again.

187
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,800
If you really love her,

188
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,000
then let her go.

189
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,520
How soon do you plan to move out?

190
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:17,360
I must wait awhile
until my servants have loaded the ship.

191
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,800
It's not like I want to stay.

192
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,160
Are you drunk already?
You've only had a few jars.

193
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,600
Think about it.

194
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,840
The brothel stays open.

195
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,000
Everyone is dying from the plague.

196
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,280
Go on. Leave.

197
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,320
Wait.

198
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,400
Let me pay you first.

199
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,480
My wallet is gone.

200
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,160
Dumb bitch!

201
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,520
You whore!

202
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,960
You ungrateful slut!

203
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,360
Enough.

204
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,920
- What do you want?
- I'm here to enjoy myself.

205
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,600
Let me have her.

206
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,520
You can't. She's being punished.

207
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,680
- Come on, what's the price?
- Three times the usual.

208
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,120
Do you have the money?

209
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,320
Greedy bastard.

210
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,400
Why are you always getting into trouble?

211
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,360
Get out…

212
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,840
of here.

213
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,280
This place is dangerous.

214
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,360
Death.

215
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,800
I'm trying to help you.

216
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,200
If things continue like this,

217
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,680
you'll have to shut down the brothel.

218
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,800
These pleasure girls
are no different from slaves.

219
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,600
Why should we pay them?

220
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,840
Because they need to eat
and care for themselves.

221
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,320
Right, sir?

222
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:34,000
If we don't provide them with the basics,
how can we attract customers?

223
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,320
I'm going to follow her.
Don't tell anyone.

224
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,640
We cannot charge all our customers
the same rates.

225
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,720
Ploy!

226
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,400
Stop her!

227
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,080
That mute tried to kill me!

228
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,760
Don't waste your time helping her, Thep!

229
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,360
You think you're so powerful?

230
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,560
Give her to me.

231
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,720
Don't say I didn't warn you.

232
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,480
If you focus on the bamboo
and overlook the teak tree,

233
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,040
you're going to miss an important point.

234
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,800
Let's rest for a while.

235
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,160
Stop.

236
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,040
Are you tired?

237
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,720
Kaew.

238
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,320
Where is she?

239
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,960
Damn it.

240
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,720
Turn the caravan around!

241
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,320
Where is it?

242
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,320
Don't go!

243
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,080
Come here.

244
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,760
Why are the symptoms so strange?

245
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,680
People said he returned from the jungle.

246
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,440
He's been feverish all day long.

247
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,040
And then he suddenly
started to have convulsions.

248
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,240
Move.

249
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,240
Come here.

250
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,680
This is not the plague.

251
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,360
Take the abbot with you and go!

252
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,240
Go!

253
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,640
Don't come here.

254
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,680
You have to chop their heads clean off.

255
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,760
The brothel is made of bricks and mortar.

256
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,400
It will keep the zombies out.

257
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,560
Ma'am, come with me now.

258
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,520
I think we should go to the abbey.

259
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,520
It's stronger than that horrible brothel.

260
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,520
Lek, Noy, pack up, let's go!

261
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,680
Lek, Noy,

262
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,520
let's get out of here
and leave this all behind.

263
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,280
Take them to the abbey, hurry.

264
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,320
Come with me.

265
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,600
Mien?

266
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,720
Mien!

267
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,400
Mien, my daughter!

268
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,920
Mien!

269
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,600
Mien?

270
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,600
- Kong.
- What are you doing here?

271
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,400
- Where's Mien?
- I thought she left town with you.

272
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,320
Madam!

273
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,880
Madame.

274
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,480
Mien…

275
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,640
Excuse me, could you help me…

276
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,160
I'm here now, Mien. Don't worry.

277
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,600
They wouldn't dare enter this holy place.

278
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,680
We should get to the brothel right now.

279
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,600
We need to help the survivors.

280
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,080
The zombies already attacked the abbey.

281
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,600
Are you going to let them
feast on your flesh too?

282
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,720
Go! Hurry!

283
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,600
Hey!

284
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,360
Hurry up and shut the door!

285
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,200
Lock it.

286
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,240
You again?

287
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,960
Mother!

288
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,480
Mother!

289
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,040
Ploy isn't here.

290
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,720
Where else could she have gone?

291
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,640
She's probably at the brothel.

292
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,160
If we stand around and bicker all night,

293
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,800
we'll die before we could fight off
the zombies.

294
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,160
Open the door!

295
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,880
Open the door!

296
00:48:53,960 --> 00:49:00,400
If we open that door now,
those zombies are going to kill us all.

297
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,840
Wait, don't do it. Thep!

298
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,440
Stop him!

299
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,520
Come on, I dare you.

300
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,880
Thep!

301
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,760
Just do whatever you're going to do
already.

302
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:28,520
The three of you,
go rescue the people outside. Hurry.

303
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,400
The door's open.

304
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,920
Mien?

305
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,600
We'll stay here until dawn.

306
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,400
What does that mean?

307
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,480
Do you expect us to leave this place?

308
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,920
There's neither food nor water here.

309
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,000
And the longer we stay here,

310
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,800
the more likely it is
that we'll be killed by the zombies.

311
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,560
Can someone please tell me

312
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,080
what awakened all the zombies
in the first place?

313
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,320
All I know is
we must cut their heads clean off.

314
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,240
That's the only way to stop them.

315
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,120
Where do we go from here?

316
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,720
How do we know
there aren't zombies in other cities?

317
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,920
Phitsanulok isn't far from here.

318
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,160
Maha Thammaracha has raised an army
against King Bayinnaung.

319
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,760
We'll be safe there.

320
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,720
You expect us
to just charge past the zombies?

321
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,600
If we leave this place,
we'll die for sure.

322
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:04,200
At least it's better
than being sitting ducks.

323
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,880
First we need to search the whole area.

324
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,080
Look for anything useful.

325
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,920
Then we should rest.

326
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,880
By tomorrow morning,
we'll be ready to fight.

327
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,320
Please forgive me.

328
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,240
Why are you always trying to help others?

329
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,360
What about you?

330
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,760
Why are you always
following your boss around?

331
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,880
Because it's my duty.

332
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,800
Well, this is my duty.

333
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,320
I once left the battlefield
for fear of death.

334
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,720
All my brave comrades
who fought by my side were slaughtered,

335
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,760
down to the last man.

336
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:43,080
Now I have a chance to clear my bad karma.

337
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,120
I can finally set things right.

338
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,000
Do you think we'll survive?

339
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,400
Absolutely, darling.

340
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,320
We'll make it to Phitsanulok.

341
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,200
But how are we going to escape this place?

342
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,560
I don't know what Thep's plan is.

343
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:14,120
But I know he'll come up
with something tonight.

344
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,120
I think I know
how we can escape from here.

345
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,960
How?

346
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,480
You remember that merchant ship?

347
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,920
We were supposed to
run away together on it.

348
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:35,360
If we can get to the ship,
we'll escape alive.

349
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,840
You're right. I'll inform Thep.

350
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,920
No, don't.

351
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:48,240
I'm afraid they'll leave us behind
in order to save themselves.

352
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,560
It's every man for himself now.

353
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,640
Let's keep this a secret between us.

354
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,560
Have you come to roll opium for me Ploy?

355
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:23,440
Last time,
you couldn't even light the flame.

356
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,400
Let me teach you now that you're here.

357
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,000
Fetch a cloth quickly.

358
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,280
I thought it was Ploy.

359
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,560
I didn't think it would be…

360
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,840
Don't worry, Kwan.

361
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,200
It's just a small wound.

362
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,280
You're always seeking pleasure
at the wrong time.

363
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,040
How was I to know
a zombie was lurking around?

364
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,600
Kong, I'm so cold.

365
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,120
You've lost a lot of blood.

366
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,720
I'll fetch you some water.

367
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Ploy.

368
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,680
Ploy?

369
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,600
Everyone, go get some sleep.

370
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,640
Ploy can look after him.

371
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,960
Kwan's wound is rotting and drying up.

372
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,240
I've seen it.

373
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,880
It's no ordinary wound.

374
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,960
I've seen a wound just like that before.

375
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,920
If it continues to spread,

376
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,160
the victim

377
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,000
turns into a zombie.

378
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:14,320
Do you mean Kwan will turn into a zombie?

379
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,160
I have no idea.

380
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,160
Mien!

381
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,800
No.

382
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,320
If it must be done,

383
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,240
let me do it.

384
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,200
Am I going to turn into one of them?

385
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,440
Damn it.

386
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,200
I don't want…

387
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,120
anyone else

388
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,400
to chop off your head.

389
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:39,160
My head will fall off
no matter who does it.

390
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,960
Do you get feverish during menstruation?

391
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,280
I'll get you a clean cloth.

392
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,000
How are you doing, Mien?

393
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,000
Kong

394
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:51,400
Let's go upstairs.
I need to tell you something.

395
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:54,960
In this condition?

396
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,160
Yes.

397
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:08,080
How will we get out of here alive?

398
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,800
Some of us are wounded,
sick and unconscious.

399
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,280
I can't think of a plan to escape alive.

400
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:20,560
I'll create a diversion
while the rest of you flee.

401
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:25,600
But it's impossible for us all to survive.

402
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:32,600
There's something I need to tell you
about Mien and Kong.

403
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,400
We must board the ship now.

404
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,120
But you're too weak to walk.

405
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,320
The longer we stay,
the more difficult it is.

406
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,320
You're not ready, Mien.

407
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,400
You know you're not strong enough.

408
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,360
I have to be. The ship has arrived.

409
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,480
I don't know,

410
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,240
but I'm pretty sure that's their plan.

411
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:10,080
The ship is our best chance
of getting out alive.

412
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,320
Time to fulfill your duty.

413
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,440
No!

414
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,760
How did this happen?

415
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,520
I got bitten last night.

416
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:30,040
But the wound only started to spread now.

417
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:35,640
No…

418
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,080
You must go.

419
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,439
I'll stay here with you, Mien.

420
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,040
Or else you must come with me.

421
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:06,960
Listen to me.

422
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,240
You've kept your promise.

423
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:13,880
Please go.

424
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,080
Mien.

425
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:24,480
I'm not going anywhere.

426
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,000
I'm not.

427
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,160
Just kill me.

428
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:27,760
No.

429
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:31,120
There's no way I could do that.

430
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,040
I can't kill you.

431
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,560
Mien!

432
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,720
No…

433
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,960
No, it can't be.

434
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,920
No, Mien.

435
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,360
Bua!

436
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,120
Bua.

437
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:49,240
Bua, help me.

438
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,600
Bua!

439
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,800
Mien…

440
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,520
Mien.

441
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:01,200
If you die, who will avenge Mien?

442
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:42,040
THERE ARE END CREDITS AFTER THE MOVIE
