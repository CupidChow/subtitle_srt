In that sense, Mr. Paik, you are so impressive.

51
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:51,540
Without much support from the government,

52

I owe it to the math teacher I met in high school.

What? Why?

62
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,240
The school, its students, their parents. They all hated her.

63

We got a little off-topic.

Well, what you said reminded me of what happened.

That teacher stood out, didn't she?

70
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,800
Here in Korea,

71

I have a question for you.

80
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,321
Why did Archimedes jump out of his bathtub?

81
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:17,220
That's because he realized that mass and volume...

82
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,860
Yes. That's what most Korean students say.

83
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,331
Until Archimedes realized the connection,

84
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:26,461
he felt the joy of concentration,

85
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:28,930
the pain of studying,

86
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,370
and the ecstasy of discovery, but no one mentions that.

87
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,441
If you let the student...

Get out.

Are you okay? Wake up.

175

You're in a hospital. How do you feel?

176

Does your head hurt? Are you dizzy?

Yes.

You can't be like this already.

186

This is just the beginning.

187
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:33,211
I imagined running into her countless times.

188

But actually seeing her...

189

scared me.

It's understandable.

191

No matter how much time passes,

192
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:50,400
it feels like it was only a day to a victim who sees the perpetrator.

193
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:54,841
Although the perpetrator forgot it all and is doing well.

194

What do you want to say when you see her again?

195
00:16:03,341 --> 00:16:04,411
Say it.

196

Pretend I'm her.

197

Apologize for it all.

Go on.

203
00:16:33,071 --> 00:16:35,311

Apparently, he was wrongfully dismissed.

Then he told me this.

"All I did was follow Mr. Han Myung Jin's orders."

letting her child get accepted to the school.

295

But she didn't feel comfortable about revealing her identity,

296
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,140

Along with the report on Han and the current audit...

332
00:23:55,481 --> 00:23:58,291
He's talking about Han Myung Jin, right?

333
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,251
What's going to happen now that he's getting investigated?

334
00:24:01,261 --> 00:24:03,221
What if he reveals everything that we did in the past?

335
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,460
Be quiet. It's nothing to shout about.

336
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:07,261
You need to do something about this.

337
00:24:07,331 --> 00:24:09,200
We can't let him get investigated!

338
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:10,700
- The current accusations... - What's the matter?

340
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,241
Ye Rin, you look gorgeous. Are you going somewhere?

341
00:24:18,311 --> 00:24:19,811
I have dinner plans. I'll see you guys.

342
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,981
Okay. Eat something delicious.

343
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,341
Happy birthday, Ye Rin.

- Bye. - Bye.

- The school will have to wait... - What are you going to do?

346
00:24:34,561 --> 00:24:35,761
for the results...

347
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,920
Happy birthday.

348
00:25:09,991 --> 00:25:12,231
- How did you know? - Your social media page.

349
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,501

00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:40,241
The director is here.

Come in.

- Director. - Did you go home safely last night?

356
00:25:47,521 --> 00:25:50,181
Yes. I apologize. Something suddenly came up.

357
00:25:50,251 --> 00:25:51,251
It's okay.

358
00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:53,521
From what I recall, you had something to tell me.

359
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:57,431
Yes. I plan on expanding my business.

360
00:25:57,491 --> 00:25:58,860
There will be many changes.

361
00:25:59,231 --> 00:26:00,600
What kind of changes?

362
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,600
I'm going to provide consulting services...

363
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,830
to help students get into universities abroad.

364
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:07,271
It's what I'm good at, so I was intrigued when I heard the offer.

365
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:08,840
Once we redirect our business,

366
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,170
our books and lectures will be focused on IVY League schools.

367
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,840
- Right. - I'll tell you the details...

368
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,181

Sure.

371
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,070
To be honest,

372
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,941
I'd like to apologize to you.

373
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,840
You mentioned the photo I took at Jeju Island so abruptly,

374
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,840
so I was too taken aback to say anything.

375
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:54,051
I'm sorry.

376
00:26:55,721 --> 00:26:57,721
I didn't expect things to go that far.

377
00:26:57,791 --> 00:26:58,850
I mean it.

378
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:03,291
I had no idea those photos would get revealed at Ms. Ji's wedding.

379
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:08,330
Then who did it?

380
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,201
If it wasn't you,

381
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,511
who used those photos to make a mess of things?

382
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,910
I'm not interrogating you.

383
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,681
I've just always been curious.

384
00:27:24,781 --> 00:27:27,080
Who would do that and why?

385
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,791
It was Ms. Noh.

386
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,221
I didn't even show those photos...

387
00:27:35,191 --> 00:27:37,191
to my own parents.

388
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,461
She was the only person I showed those photos to.

389
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,670
It must've been hard for you too.

390
00:27:47,241 --> 00:27:48,471
She used you.

391
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,840
You never intended on using those photos that way.

392
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,481
But she just did what she wanted to do with them.

393
00:27:57,981 --> 00:27:59,951
I bet you felt really bad after what happened.

394
00:28:11,531 --> 00:28:12,560
Thanks.

Hello?

397
00:28:31,951 --> 00:28:34,251
- Where are you? - I'm on my way home.

398
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,380
- Stop for a moment. - What? Why?

399
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,350
What are you doing here?

400
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:43,420
I dropped by on my way home. Happy birthday.

401
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:44,931
Thank you.

402
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,630
Did you have a birthday party?

403
00:28:50,701 --> 00:28:53,271
What? No, I just had dinner.

404
00:28:53,771 --> 00:28:54,801
With whom?

405
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,241
Seung Yoo.

406
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,211
- Are you going out with him? - No.

407
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,810
But what's with that tone?

408
00:29:04,551 --> 00:29:06,981
- Be careful of Seung Yoo. - What?

409
00:29:07,521 --> 00:29:10,181
I saw Ms. Ji Yoon Su. She lives in the same building as me.

410
00:29:18,031 --> 00:29:19,060
Ms. Ji.

411
00:29:20,031 --> 00:29:21,060
Ms. Ji.

412
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,100
What?

413
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,570
I'm done.

414
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:28,241
Okay. Let's call it a day.

415
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:30,910
How is school these days?

416
00:29:30,971 --> 00:29:32,070
Rowdy and disorganize.

417
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,580
Today, Mr. Han got taken away.

418
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:39,580
Don't care about anything else and focus on your studies.

419
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,481
Take everything you can from that school, okay?

420
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:43,551
Okay.

421
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:46,551
By the way,

422
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,991
Professor Ji Hyeon Uk is your father?

423
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,191
How did you find out?

424
00:29:53,261 --> 00:29:54,501
You have the same surname,

425
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,860
so I wondered and asked Mr. Paik.

426
00:29:56,931 --> 00:29:58,201
He told me.

427
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:03,370
I plan to visit again to play chess with him.

428
00:30:04,441 --> 00:30:05,570
Can I do that?

429
00:30:06,441 --> 00:30:07,441
Yes.

430
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:08,810
Great.

431
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,681
Oh, right. Ms. Ji.

432
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,551
Mr. Paik gave this to us to solve.

433
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,291
It's really hard.

434
00:30:21,761 --> 00:30:24,031
Can you take a look at it?

435
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,560
I should go now. Bye.

436
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:45,080
Such a time comes.

437
00:30:46,051 --> 00:30:49,251
Whatever problem you see, your heart does not respond.

438
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,021
You don't feel joy,

439
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,021
or the yearning to solve it.

440
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,160
That time.

441
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,560
Every mathematician goes through that period.

442
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,060
A mathematician who doesn't go through that...

443
00:31:03,031 --> 00:31:05,370
cannot solve the next problem.

444
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,791
How do you feel? Any better?

445
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,360
- Yes. - Can we go somewhere to talk?

446
00:32:10,201 --> 00:32:11,201
Get in.

447
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,310
I saw Ji Yoon Su.

448
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,140
She lives in my complex.

449
00:32:21,211 --> 00:32:22,211
Since when?

450
00:32:22,211 --> 00:32:23,410
I saw her when I moved in.

451
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,610
Do you think Seung Yoo knows that or not?

452
00:32:52,711 --> 00:32:53,941
I saw the news article.

453
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:56,810
What will you do?

454
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:00,551
I'll make them pay.

455
00:33:03,521 --> 00:33:05,291
So they can't sleep at night.

456
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,120
Prosecutor Park Jung Won?

457
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:11,291
I gave him a hard time during last year's government inspection.

458
00:33:11,691 --> 00:33:12,890
He's in charge.

459
00:33:14,301 --> 00:33:16,031
It's not easy to get information.

460
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,040
I knew Han Myung Jin would be a nuisance one day.

461
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,940
You should've fired him long ago.

462
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,081
Are you blaming me right now?

463
00:33:32,551 --> 00:33:35,221
The person who bribed him to steal the answer sheet...

464
00:33:35,851 --> 00:33:38,420
was your wife. Have you forgotten?

465
00:33:38,491 --> 00:33:39,920
What I'm saying is,

466
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,061
we should cut off the loose ends while we have a chance.

467
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,790
Yes, like that.

468
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,141
For a long time, Han Myung Jin...

469
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:12,451
Ms. Noh, it's me, Sung Ye Rin.

470
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,061
Why are you here this late?

471
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,460
I'm sorry to bother you.

472
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,670
I have something to tell you.

473
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,730
Sit down.

474
00:34:35,311 --> 00:34:36,311
What is it?

475
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,281
Are you here about Mr. Han Myung Jin too?

476
00:34:40,351 --> 00:34:42,121
Mr. Han? What about him?

477
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:43,380
You didn't see the news?

478
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,551
It was talk of the town all day long.

479
00:34:51,031 --> 00:34:52,661
What is it if it's not about that?

480
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:58,070
Ms. Ji is back in Hangok-dong.

481
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,570
Did you see her?

482
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,511
I know someone who did.

483
00:35:08,511 --> 00:35:09,911
And who knows where she lives.

484
00:35:11,081 --> 00:35:15,081
Noh Jung Ah, Sung Ye Rin, Sung Min Jun,

485
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,380
Han Myung Jin, Choi Sung Han.

486
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,391
That's what I know so far.

487
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,621
I will shake them up.

488
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,290
The more threatened they feel,

489
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,860
the more they'll abandon and blackmail each other.

490
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,040
So what?

491
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,270
I thought you should know.

492
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,110
Do you still like Seung Yoo?

493
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:48,020
Years ago, blinded by jealousy, you handed me that photo.

494
00:35:48,681 --> 00:35:50,820
You still can't get over him,

495
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,721
so you came to me just because you heard Ji Yoon Su was nearby?

496
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:57,561
Does it bother just me that she's back?

497
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,630
This is what you always do.

498
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,301
You get what you want...

499
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,630
by asking others to do your dirty job for you.

500
00:36:06,701 --> 00:36:07,900
I asked you?

501
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,440
I never imagined that photo would be used the way it was.

502
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,040
"Used"?

503
00:36:20,281 --> 00:36:21,451
Did you just say...

504
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:25,121
"used"?

505
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,561
Ye Rin.

506
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,971
I guess you don't remember.

507
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,971
I did it for you.

508
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,440
I did what I did for you.

509
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:51,851
You and your mom...

510
00:36:53,281 --> 00:36:56,351
got Mr. Han to steal you the answer sheet.

511
00:36:56,951 --> 00:36:58,790
Ji Yoon Su found out.

512
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:02,690
If I hadn't made use of the photo then,

513
00:37:02,761 --> 00:37:04,090
what would've happened?

514
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:08,431
Ye Rin. Answer me.

515
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,641
I used it?

516
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,871
No.

517
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,411
I helped you.

518
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,011
This time, you find a way.

519
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:33,391
See if she's in touch with Paik Seung Yoo too.

520
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,190
You want to know that more than anyone.

521
00:37:38,931 --> 00:37:39,931
I'll do that.

522
00:37:40,991 --> 00:37:42,000
But this time,

523
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,900
don't expect anything like the Jeju airport photo.

524
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,000
I won't share anything with you.

525
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:07,121
Did you hear that?

526
00:38:07,721 --> 00:38:09,420
Ji Yoon Su is back.

527
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:22,440
Did you have to say that?

528
00:38:23,471 --> 00:38:24,710
What should I have said, then?

529
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,641
That again I'll work with your dad...

530
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:29,110
and do everything for you, so don't worry?

531
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,210
It's not like you won't do anything.

532
00:38:31,911 --> 00:38:34,311
The audit and Han Myung Jin.

533
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,480
Is Ji Yoon Su behind all that?

534
00:38:38,851 --> 00:38:41,460
She orchestrated all that alone?

535
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,820
Then...

536
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,031
Paik Seung Yoo...

537
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,661
While they fight,

538
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:55,770
we should collaborate.

539
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,940
Seung Yoo.

540
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,311
I'm worried for you.

541
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:10,451
That you'll end up losing everything you accomplished.

542
00:39:15,261 --> 00:39:17,290
I didn't accomplish that much anyway.

543
00:39:18,761 --> 00:39:20,190
And it can all be done over.

544
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,000
However,

545
00:39:23,931 --> 00:39:26,101
there's something I never want to lose again.

546
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,610
Do you trust me?

547
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,710
I won't make you hide again.

548
00:39:37,281 --> 00:39:38,551
I won't make you be afraid...

549
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:41,150
or have nightmares again.

550
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,281
I want to make you smile like you used to.

551
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,221
That's all I want.

552
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,420
Go in.

553
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,891
Aren't motorcycles dangerous?

554
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,360
Not if I wear a helmet and drive safely.

555
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,701
Have you ever ridden one?

556
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,301
Do you want to try? It's the best stress relief.

557

Seung Yoo.

558
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,860
I'm worried about you.

Unfortunately, the other kids can't enjoy this special benefit.

You should be considerate of them...

so they don't feel like they've been deprived.

But don't feel guilty.

You may go. Study hard.

Mr. Han Myung Jin was fired.

He was?

Overnight?

580
00:44:15,491 --> 00:44:17,460
I heard they had an emergency disciplinary hearing.

581
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,960
I guess that was what they decided.

582
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,561
My gosh.

583
00:44:23,031 --> 00:44:24,261

Hey. Isn't that Mr. Han's car?

585
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:29,101
Yes, I think so.

586

What's your problem?

00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:52,061
If I were born with everything that you were,

591
00:44:52,391 --> 00:44:54,960
wealth, brains, and looks, I wouldn't live like you.

592
00:44:55,031 --> 00:44:56,531
I wouldn't rebel like a fool.

593
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,630
I'd be wise and enjoy it.

594
00:44:59,201 --> 00:45:01,230
- Grumpy old fogy. - What?

595
00:45:01,471 --> 00:45:03,440
You think you're a great mom, don't you?

596
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,170
You always ask why I'm not grateful...

597
00:45:05,241 --> 00:45:06,440
and what the problem is,

598
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,281
but how could a good mom not know?

599
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,980
I'll go if you're done.

What's that?

606
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,741
- Let go. - Awesome.

607
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,070
Let go!

608
00:45:39,141 --> 00:45:40,471

I read your paper.

644
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,789
You read the whole thing?

645
00:47:58,659 --> 00:48:00,260
Wasn't that why you sent it?

You may be my son,

You were born different.

655
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:41,599
So I didn't know how to raise you...

656

or how to set an example.

00:48:45,809 --> 00:48:47,639
It was always difficult and confusing.

658
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,749
I wanted to understand at least one sentence in that paper...

659
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:56,479
hoping it might help me understand you.

660
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,550
So I read it with my eyes wide open, but I didn't get a single word.

661
00:49:02,019 --> 00:49:03,019
How's Mom?

662
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:04,990
Is she doing well?

663
00:49:05,059 --> 00:49:06,760
Yes, she's doing well.

664
00:49:08,329 --> 00:49:10,630
You should come home and eat her homemade food.

665
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,539
I cleaned out the room full of trophies.

666
00:49:17,139 --> 00:49:18,539
What did you do with all those trophies?

667
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:20,840
Those trophies became meaningless...

668
00:49:20,909 --> 00:49:22,380
because you were no longer home.

669
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:24,610
So did you throw them all away?

670
00:49:27,309 --> 00:49:29,479
I packed them in a box. They're outside on the balcony.

671
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,829
I'll visit this weekend.

672
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:43,360
Okay. I really hope you do.

673
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,740
I heard you didn't eat lunch.

674
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:56,139
You keep skipping meals. That's not good for your health.

675
00:49:56,209 --> 00:49:57,409
Enough.

676
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:01,749
I'll have a meal sent to your room. Don't forget to eat it.

677
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:03,579
I'm going to check, okay?

678
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:04,650
Gosh.

Have you been well?

681
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,630
I'm here to do my homework.

682
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:23,499
My homework is really difficult.

683
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,740
Can you please help me?

684
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,209
This is the problem.

You look different.

689
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,630
How long have you been living in this neighbourhood?

690
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,130
Why do you want to know?

691
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,070
I didn't think you'd come back.

692
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:28,800
I was surprised to see you.

693
00:51:32,939 --> 00:51:34,039
Why are you back?

694
00:51:36,209 --> 00:51:37,780
Do I need to answer that question?

695
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,050
It's not a difficult question to answer...

696
00:51:41,709 --> 00:51:43,720
compared to the stuff I'm about to ask you.

697
00:51:46,249 --> 00:51:48,519
I saw you with Seung Yoo.

698
00:51:50,459 --> 00:51:53,789
What are you doing with him?

699
00:52:14,849 --> 00:52:16,550
What you're doing is wrong.

700
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:19,420
What exactly are you talking about?

701
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:20,720
I understand...

702
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:24,619
that you need him.

703
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:28,260
I don't know what you do for a living these days,

704
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,300
but you helped Seung Yoo become a renowned mathematician,

705
00:52:32,829 --> 00:52:34,829
and you could always use that to your advantage.

706
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,900
But don't.

707
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,570
Just because your life's a mess,

708
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:43,709
you can't ruin Seung Yoo's bright future too.

709
00:52:47,909 --> 00:52:50,479
And let me tell you something.

710
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:55,420
Back then, I really thought Seung Yoo had feelings for you.

711
00:52:56,059 --> 00:52:59,059
I even thought you guys looked good together.

712
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:02,329
But that's no longer the case.

713
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:06,800
Do you think Seung Yoo still feels the same way about you?

714
00:53:10,999 --> 00:53:15,070
He just probably feels sorry and guilty.

715
00:53:35,659 --> 00:53:38,559
I solved the math question you asked us to solve, Mr. Paik.

716
00:53:39,499 --> 00:53:41,300
Professor Ji helped me.

717
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:43,670
You went to the sanatorium?

I'm sure you understand what I mean.

723
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,789
I hope you don't do anything to get in Seung Yoo's way.

724
00:54:09,459 --> 00:54:10,599
Please.

725
00:54:12,729 --> 00:54:13,729
You're right.

726
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,769
My life's a wreck.

727
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,539
I had a hard time admitting it,

728
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:24,539
but thank you for making me say it out loud.

729
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:27,950
But you see,

730
00:54:29,749 --> 00:54:31,820
I'm not embarrassed about my life.

731
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:35,519
I'm not embarrassed of who I am.

732
00:54:37,289 --> 00:54:39,030
That's because I did nothing wrong...

733
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:41,630
just like how I did nothing wrong back then.

734
00:54:42,499 --> 00:54:45,099
It sounds like you want to blame me.

735
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:51,539
I do think it's a shame.

736
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:55,809
What's with that smile?

737
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,479
I must say,

738
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,780
you turned out exactly how I thought you would.

739
00:55:04,579 --> 00:55:06,889
I really hoped that you'd grow up...

740
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:08,550
to be an adult who knew how to apologize.

741

Ye Rin.

742
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:15,999
It's not a shame.

743
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,030
When you hurt someone,

744
00:55:20,269 --> 00:55:21,700
cause pain,

745
00:55:21,769 --> 00:55:23,939
and ruin that person's life,

746
00:55:26,269 --> 00:55:28,340
the right thing to say is, "I'm sorry."

747
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:31,979
You're supposed to apologize.

748
00:55:35,409 --> 00:55:36,420
I know.

749
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:39,389
This isn't going to change anything.

750
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,389
But...

751
00:55:43,789 --> 00:55:45,459
telling me that it's a shame...

752
00:55:47,189 --> 00:55:48,729
can really change a lot of things.

753
00:55:50,229 --> 00:55:52,499
A lot of things will change...

754
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:54,630
now that you've said that to me.

755
00:55:56,869 --> 00:55:59,470
To be honest, you were always irrelevant to me until now.

756
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,209
You're a smart girl, so I'm sure you understood.

757
00:56:11,479 --> 00:56:14,090
Haven't you been keeping tabs on Ms. Ji Yoon Su?

758
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:19,889
She used to teach math in the suburbs.

759
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:23,829
But I don't know what she's been doing for the past year. I'm sorry.

760
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:24,959
Did you notice anything peculiar...

761
00:56:24,959 --> 00:56:26,030
after Seung Yoo started working here?

762
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:28,300
No, nothing in particular.

763
00:56:29,539 --> 00:56:32,769
By any chance, do you think Mr. Paik had something to do...

764
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,769
with the audit?

765
00:56:35,209 --> 00:56:38,309
Do you think he came here with an ulterior motive?

766
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:42,720
Keep a close eye on Seung Yoo not only at school...

767
00:56:43,050 --> 00:56:44,920
but also outside the school grounds and keep me updated.

768

Why did you look up the answer first?
