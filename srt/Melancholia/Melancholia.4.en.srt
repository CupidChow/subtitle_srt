00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,980
That you are smiling and getting angry.

00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,700
So don't shut your heart.

Don't hide it. Your true self.

Is it all right for me to do that?

00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:57,280
Is it really all right, to show everything?

00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,640
What are you going to do?

13
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,370
Will you continue to be so bullheaded? Make up your mind by tomorrow morning.

14
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,600
We will decide by tomorrow morning

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,050
whether to convene a school violence committee meeting.

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,320
Let's not let it get that far. It's not a big deal.

00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,890

What punk? What punk... who the hell made stuff like this?

24
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:40,160
It was transferred to the Student Department. The punishment will be decided tomorrow morning.

25
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,810
Let me know as soon as the decision is made, understand?

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,480
Yeah.

00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,130

00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,820
That's right.

29
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,470
I'm sorry for leaving like that before. I was so taken aback.

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,150
Kids today, really.

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,180
Just what was he thinking about a teacher?

An aspect of school sometimes makes kids weird.

33
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,780
If it's too difficult for you, I don't mind if you quit school.

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,850
Consider it.

35
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,320
Keep your weekend free. There's a luncheon.

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,020
- With whom? <br> - Vice-Minister Sin.

00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,450
Why should I be there?

38
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,820
The minister will be away when we have our wedding ceremony.

39
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,220
The vice-minister is going to officiate for our ceremony. We should give our greetings.

40
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,000
The officiator? We haven't discussed it.

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,350
Isn't it obvious?

42
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,950
Who else would you ask?

43
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,190
See you later. Lock the door and have a nice rest.

It's sponsored by the AI Research Institute and the research is relevant to the fourth industry.

60
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,830
I chose a subject out of those.

61
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,680
Face recognition technology?

62
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,030
Yes. First, I wrote a draft.

63
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:30,250
All right. I'll look at it. Naturally, you'll have a good experience at the institute,

64
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,380
but I hope you will also read books and go to the movies.

65
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,260
Unexpectedly, many things will arise to think about.

66
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,890
Yes.

67
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,940
Teacher.

68
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,690
Jang Gyu Yeong, apologize to your teacher

69
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,820
and say that such a thing will never happen again.

70
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,540
I apologize. I won't do that again.

71
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:09,540
Yes. I believe you mean what you say and will keep your promise.

72
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,760
Yes, ma'am.

73
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,790
Apologize to Seung Yu, too, Gyu Yeong.

00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,700
I'm sorry.

00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,800
I'm sorry I hit you.

76
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,050
This time I'll overlook it, but just you wait and see.

77
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,080
If it is repeated just once, there will be no mercy.

78
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,560
- Yes, sir. <br> - Yes, sir.

79
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,220
You're dismissed.

80
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,490
Good job.

81
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,690
I finished writing the speech.

82
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,440
Did you?

83
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,530
We decided to end this situation on a positive note.

84
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,920
None of them want to have bullying in their school records.

85
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,860
Make sure all the collage pictures are deleted and that they're not leaked outside.

86
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,750
I'll do that.

87
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,890
Okay! Seong Yu was cleared without penalty points!

88
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,590
- What a relief. I thought it would end badly!<br>- These jerks are the ones at fault!

89
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,960
Baek Seong Yu, that jerk? Is it okay to let him be our school representative?

90
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,260
But why did he overreact like that? By any chance, does he really like the math teacher?

91
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:47,140
That crazy bastard. I will make him kneel before me. Out of my way.

92
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,530
This is apple mango bingsu*, famous in Jeju Island.<br><i>(Korean shaved ice dessert)</i>

93
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,250
This is not edible, so I'll put it aside.

94
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,500
- Such a precious bingsu.<br> - Absolutely.

95
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,200
I've always wanted to give you something precious.

96
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,260
But I keep worrying you.

97
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,700
By the way, about that child, Baek Seong Yu. Didn't he have school violence problems?

98
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,690
Is he still going to the Olympics?

99
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,060
Mrs. Yu.

100
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,570
Ye Rin's goal isn't simply to participate in the Olympics, is it?

101
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,440
Of course not. The goal is to also win.

102
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,800
So, keep your focus on the goal. Don't worry about little things.

103
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,830
Oh, yes.

104
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,380
What is this?

105
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,210
It's her acceptance speech. Have her prepare one along those lines.

106
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,130
Is my Ye Rin being guided by Teacher Ji Yun Su?

107
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,200
Isn't she an intern at the AI Research Institute?

108
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,700
If people know that Ye Rin prepared for a competition at a research institute, it may generate a preferential treatment controversy.

109
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:11,480
So, for all that matters, Ye Rin is preparing for the Olympics at the school?

110
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,300
Teacher Ji Yun Su will have many uses. Be mindful of that.

111
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,190
Your company arrived.

112
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,460
Hello, Vice-Minister.

113
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:29,660
Yes, he contacted me asking me if I had time for lunch. Is it all right if he joins us?

114
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:35,130
Oh, sure. This is Seong Min Jun of the Democratic Party of Korea.

115
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,960
And this is my fiancée.

116
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,790
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Seong Min Jun.

117
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,140
Yes, hello.

118
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,030
- Long time no see, Teacher Ji.<br>- Hello.

119
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,700
So, please have a seat.

120
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,460
I'm sorry for coming uninvited and all of a sudden.

121
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,500
- I heard you were coming, so I wanted to meet you.<br>- Me?

122
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,270
His daughter is a student at Aseong High School.

123
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:16,440
Seong Ye Rin, 2nd year. She is my daughter.

124
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,990
Oh, Ye Rin?

125
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:26,520
This is the manual for the face recognition program we'll present tomorrow. Read carefully the parts you'll explain.

126
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,560
Yes.

127
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,960
Is everything ready for the Jeju Society event tomorrow?

128
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,600
Yes, everything's ready.

129
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,370
Ye Rin, you decided to help with the program presentation?

130
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,260
Yes, I just received the manual.

131
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,530
Right, please do well.

132
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:43,590
Sure, I will do my best.

133
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,360
Now let's see this.

134
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,430
Thanks to you teaching the assemblyman's daughter so well,

135
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,260
we have great news.

136
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,760
I heard she's participating in the International Mathematician Olympics.

137
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,120
Ah, yes.

138
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,140
Thank you for guiding her well.

139
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,460
To be honest,

140
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,540
I saw the speech that Ye Rin has been preparing.

141
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,080
I see.

142
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,630
How was it?

143
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,080
I was surprised.

144
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,540
I couldn't find any flaws.

145
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,140
Assemblyman, with these words, you must feel full even before eating!

146
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,630
You're flattering me so much, I don't know what to do.

147
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,390
If I tell you more honestly,

148
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,090
it's beyond the level of a high schooler,

149
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,450
and feels like it's been touched up by a professional.

150
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,130
Ah.

151
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,570
As expected,

152
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,540
you are correct.

153
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,270
Luckily, we were offered an opportunity,

154
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,330
and we were able to get the advice of a related professional.

155
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:57,390
Of course, we only got advice. Ye Rin personally wrote everything from start to finish.

156
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,570
For sure,

157
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,350
we didn't gain extra help because you were lacking.

158
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,080
Of course!

159
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,230
When you have such an exceptional teacher.

160
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,170
Let's cheer.

161
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,830
Thank you for the meal.

162
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,230
Of course.

163
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,250
Shall we play golf next time?

164
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,420
Yes, of course. I will be the one to pay then.

165
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,080
Then,

166
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,650
good luck with your marriage.

167
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,240
I'll congratulate you both on your future

168
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,920
in my speech as the officiant.

169
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,090
Again, congratulations on your marriage.

170
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,610
Thank you.

171
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,090
Then, take care.

172
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,700
I will be take my leave.

173
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,360
The assemblyman told me to take this to your car.

174
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,090
It is an apple and mango bingsu* from Jeju, <br> <i> (*shaved ice dessert) </i>

175
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,120
and he said to eat it right away or store it in the freezer.

176
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,870
You were uncomfortable, right?

177
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,190
Just try to understand.

178
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:22,960
It's because the minister and Assemblyman Seong are so close.

179
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,030
I hope this won't happen again in the future.

180
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,200
You said there's one more representative for the IMO from Aseong High School, right?

181
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,790
Who is it?

182
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,290
A student called Baek Seung Yu.

183
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,680
You're personally preparing him?

184
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,470
Don't...

185
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,790
put so much effort in him.

186
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,610
What do you mean?

187
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,120
Actually, the middle and high school division

188
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,630
was set up by Assemblyman Seong. <br> - What?

189
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,180
The one who made all this happen by linking the Ministry of Education and the Mathematician Committee

190
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,260
was Assemblyman Seong.

191
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,250
Are you, perhaps,

192
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,170
saying that the winner has already been decided?

193
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,340
That's not it, right?

194
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,430
You knew all this and still came?

195
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,300
You don't have to win and receive a prize for it to be considered meaningful.

196
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:23,830
- Even by just participating, most students will— <br> - This is making other students just accessories.

197
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,590
This isn't a good lesson for Ye Rin either.

198
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,850
How could someone who's in the Education Committee

199
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,600
agree with something like that? <br> - What do you mean 'agree?'

200
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,920
Is there really a reason to say no when he's creating a competition with good intentions?

201
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,320
<i> Eco Bag </i>

202
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:54,490
<i> Teacher Ji Yun Su </i>

203
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,380
Don't be so rash.

204
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,690
There are many international college professors amongst the judges. Do you think he really coerced all of them?

205
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,210
Thanks for the information.

206
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,150
If that's how things are, I have to prepare.

207
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,030
- Yun Su. <br> - Sure.

208
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,740
Winning or losing, that's not the important thing.

209
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,980
However,

210
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,680
I don't want to cause them pain through an unfair competition.

211
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,770
Send that back.

212
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,090
It's just bingsu.

213
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,980
- Is there a need to go that far?

214
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,000
Do you really not know or... No.

215
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,530
Let me off. I'm going to walk.

216
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,750
<i> Teacher Ji Yun Su </i>

217
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,830
Seung Yu!

218
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,240
It was 1+1.

219
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,000
Now I feel a little refreshed.

220
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,580
Are things going well with your speech preparation?

221
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,750
No.

222
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,410
I still haven't written even one line.

223
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,320
Can you be so carefree when it's a once in a lifetime chance?

224
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,720
That's why I got permission.

225
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,200
For what?

226
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,580
Jeju Island.

227
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,560
But it's for only one day.

228
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,490
I'll go tomorrow on the earliest plane and come back at night.

229
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,130
He really gave you permission?

230
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,500
Yes.

231
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,750
In return,

232
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,790
he said to make sure I get the prize.

233
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,090
Baek Seung Yu.

234
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,790
You can do well, right?

235
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,680
You can work hard, right?

236
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,520
Let's try it.

00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,580
Yes.

00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,540
What are you packing? Are you going there to have fun?

239
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,720
What do you mean? Clothes to meet the Board, clothes for meals,

240
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,670
and clothes for the plane. You have to wear outfits like this, at least!

241
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,330
Isn't it pretty?

242
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,500
Oh right! Shoes.

Ye Rin, are your preparations going well?

245
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,420
I had lunch with Teacher Ji Yun Su today.

246
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,290
I told her about you preparing for the competition separately, so don't worry

247
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,390
and just focus hard.

248
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,960
What about Baek Seung Yu?

249
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,770
What? Why?

250
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,940
What is he preparing?

251
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,330
I don't know. She didn't really say anything.

252
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,100
Don't worry about him.

253
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,440
Your dad set everything up already, so don't worry.

00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,550
- Are you ready? <br> - Yes.

317
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:53,120
I'm buying Hanwoo* beef for everyone. Eat your fill.<br> <i>(*Special Korean beef)</i>

318
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,030
Thank you, we'll enjoy it.

319
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:59,360
It's an honor to get all the alcohol to drink from you

320
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,920
No. I feel more honored. Please take care of my Ye Rin.

321
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,330
Don't worry. Let's all raise our glasses for a toast.

322
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:10,200
Should we? Cheers to tonight!

323
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,250
Cheers!

324
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:17,480
Clink! My pretty.

325
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,900
Ye Rin is extremely smart with good sense. Don't worry.

326
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,430
If someone wants to be loved, they must have one of them.

327
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:28,400
Either be smart or have good sense.

328
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,780
Eat a lot. Ye Rin, eat this too.

329
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,930
I'll go purchase our tickets.

330
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:45,390
<i>Visit ticket office first</i>

331
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,820
When I look at Van Gogh's paintings, I am reminded of my father.

332
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:15,480
Should I say that being abandoned far from the world resembled loneliness?

333
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,150
I looked up Professor Ji Hyeon Woo.

334
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,920
Is that so?

335
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:29,280
The problem that professor gave me back then, which I haven't solved yet,

336
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,570
It's a proof that he used as an additional theorem in his thesis, isn't it?

337
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,890
You're right.

338
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:42,620
After the fact that the proof was defective was revealed,

339
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,940
the thesis which he spent over ten years writing became all in vain.

340
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:50,470
He spent several more years trying to fill in the holes in the theory.

341
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,890
Did he fill them?

342
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,990
What do you think happened?

343
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,130
It's hard to guess.

344
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:27,920
A thesis which took ten years to write was all for nothing because of a small flaw.

345
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,700
If he spent several more years to correct the flaw,

346
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,200
how would he have felt?

347
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,920
So...

348
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,630
Is that the reason you said,

349
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,460
not to fall in love with that problem.

350
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,630
Concentrate but don't be shackled.

351
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:57,960
Like it but if you don't get obsessed, you will do it.

352
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,590
You can do math.

353
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,630
<i>Will it happen the way I want?</i>

354
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:18,540
<i>To fall in love or not fall in love with something.</i>

355
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:30,060
How was the exhibition? Did you like it?

356
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,840
Yes.

357
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,180
I'll come back after washing my hands.

358
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,860
Okay.

359
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,690
What are you listening to?

360
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,470
What are you listening to?

361
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:40,290
♫ <i>I live filling the time in my heart </i> ♫

362
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:46,770
♫ <i>You, who have grown as time passed,</i> ♫

363
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:55,700
♫ <i>became my flower. Today even more so</i> ♫

364
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:01,500
♫ <i>to you, I am thankful.</i> ♫

365
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:09,390
♫ <i>My love is a flower in your hands</i> ♫

366
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:16,360
♫ <i>It is our time.</i> ♫

367
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,220
<i>(Assemblyman Seong Min Jun) <br>Conclusion of the conference with the Ministry of Education. Successful completion.</i>

368
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,290
<i>Good job</i>

369
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,980
<i>What about there?</i>

370
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,450
<i>Here too, successful</i>

371
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,250
<i>comparatively</i>

372
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:11,600
You did well. Thanks to you, things went smoothly.

373
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,100
From time to time in the future too, I will ask you. Stop dragging the old man around.

374
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,490
Are you in a rush?

375
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,790
Because I can see the difference in performance between the international middle school and Aseong High,

376
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:26,900
- are you running away? <br> - A performance difference?

377
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,330
You need to be compared to first place.

378
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,230
Eonni, do you know that?

379
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:39,220
Our school and Aseong are on the north and south of Teheran Street in Gangna.

380
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,690
Although the south Teheran Aseong parents will stake their lives of a good university

381
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,450
to make their childen professionals like themselves,

382
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:51,380
the people who live in the north will pass the professions to their children like property, not occupations.

383
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:56,110
- So what? <br> - I'm not saying I don't care about education.

384
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,450
If I pass down my land, generations and generations will make a good living.

385
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:02,580
Eonni, why does it matter which university you want to go to?

386
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:10,000
There's a lot of worlds up there that you don't know about, Eonni.

387
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:16,190
Don't delude yourself. Neither you nor I are from the north.

388
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,690
You know it's not our father's assets that we have to inherit but our occupations, right?

389
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:24,100
Aren't you president of the foundation?

390
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:29,450
- Us? <br>= Ah, Not us.

391
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,660
One of us.

392
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:53,570
Please get the stuff out of the trunk. Let's go.

393
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,500
You did a great job, my pretty.

394
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:02,150
It's not late yet, right? I'll stop by the restroom.

395
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:33,760
Ye Rin, what happened? Are you fine?

396
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,410
Let's go. It's late. Come.

397
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,830
There's still time left. Let's go drink a cup of coffee.

398
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:42,320
Coffee at this hour? <br> Ah, the smell of alcohol.

399
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,210
Oh, why. I had just one glass of wine though. What smell—

400
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:49,650
I'm really tired.

401
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,140
Thank you.

402
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,690
You did well. Do you think it'll be of help?

403
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,870
Yes, I'll go prepare.

404
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:24,970
Okay. If there's anything you're curious about ask away. See you tomorrow at school.

405
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,630
Get back.

406
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,440
- Good bye. <br> - Bye.

407
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:41,610
How was the trip to Jeju Island last weekend?

408
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:46,390
How did you..?<br> It's not good if I don't know what happens in Aseong High School.

409
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:50,580
I told Seung Yu's teacher Kim Jin Hui about it. She must have told you.

410
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,970
I am sorry. I went on an official business trip. I needed to be there.

411
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,900
Due to the schedule I didn't have time to inform you.

412
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,100
In the future, report on your extracurricular activities and then go.

413
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,690
And...

414
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:05,360
was there anything to be cautious about?

415
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,880
What are you talking about?

416
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,190
Our Aseong kids are impressionable and sensitive.

417
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:16,130
If a teacher's affection is focused on one child, they will institinctively sense that.

418
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:22,790
Was it necessary to make a pointless fuss over even Gyu Yeong's behavior a few days ago?

419
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,730
I attended an exhibition on Jeju Island which was perfect for student Baek Seung Yu's speech topic.

420
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:31,520
For more details, you can go through my report.

421
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,030
This is my content review of Song Hye Rin's speech.

422
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:39,250
- Then... <br> - Teacher.

423
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:46,320
Don't teach the kids about flawed fairness.

424
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,720
In a society, that's not going to be fair, such teachings

425
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,460
will only make the kids losers, who blame the world.

426
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,590
<i>For once, take care of yourself.</i>

427
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:07,440
<i>I wonder how this kid developed by your tenacity will turn out.</i>

428
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:21,690
Don't be scared. Straighten your shoulders. You guys can do well too.

429
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:26,140
Oh, you're here?

430
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,180
Seung Yu told he was coming too.

431
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,740
Yes.

432
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,700
I haven't seen your speech final draft.

433
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:37,900
I've attached comments but you wrote very well.

434
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,950
Thank you.

435
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,780
Isn't it hard for you?

436
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,970
Because the subject is difficult for high school students to handle,

437
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,650
I thought it might be beyond your capacity.

438
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:54,940
There was never a time math was easy for me.

439
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,560
I'm different from Seung Yu.

440
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,800
What? It's not like that,

441
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,460
Teacher, you adore Seung Yu, don't you?

442
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,060
Such a kid with innate talent.

443
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,090
If I were a teacher, I'd adore him too.

444
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,430
I'm jealous.

445
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:20,620
I liked math but I didn't have Seung Yu's talent.

446
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,920
Then you must know very well,

447
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,960
how I'd feel competing with a kid like that.

448
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:32,590
Honestly, I don't want you two facing off against each other.

449
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,360
The Math Olympiad is not a competition, but a festival.

450
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:43,620
When you look back, you might think "I should have had fun back then".

451
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:52,130
If you're done, I'll take my leave.

452
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:56,570
Okay, Ye Rin. See you tomorrow.

453
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:58,140
Okay.

454
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:08,250
Teacher, can you look through what I've prepared so far?

455
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,920
Okay, go ahead.

456
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:23,770
An artificial intelligence computer can do many things.

457
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,190
That's it.

458
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,630
It's good.

459
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,480
It's a lucky charm.

460
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:29,120
<i>Calculus</i>

461
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,960
Calculus?

462
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,820
Right. The pebbles. This small stone is the source of envy.

463
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:40,160
This small stone could be the source of a spring.

464
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:44,960
If you are nervous, hold this tightly.

465
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,100
I will.

466
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,630
<i>2017 International Math Olympiad</i>

467
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:09,970
You're checked in as participants. Here's your name tag and participants' handout.

468
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:14,790
- What time do I have to be at the venue? <br> - It starts at 2 p.m. so I'll see you in front of the venue at 1:20.

469
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:18,380
Before that, visit exhibitions and lectures that you want to observe.

470
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,890
Isn't it exciting to observe the Mathematicians' Olympiad?

471
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,330
Then, I'll see you later.

472
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,760
Oh!

473
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:41,340
Professor Mueller. Director of the Algebraic Geometry Academy, Professor Adolph Mueller.

474
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,320
I registered for his lecture.

475
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,490
Oh, me too. Let's go.

476
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,750
Oh, you're here.

477
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,820
She told me to be in front of the event room by 1:20 pm.

478
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:03,690
Is that so? Then you can practice till then. Here.

479
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:10,120
Dad is concerned about this competition. You know that, right?

480
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,970
There are four cases as shown in slide here.

481
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,160
Vice Principal Sir, hello. <br>The Director has arrived there with the Principal.

482
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,000
Come to the competition venue quickly.<br>Yes, I understand.

483
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,900
Seung Yu.

484
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,820
I will go first.

485
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,780
- I'll see you in front of the venue in 20 minutes. <br> - Yes.

486
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:19,240
That's right! Min Jae!

487
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,560
It is you.

488
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,350
It's been a long time!

489
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:28,640
I was just wondering, but... it is you!

490
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,840
Who is he?

491
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,930
At our university, we had a 10 year old mathematician.

492
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,050
10 years old? At MIT?

493
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:35,920
At MIT.

494
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,260
He was the smartest guy in our department.

495
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,570
Amazing!

496
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,360
He's a very special kid.

497
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,970
Very special child.

498
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:57,380
<i> As expected... you're really special. </i>

499
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,780
- He's the one who solved all the equations, isn't he? <br> - That's the one!

500
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,720
He came out in a mathematical journal.

501
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,020
I read that article. This kid's a genius!

502
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,600
Min Jae. Are you okay? Min Jae.

503
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,670
<i> Min Jae </i>

504
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:12,340
<i> You're special. </i>

505
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,510
Min Jae, are you okay?

506
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,570
Min Jae!

507
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:31,060
<i> Min Jae. You're special. </i>

508
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:34,630
<i> I can't become like you. </i>

509
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,340
<i> Forever. </i>

510
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,830
<i> As expected, you're really special. </i>

511
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:41,420
<i> You're special. </i>

512
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,270
<i> I can't become like you.</i>

513
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:46,730
<i> Ever. </i>

514
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:10,300
<i>So we can calculate the image of D2 like this. </i>

515
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,030
<i> And therefore, we can get this. </i>

516
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:15,480
<i> What about the edge map of the spectral sequence? </i>

517
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:19,340
<i> Let's see. The edge map... </i>

518
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,010
<i> Hyung! Hyung... </i>

519
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,670
Hyung.

520
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,510
<i> Where are you? </i>

521
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:31,320
Is your father healthy?

522
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,720
Thanks to you, he is healthy.

523
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,310
Soon, the plan to train talents in Science and and Technology will be released.

524
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:42,190
We will increase the number of new departments in science and engineering schools and expand budgets.

525
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:45,060
The student representatives here today will be the future researchers.

526
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:49,880
Aseong High School is especially known for having talented individuals.

527
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,300
I trust your preparations went well?

528
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,890
You created such a rare opportunity for us. How could we not prepare well?

529
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:58,900
Our Aseong High School is preparing to reform into a Mathematics Gifted School,

530
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:02,380
so we prepared for this competition with all we had.

531
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,360
There they are.

532
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:11,110
This is the instructor for the Aseong High School representatives, Teacher Ji Yun Su.

533
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:15,590
I heard about you. You are our Administrative Officer's fiancé.

534
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:17,340
Congratulations.

535
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,050
Thank you.

536
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:22,520
I will take the students and prepare.

537
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:27,980
This is Aseong High School's representative, Seong Ye Rin.

538
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,590
Ye Rin, greet him.

539
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:33,600
This is Minister Jeong Hee Ryung and Vice Minister Shin Seung Jae of the Ministry of Education.

540
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,020
Hello. I am Seong Ye Rin.

541
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:40,060
I heard Assemblyman Seong Min Joon's child was going to be participating in the competition. I guess you are her.

542
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,370
I will watch your presentation well.

543
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:42,760
Thank you.

544
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,330
Ye Rin, let's go.

545
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:50,890
Yun Su.

546
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,020
I'll watch the competition well. Call me when it's done.

547
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,540
Isn't Aseong High School standing out too much?

548
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:00,090
I didn't know you would all be together.

549
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:04,150
It's just greeting them, so don't worry about it. Good luck.

550
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,610
Have you seen Seung Yu?

551
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,360
He was going towards the lecture hall.

552
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,230
Okay.

553
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:21,130
Ye Rin, go to the waiting room first.

554
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:22,890
Yes.

555
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:05,520
Seung Yu. Where are you?

556
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,230
Please...

557
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,090
What? I can't hear you very well.

558
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,040
I'm sorry.

559
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:20,400
I can't do this.

560
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,030
Where are you?

561
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:28,020
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Teacher.

562
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:34,350
Where are you right now? I'll go to you.

563
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:27,620
<i> Melancholia. Doesn't that mean 'depression?' </i>

564
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:31,940
It means heaviness and the feeling of being dragged down,

565
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:38,140
but if you keep sinking to the ground,

566
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:41,460
<i> you will eventually hit the ground. </i>

567
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:47,250
<i> I could say it brings about a state of aimlessness? </i>

568
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:51,580
<i>There's a light coming through here. </i>

569
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:02,600
<i> Once you get emptied out like that, you start dreaming of new beginnings. </i>

570
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:14,870
<i>You start to see things you didn't see previously</i>

571

Young Adult Mathematics Speech Contest

573
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,920
<i> Will you promise me one thing? </i>

574
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:57,330
<i> Don't fall in love with this problem. </i>

575
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:04,940
<i> A mathematician's life doesn't mean becoming happy by solving a problem. </i>

576
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:08,200
<i> Or that you become unhappy because you can't solve it. </i>

577
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:14,380
<i> Then why do mathematicians keep solving and proving things? </i>

578
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,230
<i> While they solve the problem, </i>

579
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:23,790
<i> the trembling, excitement, </i>

580
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:25,790
<i> anxiety. </i>

581
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:42,690
<i> Whether they get the answer or not, </i>

582
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:45,810
<i> wouldn't it be for those moments you can get only when you're immersed in the problem? </i>

583
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:54,970
Seung Yu!

584
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,650
Are you okay?

585
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:13,650
I solved it.

586
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,150
I got an answer for that problem.

587
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:27,970
Okay Seung Yu, but did something--? <br> Later,

588
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:30,910
Later, I'll explain everything.

589
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:33,290
Right now, let's go.

590
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:36,810
Gayoung High School, Jang Yu Jin. <br> Present.

591
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,980
Aseong High School, Song Ye Rin. <br> Present.

592
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,360
Aseong High School, Baek Seung Yu.

593
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:45,350
Aseong High School, Baek Seung Yu?

594
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,270
Aseong High School, Baek Seung Yu is here.

595
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:51,080
Sit over there please.

596
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,310
Good job. Great, actually.

597
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:18,810
Let's go in.

598
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,890
You go ahead first.

599
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:22,600
Ah, okay.

600
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,570
Ah, did you arrive?

601
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:29,410
Yes, it'll be starting soon.

602
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,850
Let's go in.

603
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:20,270
Teacher No Jung Ah has come already. Let's greet her together.

604
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:22,030
Not necessary.

605
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:25,940
Teacher.

606
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,680
Ye Rin's mom, you're here.

607
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,280
I'm more nervous. Ye Rin, will perform well, won't she?

608
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:34,120
Don't worry. I saw Ye Rin earlier. Her condition was good.

609
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,300
Oh, is that so? Then it's a relief.

610
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,720
I'll see you when it ends.

611
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:45,590
It looks exactly the same.

612
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,790
Mm? What is?

613
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:51,080
Nothing, you bought this for me from Italy, right?

614
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:54,670
Teacher Noh Jung Ah's handbag has a similar one too.

615
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:57,250
They are just similar.

616
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:59,690
This was costly though.

617
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:07,550
Is it okay to sit here?

618
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:10,290
What's up with you?

619
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:14,600
I came to see the Aseong High School kids. You keep raving about them,

620
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,990
and I've taken an interest.

621

Young Adult Math Speech competition

623
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:49,340
will start now.

624
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:59,910
Artificial Intelligence, Internet of things,

625
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:05,830
Big Data etc., the cutting edge IT skills that will bring forth the 4th Industrial revolution,

626
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:09,370
are developed with Maths as the foundation.

627
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,550
Self-driving is an important skill from 4th Industrial revolution.

628
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:18,150
Using Mathematical principles to arrive accurately at the destination,

629
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:21,950
like Bayer's theorem, is an example.

630
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:25,840
Oh!

631
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,000
What you're seeing is a radio wave operated...

632
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,280
It looks like fun.

633
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,830
Drone.

634
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:34,490
To carry out this Vertical Takeoff and Landing, its Center of gravity should be positioned correctly.

635
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:36,420
This is no joke.

636
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:40,640
Archimedes said that Maths,

637
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,880
Aseong High School, Song Ye Rin, come out. <br> <i>a car that moves without its driver</i>

638
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:53,570
Sure.

639
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:57,420
<i>talking robots, cities managed by Big-data</i>

640
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:02,220
<i>and the likes of it can make the future we imagined come true.</i>

641
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:04,610
<i>Moving on, the next participant is</i>

642
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:08,390
Aseong High School student Song Ye Rin.

643
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:20,920
Hello, I'm Song Ye Rin, a sophomore at Aseong High School.

644
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:26,470
For international events, I prepared presentation in English today.

645
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:30,620
Don't worry. I've got subtitles too.

646
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:36,330
It's the face of actress Yoo Hye Mi.

647
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:38,970
Let me mark a dot on this beautiful face.

648
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:42,980
We can identify the outline of this face by linking these dots.

649
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:46,310
Also, it's called Delaunay's Triangulation.

650
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:50,380
It's the basic principle of face recognition program.

651
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:58,330
It's used in many technologies such as Face ID, Security camera, unmanned systems and others.

652
01:01:58,330 --> 01:02:01,860
Therefore, Mathematics is the key that,

653
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:04,400
Freaking awesome. <br> <i>opens the Fourth Industrial revolution's door.</i>

654
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:08,010
It's over.

655
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:12,750
Aseong High School, Baek Seung Yu, come out.

656
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:36,150
The next participant.

657
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:40,580
Aseong High School student Baek Seung Yu.

658
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:02,310
AI computers write novels.

659
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:04,570
It also composes music.

660
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,770
It even wins against humans in a game of GO.

661
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:13,260
AI can make many things possible,

662
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:17,280
and the things it can do is limitless, they say.

663
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:22,800
Can AI really outshine humans and have no boundaries?

664
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:27,560
The stars in the night sky, are they finite or infinite?

665
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,810
It's said that the stars in the universe are finite, but

666
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:36,000
we can count the stars in this painting from where we stand.

667
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:42,630
This light, is it finite or infinite?

668
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:45,720
It's said, the number of electrons existing in the universe, as a whole, is finite,

669
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,050
if I pick a day and count these electrons, is it worth it?

670
01:03:48,050 --> 01:03:51,430
What is this, all of a sudden, about catching clouds?

671
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:56,450
But I, saw no boundaries in this picture.

672
01:03:56,450 --> 01:04:01,310
The stars in this painting, drawn by Vincent Van Gogh in 1889,

673
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:06,550
100 years later now and 1000 years into the future too,

674
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:09,650
can move the hearts of people, forever.

675
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:16,090
He lived a limited life but his work carried an immeasurable skill with it.

676
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:22,030
I put out a question earlier, whether AI has no limits?

677
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:26,330
My answer is, Artificial Intelligence,

678
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:32,290
can remarkably function within the information and data input into it, by us humans.

679
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:58,960
AI which uses limited information as its base,

680
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,900
can never come close to being limitless.

681
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:09,160
But... it's different for humans.

682
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:20,430
Giving the skill of creativity and imagination to AI, is the work cut out for us.

683
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:24,470
Like Cantor, who established set theory on the concept of no limits, solved numerous conundrums <br> <i>Cantor's theory of infinite sets</i>

684
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:28,370
and made remarkable developments in Mathematics,

685
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:47,650
we can dream a dream with no limits,

686
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:51,630
and with liberty,

687
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:56,730
broaden our horizons.

688
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:16,890
I wish you'd like it but not obsess over it,

689
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:20,680
when it comes to Maths.

690
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:27,840
I want you to be free.

691
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:34,550
Becoming limitless, is not far into the future.

692
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:39,430
Right now,

693
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:44,890
it's up to us.

694
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:52,740
<i>Is it up to me and what I want?</i>

695
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:57,580
to fall or to not fall for something.

696
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:06,650
♫ <i>My love is a flower in your hand</i> ♫

697
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:12,950
♫ <i>Our times</i> ♫

698
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:24,690
I felt deafened and couldn't hear properly, but I could hear your voice clearly, teacher.

699
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:27,810
We're in big trouble. Some reporter stopped by this afternoon.

700
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:30,630
Looks like teacher, you want to make this a big deal?

701
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,640
I wish to make things right.

702
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,310
That teacher, Ji Hyun Su, when did she give an interview like that!

703
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:37,600
Then you stand aside, keep your promise.

704
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,450
I don't think I can keep that promise anymore.

705
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:40,530
Teacher!

706
01:07:40,530 --> 01:07:42,350
What are you going to do about that teacher, Ji Hyun Su?

707
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:44,860
If you cross the line, then I can't help it either.

708
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,550
I see everything.

709
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:48,990
You can't hide that feeling, can you?

710
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:56,080
