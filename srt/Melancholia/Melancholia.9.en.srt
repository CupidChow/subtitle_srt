00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:41,097
I'd like to check the CCTV footage inside the school library...

4

from around 4:20pm to 6:30pm on September 14.

5
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:44,527
Just a second.

6
00:00:52,106 --> 00:00:53,676
It's me, Yoon Su.

7
00:00:54,407 --> 00:00:56,477
Can we meet right now?

8
00:01:22,436 --> 00:01:23,436
Yoon Su.

9
00:01:33,846 --> 00:01:34,846
It's been a long time.

10
00:01:37,647 --> 00:01:38,686
Have you been well?

11
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:41,457
Did you follow me here?

12
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,626
Yes. Kind of. I'm sorry.

13
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,856
I must've startled you.

14
00:01:50,796 --> 00:01:52,266
Can we talk?

15
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:54,466
I have nothing to say to you.

16
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:56,966
I do.

17
00:01:59,337 --> 00:02:00,537
Yoon Su, wait.

18
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:02,507
I...

19
00:02:06,246 --> 00:02:07,546
She says she has nothing to say to you.

20
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:18,757
You came here to see him?

21
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:21,327
Were you in touch?

22
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:24,726
Since when? Recently?

23
00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:26,536
Or all along?

24
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,196
What are you doing?

25
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:35,307
- Go inside. - You go inside.

26
00:02:48,957 --> 00:02:51,357
- What is it you have to say? - I wonder.

27
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,927
I don't even remember what I came here to say.

28
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,596
What are you thinking?

29
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:04,137
- Why are you and him... - Must I...

30
00:03:05,307 --> 00:03:06,376
explain that?

31
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,876
Must I explain, then?

32
00:03:08,837 --> 00:03:11,506
What your life became because of that punk?

33
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:13,346
What's wrong with my life?

34
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,547
Whatever the case, it's none of your business now.

35
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:22,017
I don't know how you found me.

36
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:24,457
But stop following me.

37
00:03:25,387 --> 00:03:26,696
Don't do any background checks on me either.

38
00:03:29,827 --> 00:03:30,966
How do you...

39
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:34,137
not know any shame?

40
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,436
I haven't seen you in four years and this what you're like?

41
00:03:38,506 --> 00:03:39,837
I don't believe it.

42
00:03:43,077 --> 00:03:44,307
You won't even explain?

43
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:46,277
It isn't any of my business now.

44
00:03:47,147 --> 00:03:49,216
But still, you'd better act with caution.

45
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:53,686
If you had from the start, this would never have happened.

46
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:51,747
- Are you all right? - Si An.

47
00:04:53,147 --> 00:04:54,676
I saw her live presentation.

48
00:04:55,986 --> 00:04:57,817
How will the school handle it?

49
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,757
We haven't decided yet.

50
00:04:59,957 --> 00:05:02,856
Both students say the other copied their work.

51
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:04,926
We're looking into that.

52
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:07,296
Do you know when she borrowed Ji Na's laptop?

53
00:05:07,356 --> 00:05:09,197
The 14th, Tuesday.

54
00:05:09,897 --> 00:05:12,027
She showed me her first draft the day before.

55
00:05:12,096 --> 00:05:13,596
I'll make sure she isn't wronged.

56
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:15,236
Don't worry too much.

57
00:05:15,296 --> 00:05:16,306
How?

58
00:05:18,306 --> 00:05:19,507
Do you have a plan?

59
00:05:21,837 --> 00:05:23,747
If you don't, I'll sort it out my way.

60
00:05:23,947 --> 00:05:24,947
"Your way"?

61
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:26,877
Don't tell Si An we met.

62
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:28,616
You can't even tell me...

63
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:30,747
what you're thinking and what you'll do?

64
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:44,197
Let me.

65
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:46,197
Don't you trust me?

66
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,366
Why should I trust you?

67
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,387
My gosh.

68
00:06:13,426 --> 00:06:14,596
What are you doing, Ji Na?

69
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,997
- Where do I stab it? - What?

70
00:06:23,606 --> 00:06:25,306
You said you stabbed if you were annoyed.

71
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:27,337
I want to do that too.

72
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:31,207
You're crazy.

73
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:37,046
- Are you afraid of me. - Yes. I am.

74
00:06:37,986 --> 00:06:39,156
You shouldn't be.

75
00:06:39,887 --> 00:06:41,716
You should be grateful.

76
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:45,027
Others look down on you because you're not competition.

77
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:49,267
But I at least considered you competition.

78
00:06:54,437 --> 00:06:55,567
Aren't you grateful?

79
00:07:02,647 --> 00:07:03,947
Remember your place.

80
00:07:34,106 --> 00:07:36,207
Are you sure you're maintaining...

81
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:38,777
the honour and dignity of this school?

82
00:07:39,317 --> 00:07:41,476
- What? - I didn't steal anything.

83
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:44,247
I didn't steal the watch or the assignment.

84
00:08:08,837 --> 00:08:09,877
Hello, sir.

85
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:12,616
An orientation?

86
00:08:12,676 --> 00:08:14,317
Yes, she'd like to meet first.

87
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:19,356
The thing is, the tutor made a rare request...

88
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,786
to meet you in person.

89
00:08:22,957 --> 00:08:25,527
- I would like that. - How about lunch tomorrow?

90
00:08:25,587 --> 00:08:27,527
Let's meet at 12 noon.

91
00:08:27,596 --> 00:08:29,796
I'll text you a decent location.

92
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:34,596
I will think positively of the offer you made before.

93
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:38,567
Then we should meet as well in the near future.

94
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,176
I'll be in touch.

95
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:05,227
Tomorrow noon, Principal Noh Jung Ah.

96
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,497
Come to this location.

97
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:20,316
Must I explain, then?

98
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:23,046
What your life became because of that punk?

99
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,257
Unlike Yoon Su,

100
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:03,727
you were protected from the aftermath...

101
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:06,056
not because you were good at math.

102
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:08,326
It was because you were a minor at the time.

103
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:11,497
If you go any further, you can make no excuse.

104
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:14,137
Are you saying that for my sake?

105
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:15,497
No.

106
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:17,336
It's a warning.

107
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,777
Stay out of Yoon Su's life.

108
00:10:21,836 --> 00:10:23,576
Please, don't come around again.

109
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:26,517
What right do you have?

110
00:10:28,017 --> 00:10:29,387
You did nothing when you did,

111
00:10:29,446 --> 00:10:30,786
and now you have no right.

112
00:10:32,117 --> 00:10:33,156
Also,

113
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,956
you can say whatever you want to me,

114
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:38,586
but don't talk to her like that.

115
00:10:40,696 --> 00:10:41,757
What?

116
00:10:42,926 --> 00:10:44,627
Aren't we in the same shoes?

117
00:10:44,997 --> 00:10:46,296
Back then and now too,

118
00:10:47,796 --> 00:10:49,166
you're nothing to her.

119
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:53,176
Like you said, I was a minor then, but not anymore.

(Myun Yeok Gong Bang)

121
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:23,566
It's nice and hot in here.

122
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:27,306
Ye Rin, your skin is so rough.

123
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:30,806
Let out some sweat and detox, okay?

124
00:11:36,117 --> 00:11:37,147
This is nice.

125
00:11:37,786 --> 00:11:39,757
- Let me see. - No.

126

Mom, wait here for a bit.

127
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:45,027
What? Okay. Don't say I'm here.

128
00:11:45,227 --> 00:11:46,727
Bring your head forward.

129
00:11:46,796 --> 00:11:48,027
- My face looks bigger. - It doesn't.

130

My gosh.

Hi, Ye Rin.

133

What's going on here? Are you...

134
00:11:58,507 --> 00:12:01,777
You're right. We are more than friends.

135
00:12:03,946 --> 00:12:08,046
Ye Rin. Can you keep it a secret for a while?

136
00:12:08,117 --> 00:12:11,316
Yes, please. So Jung isn't ready yet.

137
00:12:11,387 --> 00:12:13,056
- I'm embarrassed. - Okay.

138
00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:17,426
I moved. Who's coming to the housewarming?

139
00:12:17,456 --> 00:12:19,357
Gyu Yeong moved out.

140
00:12:19,426 --> 00:12:20,556
He's having a housewarming.

141
00:12:20,627 --> 00:12:22,627
- Should we go? - Of course.

142
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:23,967
You'll go too, right?

143
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:25,796
- Should I invite Seung Yoo? - Yes.

144
00:12:25,897 --> 00:12:26,967
- Should I? - Yes.

145

You have a new number, right?

00:12:28,637 --> 00:12:29,637
Put it in.

This way.

Sorry, I'm late.

154

Are you by yourself?

155
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:22,777
Yes, I just got a call.

156
00:14:22,847 --> 00:14:24,546
Something unavoidable came up.

00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:39,127
Choi Si An?

158
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:42,497
The clinic instructor is her supporter?

159
00:14:42,497 --> 00:14:43,607
Yes.

160
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:47,306
I heard something unfortunate occurred yesterday.

161
00:14:47,806 --> 00:14:50,777
She was very upset after hearing what happened.

162
00:14:52,477 --> 00:14:54,147
What a coincidence.

163
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:57,987
We're investigating the matter.

164
00:14:58,046 --> 00:15:00,357
Why don't you resolve it amicably?

165
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,027
If you take good care of Si An,

166
00:15:03,086 --> 00:15:07,857

Mr. Paik brought us a bunch of math tools.

Yes, I am.

Stay out of mine and stop lingering around me.

That's right. I have something for you. Hold on.

I planned to give it to you the next time I saw you.

I need to talk to you about something first.

- Go ahead. - Ever since the ivy league scandal,

Just do as I say.

00:20:36,957 --> 00:20:39,657
First, establish a foundation.

One that helps talented but poor students.

254

A non profit.

255
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:45,167
A scholarship foundation?

256
00:20:45,227 --> 00:20:48,136
I'll get the approval from the Ministry of Education.

257
00:20:48,737 --> 00:20:51,407
All you have to do is prepare the documents.

258
00:20:52,507 --> 00:20:55,106
The foundation is for laundering bribe money.

259
00:20:55,507 --> 00:20:57,207
Parents donate to the foundation.

260
00:20:57,806 --> 00:21:01,017

I see.

269

It's about the public class, right?

The principal will take care of it. Don't worry about it.

272

Mr. Paik is a teacher in our math department.

How could I not worry about it?

274

If you're so concerned,

275
00:21:39,086 --> 00:21:40,917
you should take care of things in advance...

276

Ji Na...

281

actually admitted that it was her and told me she regretted it.

282

As her mother, I'd like to tell you that I'm extremely sorry.

283
00:22:42,376 --> 00:22:46,146
I think she was overly excited about joining your project...

284
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:47,886
and ended up crossing the line.

285
00:22:48,386 --> 00:22:50,487
This project isn't going to be reflected in her grades,

286
00:22:52,427 --> 00:22:54,626
so could you forgive her just this once?

287

Ji Na will no longer be able to take part in the project.

I checked the facts and punished the person who was responsible.

331
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:56,028
Still, I felt reassured to know that you believed me.

332
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:03,268
- Keep going! - Go!

333
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,438
Si An gets to stay, and you were asked to leave?

334
00:26:07,508 --> 00:26:09,639
Did you really copy her homework?

335
00:26:10,538 --> 00:26:11,879
Si An is so annoying.

336
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:13,778
Get out of my way.

337
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,488
What's your relationship with Paik Seung Yoo?

338
00:26:21,518 --> 00:26:23,089
Why does he always take your side?

339
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:25,359
It's Mr. Paik, not Paik Seung Yoo.

340
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,988
Do you have no respect or manners?

341
00:26:28,528 --> 00:26:30,129
Who do you think you are to lecture me?

342
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:31,859
- Ouch. Hey. - My gosh.

343
00:26:31,928 --> 00:26:32,998
Stop it.

344
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:34,928
Hey.

345
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,169
I know you guys don't like me,

346
00:26:37,268 --> 00:26:38,839
but I never caused you guys any harm,

347
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:40,809
and unlike you, I never once stole anything.

348
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:44,038
Now you know what happens if you mess with me.

349
00:26:45,879 --> 00:26:47,178
You'd better watch out from now on.

350
00:26:54,188 --> 00:26:56,248
We were informed that some of the applicants...

351
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,819
of Asung Academy of Mathematics and Arts...

352
00:26:57,889 --> 00:26:59,988
were asked remarkably easy questions...

353
00:26:59,988 --> 00:27:03,159
during the interviews they had prior to entering the school.

354
00:27:03,428 --> 00:27:04,528
An audit?

355
00:27:05,228 --> 00:27:07,299
This is so unexpected.

356
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:09,329
Everyone's going to be sensitive for a while.

357
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:11,538
We'll be asked to hand in tons of files and paperwork.

358
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:15,268
Those who were in charge of the admission are going to be busy.

359
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:16,909
They'll be busy getting investigated.

360
00:27:16,978 --> 00:27:18,508
It's going to be a mess.

361
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:21,248
Mr. Han, weren't you also in charge of the admission?

362
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:22,649
- What about that? - Well...

363
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:25,448
I was just going to say that you're going to be busy.

364
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:28,419
You're the ones ruining the school atmosphere...

365
00:27:28,488 --> 00:27:31,188
by gathering around and gossiping like that.

366
00:27:31,258 --> 00:27:33,488
Don't let the audit disturb you...

367
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:35,728
and just carry on with your work as usual.

368
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,159
As usual!

369
00:27:38,258 --> 00:27:39,458
Goodness.

370
00:27:44,938 --> 00:27:47,809
The Office of Education will be auditing the school.

371
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:50,909
The students called into question turned out to be children...

372
00:27:50,978 --> 00:27:52,738
of high-ranking politicians and renowned businessmen.

373
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:22,238
What happened?

374
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:24,178
I took care of the issue with Si An.

375
00:28:25,178 --> 00:28:27,978
Principal Noh admitted everything without a big fight.

376
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:29,309
What did you do?

377
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:30,948
That's what I should be asking you.

378
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:33,119
Are you trying to become a whistle-blower?

379
00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:35,948
I'm going to disclose everything one by one.

380
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:39,819
Then we'll eventually find out what happened four years ago.

381
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:41,958
We'll find out who did what.

382
00:28:42,028 --> 00:28:43,859
Do you really think you'll be able to uncover everything?

383
00:28:43,928 --> 00:28:46,028
If it were that easy, why do you think I failed to do it?

384
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:49,569
Then tell me what you're planning to do.

385
00:28:51,498 --> 00:28:53,468
Tell me. You're making me nervous.

386
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,008
I'm going to reveal everything.

387
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:01,948
Not about what happened in the past but about what's happening now.

388
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:05,319
I'm going to repay them by doing exactly what they did to me.

389
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:08,049
Let's do it together.

390
00:29:09,688 --> 00:29:12,359
I told you to forget what happened and just live your life.

391
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:13,718
How can I forget?

392
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:17,859
I could never forget.

393
00:29:19,129 --> 00:29:21,369
I couldn't help but feel like a fool.

394
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:24,538
"Why couldn't I do anything? Why couldn't I protect her?"

395
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:27,339
Just leave it to me.

396
00:29:28,038 --> 00:29:30,438
I'll deal with the people who need to be dealt with.

397
00:29:31,508 --> 00:29:33,178
I won't be doing anything with you.

398
00:29:34,879 --> 00:29:37,278
Your return was never part of my plan.

399
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:43,218
It will only cause an error.

400
00:30:16,819 --> 00:30:18,958
- Welcome... - Welcome...

401
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,198
Didn't we tell you that you're not welcome here?

402
00:30:26,528 --> 00:30:28,129
I didn't want to come either,

403
00:30:28,198 --> 00:30:30,899
but my son wanted your macaroons...

404
00:30:32,268 --> 00:30:33,299
with all due respect.

405
00:30:34,938 --> 00:30:36,538
- How many? - I'd like 12,

406
00:30:37,508 --> 00:30:38,538
Ms. Min.

407
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:47,288
I heard Mr. Paik was...

408
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:50,518
going to build a museum.

409
00:30:51,288 --> 00:30:54,028
- A museum? - What kind of museum?

410
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,089
The National Museum of Mathematics.

411
00:30:57,998 --> 00:30:59,299
- Did you see him? - What?

412
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:03,369
- I mean, my son. - Yes, I did.

413
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:06,698
He was very handsome and all grown up.

414
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:19,849
Thank you.

415
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:26,688
- Mr. Paik Min Sik? - That's me.

416
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:27,928
Here you go.

417
00:31:29,028 --> 00:31:30,059

(Asung Academy of Mathematics and Arts)

419
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:34,599
"Asung Academy of Mathematics and Arts"?

420
00:31:42,409 --> 00:31:43,639
What is it?

421
00:31:43,708 --> 00:31:46,278
Honey, Seung Yoo...

422
00:31:46,678 --> 00:31:47,778
What about Seung Yoo?

423
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:51,278
He sent his thesis.

424
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:56,248
Look.

425
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,309
Hello, Dad.

426
00:32:35,728 --> 00:32:37,059
No.

427
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:40,768
Okay, I won't play.

428
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:44,099
Shall we get some air?

429
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,438
Dad.

430
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,778
I heard you enjoyed playing against Si An.

431
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:58,349
And that you chat a lot with Seung Yoo.

432
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:00,319
Why not with me?

433
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:05,188
Is it because I resent you?

434
00:33:07,758 --> 00:33:10,899
I did. I did resent you a lot.

435
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:15,428
When I graduated from middle school and high school,

436
00:33:16,198 --> 00:33:17,768
and even when I got into university,

437
00:33:18,198 --> 00:33:19,839
you were never there.

438
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:23,368
You were always at home.

439
00:33:24,038 --> 00:33:26,109
You concentrated on your proofs.

440
00:33:29,649 --> 00:33:32,518
Even when Mom died.

441
00:33:40,828 --> 00:33:43,388
I'm sorry. I talked without thinking.

442
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:46,799
I don't resent you anymore.

443
00:33:56,308 --> 00:33:59,379
You still solve problems every day.

444
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:01,949
You must enjoy it.

445
00:34:05,149 --> 00:34:06,149
What...

446
00:34:07,118 --> 00:34:08,989
will you prove?

447
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:13,859
What is your proof?

448
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:18,399
Dad, I...

449
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:27,408
I don't solve math problems anymore.

450
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:34,679
Problems that I used to like,

451
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:38,149
the ones with no answer.

452
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,888
Now, whatever problem I see, my heart doesn't beat fast.

453
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:47,018
I don't enjoy it,

454
00:34:48,058 --> 00:34:50,429
and I don't want to solve it.

455
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:54,228
I'm...

456
00:34:55,799 --> 00:34:57,498
no longer a mathematician.

457
00:34:58,169 --> 00:35:00,699
Such a time comes.

458
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:04,239
Whatever problem you see,

459
00:35:05,038 --> 00:35:06,638
your heart does not respond.

460
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,549
You don't feel joy,

461
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:11,149
or the yearning to solve it.

462
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:12,848
That time.

463
00:35:15,348 --> 00:35:19,118
Every mathematician goes through that period.

464
00:35:19,759 --> 00:35:21,958
A mathematician who doesn't go through that...

465
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:25,199
cannot solve the next problem.

466
00:36:00,998 --> 00:36:03,629
Jang Gyu Yeong's housewarming. Do you want in?

How cute.

470
00:36:46,308 --> 00:36:48,179
- You're always cute? - I am not.

471
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,549
- Who is that yellow monkey? - Will you stop it?

472
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:51,618
Go away.

473
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:53,549
I'll show you photos from the sauna.

474
00:36:53,618 --> 00:36:55,549
- Do you need help? - Everything's done?

475
00:36:55,618 --> 00:36:56,788
You are no longer my friend.

I'm free at last. Great. Thank you.

- Show me a few more. - Look.

478
00:37:01,058 --> 00:37:02,158
You two look more alike.

Get a girlfriend if you're jealous.

Here's the food.

481
00:37:05,929 --> 00:37:08,199
Hey. Let's take a photo.

482
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,699
Me and you? No way. People will get the wrong idea.

483
00:37:10,768 --> 00:37:13,299
The wrong idea? Who can't get the wrong idea?

484
00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:14,569
It's Seung Yoo.

Why is he so late?

Get in here quick.

Now we can eat.

488

- Hey. - Hi.

489
00:37:26,049 --> 00:37:27,118
Sit down.

490
00:37:29,788 --> 00:37:30,788
How long has it been?

491
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,819
- About 30 days? - About that, yes.

What do you like about each other?

493
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:36,589
You emptied both bottles already?

494
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:38,359
Are you okay? Are you drunk?

495
00:37:38,429 --> 00:37:39,699
- No. - Who am I?

496
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:41,129
I'll get more from the convenience store.

497
00:37:41,868 --> 00:37:43,029
Do you need anything else?

498
00:37:43,098 --> 00:37:44,799
- You'll go with her? - Why not?

499
00:37:44,868 --> 00:37:46,199
Wine. And ice cream.

500
00:37:46,268 --> 00:37:47,538
Okay. Go on eating.

501
00:37:47,609 --> 00:37:49,408
- See you. - Don't take too long.

502
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:51,179
I hope you hurry.

503
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:00,279
Give me that.

504
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,589
Let's sit for a while.

505
00:38:23,609 --> 00:38:24,779
Do you feel awkward around me?

506
00:38:25,908 --> 00:38:26,908
What?

507
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:29,708
I'd like us to get along.

508
00:38:46,728 --> 00:38:48,268
What do you mean by that?

509
00:38:48,469 --> 00:38:49,929
I'd like us to be closer.

510
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:52,938
And forget about the past.

511
00:38:54,768 --> 00:38:55,839
"The past"?

512
00:38:59,609 --> 00:39:01,208
The Jeju airport photo.

513
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:03,908
You took it, didn't you?

514
00:39:06,018 --> 00:39:07,949
You were at the conference too.

515
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:15,489
Then why...

516
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:19,699
Why do you want us to get along?

517
00:39:22,228 --> 00:39:23,399
Don't you hate me?

518
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:27,268
You liked Ms. Ji back then,

519
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:29,208
and because of my photo...

520
00:39:29,268 --> 00:39:30,609
You must've had your reasons.

521
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:35,609
I don't think you'd have done that for no reason.

522
00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:45,018
Back then...

523
00:39:46,089 --> 00:39:47,259
Actually...

524
00:39:57,498 --> 00:39:58,538
Why are you crying?

525
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:02,509
Let's go inside.

526
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:19,118
Do you have feelings for her?

527
00:40:19,888 --> 00:40:20,989
Does it matter to you?

528
00:40:25,029 --> 00:40:26,029
To me?

529
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:28,669
No.

530
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:40,739
You aren't coming?

531
00:40:42,478 --> 00:40:43,779
You go ahead. I need to make a call.

532
00:41:01,242 --> 00:41:02,512
I came for Gyu Yeong's housewarming.

533
00:41:02,581 --> 00:41:03,711
He just moved here.

534
00:41:04,682 --> 00:41:05,911
Why are you doing this?

535
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:08,822
Because you don't want to see them?

536
00:41:09,152 --> 00:41:10,722
I don't care about that.

537
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,492
I just don't want to be found out...

538
00:41:12,552 --> 00:41:14,362
and have my plan ruined.

539
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,101
- What about you? - How do you do this?

540
00:41:57,161 --> 00:41:59,072
- Hey. - It's from Ye Rin and Seung Yoo.

541
00:41:59,132 --> 00:42:00,172
- They brought it? - Really?

542
00:42:00,231 --> 00:42:02,601
Where's my cool friend Seung Yoo?

543
00:42:03,371 --> 00:42:04,742
He was going to make a call.

544
00:42:08,012 --> 00:42:09,141
Why did you come by yourself?

545
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:12,211
Whom was Seung Yoo with just now?

546
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:14,952
What? I didn't see anyone.

547
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:19,992
Is something going on between you and Seung Yoo?

548
00:42:21,262 --> 00:42:22,291
Nothing much.

549
00:42:24,862 --> 00:42:26,132
You were crying.

550
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:28,001
Why did you cry over nothing?

551
00:42:29,831 --> 00:42:31,072
What's it to you?

552
00:42:32,432 --> 00:42:33,572
That's right. Gyu Yeong.

553
00:42:33,632 --> 00:42:35,472
Didn't you say you saw Ms. Ji Yoon Su?

554
00:42:36,702 --> 00:42:38,242
You did? Where?

555
00:42:40,112 --> 00:42:41,141
Sorry.

556
00:42:41,211 --> 00:42:42,842
My cool friend Seung Yoo is here.

557
00:42:42,911 --> 00:42:44,012
Let's eat.

558
00:42:47,382 --> 00:42:49,152
Hey, you don't have a girlfriend, right?

559
00:42:49,182 --> 00:42:50,251
Want me to set you up?

560
00:42:50,722 --> 00:42:52,791
There are girls lined up asking to meet you.

561
00:42:52,851 --> 00:42:53,891
Me too.

562
00:42:53,891 --> 00:42:55,362
Hold on. Me first.

563
00:42:55,422 --> 00:42:57,561
What do you say? Want to meet them?

564
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:01,032
I like someone.

565
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:03,001
Oh my gosh. Since when?

566
00:43:03,061 --> 00:43:05,101
Without telling us? Who?

567
00:43:05,672 --> 00:43:06,702
Someone.

568
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:19,882
Someone whom I like more after being reunited after so long.

569
00:43:20,311 --> 00:43:21,621
- Wow. - What?

570
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:22,952
Does that mean...

571
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:25,822
it's someone we know?

572
00:43:26,222 --> 00:43:29,592
It's someone that you saw again after a long break, right?

573
00:43:30,862 --> 00:43:31,891
Is it...

574
00:43:35,101 --> 00:43:36,532
Is it me?

575
00:43:37,561 --> 00:43:40,271
- Hey. - Probably not, right?

576
00:43:40,572 --> 00:43:42,342
- No way. - I know.

577
00:43:42,402 --> 00:43:44,402
Just kidding. I'm trying to be funny.

578
00:43:44,472 --> 00:43:46,112
- You punk. - I know.

579
00:43:46,641 --> 00:43:47,641
(Paik Seung Yoo)

580
00:43:47,641 --> 00:43:48,742
Protrude.

581
00:43:50,112 --> 00:43:51,251
Protrude...

582
00:43:51,311 --> 00:43:52,682
- Gosh. - Protrude.

583
00:43:54,152 --> 00:43:56,751
You look like you were the one who wrote it.

584
00:43:56,822 --> 00:43:58,952
Does it make sense to you if you study?

585
00:43:59,592 --> 00:44:02,322
I can't understand any of it.

586
00:44:03,621 --> 00:44:04,731
And...

587
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:11,032
Among the auditors coming,

588
00:44:11,101 --> 00:44:13,702
Shim Sang Wook will be the easiest to talk to.

589
00:44:15,342 --> 00:44:17,141
I hear he loves this wine.

590
00:44:18,641 --> 00:44:19,911
I'll relay it to him.

591
00:44:19,972 --> 00:44:21,612
I have the documents.

592
00:44:22,342 --> 00:44:24,182
I'll take care of the originals.

593
00:44:24,242 --> 00:44:25,552
Good job.

594
00:44:26,682 --> 00:44:29,751
Give them everything they ask for and cooperate with them.

595
00:44:30,222 --> 00:44:31,291
I will.

596
00:44:42,802 --> 00:44:44,402
- Thank you. - Thank you.

597
00:44:48,402 --> 00:44:49,871
How's the approval...

598
00:44:49,871 --> 00:44:51,711
for establishing the foundation coming along?

599
00:44:51,771 --> 00:44:54,141
Well... You'll get it soon.

600
00:44:55,012 --> 00:44:57,282
Tell them to prepare a scholarship grant ceremony.

601
00:44:57,782 --> 00:44:59,452
I've chosen an appropriate student.

602
00:45:02,081 --> 00:45:04,521
But aren't you doing too much?

603
00:45:05,391 --> 00:45:07,822
The museum project is huge as well.

604
00:45:08,191 --> 00:45:09,222
Assemblyman.

605
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:11,432
You need to think big.

606
00:45:11,992 --> 00:45:14,061
You're striving to become the party leader soon...

607
00:45:15,132 --> 00:45:16,902
and even the president.

608
00:45:18,902 --> 00:45:19,932
You should go.

609
00:45:20,231 --> 00:45:22,441
Let's open a bottle of this wine too after the audit.

610
00:45:25,972 --> 00:45:29,541
Oh my goodness. Noh Jung Ah and Assemblyman Sung Min Jun?

611
00:45:30,382 --> 00:45:31,711
What are they doing?

612
00:45:32,081 --> 00:45:35,621
Oh my gosh. What's going on here?

613
00:45:44,021 --> 00:45:45,061
Hello, director.

614
00:45:45,132 --> 00:45:47,391
Kim Ji Na's orientation is at 6pm tonight.

615
00:45:48,501 --> 00:45:49,902
I'll make sure she isn't late.

616
00:45:51,161 --> 00:45:54,132
Also, we should get the approval soon...

617
00:45:54,672 --> 00:45:55,871
thanks to the documents you prepared.

618
00:45:55,941 --> 00:45:57,001
That's great news.

619
00:45:57,141 --> 00:45:58,771
You must be busy with the audit and everything.

620
00:45:58,842 --> 00:46:01,411
Don't worry about that. It's nothing.

621
00:46:02,911 --> 00:46:03,981
Yes.

622
00:46:04,911 --> 00:46:05,911
Bye now.

623
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:14,891
Send in Choi Si An.

624
00:46:21,902 --> 00:46:23,432
I haven't had this in ages.

625
00:46:23,501 --> 00:46:24,972
Tteokbokki equals love.

626
00:46:25,731 --> 00:46:27,731
Your mom won't let you eat this, saying you'll gain weight, right?

627
00:46:28,441 --> 00:46:29,842
Eat up.

628
00:46:34,882 --> 00:46:36,342
How are things at school?

629
00:46:36,641 --> 00:46:38,211
Not good. Because of the audit and whatnot.

630
00:46:38,282 --> 00:46:40,081
They pretend it's fine, but the tension is high.

631
00:46:40,751 --> 00:46:41,822
I see.

632
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,191
Orientation is at 6pm. Don't be late.

633
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:48,291
I have to go.

634
00:46:48,592 --> 00:46:50,862
Can you drop me off at my academy?

635
00:46:55,532 --> 00:46:57,532
- Thank you. - Good luck.

636
00:46:57,601 --> 00:46:58,601
Thanks.

637
00:47:26,632 --> 00:47:28,501
I've been meaning to meet with you,

638
00:47:28,862 --> 00:47:31,032
but I got busy with this and that.

639
00:47:31,532 --> 00:47:32,572
Me? Why?

640
00:47:32,632 --> 00:47:34,501
I want to give you a scholarship certificate.

641
00:47:34,902 --> 00:47:36,402
You'll receive money for educational costs.

642
00:47:37,472 --> 00:47:40,512
I know you're getting some now. This will be in addition.

643
00:47:41,012 --> 00:47:42,012
Out of nowhere?

644
00:47:42,081 --> 00:47:44,012
How long have you been going to the math clinic?

645
00:47:45,552 --> 00:47:48,621
How do you know the instructor?

646
00:47:50,382 --> 00:47:51,552
What do you mean?

647
00:47:52,152 --> 00:47:54,121
It's an academy that's hard to get into,

648
00:47:54,592 --> 00:47:57,262
and an instructor who's impossible to meet even with a pile of cash.

649
00:47:59,532 --> 00:48:03,101
I wonder how the likes of you ended up there.

650
00:48:04,802 --> 00:48:06,601
You don't have a strange relationship, do you?

651
00:48:07,132 --> 00:48:08,572
She's a woman.

652
00:48:12,842 --> 00:48:14,612
A woman and single.

653
00:48:15,112 --> 00:48:18,581
She probably cares for you like her child because she has none.

654
00:48:19,282 --> 00:48:21,081
I'll go if you're done.

655
00:48:21,152 --> 00:48:24,751
She makes an insane amount of money but has no time to spend it.

656
00:48:24,822 --> 00:48:26,291
