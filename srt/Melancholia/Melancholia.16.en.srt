that would be on Minister Shin who headed the task force team,

and Professor Cha who headed the committee.

88

Wouldn't those two be most deeply involved?

Didn't you have the bill passed forcibly...

You can tell the math problems here...

In 2017,

312
00:17:49,884 --> 00:17:53,510
I had three teachers.

313

and one...

noticed that I had seen the answer sheet and copied it.

317
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:08,459
I turned that last teacher into my enemy.

318
00:18:09,364 --> 00:18:10,459
However,

319
00:18:11,034 --> 00:18:14,139
every time I came across a wall in life,

320
00:18:14,775 --> 00:18:17,139
I remembered what that teacher had said to me.

321
00:18:17,814 --> 00:18:19,310
That I needed to know...

322
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:21,679
what I did wrong.

323
00:18:23,614 --> 00:18:26,110
That I needed to be able to say what I did wrong.

324
00:18:26,215 --> 00:18:27,550
I remembered those words.

What made you decide to admit everything today?

326

I lied,

327
00:18:36,864 --> 00:18:38,290
I received special treatment,

328
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:40,830
and I framed another person.

00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:43,800
However,

330
00:18:44,534 --> 00:18:47,399
I never once admitted it...

331
00:18:47,905 --> 00:18:49,739
or apologized for it.

332
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,350
I apologize sincerely.

333
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:01,879
I'm sorry, Ms. Ji Yoon Su.

334
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:17,004
What's going on?

335
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:19,073
- Ji Yoon Su. - It's Ji Yoon Su.

336
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,373
- It's her. - It's Ji Yoon Su.

337
00:19:21,374 --> 00:19:23,000
Isn't that her?

338
00:19:23,405 --> 00:19:24,510
Let's go.

339
00:19:26,015 --> 00:19:27,439
Okay, let's go.

340
00:19:28,314 --> 00:19:30,043
You're the female teacher from Asung High School, right?

341
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,283
Do you have any comments about this?

342
00:19:31,284 --> 00:19:32,914
It has been proven that you were in fact framed.

343
00:19:32,915 --> 00:19:34,283
How do you feel?

344
00:19:34,284 --> 00:19:35,580
Please give us a statement.

345
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:43,520
Four years ago,

346
00:19:44,594 --> 00:19:47,399
the student who was framed with me...

347
00:19:49,235 --> 00:19:50,459
I'll prove it.

348
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:54,239
I promise I'll prove it.

349
00:19:55,304 --> 00:19:57,909
He had promised to uncover the truth.

350
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:02,580
Finally, it was proven today.

351
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:04,479
Thus, I'm happy.

352
00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:14,024
- Anything else? - Please say something more.

353
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:16,164
- Do you feel vindicated? - Is there anything else?

354
00:20:16,165 --> 00:20:18,494
- Just a little more, please. - Sung Ye Rin!

355
00:20:18,495 --> 00:20:19,694
Please look this way!

356
00:20:19,695 --> 00:20:22,199
What proof do you mean?

357
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,570
We'll play the recording now.

358
00:20:25,074 --> 00:20:26,500
(Students in the Project)

359
00:20:27,104 --> 00:20:28,573
We'll have to be discreet.

360
00:20:28,574 --> 00:20:30,674
I'll tell you the method now.

361
00:20:30,675 --> 00:20:31,810
Just do as I say.

362
00:20:31,945 --> 00:20:34,583
First, establish a foundation.

363
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:37,613
One that helps talented but poor students.

364
00:20:37,614 --> 00:20:39,083
A nonprofit.

365
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:41,850
Parents will donate to the foundation,

366
00:20:41,925 --> 00:20:43,524
and that money will be sent...

367
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:46,424
to admissions officers abroad in the form of donations.

368
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:48,419
It'll be a way for us to launder the money.

369
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:50,389
One more thing.

370
00:20:52,265 --> 00:20:55,063
What do you want me to do with this?

371
00:20:55,064 --> 00:20:57,303
It was recorded by a third party,

372
00:20:57,304 --> 00:20:59,000
so they won't accept it as evidence.

373
00:20:59,304 --> 00:21:01,504
But if you hand it into the police saying you recorded it,

374
00:21:01,505 --> 00:21:04,343
Noh Jung Ah will get criminally charged.

375
00:21:04,344 --> 00:21:07,409
I want you to acquire some shares using the foundation.

376
00:21:08,114 --> 00:21:10,540
Do you admit that it was you who had this conversation?

377
00:21:11,284 --> 00:21:13,454
Principal Noh gave all the orders.

378
00:21:13,455 --> 00:21:15,080
All I did was cooperate.

379
00:21:15,685 --> 00:21:17,149
She also said this.

380
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:20,425
"The parents of the kids in the Global Talent Class..."

381
00:21:20,425 --> 00:21:22,093
"are all high-ranking officials."

382
00:21:22,094 --> 00:21:23,889
"So they will prevent anything bad from happening."

383
00:21:24,465 --> 00:21:28,000
She said they promised to protect us and that I shouldn't worry.

384
00:21:28,304 --> 00:21:31,870
Violations against illegal solicitation, acceptance of bribes,

385
00:21:32,304 --> 00:21:34,974
professional negligence, business obstruction,

386
00:21:34,975 --> 00:21:37,540
forgery of documents, and embezzlement.

387
00:21:38,374 --> 00:21:39,770
My goodness.

388
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:43,540
Do you admit to all these charges?

389
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,184
This isn't fair.

390
00:21:47,185 --> 00:21:48,580
How so?

391
00:21:51,425 --> 00:21:53,793
- Do you have a kid? - Yes, I do.

392
00:21:53,794 --> 00:21:56,820
- What school does your kid go to? - A public school.

393
00:21:57,165 --> 00:22:00,434
Your job comes with honor and power, and people like you...

394
00:22:00,435 --> 00:22:02,863
are willing to go far and beyond for your children.

395
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:05,399
As parents, it's only natural that we want our children...

396
00:22:05,705 --> 00:22:08,244
to take a path in life that's quicker, easier,

397
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:10,439
and more comfortable.

398
00:22:11,245 --> 00:22:12,409
Right.

399
00:22:13,715 --> 00:22:16,414
Every single parent I've ever met...

400
00:22:16,415 --> 00:22:19,613
wanted his or her child...

401
00:22:19,614 --> 00:22:22,719
to get ahead of others by starting with an advantage.

402
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,620
- When I showed them the way... - Please forgive her.

403
00:22:27,564 --> 00:22:30,224
Please forgive Ye Rin just this once.

404
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:33,164
They willingly got on their knees and stooped low.

405
00:22:33,165 --> 00:22:35,803
- Ms. Noh, happy birthday. - Happy birthday.

406
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:38,300
They treated me like a queen.

407
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:42,603
They asked for a faster and easier route.

408
00:22:42,604 --> 00:22:44,669
They were willing to do anything.

409
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:49,439
And now, they're blaming me for ruining their children's lives?

410
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:51,310
What did I do wrong?

411
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:54,524
She asked me what it was that she did wrong.

412
00:22:54,525 --> 00:22:56,724
I think that's the problem.

413
00:22:56,725 --> 00:22:59,320
I want to set things straight...

414
00:23:00,155 --> 00:23:02,424
before things get completely out of hand.

415
00:23:02,425 --> 00:23:03,790
She didn't set anything straight.

416
00:23:04,094 --> 00:23:06,764
She just damaged the system. She ruined it all...

417
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:09,699
when I had worked so hard to build a solid order.

418
00:23:12,374 --> 00:23:13,929
It was ruined by a mere teacher.

419
00:23:19,644 --> 00:23:21,510
Listen to me, Ms. Noh.

420
00:23:32,054 --> 00:23:33,225
("Principal of Asung Academy Found Guilty...")

421
00:23:33,225 --> 00:23:34,919
("for Giving Special Treatment to Kids From Prestigious Families")

422
00:23:37,195 --> 00:23:40,290
How do you think you'll feel when we have a child?

423
00:23:40,495 --> 00:23:45,174
Won't you want to do all you can for its sake?

424
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,899
Doing all I can to love my child...

425
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:50,813
is different from putting my child first...

426
00:23:50,814 --> 00:23:52,540
at the expense of other children.

427
00:23:56,415 --> 00:23:57,610
Hey, you're here.

428
00:23:58,455 --> 00:24:01,024
- It's been a while. - Yes, have you been well?

429
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:02,780
Yes. Have a seat.

430
00:24:06,854 --> 00:24:08,060
Did you see this?

431
00:24:08,995 --> 00:24:11,790
I heard about the tip-off you gave. Thank you.

432
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:15,600
I was actually thinking about what you once said to me.

433
00:24:16,064 --> 00:24:17,133
What?

434
00:24:17,134 --> 00:24:19,800
When I asked you how you'd feel if we ever had a child of our own,

435
00:24:20,505 --> 00:24:23,139
we ended up arguing due to our different opinions.

436
00:24:24,314 --> 00:24:25,540
I remember.

437
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:28,040
I just ignored it.

438
00:24:29,515 --> 00:24:31,409
I closed my eyes and pretended like it didn't matter.

439
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,149
I thought that was all I had to do to make things okay.

440
00:24:35,755 --> 00:24:37,649
Do you think differently now?

441
00:24:38,155 --> 00:24:39,290
Yes.

442
00:24:40,455 --> 00:24:42,024
After having gone through all this,

443
00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:46,189
things started to change, and I've become braver.

444
00:24:47,394 --> 00:24:49,129
That's what it feels like for me.

445
00:24:50,304 --> 00:24:51,729
I'm glad to hear that.

446
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:56,739
You really do seem different than how you were in the past.

447
00:24:57,405 --> 00:24:59,709
- I do? - Yes. In a good way.

448
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,040
A good way?

449
00:25:04,685 --> 00:25:06,209
How's he doing?

450
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:13,919
I can't believe you guys succeeded in receiving an apology.

451
00:25:15,225 --> 00:25:18,489
I didn't think that was possible in this day and age.

452
00:25:21,564 --> 00:25:22,760
But you guys did it.

453
00:25:24,034 --> 00:25:25,770
You and Seung Yoo.

454
00:25:34,344 --> 00:25:35,909
Seung Yoo once told me...

455
00:25:36,685 --> 00:25:38,949
that he wanted you to receive an apology.

456
00:25:40,884 --> 00:25:43,479
It felt a lot more sincere than hearing someone say...

457
00:25:44,894 --> 00:25:46,790
that they want to make someone happy.

458
00:25:54,864 --> 00:25:57,204
How's your teaching job? Is it okay?

459
00:25:57,205 --> 00:25:59,770
It's different from teaching students at school.

460
00:26:00,104 --> 00:26:04,169
But thanks to your recommendation, it's not too bad.

461
00:26:05,044 --> 00:26:06,574
Students seem to enjoy my lectures, and thanks to that,

462
00:26:06,574 --> 00:26:08,184
more and more students have started to enroll in my class.

463
00:26:08,185 --> 00:26:11,454
That's great. Keep up the good work. I'll be keeping an eye on you.

464
00:26:11,455 --> 00:26:13,750
Of course. I'll do my best.

465
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:18,024
By the way, no one believed me when I told them...

466
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:19,449
that I used to be your teacher in high school.

467
00:26:20,794 --> 00:26:22,264
While we're on that subject...

468
00:26:22,265 --> 00:26:24,360
- Okay. Let's take a photo. - That's what I'm talking about.

469
00:26:25,534 --> 00:26:30,404
Let me take a photo with Mr. Paik.

470
00:26:30,405 --> 00:26:32,274
Look at the screen.

471
00:26:32,275 --> 00:26:34,939
One, two, three.

472
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:37,100
Great.

473
00:26:39,614 --> 00:26:43,914
Thank you for coming to see me instead of just forgetting about me.

474
00:26:43,915 --> 00:26:45,149
I should be the one thanking you.

475
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,984
You helped out a lot and played a big role.

476
00:26:47,985 --> 00:26:49,320
That's what helped us come this far.

477
00:26:50,685 --> 00:26:52,290
- Let's drink. - Okay.

478
00:26:53,294 --> 00:26:56,989
Today, let's drink until we get wasted.

479
00:26:57,995 --> 00:26:59,429
There we go.

480
00:27:00,265 --> 00:27:01,399
Excuse me.

481
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:05,204
- May I help you? - I'm here for Ms. Ji Yoon Su.

482
00:27:05,205 --> 00:27:06,734
She's in the waiting room over there.

483
00:27:06,735 --> 00:27:09,370
Everything's ready. You can bring everyone outside.

484
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:10,870
Okay.

485
00:27:12,614 --> 00:27:14,780
You're all ready. Look at yourself in the mirror.

486
00:27:17,215 --> 00:27:19,879
Professor Ji, you look stunning.

487
00:27:21,384 --> 00:27:23,679
Ta-da. How do I look?

488
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:27,123
- Hey, Mr. Paik. - You're here.

489
00:27:27,124 --> 00:27:28,459
He's ready for us. He wants us to come outside.

490
00:27:31,064 --> 00:27:32,664
Look at you.

491
00:27:32,665 --> 00:27:36,133
Sir, I almost didn't recognize you. You look handsome today.

492
00:27:36,134 --> 00:27:38,073
Mr. Paik, how do I look?

493
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:39,229
Take it off.

494
00:27:39,634 --> 00:27:42,300
- Today's all about me. - Don't be absurd.

495
00:27:42,574 --> 00:27:45,444
We all gathered here to celebrate your discharge from the hospital.

496
00:27:45,445 --> 00:27:46,909
Professor Ji had to travel a long way.

497
00:27:47,074 --> 00:27:49,540
- We're all very busy people. - Okay, fine.

498
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:50,709
Let's go.

499
00:27:51,515 --> 00:27:53,949
- Dad, let's go. - Let's go, Professor Ji.

500
00:27:57,725 --> 00:28:00,449
Why don't you hold your grandfather's hand?

501
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:04,633
- Like this? - Yes, that's great.

502
00:28:04,634 --> 00:28:07,129
Sir, can you also lean a little bit toward your granddaughter?

503
00:28:08,134 --> 00:28:10,429
Just a little bit. Okay, great.

504
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:14,270
Mister, can you stand a little bit closer to the lady?

505
00:28:17,544 --> 00:28:20,969
Place your heads a little closer together.

506
00:28:22,044 --> 00:28:25,350
Just a bit more. A bit more. Okay, great.

507
00:28:25,485 --> 00:28:28,780
Now, give me a smile, everyone. In 1, 2, 3.

508
00:28:30,655 --> 00:28:33,889
Okay. Let's try that again. This time, give me a bigger smile.

509
00:28:34,864 --> 00:28:36,389
Grandpa, smile.

510
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:39,959
One, two, three.

511
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:46,672
Are they really going to cancel Ye Rin's admission?

512
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:48,578
Yes. Her dad apparently resigned.

513
00:28:49,943 --> 00:28:52,182
She no longer has an assemblyman to help her out.

514
00:28:52,183 --> 00:28:55,018
- She's done now. - Justice prevails.

515
00:28:58,523 --> 00:29:00,989
- Ye Rin. - When did you get there?

516
00:29:01,064 --> 00:29:02,258
Just now.

517
00:29:14,203 --> 00:29:15,298
Let's go.

518
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:21,543
Don't get scared. It's not too late to start over.

519
00:29:21,544 --> 00:29:24,083
I never said I was scared. I'm really going to try my best.

520
00:29:24,084 --> 00:29:25,649
That's the spirit.

521
00:29:25,913 --> 00:29:27,949
- I'll be your math tutor. - You?

522
00:29:28,253 --> 00:29:30,118
You know I was always better than you at math, right?

523
00:29:30,983 --> 00:29:32,449
You're such a show-off.

524
00:29:32,654 --> 00:29:33,853
How much do you charge?

525
00:29:33,854 --> 00:29:35,159
I have to work part-time too.

526
00:29:35,394 --> 00:29:37,833
- You, work? Don't you dare. - Why do you care?

527
00:29:37,834 --> 00:29:40,659
Why can't I care? I don't want you to suffer.

528
00:29:41,034 --> 00:29:42,229
You're going overboard.

529
00:29:42,703 --> 00:29:44,798
What will you do? Can I work with you?

530
00:29:45,003 --> 00:29:46,098
Will you?

531
00:29:46,433 --> 00:29:48,868
Can someone like you who never worked even manage?

532
00:29:49,104 --> 00:29:51,169
That goes for you too.

533
00:29:59,054 --> 00:30:00,752
It's for a student?

534
00:30:00,753 --> 00:30:03,949
How about this one, then?

535
00:30:04,723 --> 00:30:06,249
Si An, take a look.

536
00:30:09,894 --> 00:30:11,432
Do you think you'll sleep well?

537
00:30:11,433 --> 00:30:12,863
Yes, totally.

538
00:30:12,864 --> 00:30:14,328
You'll love it.

539
00:30:14,534 --> 00:30:16,033
It's high-density memory foam,

540
00:30:16,034 --> 00:30:18,502
and it keeps you comfortable all night long.

541
00:30:18,503 --> 00:30:20,573
Does it? Let's get this, then?

542
00:30:20,574 --> 00:30:21,798
Can I?

543
00:30:22,173 --> 00:30:23,873
It looks expensive.

544
00:30:23,874 --> 00:30:26,212
It's a gift from your two teachers to celebrate your recovery.

545
00:30:26,213 --> 00:30:27,712
Don't worry and accept it.

546
00:30:27,713 --> 00:30:29,179
Thank you.

547
00:30:29,284 --> 00:30:30,783
- I'll use it well. - Good.

548
00:30:30,784 --> 00:30:33,048
- I'll go and pay. - I'll come with you.

549
00:31:13,453 --> 00:31:15,088
What are you thinking about?

550
00:31:16,294 --> 00:31:17,758
Cassiopeia.

551
00:31:25,874 --> 00:31:29,199
Even stars that others say have no meaning...

552
00:31:29,673 --> 00:31:31,568
all have a place...

553
00:31:32,213 --> 00:31:34,338
among the celestial bodies.

554
00:31:35,044 --> 00:31:39,909
If you connect and follow those stars,

555
00:31:40,183 --> 00:31:42,518
even on this trip in the unknown,

556
00:31:43,324 --> 00:31:47,449
you can reach a beautiful conclusion.

557
00:32:20,923 --> 00:32:23,358
I'll come to play chess with you this weekend.

558
00:32:23,663 --> 00:32:24,758
Okay.

559
00:32:25,364 --> 00:32:27,528
Get some rest. We'll go now.

560
00:32:29,104 --> 00:32:30,358
Yoon Su.

561
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:35,899
Thank you.

562
00:32:41,844 --> 00:32:43,909
You never resented me.

563
00:32:45,584 --> 00:32:47,508
You always understood.

564
00:32:50,423 --> 00:32:53,919
I was a man who loved only numbers.

565
00:32:56,364 --> 00:32:57,788
You made me love...

566
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:02,858
much more than that.

567
00:33:12,344 --> 00:33:16,009
Professor, I love you too. You know that, right?

568
00:33:16,514 --> 00:33:18,009
Yes, I do.

569
00:33:18,154 --> 00:33:20,249
There's nothing he doesn't know.

570
00:33:20,784 --> 00:33:23,549
He knows all the hard work we put in.

571
00:33:26,154 --> 00:33:27,448
Get some rest.

572
00:33:27,753 --> 00:33:28,859
I will.

573
00:33:29,264 --> 00:33:30,759
I'll visit again, Dad.

574
00:33:31,864 --> 00:33:32,959
Okay.

575
00:33:33,864 --> 00:33:34,959

So, what will you prove?

There's a topic I'm thinking about really seriously.

- What is it? - Quantum cryptography.

Quantum cryptography?

585

That tough topic?

586
00:34:27,353 --> 00:34:28,948
Exactly. Why that field?

587
00:34:28,954 --> 00:34:30,249
Because it's cool.

You thought about it in a great deal of detail.

591
00:34:35,994 --> 00:34:37,089
Yes.

592

Dad would leave behind two pupils like you.

Okay. I'll do that.

You got probation and can't be on TV.

Aren't you just as penniless?

634
00:38:43,643 --> 00:38:45,212

635

Oh, whatever. Yoo Chan...

644

00:39:21,983 --> 00:39:25,153
Whose fault is it that he can't go to school?

652
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,953
He's too embarrassed to live with either of us.

653
00:39:27,954 --> 00:39:29,549
Then what will he do?

654
00:39:30,324 --> 00:39:31,518
Did he leave?

655
00:39:33,724 --> 00:39:34,819
(Son)

656
00:39:36,393 --> 00:39:39,129
- The person you have reached... - What...

657
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:42,203
- Go out and look for him. - Darn it.

658
00:39:42,204 --> 00:39:43,529
Give me that!

659
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:46,672
Hey! Yoo Chan!

660
00:39:46,673 --> 00:39:48,538
Yoo Chan!

661
00:39:56,844 --> 00:39:58,549
Can you unpack by yourself?

662
00:39:59,114 --> 00:40:00,549
I'll do it slowly.

663
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:02,718
Actually, Seung Yoo...

664
00:40:05,554 --> 00:40:09,018
Take any of my father's books that you want.

665
00:40:30,884 --> 00:40:32,578
I'll give this to Si An.

666
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:40,249
- What is it? - Are there more notebooks?

667
00:40:41,094 --> 00:40:42,218
Yes.

668
00:40:50,963 --> 00:40:52,069
This...

669
00:40:53,873 --> 00:40:55,169
I'm checking.

670
00:40:57,704 --> 00:40:59,908
- Right? - I think so.

671
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,939
I thought they were meaningless scribbles.

672
00:41:05,483 --> 00:41:06,649
But they weren't.

673
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:08,779
Let's look.

674
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:12,223
Let's find what it was that my father was trying to prove.

675
00:41:12,224 --> 00:41:13,319
Okay.

676
00:41:32,474 --> 00:41:33,638
Here.

677
00:41:43,684 --> 00:41:46,153
So this is how it feels to lose the specialized school designation.

678
00:41:46,154 --> 00:41:49,863
Asung Foundation's reputation collapsed in an instant.

679
00:41:49,864 --> 00:41:51,022
I know.

680
00:41:51,023 --> 00:41:53,332
I heard the entire board was replaced too.

681
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:54,993
- Clear the way. - Step aside.

682
00:41:54,994 --> 00:41:56,558
Careful.

683
00:41:56,904 --> 00:41:59,573
- What is that? - What is all of that?

684
00:41:59,574 --> 00:42:00,928
My gosh.

685
00:42:06,043 --> 00:42:08,913
- Cantor. - The continuum hypothesis.

686
00:42:08,914 --> 00:42:10,142
(Cantor - advanced the continuum hypothesis)

687
00:42:10,143 --> 00:42:11,413
(about the possible sizes of infinite sets.)

688
00:42:11,414 --> 00:42:13,848
Godel showed that it cannot be proven,

689
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,982
so it was irrelevant whether or not it was true.

690
00:42:15,983 --> 00:42:17,122
But the professor...

691
00:42:17,123 --> 00:42:18,323
(Godel's incompleteness theorems)

692
00:42:18,324 --> 00:42:22,488
He reinvented a world in which the continuum hypothesis is false.

693
00:42:26,934 --> 00:42:29,058
You still solve problems every day.

694
00:42:30,034 --> 00:42:32,399
Father.

695
00:42:34,873 --> 00:42:37,368
I asked why he kept doing something so useless...

696
00:42:38,873 --> 00:42:41,812
and begged him to stop.

697
00:42:41,813 --> 00:42:42,979
Me too.

698
00:42:44,244 --> 00:42:47,279
I never imagined this was what he was doing.

699
00:42:48,184 --> 00:42:50,049
He was fighting desperately...

700
00:42:51,253 --> 00:42:53,689
without anyone even knowing.

701
00:42:55,594 --> 00:42:58,729
Even stars that others say have no meaning...

702
00:42:59,693 --> 00:43:03,999
all have a place among the celestial bodies.

703
00:43:05,003 --> 00:43:09,198
If you connect and follow those stars,

704
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,569
even on this trip in the unknown,

705
00:43:12,574 --> 00:43:16,578
you can reach a beautiful conclusion.

706
00:43:20,114 --> 00:43:22,348
I think we can do something with this.

707
00:43:23,054 --> 00:43:25,892
I want to gather all the ingredients...

708
00:43:25,893 --> 00:43:27,089
that he planted...

709
00:43:27,954 --> 00:43:29,788
and complete something, anything.

710
00:43:31,063 --> 00:43:33,029
However long it takes, whatever the result.

711
00:43:34,094 --> 00:43:35,658
Can you handle it?

712
00:43:36,304 --> 00:43:40,069
This may take much more time and effort than your thesis...

713
00:43:40,304 --> 00:43:42,638
that won you the Lucifer Prize.

714
00:43:44,744 --> 00:43:47,368
It'll be a long battle which you much fight alone.

715
00:43:47,744 --> 00:43:49,908
No one will be able to help you to interfere with you.

716
00:43:50,983 --> 00:43:52,178
That's exciting.

717
00:43:54,114 --> 00:43:55,348
And frightening.

718
00:43:56,753 --> 00:43:57,919
Just a minute.

719
00:44:13,434 --> 00:44:16,439
Calculus. The source of a spring?

720
00:44:17,003 --> 00:44:18,169
Seung Yoo.

721
00:44:19,773 --> 00:44:22,279
Will you promise me one more time?

722
00:44:24,043 --> 00:44:26,209
Get immersed, but not overcome.

723
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:29,379
Like, but don't obsess?

724
00:44:31,884 --> 00:44:33,018
I promise.

725
00:44:33,893 --> 00:44:35,518
Don't worry, and cheer me on.

726
00:44:36,693 --> 00:44:38,859
I'll always cheer you on.

727
00:44:40,463 --> 00:44:41,888
You can do it.

728
00:44:56,213 --> 00:44:59,279
(3 years later)

729
00:44:59,784 --> 00:45:02,283
So? What happened to that mathematician?

730
00:45:02,284 --> 00:45:05,348
I'm not sure. What do you think?

731
00:45:06,253 --> 00:45:08,149
I hope you like that book.

732
00:45:08,523 --> 00:45:10,359
Thank you.

733
00:45:24,043 --> 00:45:25,169
Hello?

734
00:45:27,414 --> 00:45:29,808
Hello, Ms. Ji.

735
00:45:33,083 --> 00:45:34,448
How's school?

736
00:45:34,784 --> 00:45:36,578
It's tough, isn't it? There's so much to learn.

737
00:45:37,623 --> 00:45:38,788
It's not so bad.

738
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:42,158
You even wrote me a recommendation. I have to work hard.

739
00:45:43,364 --> 00:45:45,792
Also, I heard from Si An.

740
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:47,189
She's back in Korea?

741
00:45:47,693 --> 00:45:49,962
Yes, for a short while.

742
00:45:49,963 --> 00:45:52,828
She's doing incredibly well. She even wrote a thesis.

743
00:45:53,173 --> 00:45:54,529
She brags like mad.

744
00:45:57,304 --> 00:45:59,238
Thank you for coming all the way here.

745
00:46:02,713 --> 00:46:06,848
She has been talking about you a lot since a few days ago.

746
00:46:08,884 --> 00:46:10,279
That she wanted to see you...

747
00:46:11,384 --> 00:46:12,618
and to ask you to come.

748
00:46:17,063 --> 00:46:18,488
I'll wait here.

749
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,459
I'll let you two talk.

750
00:46:35,273 --> 00:46:36,408
I heard...

751
00:46:37,384 --> 00:46:39,509
you wanted to see me.

752
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:45,279
No one comes.

753
00:46:47,594 --> 00:46:49,988
No one comes to see me.

754
00:46:54,193 --> 00:46:56,098
I thought they'd come at least to laugh at me.

755
00:47:02,943 --> 00:47:04,399
My father...

756
00:47:05,543 --> 00:47:07,038
passed away.

757
00:47:08,273 --> 00:47:09,709
So did my father.

758
00:47:11,713 --> 00:47:12,848
I see.

759
00:47:13,813 --> 00:47:15,379
Were you there when he passed?

760
00:47:16,554 --> 00:47:19,118
I was a little late, but yes.

761
00:47:19,454 --> 00:47:20,549
Good.

762
00:47:26,364 --> 00:47:27,529
I...

763
00:47:28,594 --> 00:47:30,198
didn't go.

764
00:47:31,034 --> 00:47:32,399
I'm sure Yeon Woo did.

765
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:36,968
I'm sure she gave him a big, fancy funeral.

766
00:47:37,574 --> 00:47:39,109
I'm sure he was proud.

767
00:47:42,744 --> 00:47:44,379
There was a time...

768
00:47:46,813 --> 00:47:49,218
when my father was proud of me too.

769
00:47:51,684 --> 00:47:53,049
He trusted me.

770
00:47:54,494 --> 00:47:57,089
He even said he'd entrust all of Asung with me.

771
00:48:08,873 --> 00:48:10,569
I need to do well.

772
00:48:12,373 --> 00:48:13,709
That's the only way...

773
00:48:15,943 --> 00:48:18,178
my father calls me over and looks at me.

774
00:48:20,614 --> 00:48:22,149
I wanted to do well.

775
00:48:24,824 --> 00:48:26,919
That was what I wanted, but...

776
00:48:41,634 --> 00:48:43,169
You don't have to do well.

777
00:48:44,103 --> 00:48:48,609
You don't need to gain anyone's approval anymore.

778
00:48:49,043 --> 00:48:52,348
You're a mom who needs to love Ji Na.

779
00:49:02,724 --> 00:49:03,859
Mom.

780
00:49:04,864 --> 00:49:06,089
Let's go in.

781
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:09,928
They're serving your favorite abalone porridge for dinner.

782
00:49:10,134 --> 00:49:11,359
Let's go eat.

783
00:49:13,934 --> 00:49:16,299
Thank you, Ms. Ji.

784
00:49:16,804 --> 00:49:18,038
I'll call you again.

785
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:23,808
Get home safely.

786
00:49:25,284 --> 00:49:27,448
Okay, Ji Na. I'll see you next time.

787
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,508
- Si An. - Ms. Ji.

788
00:50:05,384 --> 00:50:07,778
It's been so long. I missed you.

789
00:50:07,824 --> 00:50:10,053
- Me too. I'm glad you're here. - Have you been well?

790
00:50:10,054 --> 00:50:12,019
Of course. Let's go inside.

791
00:50:12,663 --> 00:50:14,492
- It's cold, isn't it? - I'm okay.

792
00:50:14,493 --> 00:50:15,963
- Are you hungry? - I'm starving.

793
00:50:15,964 --> 00:50:17,158
Let's eat.

794
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,099
That was delicious.

795
00:50:21,804 --> 00:50:23,798
Did you cook everything?

796
00:50:24,304 --> 00:50:26,843
I know I'm not a great cook, but I still tried my best.

797
00:50:26,844 --> 00:50:28,542
What do you mean you're not a great cook?

798
00:50:28,543 --> 00:50:31,138
Every time I come to Korea, you cook me a feast.

799
00:50:32,114 --> 00:50:34,638
Here's something to repay you for that.

800
00:50:36,484 --> 00:50:37,749
Here, Ms. Ji.

801
00:50:38,853 --> 00:50:39,979
Is it a thesis paper?

802
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:41,178
Yes.

803
00:50:41,223 --> 00:50:43,593
You have no idea how much I've waited for this very moment.

804
00:50:43,594 --> 00:50:45,448
The day I get to show you my thesis.

805
00:50:52,094 --> 00:50:53,999
Congratulations. I'm proud of you.

806
00:50:55,364 --> 00:50:59,138
By the way, have you heard from Mr. Paik?

807
00:50:59,703 --> 00:51:01,173
I think he may have changed his number.

808
00:51:01,174 --> 00:51:03,209
It's been so long since I've talked to him.

809
00:51:03,313 --> 00:51:05,068
He doesn't even read my emails anymore.

810
00:51:05,714 --> 00:51:08,079
I guess he's really concentrating on what he's doing.

811
00:51:08,513 --> 00:51:10,309
I heard he even took a leave from school.

812
00:51:10,453 --> 00:51:12,553
Back when he wrote the thesis that won the Lucifer Prize,

813
00:51:12,554 --> 00:51:14,722
he disappeared for a few years.

814
00:51:14,723 --> 00:51:16,452
That's probably why we can't get reach him.

815
00:51:16,453 --> 00:51:19,519
Still, do you think he'll show up to see me win the award?

816
00:51:20,163 --> 00:51:22,158
He promised to congratulate me.

817
00:51:23,194 --> 00:51:24,658
He'd better come.

818

Are these the kids in Calculus?

822
00:51:40,114 --> 00:51:41,209
Yes.

823
00:51:45,723 --> 00:51:46,818
Hey.

824
00:51:47,953 --> 00:51:49,023
Hello.

825
00:51:49,024 --> 00:51:50,193
Hello, Hardy.

826
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:51,452
Welcome, Hardy.

827
00:51:51,453 --> 00:51:54,492
- What is that? - "The Fun X".

828
00:51:54,493 --> 00:51:57,858
"The Fun X"? You're still doing that?

829
00:51:58,663 --> 00:52:01,363
How about I ask them a really hard math problem?

830
00:52:01,364 --> 00:52:03,829
If you do that, it might shock people.

831
00:52:04,034 --> 00:52:06,142
- Is it your turn today? - Yes.

832
00:52:06,143 --> 00:52:07,873
Hardy, what's today's math problem?

833
00:52:07,873 --> 00:52:09,068
(Hardy, what's today's math problem?)

834
00:52:09,243 --> 00:52:11,309
Here's another fun problem.

835
00:52:11,643 --> 00:52:13,542
Get rid of two corners...

836
00:52:13,543 --> 00:52:16,213
from a standard 8 by 8 chessboard.

837
00:52:16,214 --> 00:52:20,419
Let's say you have enough pieces like the one on the right.

838
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,253
Try using the pieces to cover the entire chessboard.

839
00:52:23,254 --> 00:52:24,952
This is fun.

840
00:52:24,953 --> 00:52:26,122
It's fun but hard.

841
00:52:26,123 --> 00:52:28,262
Hardy, your math problems are always amazing.

842
00:52:28,263 --> 00:52:30,459
Answer. Impossible.

843
00:52:31,234 --> 00:52:33,629
- What? - Did someone get it right?

844
00:52:34,263 --> 00:52:36,202
I knew 3cut would get it right.

845
00:52:36,203 --> 00:52:38,903
"3cut"? Is that a nickname?

846
00:52:38,904 --> 00:52:41,843
He's currently trying to solve the Riemann hypothesis.

The Riemann hypothesis?

849
00:52:45,114 --> 00:52:46,439
Sure he is.

850
00:52:46,444 --> 00:52:49,778
He's just saying whatever because that chat is anonymous.

851
00:52:49,984 --> 00:52:52,753
If he manages to solve the Riemann hypothesis,

852
00:52:52,754 --> 00:52:55,653
tell him I'll go ahead and try to solve Goldbach's conjecture.

(One of the best-known unsolved problems in number theory)

854

3cut, once again, you go the right answer.

855
00:53:01,123 --> 00:53:03,093
- He never disappoints. - He's so fast.

856
00:53:03,094 --> 00:53:04,593
Why is it impossible?

857
00:53:04,594 --> 00:53:06,533
Seeing that 3cut isn't replying,

858
00:53:06,534 --> 00:53:08,599
let me explain why.

859
00:53:36,763 --> 00:53:39,599
Hello, 3cut. This is Hardy.

860
00:53:39,904 --> 00:53:42,829
By any chance, have you read this thesis?

861
00:53:57,313 --> 00:54:00,682
"I read the thesis you sent me a couple of days ago."

862
00:54:00,683 --> 00:54:02,649
"It helped me out a lot."

863
00:54:03,393 --> 00:54:04,689
"Thank you."

864
00:54:07,163 --> 00:54:08,258
Really?

865
00:54:08,364 --> 00:54:11,988
I actually found a few more papers regarding the subject.

866
00:54:12,293 --> 00:54:13,858
Would you like me to send them to you too?

It's all thanks to you.

By the way, did Mr. Paik really not come today?

884
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,042
The association published that I'll be winning an award today,

885
00:55:31,042 --> 00:55:32,407
so he surely must've heard of it.

886

Are you Choi Si An, the winner of the award?

Yes, that's me.

888

Someone asked me to give you this.

889

He had to leave because of something urgent.

It's from Mr. Paik.

"Si An, congratulations on the award."

I can't believe he was here.

I just got a call from The Mathematics...

898

saying you passed the screening.

Everything's been verified now.

- I'm so impressed. - Thank you.

902

A lot of mathematicians tried to solve the problem,

903

but they failed.

904

The hypothesis remained unsolved for a very long time.

905

So I'm sure you were stuck every now and then.

906

How did you manage to solve it?

907
00:56:27,632 --> 00:56:29,497

Hello, 3cut.

This is the thesis I told you about last time.

I hope it helps.

912
00:57:00,373 --> 00:57:04,298
At first, it seemed irrelevant to what I was covering.

913
00:57:05,803 --> 00:57:08,008
And it really was irrelevant.

914
00:57:27,632 --> 00:57:30,898
When Andrew Wiles proved Fermat's Last Theorem,

915
00:57:31,332 --> 00:57:33,632
he got a huge hint from the elliptic equation,

916
00:57:33,632 --> 00:57:35,097
despite its irrelevance.

917
00:57:35,933 --> 00:57:38,867
Just like him, I was able to think of a brilliant idea.

918
00:57:39,973 --> 00:57:43,438
So someone laid the bridge for you to connect the dots...

919
00:57:43,783 --> 00:57:45,711
by helping you with something completely irrelevant?

Who was that person?
