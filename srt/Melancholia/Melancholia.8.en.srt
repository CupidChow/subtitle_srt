Say there! There is someone here.

15
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,830
Please open the door.

16
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,990
The doors are all locked.

17
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,700
Wait a moment.

18
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,990
Yes, hello. I'm here in the library of the Department of Natural Sciences.

19
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,950
The door is locked.

20
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,230
Yes, thank you.

21
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,760
He's coming.

22
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,460
Yeah.

23
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,060
It feels just like that day.

24
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,340
The first day we came here together.

<i>Melancholia?</i>

26
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,960

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,000
<i>Is it that book?</i>

28
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:36,390
Are you possibly teaching student Choi Si An? Right? At a tutoring academy.

29
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,960
I have a favor to ask of you. Please don't talk about me in the future to Si An.

30
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,190
That you won't do that again.

31
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,160
What you said was correct.

32
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:53,120
What kind of problem did you tell me not to fall in love with?

33
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,950
If you love a problem you want to solve, you lose your objecitivity and

34
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,420
you are swayed by your feelings.

35
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,440
I won't repeat the same error.

36
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:11,030
This time the same falling in love with a problem I want to solve won't happen.

37
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,700
Why are you saything that out of the blue?

38
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,900
- I am sorry. I thought everyone left. <br> - That's okay.

39
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,290
Aren't you going to give me some advice?

40
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,800
I've become a teacher.

41
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,860
Why at that school?

42
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,930
I may be jumping to a conclusion but if you have any purpose other than teaching to enter that school—

43
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,060
- What if there is? <br> - Don't do it.

44
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,050
- Why not? <br> - Can't you do something else?

45
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,460
Do something more noble?

46
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,400
No. Do something novel.

47
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,090
Although it's none of my business.

48
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,770
<i>Mathematics Came and Found Me</i>

49
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,630
- Who is it? <br> - It's Andy Carter.

50
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,860
He's an Ivy League entrance exam coordinator.

51
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,740
I heard you worked with him.

52
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,500
How would I dare work with Andy Carter? He's an expert in the field.

53
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,630
Is he?

54
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,580
The timing of the scandal breaking over his fraud in the exam two years ago

55
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,340
perfectly matches your return to Korea.

56
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,460
It's true that it was around the time I quit working on Ivy League counseling,

57
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,790
- but that was a coincidence. <br> - Is that right?

58
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,430
Then, it's very unfortunate. As for me...

59
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:18,900
I was looking for someone who could do precisely what Andy Carter did.

60
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,570
Please forgive my rudeness for barging in on you this way.

61
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,440
If I didn't do this, I didn't think I could have seen you.

62
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,830
Until next time, I'll see you out. Call me.

63
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,560
By the way, I heard you operate a special clinic.

64
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,170
It seems you brought in a very talented person.

65
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,230
It is not that I brought him in. I serve him.

66
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,260
Oh, is that so?

67
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,370
So if you want to differentiate between two intersecting functions, the connection must be smooth. Understand?

68
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,980
I understand.

69
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,140
Let's end today's class here. Solve the rest of the questions by next time.

70
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,880
Yes.

71
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,690
Oh, Noona. It just finished.

72
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,930
Okay.

73
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,720
- Was it your noona? <br> - Yes. She wants us to leave together since she's right out front.

74
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,330
Oh.

75
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,970
Hey, Seong Ye Rin.

76
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,090
- What do you think of him? Is he good at teaching? <br> - Possibly.

77
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,520
Hey. I'm popular in the private tutoring market.

78
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,060
When we were in school, I was better in math than you.

79
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,620
Noona, I'm going to an internet cafe with my friends.

80
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,740
- Please keep it a secret from Mom, okay? <br> - Hey!

81
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,870
- Did you buy a car? <br> - I said I am popular.

82
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,600
- You must be really popular. <br> - Get on. I'll take you home.

83
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,700
- Give me the key. <br> - Why? Will you drive?

84
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,700
Why? Are you scared?

85
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,630
Not at all.

86
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,400
Hey, Seong Ye Rin!

87
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,480
Your car handles well.

88
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,780
Naturally. How well does it handle?

89
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,750
Hey, hey, slow down.

90
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,470
Slow down. Hey, slow down!

91
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,490
Hey, there's a car!

92
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,010
Hey!

93
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,480
Excuse me! Please get out.

94
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,200
Excuse me. Please get out.

95
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,770
We didn't collide. Let's just go.

96
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,490
I was going that way first. The other car jumped out.

97
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,120
Put the window down for a second.

98

Baek Seung Yu?

99
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,430
What's going on?

100
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,080
Hey, are you riding a bike?

101
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,130
See you later.

102
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,480
The Director of School Affairs for Aseong Gifted School Noh Jeong Ah came.

103
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,200
- Did something happen? <br> - What brought her here?

104
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,400
Because your clinic is so famous, Noh Jeong Ah personally came.

105
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,380
So, did you talk about me?

106
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,530
No way. I didn't say a thing.

107
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:48,980
Don't worry. Everything about you is confidential and protected.

108
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,560
But then Director Noh Jeong Ah is also the mother of a child.

00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,700
How can you be fine?

160
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,060
Do you know what I am about to say,

161
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,060
how can you be fine?

162
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,130
You could have done as I told you.

163
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:46,390
It would have been enough if you quit the school, moved away and covered it all up.

164
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,820
Then, things wouldn't have turned so bad.

165
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,690
Let's...

166
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,360
not end this blaming each other.

167
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,330
It's all my fault.

168
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:11,770
I shouldn't have sent you to that school.

169
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,950
Then...

170
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,540
Don't think like that.

171
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:24,340
Because of this issue, you took the biggest hit.

00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,870
Oh, hello.

176
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,750
These are the documents I told you about.

177
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,610
Use them as reference only. Don't report them or use them as a tip.

178
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:36,340
I know. I wouldn't want to tell the world that this is an inside job.

179
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,000
I will leave it to your care.

180
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,080
By the way, can you tell me why you are disclosing such important information to me?

181
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,710
Shall I take your orders?

182
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,720
- I'd like a coffee. <br> - Bring two cups of Americano, please.

Seong Ye Rin, in the Mathematician Olympiad, didn't you?

00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,260
Today we will be practicing Pranayama, that helps to relieve stress.

187
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,180
We will start now.

188
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:13,700
Tuck in your tummy, tuck in your chin and straighten your back.

189
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,570
Lay down the back of your hands with palm facing upwards.

190
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:22,780
Look at the space between my eyebrows or close your eyes and breathe.

191
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,770
Breathe in deeply through your nose and

192
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,320
exhale deeply through your nose.

193
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,580
Excuse me, excuse me. My watch is missing. What do I do? My watch.

194
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,620
- At the locker room? <br> - Yes, just now.

195
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,340
Call the police, quick. It costs 30 million won.

196
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,640
What do I do, oh god, I really,

197
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,170
- Just a second. <br> - Sure.

<i>This is Top Math Academy.</i>

200
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,530
Do you happen to have an instructor named Ji Yun Su there?

201
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,500
<i>She quit. It's been quite a while.</i>

202
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,340
Oh, is that so?

203
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,480
Did she maybe go to another cademy?

204
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,310
Aigo! That punk!

205
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,770
Why Why again- what happened?

206
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,250
This bastard takes his parents as fools.

207
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:14,150
Without a word, why would he go to that school again leaving all other good places behind!

208
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,660
I won't leave him like this. I'm dragging him back by his collar right now.

209
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,900
Try dragging him back!

210
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,950
Don't you dare touch a hair on my son.

Otherwise we divorce right away. Do you get it?

212
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,080
And what? Without a word? Consult?

213
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,910
Do sons who cut off all relations with their parents discuss their careers?!

214
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,700
That kid takes care of himself well enough, look at you pestering him every chance you get,

215
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,670
which university are you going to, which research institute are you joining.

Omo, omo. Hello!

Hello.

224

Long time no see. This place hasn't changed.

I'll order some dessert.

I'll prepare the coffee.

Can you ask him to be nice to him?

230
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,180
Ah, right!

231
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:38,640
You haven't seen your son. My mistake—

232
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,190
It scared me.

After winning the Nobel prize why would he join his school?

234

It's good for us though, right?

235
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,080
Don't you agree?

236
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,070

What? Are you giving me all that?

And it's not Nobel Prize, it's Lucifer Prize!

Seriously. Either Nobel or Lucifer, you make me laugh!

Teacher Ji Yun Su helped you, right?

00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:53,560
Your essay was really well-done.

252
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,220
Really good.

253
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,020
I'm going to write a new thesis.

How many students from our school would like to participate?

I'm curious about you.

How you have lived so far, why you like math,

261
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:31,080
and how you met Teacher Ji Yun Su.

262
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,220
We met through a gambling game of Janggi*. <br> <i>Janggi: Korean Chess</i>

263
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,110
Gambling game of Janggi?

264
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,650
<i>Did I Janggi?</i>

265
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,790
<i>It's Janggi.</i>

266
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,920
<i>- Wow!<br>- She's good at this.</i>

267
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,030
Three consecutive wins.

268
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:56,990
<i>- Take it already.<br>- This child is really special, huh?</i>

269
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,400
<i>You are quite smart, aren't you?</i>

270
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,140
<i>- Once more. <br> - How much are you betting?</i>

271
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,170
<i>- How much are you thinking? <br> - 50,000 won.</i>

272
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,530
<i>50000 won is too much.</i>

273
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,350
<i>Any less than that is no fun.</i>

274
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,830
<i>Okay, good.</i>

275
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,450
<i>- There you go.<br>- I'm dying here.</i>

276
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,590
<i>- Go, go.<br>- Eat all the pieces.</i>

277
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,000
<i>- Let's watch her.<br>- Watch this!</i>

278
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,550
<i>Police, it's the Police.</i>

279
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,250
<i>It's the Police. Run quick! Run already!</i>

280
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,610
<i>Shit, I almost had him.</i>

281
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,770
<i>Aren't you a student?</i>

282
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,100
<i>Youngsters these days are gambling. What about your parents?</i>

283
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,870
<i>They're not home. I don't have parents.</i>

284
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:48,330
<i>Who is your guardian now? Contact them.</i>

285
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,970
<i>Make it quick.</i>

286
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,850
<i>I can't let you go otherwise.</i>

287
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,330
<i>They are all leaving with their guardians. You don't want to go home?</i>

288
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,780
From then on, teacher became my guardian.

289
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,750
She became my math teacher and also my friend.

290
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,760
So, you play Korean chess really well?

291
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,720
I'm good at GO and Chess too.

292
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,190
No one has won against me so far.

293
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,120
Then, after this, will you become a Chess player?

294
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,660
No. I want to become a math teacher like you.

295
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,930
Like me?

296
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,750
Ah, you dream big.

297
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,880
I will become one.

298
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,030
I will win the Lucifer prize and give that medal to teacher Ji Yun Su.

299
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,200
- What are you doing after class? <br> - Academy...

300
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,070
Let's go somewhere.

301
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:55,190
As you know, we have come together to discuss

302
00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:00,720
Aseong Gifted High School's management plan to offer a special global talent course of study.

303
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:09,550
Lucifer award winner Baek Seung Yu has become a part of our school.

304
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:13,270
He wants our kids to participate in his thesis project.

305
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:17,360
- Then will our children's names be mentioned in the paper? <br> - You're right.

306
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,340
And also, I wanted to announce this when it's confirmed but

307
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,400
we have decided to hire an International admission expert consultant, the best in the field.

308
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,420
It's great, indeed.

309
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:34,020
It will not be easy to achieve this within the school budget but we have to try.

310
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,890
As a Principal, you are putting in so much effort, we can't just stand by and watch.

311
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:41,520
We will also co-operate to raise development funds for school management.

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,170
We all agree, don't we?

313
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,820
Madam, here,

314
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:53,890
This is a product I am advertising for this time. Try this.

315
00:25:53,890 --> 00:26:00,010
You don't have wrinkles, but it is good to start managing early.

316
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,520
Tell me if you need more.

317
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:08,240
It is good. I will put it to good use.

Isn't that a Math museum in Germany?

325
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,100
Wouldn't it be great to have a math museum in our country too?

326
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,420
I tried to make a plan that is realistically possible.

00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,870

00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:25,290
Student Lee Hae Jun interprets the problem well but he lacks ideas.

330
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:29,560
He needs practice on how to put together what he learned.

331
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,010
Kim Won Hee and Lee Seul Ah have big gaps in their logic.

332
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:37,430
At this rate they might not get points in descriptive and essay-type questions so,

333
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,390
they have to organize their solution in detail.

334
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:42,300
I got it. I will convey your message to the instructors.

335
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,930
Sure.

336
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,330
Si An hasn't made any contact yet?

337
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,830
Yes, she didn't.

338
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,440
Okay.

As you know, she is the only one to score 100 in Math in the admission exam.

00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,690
She currently lives in a children's home..

Besides that does anything else stand out?

Nothing much,

We have to look into it from now.

349

Hello. <br><i>- Is this student Kim Ji Na's mother?</i>

Yes, I am.

351
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,960
It is the picture of the watch gone missing. We are investigating the members,

352
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,340
who used the women's locker room before the watch went missing.

353
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:00,900
There is no CCTV inside the locker room? How will you investigate?

354
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,160
And you can't be sure yet if it is stolen or lost, am I right?

355
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,600
We are actively verifying that with the eye-witness.

356

If there's something to talk about, contact me hereafter too.

Si An still hasn't been in touch?

She's real good, right?

365
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,890
She does it pretty well.

Very well.

00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:28,330

379
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,260
Teachers also need to rest.

380
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,280
Then, what do we do?

381
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,870
- Well, let's take a picture and continue where we left off next time.<br>- Yes.

382
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,650
So, both players, greet each other.

383
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,190
It was a good game, Professor.

384
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,550
See you next time.

385
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:47,090
Teacher! I'm sorry.

386
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,320
I was playing chess and lost track of time.

387
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,120
Chess?

388
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,310
Here there is an incredible master. He's really cool!

389
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,200
Get to the car.

390
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,790
Yes.

391
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,990
He's sleeping. We took him to his room and then left.

392
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:12,010
Why did you bring Si An at your will? I told you not to talk about me.

393
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:14,170
I didn't.

394
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,480
We were only playing chess. And Professor also enjoyed it.

395
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,960
- Aren't you hungry?<br> - Starving.

396
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,600
Let's eat something. I also didn't have dinner.

397
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,950
So, let's eat!

398
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,150
I'll enjoy the food!

399
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,820
- Teacher.<br> - Hm?

400
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,400
Who was that person earlier?

401
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,590
My master's master?

402
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:11,940
Among the theses he wrote, there is an interesting one.

403
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,620
- I will tell you the title, look for it.<br>- Right.

404
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,300
Teacher, aren't you eating?

405
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,680
Eat up. It's late.

406
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,740
The seaweed roll here is so soft, it's good.

407
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,140
Teacher Ji.

408
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,680
I got into Teacher Baek Seung Yu's project.

409
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,870
What project?

410
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:42,220
National Math museum making project. It sounds fun, right?

411
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:46,440
By the way, I heard that you taught teacher Baek Seung Yu.

412
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,190
That is really great. You raised such a mathematician.

413
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,920
- I didn't raise him. <br> - I don't agree.

414
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:58,330
Baek Seung Yu teacher says that he owes it to you and that professor from the hospital.

415
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,660
I told him I wanted to become a mathematician like him,

416
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,980
so he brought me there saying there is someone I have to meet.

417
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:10,110
After this when I become a mathematician, I'll definitely win the medal.

418
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:34,260
- Hello. <br> <i>- Baek Seung Yu, where are you?</i>

419

Go Aseong!

420
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,880
What is this about? You even invited me.

421
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,960
When we were in high school, we were not close.

422
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,920
But now we are best friends.

423
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,660
How many times did I tell you I'm a classmate, not a best friend?

424
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,980
I thought that when I got to college I would play and do whatever I wanted to.

425
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,490
But how come it is harder than high school?

426
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,610
Tell me about it. I don't even have time for love.

427
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:12,130
You don't have a boyfriend?

428
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,470
We just broke up.

429
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,880
- Hooray!<br> - How awful.

430
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,210
And you?

431
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,080
- What about me?<br> - Don't you have a boyfriend?

432
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,270
What's with you two?

433
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,500
Oh, here. Here.

434
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,810
- Seung Yu!<br> - Seung Yu!

435
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,760
What's the occasion all of a sudden?

436
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,360
We're curious about our Teacher Baek Seung Yu.

437
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,420
- What is it?<br> - Girlfriend. Do you have one?

438
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,130
There can't be. He's been stuck writing a thesis for years.

439
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,800
So maybe, your girlfriend is mathematics. You're in love with math.

440
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,360
- You can't do it like this.<br> - Cut it.

441
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,890
How's school? How are the classes with the kids?

442
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:44,890
It must not be easy. Kids these days are scary.

443
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:47,200
Were we different?

444
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,550
Was that directed to me?

445
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,680
You were a bully.

446
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,470
But Seung Yu, was it ever your dream to be a teacher?

447
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,270
No.

448
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:59,230
Then why are you one now? You even dropped out of school.

449
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,100
Excuse me a moment.

450
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,540
- Hey?<br> - Are you going already?

451
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,810
- Huh?<br>- Where are you going?

452
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,580
- Where are you going?<br> - Seung Yu has a girlfriend.

453
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,870
Ay, no way!

454
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,700
Never! If he has a girlfriend,

455
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,190
then I'm dating Lee Yeon Ja!

456
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:22,600
<i>Teacher, thank you for taking me there today. I would like to go again.</i>

457
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,590
<i>Choi Si An</i>

458
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:32,280
<i>- Hello?</i><br>- Hi.

Did you get back safely?

460
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,610
What about teacher Ji Yun Su?

461
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:42,790
Okay, is there anything else?

462
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:45,760
Okay, sleep well. See you tomorrow.

463
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:54,370
Everyone thinks it is a surprise, but I think this choice suits you.

464
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:58,120
But don't fight.

465
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,860
Only the name has changed,

466
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,070
the school is exactly the same as before.

467

Who says I'm here to fight?

468
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,080
You said you were going to share your luck.

469
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,600
That's not a place where you share what you have.

470
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,990
It is a place where you can survive by taking from others.

471
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,250
So,

472
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,130
are you happy?

473
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,060
You took a lot from others too, didn't you?

474
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:28,090
What are you talking about?

475
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,590
It's a joke, a joke.

476
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,910
Can't I make a joke?

477
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,530
You changed your phone number, right? Write it down.

478
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,680
Let's meet again.

479
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:34,180
Unless the witness makes a statement, if the police cannot identify a suspect,

480
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,770
there's no way to prove the locker room theft. Is that so?

481
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,130
Tell me about it.

482
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,060
Thank you, Lawyer Jang.

483
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,000
- Hey, Min Yeong. Hi! <br> - Hi!

484
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,400
Hi!

485
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,110
- What? <br> - Isn't that Choi Si An? Why is she here?

486
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,630
I don't know.

487
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,380
What? Choi Si An will be joining us?

488
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,360
- I can't believe it. Does she have some supporter?

489
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,570
- Hi! <br> - Hello.

490
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:32,340
You guys are the members participating in my research.

491
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,030
National Math Museum making project.

492
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,840
On that note, I will give your first assignment.

493
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,700
We will have a session where you introduce and present one idea each for the exhibits.

494
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,160
- Have it ready by the next class. <br> - Yes.

495
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,360
Shall we start class?

496
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,410
Are you preparing your speech?

497
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:01,700
I am organizing the documents I have to make a copy of.

498
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,090
You? How is your preparation coming along?

499
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:07,370
No, I couldn't even start yet.

500
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,630
Oh, I'm sorry. I have to get going.

501
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,110
After making a copy of these, I have to go to the Internet Cafe.

502
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,380
Internet Cafe? Why?

503
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,770
To work on my PPT.

504
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,020
Use mine.

505
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,040
I will lend you mine.

506
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,990
- Why would you lend me your notebook? <br> - I'm not sure, maybe,

507
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,440
because you're my friend.

508
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,450
Friend?

509
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,680
You don't want it?

510
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,760
That's not it.

511
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,890
Thank you Kim Ji Na.

512
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:58,160
It is perfect for using in tutoring classes.

513
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,870
Since it's quiet, parents prefer this too.

514
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:04,390
It's good. I will browse through some more.

515
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:08,620
It is quite popular these days. As soon as our product hits the market,

516
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,920
it sells out quickly.

517

519
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:57,820
Teach, we got our first assignment for Teacher Baek Seung Yu's project.

520
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:02,610
He wants us to bring ideas for the exhibits for a national math museum. It sounds really fun, doesn't it?

521
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:05,140
So, what will you prepare?

522
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,530
I thought of something using my skill.

523
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,520
I want to do it in a speech format.

524
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,570
Speech?

525
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:16,770
Yes, a math speech. That's cool too, right?

Are you just getting here?

532
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,560
How did you...?

533
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,840
Gyu Yeong saw you.

534
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:26,620
It is no big deal. It's fine but if you don't want to run into him, be careful.

535
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,000
I heard that you put Si An in your project.

536
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,220
Why are you being good to her?

537
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:55,760
She likes math, she is good at it,

538
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,570
and above all, it is her dream to become a mathematician like me.

539
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,730
It makes me proud.

540
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:14,760
I know this expression very well.

Not wanting to meet or chat with anyone.

543

I want to make you laugh.

544
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,160
At least through Si An.

Public lecture?

561
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:35,800
A lot of people will be interested in Korea's Math Museum project.

562
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,260
We need the publicity to make the museum a reality.

563
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:46,400
What do you think about doing a live broadcast through our school's official channel?

564
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,400
We could have people from the Office of Education, scholars, math teachers and students also attend.

565
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:55,810
Let's do that.

566

First speaker is Student Gyeong Su Yeong.

586
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,890
That is all. I hereby conclude my presentation.

587

Thank you.

588

There are quite a lot of interesting topics today.

589
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:47,000
The next speaker is Student Kim Ji Na.

590
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,900
I will start my presentation now.

591
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,310
<i>Math Museum project <br> Public lecture</i>

592
00:49:55,310 --> 00:50:00,910
The idea I have is to make a board game that adopts counting techniques.

593
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:04,610
There is a place called Enigma Café in the New York Math Museum.

594
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:08,370
It uses games to practice math principles.

595
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:12,540
Using the traditional games of our country, I want to make a board game that practices

596
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:18,080
math skills like counting techniques, probability, shortest distance.

597
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,270
That is a nice approach.

598
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:26,840
Then you have to come up with gameplay and rules. Have you referred anything?

599
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,570
As the fundamental process, I want to use Yunnori* <br> <i>Yunnori: traditional Korean board game.</i>

600
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,960
and then add strategic rules like GO or Korean chess.

601
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,060
I am looking forward to how you will develop the game. You did well.

602
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,350
Thank you.

603
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:54,100
The last speaker is Student Choi Si An.

604
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:02,940
Si An?

605
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:13,920
<i>Open Class</i>

606
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,030
You can start now.

607
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,550
<i>I'm presenter Choi Si An starting my presentation.</i>

608
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:31,700
The theme of my presentation is a board game with math.

609
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:35,150
<i>A Board Game With Math <br>Global Talent Class <br> Choi Si An</i>

610

<i>A Board Game With Math</i>

611
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:48,870
Truthfully, my presentation is quite similar to Ji Na's.

612
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:52,160
So shameless.

613
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:56,760
Should I still proceed, Teacher?

614
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:05,540
What is this?

615
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:14,090
What happened?

616
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:17,470
Kim Ji Na stole my presentation.

617
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:20,460
I did? How?

618
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,780
You lent me your notebook, didn't you?

619
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,360
My presentation files are still there in your notebook.

620
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:30,240
You didn't see my presentation files in my notebook?

621
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,910
What? I am sure you told me you didn't start yet.

622
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:36,370
When did I? Can you prove I said that?

623
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:38,830
Just a minute.

624
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:43,590
If this is not a coincidence and someone stole the other's files,

625
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:47,600
say the truth right now.

626
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,530
This project is not extraordinary enough to lie.

627
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:52,510
I didn't steal.

628
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:56,280
- Me too. <br> - Hey, Kim Ji Na, tell the truth.

629
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,640
I thought you lent me your notebook because I am your friend.

630
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,420
- You planned to steal from the start, didn't you? <br> - Silence!

631
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,050
Let's deal with it like this.

632
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:11,440
Coming Monday, we will give them a chance to explain themselves,

633
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,160
and anyone who can prove themselves will do so.

634
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:25,520
After that, the person who in the wrong will be expelled from this project.

635
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,760
That falls under my authority.

636
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,120
Discuss with me first.

637
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,390
About that,

638
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,340
Stealing a 30 million won watch was not enough,

639
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,970
now you have started stealing assignments too?

640
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,950
What are you talking about?

641
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:17,620
Are you asking because you don't know?

642
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:22,370
Meditation class. I had to stop by at the police station because of that.

643
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,540
What do you mean by Meditation class?

644
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,940
I have no idea what you are talking about.

645
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,370
Won't you shut your mouth?

646
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:43,170
Lie or steal, to some extent I can turn a blind eye.

647
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:45,360
But this is my school.

648
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:50,760
None of that should ruin my school's honor or dignity.

649
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,820
Do you understand?

650
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,640
- Mom, <br> - It's Principal Ma'am.

651
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,750
Yes, Principal Ma'am.

652
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:06,700
Principal Ma'am, are you sure you are protecting those?

653
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,400
The honor and dignity of this school?

654
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,220
What?

655
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,540
I didn't steal them.

656
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:18,940
Neither the watch nor the assignment.

657
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:36,060
Besides Ji Na did you show the assignment to anyone else?

658
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:39,420
Teacher Yun Su read through it.

659
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,430
In any case, you are sure you did no wrong, right?

660
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:44,690
I never stole.

661
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:46,440
I'll prove it no matter what.

662
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:53,540
Tell me the exact place, date and time when you borrowed Ji Na's notebook.

663
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:12,290
Is that true?

664
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:16,410
I will take a look. Arrange an orientation program.

665
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:18,310
Okay, I will. I will inform them.

666
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:23,280
Also, I want to meet with that kid's mother.

667
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,100
Directly?

668
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:26,880
Yes.

669
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,980
I understand.

670
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:45,510
<i>Applied by: No Jeong Ah <br> Student information <br> Name Kim Ji Na</i>

671
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,290
Hello?

672
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:16,390
She has reserved Western Cape CC.

673
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:21,950
Also, executive Seong Min Joon recently met with the Chief of Gangnam district.

674
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:23,010
For what?

675
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:27,180
I'm not sure. What I am sure about is, after the meeting,

676
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:31,860
he requested withdrawal of the land development plans saying that he would make another one.

677
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,380
I will look into it.

678
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:36,370
- Are you still out? <br> - <i>Yes.</i>

679
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:39,840
We will talk again later.

<i>Principal No Yeon Wu</i>

681

Yun Su.

682
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:14,190
It's been a long time.

683
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:18,180
How are you?

684
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,850
Did you follow me?

685
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:25,100
Yes. I did, I am sorry.

686
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,140
You are surprised, right?

687
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,540
Can I talk to you?

688
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,360
I have nothing to say.

689
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,660
I have something to say.

690
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:40,800
I don't know how you found me, but don't trail me anymore.

691
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,410
Don't investigate behind my back either.
