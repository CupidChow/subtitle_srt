I'm sure the recent article came to everyone as a shock.

13
00:01:32,324 --> 00:01:36,395
According to the article, our school is full of special favours.

Special favours.

These days, it's called an opportunity.

An opportunity given to someone thanks to his or her parents,

And it's true.

19
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:52,574
Our students are doing well thanks to those opportunities.

23
00:01:59,284 --> 00:02:01,215
A long time ago, during the Qing Dynasty,

24
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:04,855
one scholar consecutively failed to pass the civil service exam.

25
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:07,695
As he was about to hang himself, he suddenly thought it was unfair.

26
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,165
So he decided to ask Jade Emperor before he died.

27
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:12,564
"I tried so hard to study for that test."

28
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:13,995
"But why can't I ever pass?"

29
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:16,841
"Those who passed are less competent and didn't even try as hard."

30
00:02:16,865 --> 00:02:18,305
"How is it that they pass the test?"

31
00:02:19,604 --> 00:02:23,305
To answer his question, the Jade Emperor called two deities.

(Asung High School)

33

The deity of endeavour and the deity of fate.

34
00:02:27,575 --> 00:02:29,455
He made the two deities have a drinking battle.

35
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:31,884
How do you think that ended?

36
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,814
The deity of fate drank seven glasses...

37
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:38,425
while the deity of endeavour only drank three.

38
00:02:40,654 --> 00:02:42,395
That's the story behind the saying,

39
00:02:43,124 --> 00:02:44,644
"Luck plays a bigger role than skill."

40
00:02:45,694 --> 00:02:49,865
No matter how hard you try, you can't beat luck.

41
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:51,850
- That's gibberish. - Our students were born with luck,

but people say they're being favoured.

43
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,305
But what would they say if I ask them this?

44
00:02:57,374 --> 00:03:00,215
"If you could choose between working hard and being lucky,"

45
00:03:00,575 --> 00:03:02,344
"which one would you choose?"

46

We live in a world where luck outperforms hard work.

47
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,284
That's nonsense.

48

I can't believe she came here.

Don't fabricate the story, Ms. Noh.

53
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:31,275
The deity of endeavour wasn't the one who drank with the deity of fate.

54
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:32,675
What is she saying?

55
00:03:39,555 --> 00:03:42,485
It was the deity of justice,

56
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:45,215
which means the true meaning behind the story is this.

57
00:03:46,194 --> 00:03:48,154
"Although people can get lucky,"

58
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,465
"justice still exists."

59
00:03:51,295 --> 00:03:53,594
"Therefore, luck isn't everything."

remember what I just said.

00:10:58,384 --> 00:10:59,994
Did the moms get together?

167
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:02,665
- We're here for lobster. - We're here for lobster.

168
00:11:05,425 --> 00:11:07,195
Ji Na's so pretty.

169
00:11:34,524 --> 00:11:35,724
Everyone.

170
00:11:36,465 --> 00:11:38,494
Moms of Asung High's students...

171
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,594
got together for dinner,

172
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:43,565
but it just so happens that today...

173
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:46,974
is the birthday of Ms. Noh, our Director of School Affairs.

174
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:49,344
Shall we all raise our glasses?

175
00:11:49,445 --> 00:11:50,445
- Yes. - Yes.

176
00:11:50,504 --> 00:11:52,244
Ms. Noh, happy birthday.

177
00:11:52,305 --> 00:11:53,815
- Happy birthday. - Happy birthday.

178
00:11:53,874 --> 00:11:56,185
- Happy birthday. - Long live Ms. Noh!

179
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,215
Why don't you say a few words?

180
00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:07,094
First of all, thank you for your well-wishes.

181
00:12:07,555 --> 00:12:09,364
The second semester starts soon,

182
00:12:09,425 --> 00:12:11,271
and as Asung High's Director of School Affairs,

183
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:13,065
I would like to say something.

184
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:17,065
Educational policies are continuously changing,

185
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:18,565
and I know you're concerned.

186
00:12:18,965 --> 00:12:21,705
One sentence on the news and your hearts sink.

187
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,375
"We'll shut down autonomous private schools."

188
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:25,815
"We'll reduce early admissions."

189
00:12:26,244 --> 00:12:27,774
"We'll standardize high schools."

190
00:12:28,445 --> 00:12:31,984
The government is basically levelling us down.

191
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,254
But levelling down our Asung students...

192
00:12:36,325 --> 00:12:38,524
won't make them ordinary.

193
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,354
Our children are special,

194
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:43,465
and we'll provide a distinct education accordingly.

195
00:12:43,524 --> 00:12:47,835
Will it be okay to stray too far from the policies?

196
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:50,565
Of course not.

197
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:53,335
That's why, starting this semester,

198
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,950
we'll take part in the trial running of...

199
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:58,305
the government's new policy, the high school credit system.

200
00:13:00,315 --> 00:13:01,844
- The credit system? - Yes.

201
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:05,815
However, we'll do it the Asung way. The special way.

202
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,474
(Dad)

203
00:14:02,335 --> 00:14:03,344
Math.

204
00:14:03,445 --> 00:14:07,215
To many students, it enlists fear and despair.

205
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:10,884
But it's the one subject that sets students apart...

206
00:14:10,945 --> 00:14:12,344
in the entrance exam.

207
00:14:12,555 --> 00:14:14,754
Our school will have a distinct...

208
00:14:14,815 --> 00:14:17,285
upper-level math class.

209
00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:24,364
And to teach that class, we hired a very special teacher.

210
00:14:26,835 --> 00:14:28,435
Asung High School will hire...

211
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:31,264
a skilled teacher, many of whose students...

212
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:34,774
won Olympiads and other math competitions.

213
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:36,744
Name, Ji Yoon Su.

214
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:38,244
She's an Asung graduate.

215
00:14:38,305 --> 00:14:39,575
Class of 2005.

216
00:14:39,874 --> 00:14:41,974
Majored Math Education at Hankuk University.

217
00:14:42,045 --> 00:14:44,844
She taught at Cheongju's Cheongan High School since 2012.

218
00:14:44,915 --> 00:14:48,484
In the past few years, many of her students won Math Olympiads.

219
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,724
What's notable is none of those students...

220
00:14:50,785 --> 00:14:52,354
had any private tutors.

221
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,455
Only by attending their regular math classes,

222
00:14:54,524 --> 00:14:58,825
they prepared for the competitions and won.

223
00:14:59,124 --> 00:15:00,134
Are you sure?

224
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:02,435
That makes no sense at all.

225
00:15:02,494 --> 00:15:04,665
Kids from specialized schools for the gifted...

226
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:06,774
or science high schools usually win those things,

227
00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:09,675
and you're saying kids from an ordinary school beat them.

228
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:10,774
That's right.

229
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:12,915
The secret is...

230
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:15,215
this.

231
00:15:17,744 --> 00:15:20,014
I'm leaving now. See you soon.

232
00:15:20,655 --> 00:15:21,984
Okay. Get here safe.

233
00:15:23,854 --> 00:15:24,854
Sorry.

234
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:28,195
Oh no.

235
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:53,984
Excuse me.

236
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:40,764
How old?

237
00:16:41,795 --> 00:16:43,504
- You're six? - Yes.

238
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:19,574
(Father)

239
00:17:26,774 --> 00:17:27,814
Hello.

240
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,175
Hello, Hardy.

241
00:17:29,244 --> 00:17:30,945
Hardy is giving the question today, right?

242
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:33,355
That's right. Okay, let's start.

243
00:17:33,415 --> 00:17:36,625
Today, it's a fun question that doesn't require a formula.

244
00:17:37,784 --> 00:17:40,095
A six-year-old girl who lives on Earth...

245
00:17:40,155 --> 00:17:43,794
got on a train leaving from home heading south.

246
00:17:43,865 --> 00:17:47,595
She went 1km and saw a bear and chased it 1km east.

247
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:50,435
Then she went 1km north...

248
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:52,705
and ended up at home where she started.

249
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:56,875
Here's the question.

250
00:17:57,205 --> 00:17:59,945
What colour is the bear that the girl saw?

251
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:08,185
- The colour of the bear? - That's ridiculous.

252
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,254
She went south, east, then north.

253
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:11,884
And she went back to where she started?

254
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:42,894
Read the question carefully and you'll see it.

255
00:18:43,024 --> 00:18:45,084
- I don't see it. - It's too hard.

256
00:18:45,355 --> 00:18:46,355
White.

257
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:49,595
Correct.

258
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:51,824
(Correct)

259
00:18:55,064 --> 00:18:56,834
Please hurry!

260
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:00,834
Sorry.

261
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,145
White? A polar bear?

262
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:07,415
Why is it a polar bear?

263
00:19:08,474 --> 00:19:11,385
Will 3cut, who got the answer, please explain?

264
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:13,365
(Will 3cut, who got the answer, please explain?)

265
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,324
Since 3cut isn't responding,

266
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,724
I'll explain.

267
00:19:24,794 --> 00:19:27,895
You need to think outside the box in order to solve this question.

268
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:31,804
You must wonder what if the land isn't flat?

269
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:34,605
That was why you specified that she lived on Earth.

270
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,175
Correct.

271
00:19:36,445 --> 00:19:40,314
1km like this, another 1km, and then another 1km.

272
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:43,415
Since she lives on the North Pole, it was a white polar bear.

273
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:29,965
(You made math fun.)

274
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,240
(I'm going to be a math teacher just like you.)

275
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:36,165
(I'll study hard and follow in your footsteps! Hye Jin)

276
00:22:00,254 --> 00:22:04,284
A train is approaching.

277
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,224
We've arrived at Seoul Station.

278
00:22:07,724 --> 00:22:10,365
Please make sure you have your belongings.

279
00:22:11,024 --> 00:22:12,524
That's right.

280
00:22:12,595 --> 00:22:14,595
Sorry. Excuse me.

281
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:17,304
Excuse me. Sorry.

282
00:22:17,935 --> 00:22:18,935
Sorry.

00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:31,984
Thank you.

Hi. I just arrived.

285
00:22:48,165 --> 00:22:49,165
Hi.

286
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:51,734
You must be tired.

287
00:22:52,534 --> 00:22:54,135
Sorry I couldn't pick you up.

288
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:56,974
I was swamped with work. I just finished.

289
00:22:57,574 --> 00:23:00,445
It's okay. It's nice taking the train.

290
00:23:00,514 --> 00:23:02,514
- Me too. - What?

291
00:23:02,574 --> 00:23:04,784
It's nice seeing you.

292
00:23:09,784 --> 00:23:11,455
It won't let me hug you.

293
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:12,824
Let's go.

294
00:23:13,355 --> 00:23:14,795
You didn't forget anything, did you?

295
00:23:17,024 --> 00:23:18,024
No.

296
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:24,635
Careful. It's dark.

297
00:23:24,705 --> 00:23:25,804
Stay here.

298
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:28,534
One, two, three.

299
00:23:29,905 --> 00:23:30,905
Ta-Da.

300
00:23:32,405 --> 00:23:35,314
Should I sing that song? Never mind.

301
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:38,544
So... I put your stuff here and there.

302
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:40,814
You had a bunch of stuff.

303
00:23:40,955 --> 00:23:42,584
You need to throw out some things.

304
00:23:43,385 --> 00:23:47,054
So, all the furniture is here.

305
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,155
Yes. Mother sent them.

306
00:23:49,965 --> 00:23:52,724
We have a lot to do with just wedding planning.

307
00:23:52,794 --> 00:23:53,794
Okay.

308
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:01,175
Why? You don't like it?

309
00:24:01,234 --> 00:24:02,574
That's not it.

310
00:24:03,274 --> 00:24:04,954
We have everything already from the start.

311
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,074
What do you mean?

312
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,474
Open the cupboard.

313
00:24:08,544 --> 00:24:10,314
They're completely empty.

314
00:24:10,385 --> 00:24:12,715
We have to fill them ourselves.

315
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:17,224
Okay. I'll do that.

316
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:21,655
Working at Asung will help your career.

317
00:24:22,054 --> 00:24:25,764
It'll soon be a specialized school for math and arts.

318
00:24:26,595 --> 00:24:28,294
A specialized school.

319
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:30,965
That sounds fancy.

320
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:36,905
- Oh no. - What now?

321
00:24:37,145 --> 00:24:38,205
Did you lose something?

322
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,175
Thank you.

323
00:24:45,615 --> 00:24:47,084
Was it 1729?

324
00:24:53,355 --> 00:24:54,554
He's home.

325
00:24:57,294 --> 00:24:58,294
Seung Yoo.

326
00:24:58,365 --> 00:24:59,764
Where have you been?

327
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,494
Why didn't you answer your phone?

328
00:25:02,095 --> 00:25:03,975
I heard you skipped today's counselling session.

329
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:05,834

Could you give us a hint?

542

A hint?

543
00:39:34,084 --> 00:39:35,843
Through any given point not on a line,

544
00:39:36,383 --> 00:39:40,084
there passes exactly one line parallel to that line.

545
00:39:41,524 --> 00:39:43,683
That is Euclid's parallel postulate.

546
00:39:43,754 --> 00:39:46,354
For over 2,000 years, no mathematician doubted it.

547
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:49,894
But in the 19th century, a young man had a thought.

548
00:39:50,424 --> 00:39:52,933
"Is this self-explanatory"?

549
00:39:54,033 --> 00:39:58,403
The young man's father dissuaded his son from his fixation,

550
00:39:58,473 --> 00:39:59,903
but he said this.

"Dad. I am starting from nothing..."

"to create a completely different world."

553

That young man was Janos Bolyai.

554
00:40:14,953 --> 00:40:17,823
That's how non-Euclidean geometry was born.

You can't just leave.

823
01:00:52,629 --> 01:00:53,828
Seung Yoo!

824
01:01:27,859 --> 01:01:31,029
- Hi. - Hello.

825
01:01:36,368 --> 01:01:38,978
First, let me talk to you about the math club.

826
01:01:39,038 --> 01:01:40,308
As you all know,

827
01:01:40,379 --> 01:01:42,978
we already got an answer for the first question.

828
01:01:43,049 --> 01:01:44,109
"False premise."

829
01:01:45,279 --> 01:01:47,448
I know you're not used to solving math questions...

830
01:01:47,518 --> 01:01:49,248
with no definite answer.

831
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:52,518
But that's what makes it so similar to our lives.

832
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:55,629
We live in a world full of errors...

833
01:01:55,689 --> 01:01:59,198
along with incomprehensible and insoluble questions.

834
01:01:59,658 --> 01:02:01,728
Is the next question going to be something similar?

835
01:02:02,428 --> 01:02:03,629
I haven't decided yet.

836
01:02:04,129 --> 01:02:07,339
By the way, the person who solved the question is in this class.

837
01:02:07,399 --> 01:02:08,569
- What? - What?

838
01:02:08,638 --> 01:02:10,209
- Really? - Who is it?

839
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:11,839
- Who solved it? - Who was it?

840
01:02:13,078 --> 01:02:14,078
Ye Rin.

841
01:02:16,178 --> 01:02:17,978
Can you explain to your friends...

842
01:02:19,219 --> 01:02:20,899
why that problem had an incorrect premise?

843
01:02:21,248 --> 01:02:23,848
- My gosh. - Nice, Ye Rin.

844
01:02:23,919 --> 01:02:26,589
- You're amazing. - Ye Rin.

845
01:02:26,658 --> 01:02:28,489
- Great job. - Go on, Ye Rin.

846
01:02:28,558 --> 01:02:30,658
- Unbelievable. - You're so smart.

847
01:04:03,348 --> 01:04:04,348
Ye Rin.

848
01:04:07,459 --> 01:04:09,259
You don't remember.

849
01:04:11,629 --> 01:04:12,629
No.

850
01:04:15,998 --> 01:04:19,038
I apologize. Having to solve it suddenly...

851
01:04:22,169 --> 01:04:23,169
Take your seat.

852
01:04:31,009 --> 01:04:34,078
I will explain it for you.

853
01:04:49,629 --> 01:04:51,698
(Math)

854
01:05:02,279 --> 01:05:03,448
What happened?

855
01:05:06,879 --> 01:05:07,879
Ye Rin.

856
01:05:09,919 --> 01:05:10,989
"You did great."

857
01:05:12,419 --> 01:05:13,459
No one...

858
01:05:14,618 --> 01:05:16,288
ever said that to me.

859
01:05:18,828 --> 01:05:23,069
"Your answer is wrong" is what I heard the most...

860
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:25,129
since I started learning math.

861
01:05:30,408 --> 01:05:32,379
I'm sorry I lied.

862
01:05:47,558 --> 01:05:48,989
Then who are you?

863
01:05:53,328 --> 01:05:54,328
Hey!

864
01:06:00,299 --> 01:06:01,469
Okay. Eyes!

865
01:06:08,908 --> 01:06:10,879
Double beat.

866
01:06:13,078 --> 01:06:14,078
One.

867
01:06:15,549 --> 01:06:17,219
Ms. Ji, right?

868
01:06:18,018 --> 01:06:19,018
Ms. Ji.

869
01:06:19,089 --> 01:06:21,019
- Hello. - Hello.

870
01:06:21,089 --> 01:06:23,459
- We are Project... - D.

871
01:06:24,089 --> 01:06:25,799
You appeared in our video,

872
01:06:25,858 --> 01:06:27,898
so now you're a Project D member.

873
01:06:27,959 --> 01:06:28,998
Congratulations.

874
01:06:30,828 --> 01:06:32,698
Would you like to see the video?

875
01:06:33,269 --> 01:06:35,868
Dance is more about feel than technique.

876
01:06:35,938 --> 01:06:38,679
Feel. Please watch our expressions.

877
01:06:39,009 --> 01:06:40,009
Okay.

878
01:06:41,108 --> 01:06:42,248
Nice look.

879
01:06:42,309 --> 01:06:43,948
We're preparing for a competition.

880
01:06:44,009 --> 01:06:45,929
- We're always practicing. - Here's another one.

881
01:06:55,459 --> 01:06:56,459
Oh, wait.

882
01:06:58,129 --> 01:07:00,328
How long have you been filming?

883
01:07:04,429 --> 01:07:06,669
- What do you do for free period? - Why?

884
01:07:07,299 --> 01:07:08,969
I don't want our portfolios to overlap.

885
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:11,408
I'm not in Math Camp Prep.

886
01:07:11,438 --> 01:07:12,438
Don't worry.

887
01:07:13,139 --> 01:07:15,648
That solution. It wasn't you, was it?

888
01:07:17,809 --> 01:07:19,349
You're hardly that good.

889
01:07:24,349 --> 01:07:25,759
Who is it, then?

890
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:32,259
Press, up, press, up.

891
01:07:32,629 --> 01:07:33,929
Press, up.

892
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:37,099
- You're really into this. - Do I look cool?

893
01:07:37,898 --> 01:07:39,299
It's 1729 again.

894
01:07:40,698 --> 01:07:43,639
Do you like math?

895
01:07:47,538 --> 01:07:49,179
Ms. Ji, fill in a membership form.

896
01:08:07,698 --> 01:08:11,368
Go way down and stretch.

897
01:08:19,608 --> 01:08:21,009

Baek Seung Yoo?

906
01:10:56,068 --> 01:10:58,469
Can I see his file for the previous semester?

907
01:10:58,629 --> 01:11:00,538
Still, you have to do well.

908
01:11:00,599 --> 01:11:02,868
Or I will give up on you.

The International Olympic of Mathematicians...

910

will host a competition for middle and high school kids.

911

They spent the night together. Ms. Ji Yoon Su and that student.

No. I won't do it!

913
01:11:13,479 --> 01:11:14,578
Fill this cabinet!

914
01:11:14,648 --> 01:11:16,788
You can't do anything you want until this is full.

915
01:11:17,089 --> 01:11:18,719
I know it and so do you.
