I told her that Sung Ye Rin's mother...

17
00:01:51,318 --> 00:01:53,487
asked me to give her the answers to the math exam...

and that I refused.

19

But Ms. Noh, who was a director back then,

20
00:01:57,558 --> 00:01:59,698
told me to give them to her anyway.

Now and even in the future.

25
00:02:10,308 --> 00:02:11,937
The answer and formula Sung Ye Rin used...

So I raised questions regarding the issue,

29

and after the midterm exams,

30
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:22,547
the school gathered a committee to check the issue.

However...

"That's the only way to invalidate the previous test."

36
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:42,807
That was the order she gave me.

37
00:02:43,607 --> 00:02:45,237
However, there was no retest...

38
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:46,908
because one student showed us...

39
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:50,117
that he solved the math problem using his creativity...

40
00:02:50,577 --> 00:02:53,587
and proved that it wasn't irrelevant to the stuff he learned in class.

I bet you were always anxious,

without telling Principal Noh.

You wanted to be prepared for the worst-case scenario,

67

165
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,138
I can smile now.

166
00:10:28,138 --> 00:10:29,977
You made me smile, Seung Yoo.

167
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:33,108
So don't worry about me anymore.

168
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:36,547
One day, I will go back to school,

169
00:10:36,618 --> 00:10:38,677
and I'll teach like before.

170
00:10:42,788 --> 00:10:46,557
You're now capable of solving any problem without getting hurt.

171
00:10:46,628 --> 00:10:48,128
You're strong and firm.

172
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:52,957
I said you would accomplish that one day.

173
00:10:54,398 --> 00:10:55,467
So...

174
00:10:56,638 --> 00:10:58,097
you keep going on proving.

175
00:10:59,738 --> 00:11:01,207
Not about us,

176
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:04,508
but something more beautiful and worthwhile.

177
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:09,248
You can do that.

178
00:11:24,628 --> 00:11:26,628
- What? - Let's wrap it up.

179
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:28,567
Call off the engagement.

180
00:11:29,097 --> 00:11:30,738
Why do you want to end it?

181
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:32,768
Why don't you want to end it?

182
00:11:33,268 --> 00:11:35,437
Yes, we were partners at first.

183
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:38,138
But I fell for you, Sung Jae. Was that bad of me?

184
00:11:38,207 --> 00:11:39,437
Did you like me?

185
00:11:39,707 --> 00:11:40,947
Didn't you just want to...

186
00:11:41,008 --> 00:11:43,047
show off to Yoon Su that you had won me?

187
00:11:44,347 --> 00:11:47,918
You're right. I want to show her. Can't I do that?

188
00:11:47,988 --> 00:11:51,087
Do you think having me is anything to brag about to her?

189
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:54,028
Don't you get it?

190
00:11:54,288 --> 00:11:55,788
The more you do this,

191
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:57,827
the worse we'll look.

192
00:11:59,398 --> 00:12:01,697
Why didn't you just focus on our deal?

193
00:12:03,238 --> 00:12:06,067
Then we wouldn't have had to feel so rotten.

194
00:12:16,477 --> 00:12:17,677
Have you eaten?

195
00:12:20,388 --> 00:12:22,118
What's that? When did you come over?

196
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,687
I'm hungry.

197
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:27,988
Let's eat.

198
00:12:35,998 --> 00:12:38,097
Weren't you unable to eat raw fish?

199
00:12:38,768 --> 00:12:40,807
What are you saying? It's so delicious.

200
00:12:43,307 --> 00:12:44,408
Did he dump you?

201
00:12:46,008 --> 00:12:47,077
Such is youth.

202
00:12:47,447 --> 00:12:50,778
You get used by a man, dumped, and fight about it.

203
00:12:52,347 --> 00:12:55,488
Sung Jae's plan was to use you to ruin me,

204
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:58,358
then go back to Yoon Su.

205
00:12:58,587 --> 00:13:00,727
You had no idea and naively...

206
00:13:01,288 --> 00:13:02,528
gave Yoon Su...

207
00:13:02,587 --> 00:13:04,758
Asung High School's inside information.

208
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:07,128
Inside information?

209
00:13:07,197 --> 00:13:09,797
The Academic Affairs notebook. Wasn't that you?

210
00:13:11,038 --> 00:13:12,337
What notebook?

211
00:13:12,398 --> 00:13:14,638
You had a spy.

212
00:13:14,707 --> 00:13:16,707
Ex-Principal Oh Jin Taek.

213
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:22,077
Leaking important documents...

214
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:23,817
and breaching the Personal Information Protection Act.

215
00:13:23,878 --> 00:13:26,248
You know that's a serious crime and professional malpractice, right?

216
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:29,347
- Jung Ah. - What now?

217
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:32,687
Shall we enjoy our sushi and head to the police station together?

218
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:34,227
That was long ago.

219
00:13:34,288 --> 00:13:37,197
I don't know where Oh Jin Taek is or what he does now.

220
00:13:37,427 --> 00:13:40,168
And I really don't know about the Academic Affairs notebook.

221
00:13:40,227 --> 00:13:41,268
I'm serious.

222
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:49,538
Then...

223
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:52,307
let's do this.

224
00:13:52,538 --> 00:13:54,807
The charges you brought against me at the board meeting.

225
00:13:55,408 --> 00:13:57,278
Tell Dad you were mistaken.

226
00:13:58,477 --> 00:13:59,477
Then...

227
00:14:02,018 --> 00:14:04,717
I won't bring up what you and Oh Jin Taek did.

228
00:14:06,217 --> 00:14:07,258
How's that?

229
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:16,868
Mr. Paik, your book is great.

230
00:14:17,337 --> 00:14:20,307
I just finished it. Ms. Ji got me a copy.

231

232
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:24,937
This is about her, right?

233
00:14:25,337 --> 00:14:26,977
You two are so cool.

00:15:12,658 --> 00:15:14,028
We're with Hangok Police.

240

(Warrant for Search and Seizure)

242
00:15:17,827 --> 00:15:18,858
A search warrant?

243
00:15:18,898 --> 00:15:20,927
Your status has been converted into being a suspect,

244
00:15:20,998 --> 00:15:22,427
- so your cooperation is requested. - What?

245
00:15:22,528 --> 00:15:24,268
Me?

246
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:26,097
- Wait! - Oh my gosh.

247
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:28,608
- Suspect? - Han Myung Jin's statement...

248
00:15:28,668 --> 00:15:30,977
confirmed her involvement.

249
00:15:31,038 --> 00:15:34,347
Let go of me. Are you arresting me right now?

250
00:15:34,408 --> 00:15:35,707
It's voluntary.

251
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:38,077
If you refuse, we'll come back with a warrant,

252
00:15:38,148 --> 00:15:39,847
- so you should come voluntarily. - But...

253
00:15:39,918 --> 00:15:41,717
- Let go of me! - Mom.

Don't say anything.

257
00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:48,327
- I'll go with a lawyer. - Let go of me!

258
00:16:01,738 --> 00:16:03,337
- What do we do? - Where's Dad?

259
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:05,278
He went to meet with the lawyer.

260
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:08,447
Will you be arrested too?

261
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:10,717
Quiet. Go to your room.

262
00:16:13,248 --> 00:16:15,888
It's so nice to see you and Yeon Woo...

263
00:16:15,947 --> 00:16:17,418
make up like this.

264
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:21,388
I'll cancel your dismissal,

265
00:16:21,788 --> 00:16:24,097
so focus more on running the school.

266

I will, Father.

267
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:27,427
What happened with the case against you?

268
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:29,727
Don't worry about it.

269
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:32,268
- It'll be over soon. - It will?

270
00:16:33,268 --> 00:16:36,238
Then I should rush my decision instead of pushing it back.

271
00:16:36,707 --> 00:16:38,638
I'll name the new director...

272
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,378
at the upcoming board meeting,

273
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:42,508
just so you know.

274
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:44,977
- Yes, Father. - All we need now...

275
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:48,148
is for Yeon Woo to marry Prime Minister Ryu's son.

276
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:50,317
That would be nice, but...

277
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:55,258
Didn't she tell you?

278
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:57,427
You and Sung Jae broke up?

279
00:16:59,898 --> 00:17:01,668
I didn't want to,

280
00:17:02,467 --> 00:17:03,697
but I have to accept it.

281
00:17:03,768 --> 00:17:05,268
Definitely not.

282
00:17:06,437 --> 00:17:08,408
That is absurd.

283
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:10,638
How could he leave you to go back to Ji Yoon Su?

284
00:17:10,707 --> 00:17:12,238
I'm upset too.

285
00:17:13,278 --> 00:17:16,177
But what can I do? He just can't get over her.

286
00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:17,677
Don't worry.

287
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:20,017
He can't decide whom he marries anymore.

288
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:22,318
When that happened four years ago,

289
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:24,717
he agreed to cut ties with the family...

290
00:17:24,787 --> 00:17:26,487
if he decided whom to marry on his own again.

291
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:28,927
I'll keep Sung Jae in check,

292
00:17:29,158 --> 00:17:30,858
so don't worry about it.

293
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:32,497
Okay?

294
00:17:33,457 --> 00:17:34,727
Yes, Mother.

295
00:17:35,168 --> 00:17:36,497
- It's Yu Hye Mi! - Yu Hye Mi!

296
00:17:36,568 --> 00:17:38,068
How do you feel?

297
00:17:38,138 --> 00:17:39,138
Give us a statement!

- Do you admit what you did? - Yu Hye Mi!

299
00:17:41,007 --> 00:17:43,338
How do you feel as you're about to be investigated?

300
00:17:43,408 --> 00:17:45,007
Do you admit to receiving the answers in advance?

301
00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:47,447
What was Assemblyman Sung Min Jun's involvement?

302
00:17:47,848 --> 00:17:50,148
- Please tell us! - Yu Hye Mi!

303
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:04,257
Ji Yoon Su.

304
00:18:22,677 --> 00:18:23,677
(Assemblyman Sung Min Jun)

305
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:28,648
What took you so long to answer?

306
00:18:29,217 --> 00:18:30,287
What is it?

307
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:37,658
- A search warrant? - Han Myung Jin must've talked.

308
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:41,368
He said things that were consistent...

309
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:42,967
with some academic affairs records.

310
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:49,138
- This is for the best. - What?

311
00:18:49,207 --> 00:18:50,437
Given the situation,

312
00:18:50,977 --> 00:18:52,777
someone must take the fall.

313
00:18:52,838 --> 00:18:54,207
And you want it to be Ye Rin's mom?

314
00:18:54,277 --> 00:18:55,747
Would you prefer it be Ye Rin?

315
00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:57,477
Get it together.

316
00:18:58,517 --> 00:19:01,318
This will destroy Ye Rin's life...

317
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:04,058
more than yours or mine.

318
00:19:05,118 --> 00:19:06,158
Don't forget that.

319
00:19:06,217 --> 00:19:07,787
You want me to accept the charges?

320
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:09,487
We can reduce the sentence then.

321
00:19:10,227 --> 00:19:12,658
We may even end it with just probation.

322
00:19:13,328 --> 00:19:15,668
You're telling me to take the fall for the whole thing.

323
00:19:15,727 --> 00:19:17,537
Must we have Ye Rin get arrested too?

324
00:19:18,697 --> 00:19:20,197
They keep getting more evidence and testimonies.

325
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:21,507
It'll only make things worse...

326
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:23,408

Why should I do what you ask?

489
00:32:56,753 --> 00:32:58,454
The board meeting is in a few days.

490
00:32:58,523 --> 00:33:02,093
If we break up now, I'll be at a huge disadvantage.

491
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:06,664
If that's the reason,

492
00:33:07,734 --> 00:33:08,934
you don't need to worry.

493
00:33:11,273 --> 00:33:13,333
You'll soon get another chance.

494
00:33:14,204 --> 00:33:16,073
- What do you mean? - I'm going to expose...

495
00:33:17,874 --> 00:33:20,843
everything that Noh Jung Ah did.

496
00:33:33,724 --> 00:33:34,863
Thank you.

497
00:33:37,524 --> 00:33:39,533
Have a glass of mulled wine. It's one dollar per glass.

498
00:33:39,593 --> 00:33:42,363
- A minor selling alcohol? - Mr. Paik, you came.

499
00:33:42,763 --> 00:33:45,233
- This is a non-alcoholic drink. - Then let me have a glass.

500
00:33:45,303 --> 00:33:48,004
Thank you. Feel free to take a look around.

501
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:49,544
Okay.

502
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:53,113
Have some mulled wine.

503
00:34:16,604 --> 00:34:17,604
Are you doing well?

504
00:34:17,934 --> 00:34:18,934
Yes.

505
00:34:20,073 --> 00:34:21,644
Si An invited me.

506
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:22,843
And me.

507
00:34:25,044 --> 00:34:28,914
Silent night

508
00:34:29,244 --> 00:34:33,184
Holy night

509
00:34:33,584 --> 00:34:36,923
All is calm

510
00:34:36,983 --> 00:34:38,854
Aren't they good? I taught them.

511
00:34:38,923 --> 00:34:40,693
Yes. They're pretty good.

513
00:34:46,434 --> 00:34:50,064

514
00:34:50,633 --> 00:34:54,903
Holy infant

515
00:34:54,974 --> 00:34:57,274
So tender...

516
00:34:57,343 --> 00:34:59,644
Your cap is wonky.

517
00:35:02,814 --> 00:35:04,854
I'm glad we have Si An.

518
00:35:06,013 --> 00:35:09,653
Not because she brought us back together.

519
00:35:10,754 --> 00:35:12,894
I got to see a child grow up...

520
00:35:14,024 --> 00:35:17,064
and I got to feel like a protective adult.

521
00:35:17,664 --> 00:35:19,463
She makes me feel that.

522
00:35:20,064 --> 00:35:21,664
Until now,

523
00:35:22,064 --> 00:35:25,004
Si An considered me her guardian and relied on me,

524
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:28,974
but in reality, she comforted me...

525
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,303
and gave me strength.

526
00:35:31,974 --> 00:35:33,173
You look relaxed.

527
00:35:34,744 --> 00:35:36,513
You dressed like before too.

528
00:35:37,983 --> 00:35:40,213
What do you think? Does it still suit me?

529
00:35:40,283 --> 00:35:42,124
You look great.

530
00:35:43,823 --> 00:35:44,823
So do you.

531
00:35:45,454 --> 00:35:47,854
It's good to see you look more relaxed.

532
00:35:48,093 --> 00:35:50,294
Ms. Ji, let's take a photo.

533
00:35:50,363 --> 00:35:51,894
- A photo? - Look over there.

534
00:35:51,963 --> 00:35:53,233
Are you ready?

535
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:55,903
One, two, three.

536
00:35:58,903 --> 00:35:59,903
Wait.

537
00:36:00,434 --> 00:36:02,144
I have a disciplinary hearing tomorrow at the school.

538
00:36:02,673 --> 00:36:04,343
Will you go back there?

539
00:36:04,843 --> 00:36:07,173
- I'm still wondering. - Okay.

540
00:36:07,244 --> 00:36:09,483
When Si An becomes a famous mathematician,

541
00:36:11,184 --> 00:36:12,314
let's congratulate her.

00:36:14,254 --> 00:36:15,783
Let's congratulate her together.

543
00:36:16,823 --> 00:36:17,823
Let's do that.

544
00:36:20,254 --> 00:36:21,254
Goodbye.

545
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:10,874
Take this.

546
00:37:11,403 --> 00:37:12,573
Did you make this yourself?

547
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:14,783
Yes, it's to prepare you for your midterm exam.

549

How do you have that book?

550
00:37:19,954 --> 00:37:22,454
What about you? What's this book?

551
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,093
You don't need to know.

552
00:37:46,073 --> 00:37:47,474
Is everything in order?

553
00:37:48,283 --> 00:37:51,314
Mr. Paik's disciplinary hearing is today.

554
00:37:51,383 --> 00:37:53,314
Are the midterm results out?

555

Yes.

556
00:37:55,153 --> 00:37:58,053
The Global Talent Class students did well.

557
00:37:58,454 --> 00:38:00,524
Kim Ji Na did exceptionally well.

558
00:38:00,693 --> 00:38:02,093
She got full marks in math.

559
00:38:02,463 --> 00:38:03,463
Did she?

560
00:38:03,693 --> 00:38:04,994
Call Mr. Ahn.

561
00:38:05,064 --> 00:38:06,863
I already did.

562
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:15,704
Hello, Ms. Noh.

563
00:38:15,774 --> 00:38:17,343
For the math exam,

564
00:38:17,403 --> 00:38:20,274
you came up with some good problems at the right level.

565
00:38:20,343 --> 00:38:22,914
Well done. I'm satisfied with the result.

566
00:38:22,983 --> 00:38:23,983
Thank you.

567
00:38:24,213 --> 00:38:27,013
You did very well. We should meet in private soon.

568
00:38:27,084 --> 00:38:28,084
Of course.

569
00:38:31,024 --> 00:38:32,193
Mr. Choi.

Yes?

571
00:38:37,124 --> 00:38:40,463
One of Asung High's academic affairs notebooks...

572
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:42,803
was submitted to the police.

573
00:38:45,004 --> 00:38:46,434
Do you know anything about that?

574
00:38:46,903 --> 00:38:49,403
No. Did something like that happen?

575
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:53,774
What went on in the school was written in great detail.

576
00:38:55,044 --> 00:38:56,443
Do you have any idea...

577
00:38:57,144 --> 00:38:58,184
who sent it in?

578
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:01,184
No. But I'll look into it.

580
00:39:07,394 --> 00:39:09,524
I lashed out, didn't I?

581
00:39:12,334 --> 00:39:13,994
As you know, this afternoon,

582
00:39:14,064 --> 00:39:15,733
there's an Asung Foundation board meeting.

583

I will make that happen.

587

It's Paik Seung Yoo.

588

Let's go talk to him.

589

Why are you here?

590
00:39:54,073 --> 00:39:55,504
Weren't you fired?

591
00:39:55,573 --> 00:39:57,644
We don't want to learn from you.

592
00:39:57,903 --> 00:40:00,314
- Why is that? - Yoo Chan's mom got arrested.

593
00:40:00,374 --> 00:40:01,744
That was all you.

594
00:40:02,343 --> 00:40:05,153
You don't like us or our school.

595
00:40:05,213 --> 00:40:06,653
Why do you want to teach us?

596
00:40:11,553 --> 00:40:12,553
Thank you,

Jenny, Ji Na, Soo Young.

598
00:40:15,823 --> 00:40:18,093
I was struggling to find a reason to come back.

599
00:40:18,794 --> 00:40:20,494
I think you can be it.

600
00:40:20,593 --> 00:40:21,763
What are you saying?

601
00:40:22,903 --> 00:40:25,474
I'm pleased to hear you think I don't like you.

602
00:40:25,803 --> 00:40:29,403
It sounds like you want to be cared for and not ignored.

603
00:40:30,144 --> 00:40:33,013
I know you're confused because of what's going on.

604
00:40:33,073 --> 00:40:34,173
We can talk about it.

605
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,343
What you want to know, what you wonder.

606
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:38,113
We can talk about it openly.

607
00:40:41,184 --> 00:40:42,184
Thank you.

608
00:40:44,124 --> 00:40:45,124
What was that?

609
00:40:46,454 --> 00:40:48,863
- He's so annoying. - I don't get it.

610

I need to discuss that with the higher-ups.

I apologize for...

bringing up a personal issue at a school event.

624

But...

I don't think I did anything to harm my reputation as a teacher.

I believe...

seeing a teacher fight injustice and prejudice...

628
00:41:59,164 --> 00:42:01,803
will instil a positive value within the students.
