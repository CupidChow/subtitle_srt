00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,251
Even if you found an error,

329
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,681
you still should've discussed it with me.

330
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:35,280
I thought it was more urgent to fix the answer sheet...

331
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,080
because the test was on the following day.

332
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,790
Why did you want to see Ye Rin?

333
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,060
Weren't you talking about the answer sheet with her?

334
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:48,261
I had a question about her test paper. I'll be off, then.

335
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,030
From now on, discuss everything with me.

336
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:53,830
We teach the same subject, so please try to communicate.

337
00:28:01,141 --> 00:28:02,141
What?

338
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:04,810
What do you mean?

339
00:28:05,211 --> 00:28:07,580
Are you saying Ms. Ji knows?

340
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:09,820
I'm not sure if she knows for sure.

341
00:28:10,151 --> 00:28:12,090
But it's possible that she might raise an issue about it.

342
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:13,691
If she ever asks,

343
00:28:13,751 --> 00:28:16,721
tell Ye Rin to tell her that it was a mistake...

344
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,661
no matter what happens.

345
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,261
What's the matter with you?

346
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,329
I can't believe she changed the answer sheet...

347
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,630
after you gave it to us.

348
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:26,830
- What's this about? - My goodness.

349
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:28,901
- Who's on the phone? - No, wait.

350
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,370
- "Han Myung Jin"? - Honey.

351
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,011
What did you just say?

352
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,610
He gave you the answer sheet?

353
00:28:40,681 --> 00:28:42,951
Honey, listen to me carefully.

354
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,421
It's not what you think.

355
00:28:44,481 --> 00:28:45,721
What do you think I'm thinking?

356
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,451
What did you do?

357
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,020
Hurry up and tell me!

358
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:52,931
Gosh, I can't believe this.

359
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:59,330
So this is the answer sheet before it was corrected,

360
00:28:59,901 --> 00:29:02,441
and this is the answer that Ye Rin wrote today?

361
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,340
Yes.

362
00:29:06,441 --> 00:29:07,641
They're identical.

363
00:29:08,141 --> 00:29:09,780
We changed the numbers.

364
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,441
How did she solve the problem like this?

365
00:29:11,511 --> 00:29:14,251
It's like she copied this answer sheet.

366
00:29:18,451 --> 00:29:20,491
No, I'm not saying she did.

367
00:29:22,421 --> 00:29:23,520
No way.

368
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:25,491
You don't think someone leaked the answer sheet, do you?

369
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:31,971
Ye Rin, what is the matter with you?

370
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:34,570
What should we do?

371
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,971
But what if it was really a mistake?

372
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,641
Is that completely impossible?

373
00:29:40,711 --> 00:29:43,211
We might be able to find out by looking at the test papers.

374
00:29:44,641 --> 00:29:46,610
Students use the blank space to solve the math problems.

375
00:29:46,681 --> 00:29:49,080
If she made a mistake, we should be able to find it.

376
00:29:49,181 --> 00:29:50,280
You're right.

377
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,491
Then let's ask her to bring the test papers...

378
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,491
after the midterm exams are over.

379
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,721
After they're over?

380
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,630
We should let her finish her exams.

381
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:02,461
If we raise an issue right now,

382
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:06,370
she might blame us and say we made her get bad grades.

383
00:30:07,171 --> 00:30:09,600
It'll only give us a huge headache.

384
00:30:11,671 --> 00:30:12,671
I see.

385
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,511
(Asung High School)

386
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,860
Darn it.

387
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,040
I'm extremely sorry.

388
00:30:52,011 --> 00:30:53,310
I understand...

389
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:57,580
if you choose to expel Ye Rin and have my wife reported.

390
00:30:58,751 --> 00:31:00,790
They say, "Preparing for university is like entering a fiery pit."

391
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:03,820
I really love that saying.

392
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:07,991
I want Asung Empire to become a fiery pit...

393
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,630
with blazing flames and burning lives.

394
00:31:11,671 --> 00:31:14,100
Then there's a sharp blade that gets created...

395
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:16,300
after it was forged many times inside the hot, burning fire.

396
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,540
What's the point of living in paradise where everyone is happy?

397
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,780
A true winner is a person who survives the fiery pit.

398
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:30,880
I wanted Ye Rin to do everything she could...

399
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,991
to survive the fiery pit...

400
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:36,290
and become a sword I could wield.

401
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,191
For that to happen,

402
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,560
she should not have gotten caught.

403
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,570
You knew all about...

404
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,701
In Asung High,

405
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,040
do you think there can be anything I do not know?

406
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,641
The math answer sheet?

407
00:31:54,711 --> 00:31:56,040
Ye Rin's mother asked for it.

408
00:31:56,511 --> 00:31:58,911
But I refused, of course.

409
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,780
Give it to her.

410
00:32:03,651 --> 00:32:04,651
Pardon?

411
00:32:05,191 --> 00:32:06,491
Give her the answer sheet.

412
00:32:07,891 --> 00:32:09,060
Ms. Noh.

413
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
However,

414
00:32:11,961 --> 00:32:13,991
I know nothing of this.

415
00:32:14,431 --> 00:32:16,360
Now and even in the future.

416
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,231
Please forgive her.

417
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,971
Please forgive Ye Rin just this once.

418
00:32:25,441 --> 00:32:26,441
What if I do?

419
00:32:26,671 --> 00:32:29,941
On Ye Rin's name... No, on my life,

420
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:34,511
I will not disappoint you.

421
00:32:35,151 --> 00:32:36,221
I swear.

422
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,360
- Darn it. - No way.

423
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:45,830
- Okay! - My gosh.

424
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:47,661
All my grades went up!

425
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:49,600
How do you do better and better?

426
00:32:49,661 --> 00:32:51,461
- My grades are up. - That's crazy.

427
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,530
- Full marks? - No.

428
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,141
- Let's have a look. - Is that the old one?

429
00:32:56,201 --> 00:32:57,701
Hang on.

430
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,570
- Baek Seung Yoo's insane. - Why?

431
00:32:59,641 --> 00:33:01,981
No way. Full marks in every subject?

432
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,310
- That is really insane. - Full marks?

433
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,451
My mom will kill me.

434
00:33:06,511 --> 00:33:08,580
- Darn him. - Hey.

435
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,251
This is crazy.

436
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,921
How is this possible?

437
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:16,120
It's all about the ankle.

438
00:33:16,191 --> 00:33:18,431
If your ankles are strong, you can kick the ball...

439
00:33:18,491 --> 00:33:20,289
- Hey. - Janet.

440
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,900
- Janet. - Seung Yoo's here.

441
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,061
Baek Seung Yoo!

442
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:27,771
Full marks in everything.

443
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:29,971
In everything? Is that for real?

444
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,471
- Hey. - He's crazy.

445
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:32,871
Hey, what's this?

446
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,070
- What is it? - What is it?

447
00:33:34,411 --> 00:33:35,440
What is it?

448
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:36,940
That's Ms. Ji.

449
00:33:37,011 --> 00:33:39,181
- Where is this from? - Who took this?

450
00:33:39,581 --> 00:33:41,820
What is it doing here? Who put it here?

451
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,880
I don't know.

452
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,431
What if I find a math problem that's worth all of this damage?

453
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,101
Don't look for it.

454
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:00,530
- What are you doing? - Is it yours?

455
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:01,730
Where are you going?

456
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,241
There are math problems you can't help...

457
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,110
but want to solve them and fall in love with them.

458
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,590
The problem will find you...

459
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:22,460
when you become strong and stable enough that you will not get hurt...

460
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:23,820
while trying to solve it.

461
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:26,431
I believe that one day,

462
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,661
you will achieve that.

463
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,561
I appreciate your present,

464
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:34,101
but I cannot accept this.

465
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:29,291
This is on the house.

466
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,661
My Seung Yoo did well in the midterm exams,

467
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,431
so I'm giving these out.

468
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:36,630
- Thank you. - Enjoy it.

469
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,101
This is on me.

470
00:35:38,161 --> 00:35:40,670
I don't think you should be handing stuff out.

471
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,500
Why not? Is something wrong?

472
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,840
Seung Yoo...

473
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,041
- got full marks in everything? - Yes.

474
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,440
I heard he was the only one to get full marks in math.

475
00:35:48,511 --> 00:35:51,380
Was Ms. Ji his special tutor or something?

476
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,681
- A special tutor? - I've heard strange rumours.

477
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,280
- Don't. - Why not?

478
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:01,021
How can the last kid in his year suddenly become first?

479
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,761
Something's definitely up.

480
00:36:03,021 --> 00:36:05,121
My Gyu Yeong told me that...

481
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,061
there's something between Seung Yoo and Ms. Ji.

482
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,800
To use the kids' slang, it looks like they're flirting.

483
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,300
This is crazy!

484
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,771
Jang Gyu Yeong!

485
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,940
- Where are you? - Ma'am.

486
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,141
Hee Seung!

487
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,980
Where's your son?

488
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,451
- What is this about? - "What is this about?"

489
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:31,780
Why? Are you afraid I'll hurt your son?

490
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,791
Then you shouldn't have gone and talked about mine.

491
00:36:34,851 --> 00:36:37,521
Well, that was just...

492
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,530
a rumour among the kids.

493
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,190
Okay. A rumour?

494
00:36:41,261 --> 00:36:45,530
Tell Gyu Yeong to come here and repeat those rumours.

495
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,371
Listen carefully.

496
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,900
Your son Seung Yoo.

497
00:36:51,371 --> 00:36:55,041
He's busy throwing himself at and confessing his love to Ms. Ji.

498
00:36:55,141 --> 00:36:57,811
Gyu Yeong saw him at it, okay?

499
00:36:58,181 --> 00:37:00,210
- Gyu Yeong saw him? - Yes.

500
00:37:01,181 --> 00:37:03,521
What did he see?

501
00:37:03,851 --> 00:37:06,090
I bet he just hallucinated because he's angry...

502
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,791
he's no longer the best at math.

503
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,521
- What are you saying? - What?

504
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,460
My son beat yours,

505
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,030
and now your son's math scores went way down.

506
00:37:14,431 --> 00:37:16,030
He should blame his lack of smarts,

507
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:17,661
not my son.

508
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,101
Are you out of your mind?

509
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,230
Yes, I am! So what?

510
00:37:21,771 --> 00:37:24,641
Delete your message about them flirting.

511
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:27,340
If you don't, I'll sue you for slander.

512
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,081
And tell Gyu Yeong to watch what he says, okay?

513
00:37:30,141 --> 00:37:32,351
Or I will rip his cheeks open.

514
00:37:40,851 --> 00:37:42,491
If you ruin my garden,

515
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:46,061
do so at the risk of getting yours ruined too.

516
00:37:48,261 --> 00:37:51,530
Oh, no! Oh, my gosh!

517
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,710
My gosh.

518
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:03,610
Those darn women...

519
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,411
will say just anything.

520
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:08,210
Just because they can.

521
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,491
I'm home.

522
00:38:15,121 --> 00:38:16,121
Seung Yoo.

523
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:21,730
It's not like that, is it?

524
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,101
About you and Ms. Ji.

525
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,530
It's just gossip, isn't it?

526
00:38:27,831 --> 00:38:29,000
What do you mean?

527
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:34,340
The moms keep saying nonsense...

528
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:37,280
that you professed your love for her and whatnot.

529
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,250
Is it true?

530
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,121
What's going on? Talk to me!

531
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,021
It's not like that.

532
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,530
Yes, it had better not be.

533
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,360
What if your dad were to find out?

534
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,971
Be careful.

535
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:03,940
Everyone's wary of you because your grades shot up.

536
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Okay?

537
00:39:05,741 --> 00:39:06,940
Ms. Ji...

538
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:10,610
is getting married soon.

539
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,911
Oh, that's great news.

540
00:39:14,511 --> 00:39:16,351
We should congratulate her.

541
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,581
Let's go to the wedding. When is it?

542
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:20,150
It's this Saturday.

543
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:21,951
I can't go.

544
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,590
Why not?

545
00:39:27,931 --> 00:39:30,161
- Hello. - Hello.

546
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:33,570
(The schedule is as follows.)

547
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,541
(Note: Asung High School junior Baek Seung Yoo will present.)

548
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,081
Ms. Ji.

549
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:45,311
Can we talk?

550
00:39:49,021 --> 00:39:52,021
It's about Ye Rin.

551
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:54,291
I thought we should tell those in charge.

552
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:57,791
So I told the vice principal just now.

553
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,590
I see. What did he say?

554
00:40:00,661 --> 00:40:02,701
That we don't have to check Ye Rin's papers.

555
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,900
He said we'll soon find out what that means.

556
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,871
What does that mean?

557
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,201
I'm not exactly sure,

558
00:40:10,471 --> 00:40:12,840
but they called an Academic Performance Management Committee.

559
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:14,871
I'm sure it'll come up then.

560
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,710
An Academic Performance Management Committee?

561
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,581
You get married tomorrow.

562
00:40:18,641 --> 00:40:21,681
Don't worry too much about it right before your big day.

563
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:40,530
(2017 Academic Performance Management Committee)

564
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:52,951
First of all, I want to say I'm sorry.

565
00:40:56,451 --> 00:40:58,480
Listen carefully to what I say.

566
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,250
Okay.

567
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,221
I will make it so it never happened.

568
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,831
Nothing...

569
00:41:08,431 --> 00:41:09,601
happened.

570
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:13,471
I have something to tell you about the junior year...

571
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:16,170
midterm math exam.

572
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,311
(Principal Oh Jin Taek)

573
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,081
Yes, it's me.

574
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,221
Can we talk for a bit?

575
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,851
There's a problem with the math exam?

576
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:36,791
Tell me more.

577
00:41:38,021 --> 00:41:39,730
- Your old number? - Yes.

578
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:41,891
- Text me later. - Get going.

579
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,471
It's English?

580
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,241
Ye Rin.

581
00:41:52,771 --> 00:41:55,471
Can you bring your math exam to the counselling room?

582
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,380
- What for? - I want to check something.

583
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,681
I threw it away.

584
00:42:02,951 --> 00:42:05,021
You threw out your exam questions?

585
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,150
Ms. Ji.

586
00:42:07,221 --> 00:42:08,750
I think we're in trouble.

587
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,491
Just a moment.

588
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,491
Let's talk about it later.

589
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:17,101
What is it?

590
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:20,601
They'll have the kids retake math. The whole exam.

591
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,670
It'll take ages to compile the questions.

592
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:25,300
There will be another exam? Why?

593
00:42:26,871 --> 00:42:29,181
- They'll retake the exam? - If that happens,

594
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,340
the existing scores become void...

595
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,581
and won't be a problem.

596
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:34,980
That's true.

597
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,550
You're right. I'm impressed.

598
00:42:40,951 --> 00:42:43,960
I was down on my knees right now.

599
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,761
Do you see it?

600
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,261
You don't, do you? What a pity.

601
00:42:49,331 --> 00:42:52,570
Like I said, this is the last time.

602
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,831
You bet it is.

603
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,440
From now on, you just have to watch...

604
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,971
how Sung Min Jun keeps his word.

605
00:43:01,771 --> 00:43:02,840
Look forward to it.

606
00:43:02,911 --> 00:43:05,241
- A retake? - No way.

607
00:43:05,311 --> 00:43:06,880
- Can we not? - That blows.

608
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,210
Be quiet!

609
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,780
Why must we retake the exam?

610
00:43:09,851 --> 00:43:11,951
One of the questions required a solution...

611
00:43:12,021 --> 00:43:14,291
that isn't covered in your textbooks.

612
00:43:14,351 --> 00:43:18,121
We're organizing a retake to keep things fair, so it's final.

613
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,690
Which question was the problem?

614
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:22,261
- Number 15. - Number 15?

615
00:43:22,331 --> 00:43:23,360
Now look.

616
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,900
You solved it with L'Hopitals theorem, didn't you?

617
00:43:31,971 --> 00:43:33,011
- Yes. - Yes.

618
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:36,141
I guarantee you that everyone solved it this way.

619
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:38,610
It's such a simple and useful theorem...

620
00:43:38,681 --> 00:43:40,351
that it's mentioned in class,

621
00:43:40,411 --> 00:43:42,451
but not mentioned in your textbooks.

622
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,150
Because it's not in your textbooks,

623
00:43:45,221 --> 00:43:47,021
it should not be in any exam.

624
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,621
What if I guessed and got it right?

625
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:50,621
The probability...

626
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:52,261
I didn't solve it with L'Hopitals theorem.

627
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:54,960
What? Who said what just now?

628
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,201
I didn't solve it that way.

629
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,670
What a nuisance.

630
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:01,630
So what if you didn't solve it this way?

631
00:44:02,271 --> 00:44:03,601
Did you use Taylor's series?

632
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:05,701
Seung Yoo got full marks in math this time.

633
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,771
If he solved it without using L'Hopitals theorem,

634
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,011
isn't there no problem, then?

635
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,610
- Yes. - Yes.

636
00:44:11,681 --> 00:44:13,650
- Can't we skip it? - Let him show us.

637
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:14,980
Silence!

638
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:18,050
How dare you interrupt a teacher?

639
00:44:18,121 --> 00:44:21,951
Also, Baek Seung Yoo got full marks. So what about it?

640
00:44:25,061 --> 00:44:27,391
You have to resit an exam you got full marks on,

641
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,831
and you're ticked off?

642
00:44:31,931 --> 00:44:34,300
Do you think it's all about getting good grades?

643
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:36,340
You must be a decent person first.

644
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,210
But then, what did you do wrong?

645
00:44:41,141 --> 00:44:44,110
It's the teacher's fault for egging you on,

646
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:45,710
saying you're good.

647
00:44:49,851 --> 00:44:51,621
Look at you.

648
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,521
Look down.

649
00:44:57,121 --> 00:44:58,221
Look down!

650
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:02,960
See me after class.

651
00:45:12,201 --> 00:45:14,170
It can't be solved without L'Hopitals theorem.

652
00:45:14,811 --> 00:45:16,911
This is insane. I came up with this question.

653
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,550
I just took it for granted they could use L'Hopitals theorem.

We don't have to check Ye Rin's papers.

The limit value is guaranteed as K,

665

so if you substitute the X from Tangent X to EX...

and use addition...
