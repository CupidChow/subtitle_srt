The police just took the security footage.

How is Si An?

19
00:01:28,424 --> 00:01:29,692
Did the surgery go well?

They're not done yet.

No, I haven't.

Her cell phone wasn't in the art room.

Why is her surgery taking so long?

25

I'm so worried.

Ji Na, where are you going?

44
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,028
I don't know how to explain this.

45

Why? What happened?

46
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:47,639
I'm going to teach Si An a lesson.

47
00:02:48,104 --> 00:02:49,808
She's dead meat.

48
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:56,139
- Are you sure? - What are we going to do?

49
00:02:56,553 --> 00:02:58,748
I don't know what to do.

50
00:02:58,984 --> 00:03:00,679
Just because she said that doesn't necessarily mean...

51
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:02,722
that she was the one who hurt Si An.

52
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:05,118
So I didn't say anything to the police.

53
00:03:05,493 --> 00:03:06,923
It felt like tattling.

54
00:03:06,924 --> 00:03:08,962
I also got a little scared.

55
00:03:08,963 --> 00:03:11,128
Thank you for telling me, at least.

56
00:03:11,864 --> 00:03:13,733
Did you see Ji Na after that?

57
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:15,759
I actually looked for her,

58
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:19,498
but she was nowhere to be seen after the incident.

59
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:21,539
Okay. I'll call you later.

60

Did you look into the security footage from Asung Academy?

61
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:45,859
Yes, I did. Take a seat.

62
00:04:11,324 --> 00:04:12,419
Hello?

63
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:14,959
Yes.

64
00:04:15,663 --> 00:04:17,893
They finished the surgery and took her to the ICU.

65
00:04:17,894 --> 00:04:19,159
Is she still unconscious?

66
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:21,758
Don't get shocked by what I'm about to say.

67
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,402
Go ahead. What is it?

68
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:25,929
I just saw the security footage.

69
00:04:26,644 --> 00:04:28,239
I'm going to meet Principal Noh.

72
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:34,839
- Kim Ji Na? - Yes.

73
00:04:35,684 --> 00:04:37,549
Ms. Kim Jin Hui told me something.

74
00:04:47,124 --> 00:04:48,318
I'll go with you.

75
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:51,828
I need to see her. As Si An's guardian.

76
00:05:04,814 --> 00:05:06,008
Passcode.

77
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:11,248
You have unlocked the safe. The door is open.

78
00:05:15,884 --> 00:05:17,448
The door is closed.

79
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:32,698
Attorney Jang, are you on your way?

80
00:05:33,973 --> 00:05:36,508
Please hurry up. Okay.

81
00:06:03,434 --> 00:06:05,373
Bring me the files regarding Si An's accident,

82
00:06:05,374 --> 00:06:07,003
the updates on the police investigation,

83
00:06:07,004 --> 00:06:10,339
and all the footage from the school security cameras.

84
00:06:12,444 --> 00:06:14,008
Attorney Jang, is that you?

85
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:22,219
Si An's guardian is here to see you.

86
00:06:56,653 --> 00:06:57,792
Why are you here?

87
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,422
To ask for your cooperation with the investigation.

88
00:06:59,423 --> 00:07:01,458
Where is Kim Ji Na right now?

89
00:07:01,694 --> 00:07:03,862
- Why do you ask? - It's possible that...

90
00:07:03,863 --> 00:07:05,729
she was Si An's attacker.

91
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:08,503
"Attacker"? What proof do you have?

92
00:07:08,504 --> 00:07:10,929
How about you watch the security footage first?

93
00:07:16,543 --> 00:07:17,743
This shows Kim Ji Na...

94
00:07:17,744 --> 00:07:20,609
rushing from the art room direction right after the accident.

95
00:07:21,713 --> 00:07:23,453
So what? Is this it?

96
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:26,453
This was from the camera closest to the art room...

97
00:07:26,454 --> 00:07:29,083
right before the first witness discovered the scene.

98
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:32,222
How does this say my daughter was the attacker?

99
00:07:32,223 --> 00:07:34,522
Someone heard what she said.

100
00:07:34,523 --> 00:07:36,359
I will end Choi Si An.

101
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:38,032
I will kill her today.

102
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:39,693
Based on just that,

103
00:07:39,694 --> 00:07:42,099
you say my daughter hurt Si An?

104
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:45,899
I would like to talk to her.

105
00:07:46,543 --> 00:07:47,873
I want to hear...

106
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:51,039
what led her to say something like that.

107
00:07:53,814 --> 00:07:55,938
You're here at last, Attorney Jang.

108
00:07:58,554 --> 00:08:00,078
You called an attorney already.

109
00:08:00,153 --> 00:08:01,922
Whenever there's an unfortunate incident,

110
00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:03,253
as the principal,

111
00:08:03,254 --> 00:08:05,818
isn't it natural for me to bring in a legal representative?

112
00:08:06,523 --> 00:08:08,058
He's with the police.

113
00:08:08,494 --> 00:08:10,729
She is Choi Si An's guardian,

114
00:08:10,963 --> 00:08:13,063
and she's naming my daughter Ji Na as the attacker...

115
00:08:13,064 --> 00:08:15,162
and demands to see her right away.

116
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:18,068
Without any clear proof, you identified a suspect?

117
00:08:18,304 --> 00:08:20,138
We will not cooperate with such an investigation.

118
00:08:20,343 --> 00:08:21,972
Follow the proper protocol.

119
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:24,568
We haven't concluded she's a suspect.

120
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:26,373
We'll send a request for an interview.

121
00:08:26,374 --> 00:08:28,308
Please let her cooperate as a witness for now.

122
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:29,808
Very well.

123
00:08:34,824 --> 00:08:35,882
Hello?

124
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:37,549
Are you Choi Si An's guardian?

125
00:08:37,794 --> 00:08:40,462
- Yes, I am. - Can you come right now?

126
00:08:40,463 --> 00:08:42,818
What? Right now?

127
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:45,588
I'll be there.

128
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:48,862
- Was that the hospital? - Yes. I need to go.

129
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:49,999
Let's go, then.

130
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:53,438
I'll come by tomorrow for your daughter's statement.

131
00:08:53,603 --> 00:08:56,068
Please let me see Ji Na then.

132
00:08:56,444 --> 00:08:57,568
I will.

133
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:00,679
You should pray Si An recovers.

134
00:09:01,613 --> 00:09:03,679
You'd better pray even harder than we do.

135
00:09:05,454 --> 00:09:06,608
Let's go.

136
00:09:15,324 --> 00:09:16,588
Are you all right?

137
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:24,828
I told you...

138
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,869
the truth as it is.

139
00:09:30,643 --> 00:09:34,009
In this kind of situation, what will happen to Ji Na?

140
00:09:34,184 --> 00:09:35,938
She must insist it wasn't intentional.

141
00:09:36,814 --> 00:09:38,512
If she says they fought and the plaster figure...

142
00:09:38,513 --> 00:09:39,882
just happened to fall,

143
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:42,419
we can argue it was negligence resulting in an injury.

144
00:09:43,024 --> 00:09:46,348
The issue will be the victim's condition.

145
00:09:46,824 --> 00:09:47,992
What if it's bad?

146
00:09:47,993 --> 00:09:51,488
In the worst-case scenario, what if she ends up dying?

147
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:53,358
It will be manslaughter.

148
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:55,598
Ji Na could be arrested.

149
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:00,543
Why not try to...

150
00:10:00,544 --> 00:10:02,269
settle with the victim for ethical reasons?

151
00:10:02,274 --> 00:10:05,039
The victim only has a guardian, not even a real parent.

152
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:13,379
Settle with them?

153
00:10:16,223 --> 00:10:18,519
Do you think I can settle with the likes of...

154
00:10:18,924 --> 00:10:20,718
Ji Yoon Su and Paik Seung Yoo?

155
00:10:21,463 --> 00:10:23,929
They will use this incident to corner me.

156
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:25,659
They will never settle.

157
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:28,358
Not to mention that today,

158
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:31,002
I was made chairman of the Asung Foundation.

159
00:10:31,003 --> 00:10:34,338
I will soon take it over from my father.

160
00:10:35,643 --> 00:10:37,269
After all I did to get here...

161
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:39,869
I waited so long for this day.

162
00:10:43,414 --> 00:10:44,948
We just have to hide this.

163
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,049
We can hide this.

164
00:10:48,483 --> 00:10:49,779
Nothing will go wrong.

165
00:10:51,424 --> 00:10:52,649
There will be no problems.

166
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:56,563

It's taking longer than I thought.

She may be too afraid to talk,

Si An is still unconscious.

332
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:02,829
We're still waiting.

333
00:21:07,403 --> 00:21:08,669
Have you seen this before?

334
00:21:16,244 --> 00:21:17,339
No.

335
00:21:19,353 --> 00:21:22,819
Si An said the Global Talent Class kids had it.

336
00:21:23,123 --> 00:21:24,622
I know nothing about it. I mean it.

337
00:21:24,623 --> 00:21:26,119
Did Ji Na tell you anything...

338
00:21:26,593 --> 00:21:28,389
after the incident yesterday?

339
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:31,929
Yoo Chan.

340
00:21:33,734 --> 00:21:35,733
Tell me anything you know.

341
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:37,159
I don't know anything.

342
00:21:46,814 --> 00:21:48,278
Pick up, Ji Na.

343
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:50,753
- Pick up! - The person you have reached...

344
00:21:50,754 --> 00:21:53,309
(Principal Noh Jung Ah)

345
00:21:59,324 --> 00:22:01,359
If the Global Talent Class kids had it,

346
00:22:01,494 --> 00:22:03,192
did Asung Academy make it?

347
00:22:03,193 --> 00:22:04,359
I don't know.

348
00:22:05,334 --> 00:22:08,033
Only that Si An was hurt because of it.

349
00:22:08,034 --> 00:22:09,233
Because of this?

350
00:22:09,234 --> 00:22:11,698
I think the person who either made this...

351
00:22:12,203 --> 00:22:15,298
or had it was caught by Si An,

352
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:18,008
which was why that happened to her.

353
00:22:18,643 --> 00:22:20,109
That's my guess.

354
00:22:22,514 --> 00:22:24,452
Thanks for bringing Yoo Chan.

355
00:22:24,453 --> 00:22:27,548
Are you going to dig into what Yoo Chan did wrong as well?

356
00:22:28,284 --> 00:22:30,248
Do you think this was Yoo Chan's doing?

357
00:22:31,324 --> 00:22:34,119
Even if we uncover what problems exist with the Global Talent Class,

358
00:22:34,494 --> 00:22:36,592
Yoo Chan may still be a victim.

359
00:22:36,593 --> 00:22:38,059
You were too, before.

360
00:22:38,464 --> 00:22:41,958
You were led down the fast lane by the adults without knowing it.

361
00:22:52,044 --> 00:22:54,743
These are the expected questions. Memorize everything.

362
00:22:54,744 --> 00:22:56,183
According to Mr. Han,

363
00:22:56,183 --> 00:22:58,113
the math test is going to be really hard this time.

364
00:22:58,113 --> 00:22:59,213
Memorize everything, okay?

365
00:22:59,214 --> 00:23:02,083
How did you end up doing volunteer work for IAIT?

366
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:03,619
Are you sure you prepared for the Olympics at school?

367
00:23:10,193 --> 00:23:11,288
Seung Yoo.

368
00:23:13,034 --> 00:23:16,099
Can you send me that photo of the textbook?

369
00:23:17,403 --> 00:23:21,639
It's true that there was an unfortunate incident yesterday.

370
00:23:21,744 --> 00:23:24,713
The police may ask the children to give statements.

371
00:23:24,714 --> 00:23:26,813
- What? - Ji Hye gets scared easily.

372
00:23:26,814 --> 00:23:28,783
We got a call already.

373
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:30,852
They said Jenny was caught on the security video.

374
00:23:30,853 --> 00:23:32,679
Don't worry.

375
00:23:32,883 --> 00:23:36,382
Don't agree to anything on your own no matter what the police request.

376
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:38,993
Please proceed only after consulting...

377
00:23:38,994 --> 00:23:40,553
our foundation's lawyer.

378
00:23:40,554 --> 00:23:42,293
Then everything will be fine.

379
00:23:42,294 --> 00:23:43,919
- Okay. - Also...

380
00:23:44,834 --> 00:23:48,559
We will put a hold on the consulting for the Global Talent Class.

381
00:23:49,034 --> 00:23:50,533
You brought the textbooks, right?

382
00:23:50,534 --> 00:23:51,899
- Yes. - Yes, of course.

You're here.

- How is Si An? - Nothing's changed.

387
00:24:23,534 --> 00:24:26,073
By the way, her friend came by just now.

00:24:26,074 --> 00:24:27,639
- Her friend? - Yes.

- Are you okay? - Ji Na.

Are you guys okay? Did you get hurt?

392
00:25:10,014 --> 00:25:11,083
Ji Na, it's okay.

393
00:25:11,084 --> 00:25:12,909
I know you came because you were worried about Si An.

394
00:25:14,453 --> 00:25:15,778
Si An is fine.

395

If you don't want to see me dead, call me right this instant!

407
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:08,599
Could she be...

thinking of hurting herself?

409
00:26:13,173 --> 00:26:14,538
Or could she have gone to the police station?

410
00:26:17,913 --> 00:26:19,109
Has she lost her mind?

Did you eat?

Your mom doesn't know you're here, does she?

No, she doesn't. Are you going to tell her?

417
00:26:48,075 --> 00:26:51,680
If you don't want me to, I won't. Don't worry.

418
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,750
There's something I need to show you.

There's that video clip of you...

at the meditation center and student profile.

423

I also have personal records about you.

Why do you have these?

I feel embarrassed by this, and I'm also sorry.

00:27:39,996 --> 00:27:42,031
I showed you everything and deleted the file.

431

Now, will you do the same for me?

432
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,230
Will you tell me what really happened?

433
00:27:51,746 --> 00:27:52,871
Ji Na.

434
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:55,574
I was extremely surprised when I saw you earlier.

435
00:27:55,575 --> 00:27:57,881
I had no idea you'd show up here.

436
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:02,250
You're very brave. I mean it.

437
00:28:03,486 --> 00:28:06,151
Also, do you remember when I told you...

438
00:28:06,556 --> 00:28:09,055
that if anything confused you, or if you had any questions,

439
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:11,321
you could feel free to open up to me?

440
00:28:13,226 --> 00:28:16,331
- Yes, I remember. - I think now is that time.

441
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:18,861
He's right, Ji Na.

442
00:28:20,006 --> 00:28:23,571
Muster up your courage a little bit more. Please.

443
00:28:25,575 --> 00:28:27,440
Are you going to believe what I say...

444
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,710
no matter what I tell you?

445
00:28:31,516 --> 00:28:32,611
Yes.

446
00:28:45,026 --> 00:28:46,725
I heard there was an accident at school.

447
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:48,061
Yes, there was.

448
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:51,601
A disgraceful accident at that.

449
00:28:52,936 --> 00:28:55,071
I can't believe the police came to my school...

450
00:28:55,436 --> 00:28:57,074
and tried to investigate my daughter.

451
00:28:57,075 --> 00:28:59,101
What did you do this time?

452
00:28:59,246 --> 00:29:01,240
You're making kids get investigated as well?

453
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,341
Why is it that you kids don't know how to be grateful?

454
00:29:05,486 --> 00:29:08,111
You're willing to take what I give when things are to your advantage,

455
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:10,384
but when things get tough, you're quick to blame it on me.

456
00:29:10,385 --> 00:29:11,651
You know what this is, don't you?

457
00:29:12,256 --> 00:29:13,581
What book is this?

458
00:29:15,325 --> 00:29:16,720
Where did you get that?

459
00:29:18,196 --> 00:29:19,321
Give me...

460
00:29:21,165 --> 00:29:23,291
Give me that! Give it to me!

461
00:29:23,466 --> 00:29:25,864
We need to hide it to keep things quiet!

462
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:28,031
Give it to me! Hey!

463
00:29:37,046 --> 00:29:38,180
I didn't...

464
00:29:39,385 --> 00:29:41,680
drop the plaster figure on her.

465
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:45,121
Okay.

466
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,281
Slowly tell us what happened.

467
00:29:50,395 --> 00:29:53,795
You haven't made any textbooks for the clinic recently, have you?

468
00:29:53,796 --> 00:29:55,765
No, I haven't. What's this?

469
00:29:55,766 --> 00:29:57,660
It's a lot like what you made, isn't it?

470
00:29:58,206 --> 00:30:00,064
I think it was made at your clinic.

471
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:02,005
The Global Talent Class kids had it.

472
00:30:02,006 --> 00:30:03,074
And?

473
00:30:03,075 --> 00:30:05,604
I think there's a problem with the textbook.

474
00:30:05,605 --> 00:30:07,770
- What problem? - Choi Si An!

475
00:30:09,115 --> 00:30:11,440
I'll call you back.

476
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:16,611
What is this?

477
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,051
- Why did you take a photo of this? - Be honest with me.

478
00:30:19,756 --> 00:30:21,220
Where did you get that book?

479
00:30:21,996 --> 00:30:25,091
The questions in that book were the same as the ones on the test.

480
00:30:25,966 --> 00:30:27,061
Give it to me.

481
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:30,031
You, Yoo Chan, Jenny, and Soo Young.

482
00:30:30,365 --> 00:30:33,430
Everyone in the Global Talent Class got a high score on the math test.

483
00:30:33,905 --> 00:30:35,270
They had that book too, didn't they?

484
00:30:35,936 --> 00:30:38,174
You know it's wrong.

485
00:30:38,175 --> 00:30:39,940
You also know that it's a shameful thing to do.

486
00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:42,740
I know you're scared.

487
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,581
But tell me what happened.

488
00:30:45,815 --> 00:30:46,940
Okay, fine.

489
00:30:47,686 --> 00:30:50,950
I'll explain everything. But first, delete that photo.

490
00:30:51,486 --> 00:30:52,725
I'll tell you if you delete it.

491
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:55,291
No. This is evidence.

492
00:30:55,996 --> 00:30:57,055
"Evidence"?

00:30:57,056 --> 00:30:59,795
I'm going to tell Mr. Paik and Ms. Ji about this.

494
00:30:59,796 --> 00:31:01,265
I'm going to report this to the Office of Education...

495
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:02,594
and the press.

496
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:04,700
What? You're going to report this?

497
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:07,361
Give that to me.

498
00:31:09,706 --> 00:31:10,970
Give it to me.

499
00:31:12,306 --> 00:31:13,601
Give me that.

500
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,670
- Stop it. - Give that to me.

501
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:21,111
Give it to me. Give me that.

502
00:31:21,415 --> 00:31:22,750
I said, no.

503
00:31:28,895 --> 00:31:29,990
Give me that.

504
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:32,061
Stop it.

505
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:33,660
- Give it to me. - No.

506

Get off me!

I didn't do it on purpose.

Okay.

517
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:07,321
So it was an accident.

Do you...

I do.

Do you really?

522

There's no reason you'd come here just to lie.

My mom...

524
00:33:22,206 --> 00:33:24,170
didn't believe me.

I put so much work into this.

00:33:45,896 --> 00:33:47,091
The poor thing.

527
00:33:52,235 --> 00:33:54,531
You made it grow into the size, shape,

528

and direction you wanted,

529
00:33:57,075 --> 00:33:58,170
but look at it now.

530
00:33:58,445 --> 00:34:00,901
It shattered in an instant.

531
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:02,471
That's how weak they are.

532

Everything that you grow.

533
00:34:05,516 --> 00:34:06,841
You ungrateful brat.

534

How dare you do this to me?

Don't think of ruining my brother.

Don't you get it?

He can't stop now.

540
00:34:20,965 --> 00:34:22,464
If he were to stop,

541
00:34:22,465 --> 00:34:24,765
he wouldn't have come this far, don't you think?

542
00:34:24,766 --> 00:34:26,805
You want to think it's too late.

543
00:34:26,806 --> 00:34:28,504
I worked so hard on this plant.

544
00:34:28,505 --> 00:34:30,131
There's a lot to turn back.

545
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:32,600
- It'll be hard work. - How ungrateful.

546
00:34:33,545 --> 00:34:36,040
How can the darn things do this to me?

547
00:34:45,255 --> 00:34:47,381
I once thought it wasn't your fault.

548
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,890
That it was on the adults who made you this way.

549
00:34:50,825 --> 00:34:54,020
But you need to stop blaming others and take a look at yourself.

550
00:34:55,735 --> 00:34:57,390
We can fix this.

551
00:34:57,536 --> 00:34:59,031
If you decide to step up, I'll help you.

552
00:35:18,586 --> 00:35:20,850
It's okay. Come and say hello.

553
00:35:31,266 --> 00:35:34,531
Si An. Ji Na's here to see you.

554
00:35:35,306 --> 00:35:36,631
She's worried about you.

555
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:41,401
Can I...

556
00:35:42,376 --> 00:35:43,810
hold her hand?

557
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:45,781
Yes.

558
00:36:00,266 --> 00:36:01,420
Si An.

559
00:36:05,536 --> 00:36:07,031
I'm sorry.

560
00:36:11,606 --> 00:36:13,401
I'm sorry for what I did.

561
00:36:19,646 --> 00:36:21,241
Will you wake up?

562
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,890
Everything I grew is weak?

563
00:36:37,566 --> 00:36:38,861
Don't be silly.

564
00:36:41,976 --> 00:36:43,670
They'll come back, won't they?

565
00:36:44,075 --> 00:36:46,175
When they realize that no place in the world...

566
00:36:46,175 --> 00:36:49,810
can protect them as well as Asung did.

567
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:56,881
Where do they think they can go?

568
00:36:57,686 --> 00:36:59,221
They're in the palm of my hand.

569

00:37:14,235 --> 00:37:15,330
Hello?

571
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:40,094
Ji Na, what happened to you?

572
00:37:40,095 --> 00:37:42,991
She gave a full statement on Choi Si An's accident.

573
00:37:43,266 --> 00:37:46,605
They got into an argument which turned physical,

574
00:37:46,606 --> 00:37:49,574
and Choi Si An bumped into the shelf the sculpture was on,

575
00:37:49,575 --> 00:37:52,571
and it fell on top of her head.

576
00:37:52,905 --> 00:37:54,600
It was an accident.

577
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:56,210
That's what she said.

578
00:37:57,115 --> 00:37:58,270
Is that it?

579
00:37:58,345 --> 00:38:00,440
Why? Should there be something else?

580
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:03,915
- No, it's just that... - Can I read the statement?

581
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:05,011
Sure.

582
00:38:05,985 --> 00:38:09,120
We can't close the case just based on her statement.

583
00:38:09,325 --> 00:38:12,625
We'll wait until the victim regains consciousness.

584
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:14,424
We need her statement as well.

585
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,830
Please bring in your daughter for any additional questioning.

586
00:38:17,836 --> 00:38:19,000
I'll do that.

587
00:38:19,436 --> 00:38:20,531
Let's go, Ji Na.

You were missing the whole day,

591

and then came here alone?

592
00:38:51,865 --> 00:38:54,600
I said I didn't hurt Si An on purpose.

593

You never believed me.

Tell me!

600
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:17,520
I didn't.

601
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:21,690
Well done, Ji Na.

602
00:39:22,336 --> 00:39:23,431
Well done.

603
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:30,571
Do you know how worried I was for you all day?

604
00:39:31,575 --> 00:39:33,870
I thought I would burn up inside.

605
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,741
Sorry, Mom.

606
00:39:38,445 --> 00:39:40,310
Don't do this ever again.

607
00:39:41,016 --> 00:39:43,281
Don't come to the police station on your own.

608
00:39:43,456 --> 00:39:45,681
Ask me and discuss it with me first.

609
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:46,980
Okay?

610
00:39:48,126 --> 00:39:49,221
Okay.

611
00:39:49,726 --> 00:39:51,821
Good. Good girl.

612
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:54,221
You're a good girl.

613
00:39:54,695 --> 00:39:57,261
Can you please not upset me?

614
00:39:58,536 --> 00:40:00,031
Do you know...

00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:03,174
what you put me through?

616

I won't, Mom.

617
00:40:06,075 --> 00:40:07,701
I won't do it again.

618

I'm sorry.

619
00:40:15,786 --> 00:40:17,511
Don't do it again.

620
00:40:19,155 --> 00:40:21,551
It makes me so upset.

621
00:40:22,755 --> 00:40:23,850
Okay.

622
00:40:50,385 --> 00:40:53,681
Ji Na said it was an accident with no malicious intent.

623
00:40:53,825 --> 00:40:56,350
Keep a close eye on Choi Si An's condition.

624
00:40:56,556 --> 00:40:58,094
Since it wasn't intentional,

625
00:40:58,095 --> 00:41:00,225
try to make Ji Yoon Su and Paik Seung Yoo...

626
00:41:00,226 --> 00:41:03,161
see we feel really bad about what happened.

627
00:41:04,135 --> 00:41:05,931
Also, ask if they'd be willing...

628
00:41:06,365 --> 00:41:07,560
to settle with us.

629
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:13,640
I understand.

630
00:41:19,816 --> 00:41:22,651
I bet you were always anxious.

631
00:41:28,996 --> 00:41:31,551
Mr. Paik. It's me.

632
00:41:32,295 --> 00:41:34,620
About the math exam incident.

633
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:37,436
The mother and teacher who leaked the answer sheet...

634
00:41:37,436 --> 00:41:38,495
are on trial.

635
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,761
Once they are punished as they deserve to be,

636
00:41:41,106 --> 00:41:42,870
it will all be wrapped up.

637
00:41:43,005 --> 00:41:44,100
Okay.

638
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:47,301
Well done. You did great.

639
00:41:48,445 --> 00:41:51,174
You're bound to be attacked from all sides,

640
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,681
but seeing how well you dealt with it...

641
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:55,681
puts me greatly at ease.

642
00:41:56,456 --> 00:41:58,611
Thank you for believing in me.

643
00:41:59,255 --> 00:42:02,451
Now I can leave everything in your hands...

644
00:42:02,655 --> 00:42:05,661
and fish to my heart's content.

645
00:42:08,365 --> 00:42:09,460
Right?

646
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,031

00:42:17,206 --> 00:42:18,571
I will deal with them.

Yeon Woo seems to be very distraught.

650

She hasn't left her home in a while.

651

Really? Then is everything ready?

652
00:42:35,795 --> 00:42:37,321
Yes, everything's ready.
