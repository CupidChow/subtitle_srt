Then why would he say that?

00:11:25,744 --> 00:11:27,544
liked people like you.

165
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:32,984
Staff who worked hard with a sense of ownership.

166
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,364
Ji Yoon Su joined Asung High, right?

167
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:44,333
- You know her? - We're Asung High classmates.

168
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:47,833
But don't mention me to her.

169
00:12:07,124 --> 00:12:09,853
Ms. Ji's fiancé?

170
00:12:10,953 --> 00:12:13,823
Administrative Official of Planning at the Ministry of Education.

171
00:12:14,364 --> 00:12:15,494
Isn't it a small world?

172
00:12:15,864 --> 00:12:18,463
I wondered why Vice-minister Shin kept him close,

173
00:12:18,534 --> 00:12:20,404
and he's ex-prime minister Ryu Hyun Il's son.

174
00:12:20,463 --> 00:12:21,603
My gosh.

175
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:24,433
The International Mathematics Olympics...

176
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:26,004
with a middle and high-school category?

177
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:28,303
Yes. It'll be a good opportunity for students...

178
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:30,014
who are into natural sciences or engineering.

179
00:12:30,244 --> 00:12:32,644
The Mathematical Society and Ministry of Education will co-host.

180
00:12:32,713 --> 00:12:33,813
That's a win-win.

181
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,083
The Mathematical Society will gain prestige,

182
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:39,053
and the Ministry of Education will benefit at the performance review.

183
00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:40,453
My point exactly.

184
00:12:40,524 --> 00:12:43,093
He's a smart man and get things done fast.

185
00:12:43,923 --> 00:12:45,264
What an unlikely couple.

186
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,794
How so?

187
00:12:48,864 --> 00:12:52,303
How will you decide who will judge?

188
00:12:52,603 --> 00:12:54,333
To make things sure,

189
00:12:54,404 --> 00:12:57,034
we should put a few allies in there.

190
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,443
But before we do that,

191
00:13:01,843 --> 00:13:04,774
how will you select who will represent our school?

192
00:13:05,073 --> 00:13:07,813
People will complain if we let the principal pick them.

193
00:13:08,213 --> 00:13:10,754
Just for show, we should have...

194
00:13:10,813 --> 00:13:13,284
a school-wide math competition.

195
00:13:13,353 --> 00:13:14,384
For all the students?

196
00:13:14,453 --> 00:13:16,254
The previous English Language Competition.

197
00:13:16,323 --> 00:13:18,923
We only let the advanced kids compete and there was an uproar.

198
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:22,764
We can't openly discriminate who can participate.

199
00:13:25,634 --> 00:13:29,404
Are you sure you like the new math teacher?

200
00:13:29,673 --> 00:13:31,374
You don't seem to.

201
00:13:33,404 --> 00:13:37,374
It's not the teacher that I need.

202
00:13:38,014 --> 00:13:39,014
What do you need, then?

203
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:43,154
A vessel to display our students in.

204
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,494
Here.

205
00:13:53,923 --> 00:13:54,923
What's that?

206
00:13:54,994 --> 00:13:58,364
Give me a moment. The application deadline is today.

207
00:14:05,943 --> 00:14:07,874
- What? - I have a surprise.

208
00:14:08,374 --> 00:14:09,473
A surprise?

209
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:14,644
- What is it? - The Mathematician Olympics...

210
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:17,853
will have a competition for middle and high-school kids.

211

For teenagers?

212
00:14:20,784 --> 00:14:22,754
We're going to create and co-host...

213

214

That's great.

215
00:14:28,294 --> 00:14:30,494
- Are you that pleased? - Of course I am.

216
00:14:31,193 --> 00:14:32,904
Can my students enter too?

217
00:14:32,963 --> 00:14:34,833
They'll pick a representative.

218
00:14:36,904 --> 00:14:39,004
How is school now that you started?

219
00:14:40,073 --> 00:14:41,073
Did you meet...

220
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,673
the chairman's daughter, the Director of School Affairs?

221
00:14:45,114 --> 00:14:46,114
Yes.

222
00:14:47,414 --> 00:14:48,984
She's a bit odd.

223
00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:51,784
Their whole family practically rules the kingdom,

224
00:14:51,853 --> 00:14:54,254
so she has even more clout than the principal and vice-principal.

225
00:14:55,524 --> 00:14:58,664
There's talk that despite being born out of wedlock,

226
00:14:58,723 --> 00:15:01,164
she still has a chance at taking over.

227
00:15:01,794 --> 00:15:04,933
They say she as good as controls the foundation.

228
00:15:06,803 --> 00:15:08,034
Are you listening?

229
00:15:08,103 --> 00:15:11,433
That competition. When will you announce it?

230
00:15:11,504 --> 00:15:13,673
What I'm saying is more important than that.

231
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:16,473
- This is the perfect competition. - For whom?

232
00:15:17,343 --> 00:15:21,313
I told you that there's a Ramanujan at our school.

Baek Seung Yoo?

234
00:15:57,014 --> 00:16:00,453
Yes. Can I see his file for the previous semester?

235
00:16:01,683 --> 00:16:02,723
Sure.

236
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:06,764
But why? Is he in trouble?

237
00:16:07,223 --> 00:16:08,864
No. It's not that.

238
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:11,734

Why are your math grades so low?

333
00:22:15,326 --> 00:22:18,026
Why do you pretend to hate math when you actually like it?

334
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,667
Those questions are running through my head, but I won't ask.

A mathematician becomes honest when they prove something.

I want to see your honesty.

343

Exactly.

Some famous mathematicians have low IQs.

Exactly. Why are you doing this to me?

352

It's not because your talent is special.

Your mathematical perspective of the world.

You remember, don't you?

367

The math genius who started at MIT when he was ten years old.

368
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:49,977
But his name was Baek Min Jae.

We changed his name.

When he returned from the US,

so many people called him "the failed genius".

What do you think?

373
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:08,937

You mean from now?

375
00:25:14,907 --> 00:25:16,836
It's because he's going through puberty.

- Puberty? - Everyone is like that at this age.

He's rebelling like crazy.

Why did you want to see me?

379

I heard you discovered many gifted kids.

380
00:25:33,286 --> 00:25:35,997
But I'm sure you've never seen anyone like Seung Yoo.

381
00:25:36,427 --> 00:25:38,796
He makes you enjoy teaching,

382
00:25:38,866 --> 00:25:41,897
so please take him to competitions like Olympiads.

Please lead him toward a bright future.

I still don't know anything about his past.

Do you know what happened to him?

Even if something did happen,

it was eight years ago already.

Eight years?

390
00:26:08,086 --> 00:26:12,766
Yes, but it's not like you lose what made you a genius.

391

I don't think he needs me...

I'm not sure yet either.

Why?

402
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:51,397
It's unnecessary competition.

403
00:26:52,036 --> 00:26:53,366
"Unnecessary competition"?

404
00:26:53,806 --> 00:26:55,677
It'd be a waste of energy to compete with kids...

who aren't even going to enter the competition.

00:41:10,497 --> 00:41:13,397
My horse could've won. It came in second.

494
00:41:14,198 --> 00:41:15,568
- Number three? - Yes.

495
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:21,678
You're wrong. That horse never managed to get ahead.

496
00:41:21,738 --> 00:41:24,877
You can't say it could've won. It lost, pure and simple.

497
00:41:26,147 --> 00:41:27,147
Listen.

498
00:41:27,747 --> 00:41:31,318
Half of the winning horses win because of their bloodline.

499
00:41:31,647 --> 00:41:33,057
They look different.

500
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:34,658
They have strong shoulders,

501
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:37,428
thick chests, and shorter backs.

502
00:41:39,127 --> 00:41:41,997
Then you must be born to win.

503
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,937
If you're not born with it,

504
00:41:46,368 --> 00:41:48,968
however hard you try, you can never win.

505
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:52,167
What?

506
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:54,678
If we have different starting points,

507
00:41:55,338 --> 00:41:57,377
and different conditions, I can't win.

508
00:41:59,377 --> 00:42:00,377
Can I?

509
00:42:06,588 --> 00:42:08,718
Hello. You made it.

510
00:42:09,928 --> 00:42:10,928
Sit.

511
00:42:16,798 --> 00:42:18,298
Why did you call this late?

512
00:42:21,638 --> 00:42:22,968
It's busy early in the semester.

513
00:42:23,537 --> 00:42:25,568
Make an appointment and get some rest.

514
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:29,508
How is planning going for the school's math competition?

515
00:42:30,207 --> 00:42:32,917
There's not much to do. Exams are a norm.

516
00:42:32,977 --> 00:42:36,548
Do you have to open it up to the whole school?

517
00:42:39,287 --> 00:42:41,187
- Why? - It's just a hassle.

518
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:42,488
Too many answers to grade.

519
00:42:43,457 --> 00:42:45,687
Why torture students with hope?

520
00:42:45,928 --> 00:42:48,557
- "Torture with hope"? - It wouldn't happen,

521
00:42:49,057 --> 00:42:50,997
but if someone random wins...

522
00:42:51,227 --> 00:42:52,428
and we must rectify that...

523
00:42:52,497 --> 00:42:53,798
"Someone random"...

Baek Seung Yoo?

525
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:57,307
You know the punk?

526
00:42:57,568 --> 00:43:00,877
Mr. Sung. Don't call one of my students a punk.

527
00:43:00,937 --> 00:43:02,307
That punk is...

528
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:07,347
I know the kid.

529
00:43:07,917 --> 00:43:09,787
He's troubled.

530
00:43:10,118 --> 00:43:11,787
He was called genius,

531
00:43:11,847 --> 00:43:13,187
but it turned out to be a lie.

532
00:43:14,017 --> 00:43:16,528
You know he gets the worst grades in his year.

533
00:43:16,588 --> 00:43:19,158
What are you so worried about, then?

534
00:43:19,227 --> 00:43:20,557
I'm not worried.

535
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:23,267
We could end up with an annoying situation.

536
00:43:23,327 --> 00:43:25,298
We have a well set-out plan.

537
00:43:25,368 --> 00:43:26,937
Just because we have a plan...

538
00:43:28,097 --> 00:43:29,738
doesn't mean the match is over.

539
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:31,368
What do you mean?

540
00:43:32,408 --> 00:43:33,807
What about my daughter, then?

541
00:43:35,108 --> 00:43:36,647
What got into you?

542
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,108
You're like a child begging for something.

543
00:43:39,178 --> 00:43:40,178
What?

544
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,118
"A child"?

545
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:45,787
Do you know...

546
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:48,457
what the easiest way to get something is?

547
00:43:50,057 --> 00:43:52,187
It's not to say what you want.

548
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:55,997
It's to listen and find out what the other person wants.

549
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,397
- Did you enjoy that? - Yes.

550
00:44:04,338 --> 00:44:07,077
So, what happens in the next episode?

551
00:44:09,377 --> 00:44:11,408
Oh, hello, Ms. Noh.

552
00:44:14,048 --> 00:44:15,178
Ms. Yu.

553
00:44:15,548 --> 00:44:17,048
What are you doing here?

554
00:44:17,118 --> 00:44:19,218
I'm here with my drama staff.

555
00:44:19,287 --> 00:44:20,557
I had a meeting.

556
00:44:20,618 --> 00:44:23,858
Oh, did you? Why are you alone, then?

557
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:26,627
I'm busy and must leave first.

558
00:44:27,028 --> 00:44:28,028
Are you?

559
00:44:28,727 --> 00:44:31,667
I should invite you to dinner one day.

560
00:44:31,997 --> 00:44:33,597
- Shall we go? - Sure.

561
00:44:34,198 --> 00:44:35,198
Let's go.

562
00:44:38,338 --> 00:44:39,577
Goodbye.

563
00:44:48,448 --> 00:44:50,318
I'll treat you to something nice.

564
00:44:50,388 --> 00:44:51,388
Thank you.

565
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:53,118
- Goodbye. - See you.

566
00:44:53,187 --> 00:44:54,187
Bye.

567
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:08,267
You know how hard it is to get approved...

568
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:10,037
as a specialized school.

569
00:45:10,468 --> 00:45:12,908
Only one school in Seoul will get the honour.

570
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:15,678
But 15 autonomous private schools are competing.

571
00:45:16,508 --> 00:45:18,178
The judging committee...

572
00:45:19,678 --> 00:45:21,347
will be put together soon.

573
00:45:21,417 --> 00:45:22,888
You want me to rig that...

574
00:45:24,247 --> 00:45:25,747
in your favour?

575
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:31,227
If you have a specialized school in your constituency,

576
00:45:31,988 --> 00:45:36,198
wouldn't that benefit you in the upcoming general election?

577
00:45:48,937 --> 00:45:50,608
I'll see what I can do.

578
00:45:51,847 --> 00:45:54,477
But you have to make sure you come through with that.

579
00:45:54,548 --> 00:45:56,088
Not just with this competition.

580

Make sure there's no problem with Ye Rin's rank at school.

And you're a student at Asung High?

659
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:19,318
What a small world.

660
00:54:21,187 --> 00:54:23,627
Please be nice to Yoon Su...

661

My gosh. My son.

665
00:54:44,377 --> 00:54:46,818
I'm so proud of you. I'm so very proud.

666
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:49,818
Get ready.

667
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,118
To go to the specialized science high school.

668
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:55,287
Let's start over.

669
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,858
Your teacher told me everything.

670
00:54:59,658 --> 00:55:00,957
Why did you rebel so much...

671
00:55:01,928 --> 00:55:03,767
if you were going to do it anyway?

672
00:55:06,198 --> 00:55:09,198
Your teacher even sent a letter of recommendation for you.

673
00:55:09,937 --> 00:55:11,437
I'll get you a tutor,

674
00:55:11,968 --> 00:55:13,307
so prepare for the entrance exam.

675
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:16,977
I don't want to.

676
00:55:18,347 --> 00:55:19,778
- Seung Yoo. - No.

677
00:55:20,977 --> 00:55:22,048
I won't do it.

678
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:23,548
- But Seung Yoo... - No?

679
00:55:23,618 --> 00:55:25,247
- Oh, no. - You punk.

680
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:27,517
Honey.

681
00:55:27,917 --> 00:55:29,187
- Honey. - Look!

682
00:55:29,957 --> 00:55:31,127
Look at that!

683
00:55:33,057 --> 00:55:34,557
We waited eight years.

684
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,727
There were times when I thought you were dead.

685
00:55:39,368 --> 00:55:41,338
There were times when I would've preferred that.

686
00:55:42,497 --> 00:55:43,707
Fill this cabinet!

687
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:46,707
You can't do anything you want until this is full.

688
00:55:47,178 --> 00:55:48,178
You understand?

689
00:55:48,908 --> 00:55:50,477
I want you to fill this cabinet again!

690
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:52,747
Tell me that you will.

691
00:55:53,347 --> 00:55:54,548
Give me an answer!

692
00:56:16,298 --> 00:56:17,368
What's all this?

693
00:56:18,238 --> 00:56:20,207
I'm going to take them to school.

Didn't they used to belong to your father?

696
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:26,647
Yes.

697
00:56:27,318 --> 00:56:29,377
What are you going to do with them? Why not just throw them out?

698
00:56:33,687 --> 00:56:37,127
Actually, you should donate them to the school library.

699
00:56:37,187 --> 00:56:39,158
They're hard to find these days, right?

700
00:56:40,428 --> 00:56:41,428
Right.

701
00:56:45,897 --> 00:56:47,838
When are we planning to check out the wedding dresses next week?

702
00:56:48,298 --> 00:56:49,897
- Thursday. - That's right.

703
00:56:50,738 --> 00:56:52,267
I'll be off now. Go on inside.

704
00:57:06,988 --> 00:57:07,988
Seung Yoo.

705
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,537
What is it? What's the matter?

706
00:57:24,138 --> 00:57:25,368
A specialized science high school?

707
00:57:26,838 --> 00:57:28,238
What? What are you talking about?

708
00:57:29,778 --> 00:57:33,577
Either way, Baek Seung Yoo, nor Baek Min Jae.

709
00:57:35,017 --> 00:57:36,618
I'm glad we met.

Seung Yoo's father?

712
00:58:19,988 --> 00:58:22,358
Yes. He called earlier.

713
00:58:22,428 --> 00:58:23,968
He asked us if Seung Yoo could leave early...

714
00:58:24,028 --> 00:58:25,428
for an interview at a specialized science high school.

715
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:28,397
By the way, I had no idea...

716
00:58:28,468 --> 00:58:31,207
that Seung Yoo was the famous math genius.

717
00:58:33,267 --> 00:58:35,008
Is that why you were interested in him?

Let's study math together.

Don't go to another school. Just study here.

I heard you recommended me to go to a science high school.

00:59:31,698 --> 00:59:33,868
I don't know how things led to that.

00:59:34,698 --> 00:59:36,468
But I'll convince your father to change his mind.

730

It doesn't matter whether or not you're a math genius.

It doesn't matter whether or not you're still good at math.

00:59:47,077 --> 00:59:48,147
But...

733
00:59:50,247 --> 00:59:52,517
you and I both know.

734
00:59:55,818 --> 00:59:57,227
That moment when you're so focused...

that you can't hear...

736

or feel anything else.

737
01:00:18,307 --> 01:00:20,048
The freedom you feel in that very moment.

738
01:00:23,548 --> 01:00:26,588
Don't let go of that freedom, Seung Yoo.

739
01:00:39,528 --> 01:00:40,537
Hello?

740
