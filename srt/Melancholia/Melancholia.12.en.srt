What will you do about it then?

81

Is the seed of an apple...

82
00:05:53,758 --> 00:05:55,059
a fruit or not?

83

What are you on about?

84
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:58,359
A seed is not a fruit.

85
00:05:59,398 --> 00:06:02,828
But if it's sown and grown, it becomes a tree that bears fruit.

00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:39,478
Because that was all I had left.

168
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,309
I needed to do that to survive!

169
00:10:43,348 --> 00:10:45,448
And now I finally found you, so why...

170
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,488
Why do you say math is all I have?

171
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:53,389
Why can't I have something more important than math?

172
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:18,379
I never...

173
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:22,649
wanted to become more important than math to you.

174
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:25,188
I never will.

175
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,759
The proof you announced you do.

176
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:33,629
It's not more beautiful or worthy than a line of geometry.

177
00:11:54,818 --> 00:11:57,088
He's too good to ruin.

178
00:11:58,348 --> 00:11:59,659
Why are you so startled?

179
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,059
Did you not learn anything...

180
00:12:02,728 --> 00:12:04,488
from the photos that were taken at Jeju Airport?

181
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:25,818
(Noh Yeon Woo)

182
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:31,389
(Noh Yeon Woo)

183
00:12:31,448 --> 00:12:33,488
I apologize for making you come in early.

184
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:36,789
As the head of the school, I wanted to provide...

185
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:39,858
an explanation regarding yesterday and tell you something important.

186
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:44,299
Mr. Paik Seung Yoo's actions and statements...

187
00:12:44,368 --> 00:12:47,269
will be investigated and will be disciplined accordingly.

188
00:12:47,338 --> 00:12:50,809
Is it true that Asung High did something...

189
00:12:51,868 --> 00:12:53,078
improper?

190
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,448
Why are you looking at me?

191
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:01,618
What did you hear? They're all groundless rumours.

192
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,088
Groundless?

193
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,718
I'm not making it up.

194
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:05,818
Ma'am.

195
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:09,588
This isn't Asung High, it's Asung Academy of Mathematics and Arts.

196
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:12,629
And as you all know, midterms are coming up.

197
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,129
School grades are the most important in the efforts...

198
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:17,529
to get into ivy league schools.

199
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:19,039
As I had mentioned,

200
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,938
I've arranged for a meeting with the best consultant.

201
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,509
He will share the latest information that he obtained...

202
00:13:25,578 --> 00:13:27,208
through his connections...

203
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:29,909
with ivy league admissions officers and what must be done.

204
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,649
Let's head there now.

205
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,978
The upcoming midterms...

206
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:37,218
will be used to boost the grades of the Global Talent Class kids.

207
00:13:37,218 --> 00:13:38,318
(Students in the Project)

208
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:41,958
What is it?

209
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:46,629
Are you afraid Ji Yoon Su will know what we're doing?

210
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:49,899
I know I've been thorough with security,

211
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:53,568
but since I had kept someone with ill intent by my side,

212
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:55,639
I can't help but be wary.

213
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,169
Minister Kyung Woo Min.

214
00:13:57,238 --> 00:13:58,909
Minguk Party Leader Sung Min Jun.

215
00:13:58,978 --> 00:14:01,009
Son Seung Yun, a professor at Hanguk Law School.

216
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:03,309
Kim Yun Joon, chairman of Myungjin Daily.

217
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:06,718
The parents of the kids in the Global Talent Class...

218
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,218
are people like that.

219
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:13,188
As in, even if a problem does arise...

220
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:17,759
These people have our backs.

221
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:19,958
What is there to fear?

222
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:22,299
Come in.

223
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:25,838
The parents of Asung Academy students are here.

224
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:26,899
Okay.

225
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:31,968
The student, a junior at Asung High...

226
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:34,978
What is going on here?

227
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,049
was me.

228
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:39,149
Why is Seung Yoo doing that?

229
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,059
Seung Yoo.

230
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,059
What happened?

231
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:50,328
You must be shocked.

232
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,129
Please have a seat. I need to tell you something.

233
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:57,529
What should we do?

234
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,198
Is there a way I can help?

235
00:15:02,838 --> 00:15:05,509
Darn it. Ji Yoon Su, that craft brat...

236
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:08,539
was a famous instructor at a clinic in Hangok-dong.

237
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:11,078
I almost sent Yoo Chan there.

238
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:13,379
Just thinking about it gives me goosebumps.

239
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:20,519
I'll see you after it's over.

240
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,629
You got this for me from Italy.

241
00:15:25,728 --> 00:15:27,598
Ms. Noh had the exact same one.

242
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:29,968
Maybe she has a similar one.

243
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:32,669
I didn't sleep well last night...

244
00:15:32,738 --> 00:15:34,338
so my face is a wreck.

245
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:45,379
How's Ye Rin?

246
00:15:45,718 --> 00:15:46,718
What?

247
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,948
She's a total mess.

248
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:54,059
She has been through a lot.

249
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:56,389
What do you mean?

250
00:15:57,358 --> 00:15:58,659
Haven't you heard?

251
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:01,429
About Ji Yoon Su's relationship with Paik Seung Yoo.

252
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,269
She knew for a while now.

253
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,129
Knew what?

254
00:16:05,328 --> 00:16:07,899
Did something happen to Ye Rin?

255
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:10,338
You're saying...

256
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,108
it was all true?

257
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:16,078
They started that lie...

258
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,009
about you and Ms. Ji Yoon Su...

259
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,118
to cover up Assemblyman Sung Min Jun's daughter cheating?

260
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:22,848
Yes.

261
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:23,948
Drop it.

262
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:26,419
They couldn't even prosecute the case.

263
00:16:26,488 --> 00:16:28,019
Do you think anything will happen now?

264
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,728
That's why I must do it now before it gets any later.

265
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,088
I said to drop it!

266
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:33,299
Leave that school right now.

267
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:35,698
- Father. - Why can't you live a quiet life?

268
00:16:36,468 --> 00:16:38,468
Why do you keep making it worse?

269
00:16:39,238 --> 00:16:41,639
This is a critical stage in your life.

270
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,438
You have so much to do.

271
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:44,809
I'm not making it worse,

272
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:46,438
I'm solving problems I couldn't in the past.

273
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:47,809
Are you still seeing...

274
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,779
that woman?

275
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:53,118
Answer me.

276
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,679
Are you?

277
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:58,588
It's not what you think.

278
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:00,118
Then? What is it?

279
00:17:00,488 --> 00:17:01,618
I'll tell you later.

280
00:17:01,718 --> 00:17:03,389
I have to get to work. Bye.

281
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,988
Was this it?

282
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,399
Was this why...

283
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,629
you sent us your thesis and came over to eat?

284
00:17:12,228 --> 00:17:13,568
To placate us?

285
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:15,568
How could you say that?

286
00:17:17,908 --> 00:17:19,039
Then promise...

287
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:22,108
you won't get involved with her ever again.

288
00:17:23,378 --> 00:17:26,118
If you're trying to prove there was nothing there before,

289
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:27,749
why are you close now?

290
00:17:27,818 --> 00:17:29,388
Who would believe you then?

291
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:31,489
Am I wrong?

292
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:39,959
If you see her again,

293
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,928
we'll be the ones disowning you this time.

294
00:17:44,469 --> 00:17:47,368
You can do as you wish if you never want to see us again.

295
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,809
Why that jerk.

296
00:17:52,068 --> 00:17:53,709
How could he...

297
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:00,148
Don't mind what he said.

298
00:18:00,219 --> 00:18:01,219
I'm okay.

299
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:03,318
I'll come back.

300
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,559
Seriously! You jerk.

301
00:18:10,628 --> 00:18:12,088
Bitter? What for?

302
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:13,598
My mom said...

303
00:18:13,858 --> 00:18:15,229
they were no joke.

304
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:16,368
- How? - In what way?

305
00:18:16,668 --> 00:18:19,199
- In the middle of the night... - At night?

306
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:21,039
- In the classroom... - That's insane.

307
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:22,439
Watch your mouth.

308
00:18:22,908 --> 00:18:25,568
What do you know? You didn't see it yourselves.

309
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,709
What about you? What do you know?

310
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:29,709
More than you punks.

311
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,648
You went to that clinic, is that it?

312
00:18:33,318 --> 00:18:35,549
I hear Ji Yoon Su is an instructor there.

313
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:37,148
My mom told me.

314
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,418
That must be why they made a fuss regarding confidentiality.

315
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:43,158
Because she has a sordid past.

316
00:18:44,628 --> 00:18:46,358
She got kicked out anyway.

317
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,529
We have to make sure Paik Seung Yoo and that woman can never come back.

318
00:18:49,598 --> 00:18:51,868
I said to stop talking about them like that.

319
00:18:52,739 --> 00:18:54,199
Who do you think you are?

320
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:55,568
Quiet. Everyone.

321
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:58,638
Take your seats.

322
00:19:00,378 --> 00:19:03,178
Mr. Paik Seung Yoo's class will be a self-study session.

323
00:19:03,578 --> 00:19:04,648
Start studying.

324
00:19:09,118 --> 00:19:11,618
You have been terminated as of today.

325
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:14,888
You may not teach or do anything else here.

326
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:17,059
Breach of duty and harming the school's reputation.

327
00:19:17,128 --> 00:19:18,858
Those are the grounds.

328
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,199
Read and sign it.

329
00:19:27,598 --> 00:19:29,739
(Paik Seung Yoo)

330
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:31,939
There will be a disciplinary hearing soon.

331
00:19:34,878 --> 00:19:36,108
Kicking me out...

332
00:19:36,178 --> 00:19:37,908
won't stop me from doing what I must.

333
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:39,779
You know that, right?

334
00:19:42,618 --> 00:19:44,519
Can you prove...

335
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,719
that you love someone with math?

336
00:19:50,158 --> 00:19:52,128
What about not loving someone?

337
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,628
Can you prove it...

338
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:57,068
with formulas and logic?

339
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,199
It's a great new challenge.

340
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:05,638
It may be the most difficult problem...

341
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:07,578
in your life.

342
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:09,749
What do you mean?

343
00:20:10,348 --> 00:20:12,408
That which you are attempting to prove...

344
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,949
may not be regarding defamation,

345
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:18,888
but rather love.

(Explanation for Termination)

347
00:20:47,304 --> 00:20:49,334
Paik Seung Yoo may quit.

348
00:20:50,675 --> 00:20:54,104
No, not quit. He's being kicked out.

349
00:20:54,844 --> 00:20:56,875
Poor you. You're losing someone on your side.

350
00:20:57,744 --> 00:20:58,814
Hey, Ji Na.

351
00:20:59,615 --> 00:21:01,885
I told you before that you scared me, right?

352
00:21:03,284 --> 00:21:04,514
I take it back.

353
00:21:04,985 --> 00:21:06,725
- I pity you. - What?

354
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:09,195
The principal is your mom.

355
00:21:09,695 --> 00:21:12,824
Unlike me, you have someone who will always have your back.

356
00:21:13,165 --> 00:21:14,695
So why do you go out of your way to pick fights?

357
00:21:16,665 --> 00:21:17,665
Oh, wait.

358
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:20,304
You don't like your mom very much, do you?

359
00:21:21,004 --> 00:21:23,334
But you still enjoy the perks of being her daughter.

360
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,004
You're awfully two-faced.

361
00:21:38,084 --> 00:21:39,824
Hey, come out here right now!

362
00:21:41,354 --> 00:21:43,955
Hey! Come out here!

363
00:21:45,254 --> 00:21:47,895
I know you live here.

364
00:21:48,094 --> 00:21:49,665
How shameless.

365
00:21:50,034 --> 00:21:53,435
I know there's something going on between you two.

366
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:55,774
You already made him fall for you when he was young,

367
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:58,774
and you're getting in the way of his future by doing it again.

368
00:21:58,844 --> 00:21:59,875
Open the door!

369
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,445
Open up! Now!

370
00:22:02,814 --> 00:22:03,844
What is she doing?

371
00:22:07,145 --> 00:22:08,784
You must have no conscience.

372
00:22:09,314 --> 00:22:11,314
Brace yourself.

373
00:22:11,485 --> 00:22:12,985
I'm going to make sure you pay for this.

374
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,195
Come to school.

375
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:25,435
The principal wishes to see you.

376
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:50,824
Why did you want to see me?

377
00:22:51,054 --> 00:22:52,195
Sit down.

378
00:22:57,395 --> 00:23:00,304
There's something I want to share with you.

379
00:23:06,145 --> 00:23:08,945
You can do whatever you want with it.

380
00:23:20,985 --> 00:23:22,054
I'm repaying you...

381
00:23:22,354 --> 00:23:25,794
for sharing the photos you took at Jeju Island.

382
00:23:28,425 --> 00:23:31,294
There were many, but I picked out the best one.

383
00:23:32,735 --> 00:23:34,034
Use it to your advantage.

384
00:24:00,725 --> 00:24:02,435
- Hello? - Where are you?

385
00:24:12,645 --> 00:24:14,104
Why did you want to see me all of a sudden?

386
00:24:14,175 --> 00:24:15,814
I was busy. Couldn't you have waited until I got home?

387
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:18,244
I went to see Ji Yoon Su today.

388
00:24:18,645 --> 00:24:20,985
- Did you meet her? - No, I failed.

389
00:24:21,985 --> 00:24:23,155
What's your plan?

390
00:24:24,514 --> 00:24:26,225
Principal Noh is going to deal with it on her own.

391
00:24:26,284 --> 00:24:28,685
- You should take your mind off it. - How am I supposed to do that?

392
00:24:28,754 --> 00:24:31,955
When did you ever manage to take care of anything properly?

393
00:24:33,395 --> 00:24:36,564
Don't do anything rash. Just be careful.

394
00:24:38,235 --> 00:24:40,935
You can't do anything without Principal Noh, can you?

395
00:24:41,604 --> 00:24:42,604
What?

396
00:24:46,145 --> 00:24:47,205
You should go.

397
00:24:47,274 --> 00:24:49,574
Let's open a bottle of this wine too after the audit.

398
00:24:49,915 --> 00:24:51,014
Explain this.

399
00:24:51,645 --> 00:24:53,584
Is there something going on between you and Noh Jung Ah?

400
00:24:53,645 --> 00:24:55,215
What is this?

401
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:57,155
What do you think you're doing?

402
00:24:59,685 --> 00:25:02,054
Explain this to me right now.

403
00:25:02,524 --> 00:25:03,725
What's going on between you two?

404
00:25:05,094 --> 00:25:07,994
- We take advantage of each other. - What? You take advantage?

405
00:25:08,064 --> 00:25:09,435
Don't you understand?

406
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:11,635
Thanks to Principal Noh, Ye Rin and Yoo Chan...

407
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:14,135
were able to receive a lot of special treatment.

408
00:25:14,705 --> 00:25:18,004
In return, I do what she asks and give her information.

409
00:25:18,905 --> 00:25:20,705
- I thought you knew that already. - I see.

410
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:24,044
So you give her information and affection. Is that correct?

411
00:25:24,115 --> 00:25:26,215
- Hye Mi! - You startled me.

412
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:27,645
We don't have time for this.

413
00:25:28,885 --> 00:25:30,655
You need to stay focused.

414
00:25:31,415 --> 00:25:33,024
If you have time to sneak around behind my back,

415
00:25:34,024 --> 00:25:35,324
use that time to take better care of Ye Rin.

416
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:47,304
Does Yoon Su still spend time with that boy?

417
00:25:47,764 --> 00:25:49,735
I can't believe that has become an issue again.

418
00:25:52,945 --> 00:25:53,975
Mom.

419
00:25:54,104 --> 00:25:56,215
You should hurry up and marry Chairman Noh In Hyung's...

420
00:25:57,274 --> 00:25:58,675
youngest daughter, Yeon Woo.

421
00:26:00,014 --> 00:26:01,844
We need to make things clear and draw a line...

422
00:26:01,915 --> 00:26:03,885
before people start spreading groundless rumours.

423
00:26:04,715 --> 00:26:07,185
It won't do us any good to get involved in this mess.

424
00:26:08,655 --> 00:26:10,195
I'll take care of it.

425
00:26:10,254 --> 00:26:11,324
Are you sure about that?

426
00:26:12,494 --> 00:26:14,294
You held onto a woman that your father and I disapproved of,

427
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:15,594
and look where that got you.

428
00:26:15,935 --> 00:26:17,994
You can't take care of anything.

429
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:20,905
Just hurry up and get a move on with the wedding.

430
00:26:28,274 --> 00:26:29,475
Your signature, please.

431
00:26:31,044 --> 00:26:32,074
Thank you.

432
00:26:32,784 --> 00:26:34,244
- Let's go. - Okay.

433
00:26:39,554 --> 00:26:41,655
You and Sung Jae should quickly get married.

434
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:42,794
I trust that you'll handle this.

435
00:26:44,655 --> 00:26:46,824
Of course, Mother. Don't worry.

436
00:26:54,104 --> 00:26:55,104
Hey.

437
00:26:57,304 --> 00:26:59,244
- We're ready for our meal. - Okay, ma'am.

438
00:27:08,985 --> 00:27:11,685
This will come in handy at the board meeting.

439
00:27:12,354 --> 00:27:14,685
First, check the list of shareholders.

440
00:27:14,824 --> 00:27:15,824
I will.

441
00:27:17,425 --> 00:27:18,824
This is exactly what I wanted.

442
00:27:19,824 --> 00:27:22,324
If I also manage to prove that Jung Ah stole money...

443
00:27:22,395 --> 00:27:25,034
from the foundation to fill her own pockets,

444
00:27:25,695 --> 00:27:27,435
I'll definitely be able to bring her down.

445
00:27:28,465 --> 00:27:30,235
- Please hurry. - Once she loses authority,

446
00:27:30,304 --> 00:27:33,175
it'll become easier for Mr. Paik to deal with her.

447
00:27:35,844 --> 00:27:37,475
By the way, I also brought a gift.

448
00:27:46,685 --> 00:27:50,254
(Jeju Verta School)

449
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:52,625
If you're up for it, I'll write you a recommendation.

450
00:27:52,925 --> 00:27:54,225
Let me know if you're interested.

451
00:28:02,334 --> 00:28:03,375
You're here.

452
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:05,975
I invited him for lunch as well.

453
00:28:06,074 --> 00:28:08,044
I hope you're both okay with this.

454
00:28:10,044 --> 00:28:11,074
Have a seat.

455
00:28:18,485 --> 00:28:19,885
I heard you met your mother.

456
00:28:21,254 --> 00:28:24,655
She texted me and asked me to hurry up and get married.

457
00:28:29,865 --> 00:28:31,034
We're getting married.

458
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:34,935
Fate really has a way of surprising you, right?

459
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:38,804
You can never know where life will lead you.

460
00:28:41,604 --> 00:28:43,774
The same goes for your relationship with Mr. Paik.

461
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:50,615
Yoon Su.

462
00:28:52,655 --> 00:28:54,784
Are you guys done talking?

463
00:28:56,425 --> 00:28:57,455
I should go now.

464
00:28:57,455 --> 00:28:58,625
Aren't you going to congratulate us?

465
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:05,435
Congratulations to the both of you.

466
00:29:17,975 --> 00:29:21,514
You shouldn't have looked so angry at me in front of Yoon Su.

467
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,814
Couldn't you keep a straight face?

468
00:29:24,084 --> 00:29:26,155
You expected me to be considerate of you...

469
00:29:28,155 --> 00:29:29,725
after what you pulled on me?

470
00:29:30,455 --> 00:29:32,155
I personally think I tried my best.

471
00:29:32,725 --> 00:29:34,494
At least I didn't tell her that I haven't actually...

472
00:29:34,494 --> 00:29:36,235
made up my mind about getting married.

473
00:29:40,304 --> 00:29:42,804
I expect this to be the last time...

474
00:29:44,975 --> 00:29:46,875
you use Yoon Su to provoke me.

475
00:29:48,205 --> 00:29:50,445
That is if you're really willing to marry me.

476
00:29:52,314 --> 00:29:54,584
Yoon Su gave me the important file.

477
00:29:57,715 --> 00:29:58,915
Jung Ah...

478
00:29:59,824 --> 00:30:03,024
will never be able to become the chairwoman of Asung Foundation.

479
00:30:04,324 --> 00:30:06,165
Think of the odds,

480
00:30:06,225 --> 00:30:08,824
and make sure you watch what you say and how you behave.

481
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:31,455
That's my point exactly.

482
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,324
We're only doing this to use each other.

483
00:30:34,385 --> 00:30:37,824
So why waste energy by getting emotional like this?

484
00:31:01,185 --> 00:31:02,814
She still forgets stuff easily.

485
00:31:03,514 --> 00:31:05,455
- This is what I'm talking about. - Gosh.

486
00:31:05,455 --> 00:31:06,455
Paik Seung Yoo!

487
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:07,824
Over here.

488
00:31:08,425 --> 00:31:09,754
You yesterday...

489
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,895
My legs almost gave way, I was so shocked, you know.

490
00:31:13,094 --> 00:31:14,594
- Hi. - How are you?

491
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:16,494
There must've been quite the aftermath.

492
00:31:16,635 --> 00:31:18,334
- I got disciplined. - Hey.

493
00:31:18,994 --> 00:31:20,905
I'll ask out of pure curiosity.

494
00:31:21,264 --> 00:31:23,074
What's going on between you and Ms. Ji?

495
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:25,175
Do you like her?

496
00:31:25,705 --> 00:31:27,304
What are you on about?

497
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,715
You had a thing for Ms. Ji back then.

498
00:31:30,645 --> 00:31:31,715
Do you still like her?

499
00:31:35,945 --> 00:31:38,415
What do you mean "still"?

500
00:31:38,514 --> 00:31:40,084
Did you meet Ms. Ji?

501
00:31:40,155 --> 00:31:41,354
Not just meet.

502
00:31:41,584 --> 00:31:43,094
They're really close.

503
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,824
- Is that true? - That's not right.

504
00:31:46,895 --> 00:31:48,895
- You can't do that. - Why can't I?

505
00:31:48,965 --> 00:31:50,794
What? Well...

506
00:31:50,865 --> 00:31:52,665
Wait. Hang on.

507
00:31:54,104 --> 00:31:55,365
You said you were set up.

508
00:31:56,074 --> 00:31:57,635
That nothing happened,

509
00:31:57,705 --> 00:31:59,135
but you were wrongfully framed.

510
00:31:59,504 --> 00:32:00,604
And now you're dating?

511
00:32:00,675 --> 00:32:02,975
What on earth is that? Do you like each other?

512
00:32:03,044 --> 00:32:04,175
Let's not go there.

513
00:32:05,344 --> 00:32:07,544
- Seung Yoo. - Hey!

514
00:32:08,244 --> 00:32:09,314
That lunatic.

515
00:32:10,385 --> 00:32:13,084
- Sung Ye Rin? - What was she doing over there?

516
00:32:13,485 --> 00:32:14,485
How long was she there for?

517
00:32:14,554 --> 00:32:15,554
Seung Yoo.

518
00:32:22,935 --> 00:32:25,494
I like you.

519
00:32:31,004 --> 00:32:32,104
I like you.

520
00:32:34,145 --> 00:32:35,405
I like you.

521
00:32:36,244 --> 00:32:37,844
Why won't you say anything?

522
00:32:41,945 --> 00:32:45,655
You needed a confession of my mistake, not my love.

523
00:32:46,324 --> 00:32:47,955
So you used my feelings.

524
00:32:48,024 --> 00:32:49,925
I hoped you'd be honest.

525
00:32:49,994 --> 00:32:51,425
About why you did what you did.

526
00:32:59,235 --> 00:33:00,804
I did it because I liked you.

527
00:33:01,935 --> 00:33:03,175
Out of jealously.

528
00:33:03,975 --> 00:33:06,244
I wanted to tear you and Ms. Ji apart.

529
00:33:07,004 --> 00:33:09,175
Why cry and scream if you like someone?

530
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,844
Liking someone makes you smile with happiness.

531
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:18,014
You want the other person to smile and be happy.

532
00:33:20,354 --> 00:33:22,055
You don't like me.

533
00:33:22,954 --> 00:33:23,954
Then what was it?

534
00:33:24,555 --> 00:33:27,095
You were able to have anything you wanted but not me.

535
00:33:27,624 --> 00:33:29,794
So you wanted me and the person I loved to become unhappy.

536
00:33:29,865 --> 00:33:30,865
Am I wrong?

537
00:33:36,774 --> 00:33:37,774
We're leaving.

Hello?

Isn't this Ji Yoon Su's phone?

546

This is Ryu Sung Jae speaking.

547
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:10,954
Why do you have her phone?

548
00:36:11,024 --> 00:36:12,394
The bombshell you dropped yesterday.

549
00:36:12,655 --> 00:36:14,064
Did she agree to it?

550
00:36:15,894 --> 00:36:17,265
If you fail to prove it,

551
00:36:17,334 --> 00:36:19,595
who do you think will take the biggest hit?

552
00:36:21,204 --> 00:36:24,274
You're a successful mathematician with a place to go back to,

553
00:36:24,334 --> 00:36:26,035
but not Yoon Su. Do you get that?

554
00:36:27,704 --> 00:36:29,144
What is it you want to say?

555
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,245
If it's not what Yoon Su wants, learn to take a step back and wait.

556
00:36:34,084 --> 00:36:35,544
Find out what she wants.

557
00:36:37,115 --> 00:36:38,314
Ask her.

558
00:36:39,015 --> 00:36:41,325
Don't just drag her along.

559
00:36:41,724 --> 00:36:44,794
Don't force what you want or how you do things on her.

560
00:36:46,155 --> 00:36:47,224
Is that advice?

561
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,564
What would've happened if I had done that?

562
00:36:53,735 --> 00:36:55,104
It's a murmur of regret.

563
00:36:58,474 --> 00:37:01,544
I'm not rooting for you, so don't get the wrong idea.

564
00:37:09,184 --> 00:37:11,584
Even if I fail to prove the assignment,

565
00:37:12,155 --> 00:37:15,285
Yoon Su won't be the one who takes the biggest hit.

566
00:37:17,425 --> 00:37:18,995
I won't let that happen.

Guess what?

568
00:37:24,135 --> 00:37:25,765
The biggest wound...

569
00:37:27,305 --> 00:37:29,434
is usually caused by the one closest to you.

570
00:38:37,175 --> 00:38:39,774
- Where are you going? - Outside. A car followed you here.

00:38:39,874 --> 00:38:41,905
- Now? - He took photos too.

572

I'll call you. Go home.

Are you his guardian?

- Is he badly hurt? - It looks like a slight concussion.

589
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:24,207
The CT scan didn't show much.

Your head doesn't hurt?

598
00:42:58,566 --> 00:43:00,136

602

stop now?

610

- and who ordered it. - So what?

Regardless, I will uncover the truth of what happened.

I was kicked out of the school...

Are you threatening me on top of that?

I'm giving you advice and asking for a favour.

If you tell the truth,

it'll help mitigate your charges.

00:47:05,417 --> 00:47:07,647
to kick that witch out.

658
00:47:07,747 --> 00:47:08,946
What are you talking about?

659
00:47:09,017 --> 00:47:11,816
They love each other to death.

660
00:47:12,187 --> 00:47:14,957
Seung Yoo goes to her every day. He's obsessed.

661
00:47:15,026 --> 00:47:16,727
- What? - She lives nearby.

662
00:47:16,787 --> 00:47:17,796
- Get out. - What was that?

663
00:47:17,857 --> 00:47:19,127
- Oh my gosh. - Get out!

664
00:47:19,196 --> 00:47:20,466
- What's wrong with you? - Go.

665
00:47:21,727 --> 00:47:23,667
- What... - I said to leave.

666
00:47:23,736 --> 00:47:26,296
You shouldn't treat me like this.

667
00:47:26,366 --> 00:47:28,736
My gosh. I'm not lying.

668
00:47:29,667 --> 00:47:31,276
Where does she live?

669
00:47:35,377 --> 00:47:36,917
You don't like me.

670
00:47:38,046 --> 00:47:40,287
You were able to have anything you wanted but not me.

671
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:43,147
So you wanted me and the person I loved to become unhappy.

672
00:48:01,937 --> 00:48:03,406
Use it to your advantage.

(Sung Ye Rin)

675
00:48:25,557 --> 00:48:26,557
Hello?

676
00:48:43,747 --> 00:48:45,747
You said I didn't like you, right?

677
00:48:47,287 --> 00:48:50,357
You don't love Ms. Ji either.

678
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,816
You can't let go because you feel guilty.

679
00:48:54,727 --> 00:48:56,187
I'm going to the police tomorrow...

680
00:48:57,827 --> 00:48:58,957
to report...

681
00:49:00,327 --> 00:49:02,366
Principal Noh Jung Ah and your father for corruption...

682
00:49:02,366 --> 00:49:03,397
surrounding Asung.

683
00:49:04,497 --> 00:49:07,107
Get it together. Ms. Ji and I are not your problem right now.

684
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:08,767
You need to get it together.

685
00:49:09,207 --> 00:49:11,877
That woman is using you. She's using your guilt.

686
00:49:11,937 --> 00:49:12,937
Ye Rin!

687
00:49:15,307 --> 00:49:16,807
Do you know whom you're acting like?

688
00:49:18,046 --> 00:49:19,147
Principal Noh Jung Ah.

689
00:49:20,386 --> 00:49:23,247
She brainwashes and uses people to get whatever she wants.

690
00:49:23,316 --> 00:49:24,687
Do you want to be like that monster?

691
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:27,627
It's not too late.

692
00:49:28,457 --> 00:49:29,756
You can be different.

693
00:49:29,827 --> 00:49:31,897
- I met with her. - What?

694
00:49:32,196 --> 00:49:34,426
I told Ji Yoon Su to let you go.

695
00:49:35,966 --> 00:49:37,096
But she didn't.

696
00:49:37,837 --> 00:49:41,337
Rather, she's hiding behind you and using you.

697
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,577
So snap out of it! Don't let yourself be suckered!

698
00:49:45,207 --> 00:49:46,577
I'm warning you.

699
00:49:49,006 --> 00:49:50,446
Don't do that again.

700
00:49:54,647 --> 00:49:55,816
What else is it then?

701
00:49:56,346 --> 00:49:57,687
Does she say she loves you?

702
00:49:59,316 --> 00:50:00,656
You don't care if you're being used?

703
00:50:01,156 --> 00:50:02,857
Because you love Ms. Ji Yoon Su?

704
00:50:03,957 --> 00:50:04,997
Yes.

705
00:50:06,857 --> 00:50:08,096
I love her.

706
00:50:24,176 --> 00:50:26,346
- Hello. - Hi, come inside.

707
00:50:26,917 --> 00:50:27,946
It's cold outside, isn't it?

708
00:50:28,386 --> 00:50:29,517
It's not too bad.

709
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:37,627
I bet you were surprised.

710
00:50:38,557 --> 00:50:40,026
There seem to be a lot of surprises these days.

711
00:50:40,096 --> 00:50:42,897
I'm fine. I'm just worried about you.

712
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,906
Oh, take this.

713
00:50:48,866 --> 00:50:51,377
Did you make this yourself?

714
00:50:51,437 --> 00:50:53,337
Yes, it's to prepare you for your midterm exam.

715
00:50:53,406 --> 00:50:55,846
Gosh. Thank you, Ms. Ji.

716
00:51:02,247 --> 00:51:03,247
Hello?

717
00:51:03,517 --> 00:51:05,557
Are you the legal guardian of Ji Hyeon Uk?

718
00:51:06,756 --> 00:51:08,227
Yes, I am.

(Ms. Ji Yoon Su)

720
00:51:32,846 --> 00:51:35,147
(Choi Si An)

721
00:51:36,046 --> 00:51:38,557
- Hello? - Mr. Paik, something happened.

722
00:51:58,207 --> 00:52:00,207
Dad.

723
00:52:01,147 --> 00:52:02,276
What happened?

724
00:52:02,906 --> 00:52:04,577
He had insulin shock.

725
00:52:04,647 --> 00:52:06,616
He hasn't been eating properly these days.

726
00:52:06,676 --> 00:52:07,886
He's malnourished,

727
00:52:07,946 --> 00:52:09,247
so his pneumonia is getting worse.

728
00:52:11,287 --> 00:52:12,957
He's become more obsessive.

729
00:52:13,017 --> 00:52:15,386
He's always writing and reading.

730
00:52:15,787 --> 00:52:16,787
That's how he spends his time.

731
00:52:47,886 --> 00:52:49,227
Dad.

732
00:52:50,057 --> 00:52:51,296
What's the matter?

733
00:52:52,857 --> 00:52:54,767
Dad.

734
00:52:57,397 --> 00:52:59,096
Dad...

735
00:53:03,977 --> 00:53:05,537
Why won't you eat?

736
00:53:06,676 --> 00:53:09,747
Why can't you take your mind off this?

737
00:53:09,807 --> 00:53:12,716
No, you're wrong.

738
00:53:14,716 --> 00:53:16,247
No.

739
00:53:31,267 --> 00:53:32,796
Did you solve the problem?

740
00:53:37,337 --> 00:53:38,537
You should solve it...

741
00:53:39,037 --> 00:53:40,537
even if you don't want to.

742
00:53:47,546 --> 00:53:48,616
I'm scared...

743
00:53:50,857 --> 00:53:51,957
that I might've...

744
00:53:52,957 --> 00:53:54,457
fallen in love with the problem.

745
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:55,986
Sometimes, you must fall in love with the problem...

746
00:53:56,957 --> 00:53:58,696
in order to solve it.

747
00:54:01,526 --> 00:54:03,127
Some problems can't be solved...

748
00:54:03,497 --> 00:54:05,366
if you don't go crazy over them.

749
00:54:06,236 --> 00:54:10,267
They're the only problems that are powerful enough to destroy you.

750
00:54:19,316 --> 00:54:20,517
What if...

751
00:54:21,287 --> 00:54:22,816
there's an error with the premise?

752
00:54:22,886 --> 00:54:24,957
Get rid of the premise.

753
00:54:27,457 --> 00:54:29,857
If you try to solve it even though you know there's an error,

754
00:54:30,156 --> 00:54:31,596
you'll eventually hit a wall.

755
00:54:37,397 --> 00:54:38,397
But at the same time,

756
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:41,366
it's also a mathematician's fate to live his or her life...

757
00:54:41,366 --> 00:54:43,107
looking for the answer.

758
00:54:45,037 --> 00:54:49,647
That doesn't necessarily mean you need to find the right answer.

759
00:54:57,486 --> 00:54:58,656
Professor Ji, are you okay?

760
00:55:04,327 --> 00:55:05,526
Why did he take that off?

761
00:55:07,156 --> 00:55:08,426
I'll go tell the nurse.

762
00:55:42,526 --> 00:55:44,337
Give me just a little more time.

763
00:55:46,136 --> 00:55:47,466
I'll put things to an end.

764
00:55:48,607 --> 00:55:51,477
Those who gave us a hard time will get punished,

765
00:55:54,607 --> 00:55:56,647
and I'll clear everyone's misunderstandings about us.

766
00:55:57,846 --> 00:55:59,346
As for us, I'll make sure we stop...

767
00:56:00,346 --> 00:56:02,417
feeling sorry and guilty about what happened.

768
00:56:04,616 --> 00:56:06,857
Then it'll be just you and me.

769
00:56:10,256 --> 00:56:12,057
Let's start over with a clean slate.

770
00:56:25,837 --> 00:56:29,506
Do you really think we can start over with a clean slate?

771
00:56:32,946 --> 00:56:35,147
The premise is that it wasn't love.

772
00:56:37,116 --> 00:56:39,287
But can the conclusion change and turn into love?

773
00:56:40,417 --> 00:56:41,557
It's true.

774
00:56:42,557 --> 00:56:43,557
Our feelings for each other.

775
00:56:46,557 --> 00:56:48,227
So you can't say it's false.

776
00:56:48,397 --> 00:56:49,397
No.

777
00:56:50,497 --> 00:56:54,506
This isn't about saying what's true is false.

778
00:56:58,437 --> 00:57:00,176
It means there's an error with the premise.

779
00:57:03,807 --> 00:57:05,247
Your proofs...

780
00:57:06,647 --> 00:57:08,147
were always beautiful.

781
00:57:10,687 --> 00:57:13,957
They were clear and concise.

782
00:57:19,196 --> 00:57:21,026
You shouldn't be wasting your time proving something...

783
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:24,466
that has so many errors like this one.

784
00:58:34,037 --> 00:58:35,066
Get some sleep.

785
00:58:35,966 --> 00:58:37,506
Don't skip your meals either.

786
00:58:40,877 --> 00:58:41,906
I'll be back.

787
00:58:52,957 --> 00:58:54,156
Mathematics...

788
00:58:55,087 --> 00:58:56,327
is harmless...

789
00:58:57,627 --> 00:58:59,227
and powerful.

790
00:59:02,526 --> 00:59:05,837
It's pure in and of itself,

791
00:59:06,736 --> 00:59:08,607
and it has no purpose.

792
00:59:11,807 --> 00:59:15,546
It's like a kid that loves to run around playfully.

793
00:59:20,216 --> 00:59:21,517
It really is.

794
00:59:43,066 --> 00:59:44,877
You brought me something very nice.

795
00:59:50,446 --> 00:59:51,446
Are you crying?

796
00:59:53,846 --> 00:59:54,886
Oh, dear.

797
01:00:11,596 --> 01:00:12,796
Why are you crying?

798
01:00:13,736 --> 01:00:15,566
You're wrapping it up nicely yourself.

799
01:00:22,107 --> 01:00:23,207
Do you think...

800
01:00:24,346 --> 01:00:27,647
Seung Yoo's heart will ache for you for at least a moment?

801
01:00:35,127 --> 01:00:37,656
They think their love is virtuous and perfect.

802
01:00:38,596 --> 01:00:40,026
There's no such thing in the world.

803
01:00:45,096 --> 01:00:46,997
You are proving that...

804
01:00:48,136 --> 01:00:49,437
no such thing exists.

805
01:00:51,807 --> 01:00:52,937
I guarantee that...

806
01:00:53,636 --> 01:00:56,307
people will love your proof much more.

807
01:01:14,767 --> 01:01:15,767
Hello?

808
01:01:21,506 --> 01:01:26,236
We shall begin the 2021 Asung Foundation board meeting.

809
01:01:29,506 --> 01:01:31,676
I wish to report something before we get things started.

810
01:01:32,716 --> 01:01:34,886
I believe the foundation's assets are being abused.

811
01:01:34,946 --> 01:01:36,116
It's a serious issue.

812
01:01:36,187 --> 01:01:38,187
It's also an issue that could become grounds...

813
01:01:38,256 --> 01:01:40,187
for Principal Noh Jung Ah's...

814
01:01:40,816 --> 01:01:42,486
punishment and dismissal.

815
01:01:49,667 --> 01:01:50,696
It's Paik Seung Yoo!

816
01:01:50,767 --> 01:01:52,636
Mr. Paik!

817
01:01:52,696 --> 01:01:54,707
Are you here to sue Asung High?

818
01:01:54,767 --> 01:01:57,236
- Yes, I am. - Do you still stand by...

819
01:01:57,307 --> 01:01:59,337
your belief that the scandal was to cover up a rigged exam?

820
01:01:59,337 --> 01:02:00,807
- Yes. - You don't have a relationship...

821
01:02:00,807 --> 01:02:02,446
with the woman who was your teacher?

822
01:02:02,946 --> 01:02:04,346
You're both innocent?

823
01:02:06,446 --> 01:02:09,247
Then what is this? I got a tip.

824
01:02:19,557 --> 01:02:20,627
You don't care?

825
01:02:20,696 --> 01:02:22,327
Because you love Ms. Ji Yoon Su?

826
01:02:22,696 --> 01:02:24,667
Yes. I love her.

827
01:02:24,736 --> 01:02:25,767
What's that?

828
01:02:25,837 --> 01:02:27,136
What is it, Mr. Paik?

829
01:02:27,196 --> 01:02:29,466
Are you two in love or not?

830
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:32,236
- What do you have to say? - What can you say?

831
01:02:32,337 --> 01:02:36,006
This isn't about saying what's true is false.

832
01:02:37,307 --> 01:02:38,877
It means there's an error with the premise.

833
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:01,807
How have you been?

834
01:03:25,397 --> 01:03:28,926
(Melancholia)

835
01:03:29,366 --> 01:03:31,366
I wanted to make them apologize to you.

836
01:03:31,696 --> 01:03:33,096
- Ji Yoon Su! - I ruined it.

837
01:03:33,167 --> 01:03:34,807
Because I fell in love with you.

838
01:03:34,866 --> 01:03:36,966
What will it take for you not to fear me?

839
01:03:37,236 --> 01:03:39,636
I don't fear you. I detest you.

840
01:03:39,707 --> 01:03:42,607
You're struggling to stay in a game as if you always belonged...

841
01:03:42,676 --> 01:03:44,616
when you don't suit the place.

842
01:03:44,877 --> 01:03:47,577
Everything that happened since we first met.

843
01:03:47,647 --> 01:03:49,517
I don't regret it at all.

844
01:03:49,787 --> 01:03:52,116
Shall we go somewhere? Anywhere?

845
01:03:52,716 --> 01:03:55,656
Yes, let's go. Anywhere.
