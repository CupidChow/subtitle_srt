<i>Pictures of the two on vacation were released at her wedding.</i>

<i>And this has shocked everyone even more.</i>

13

<i>Rumors about that female teacher and male student have spreading for a while now.</i>

00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,410
<i>That teacher should never be allowed to step foot into another school.</i>

<i>This teacher was terminated.</i>

The studio's atmosphere is very different today. <br> <i>Kim Sang Wuk's People Report</i>

22
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,320
We are filled with anticipation and eagerness.

23
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,580
If I had to guess, I would say it's because of the guest we have on today.

24
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,280
Yes, he's someone with an impressive resumé.

25
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,120
At age 10, he was invited to study by the mathetmatics department at MIT.

26
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,390
At age 18, he passed the GED and was an early admittee to Korea National University.

27
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,910
He's won various mathematical awards, including the 2020 Poincaré Award,

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,100
the European Mathematics Award, and the Ramanujan Award.

29
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:25,200
What did he accomplish at the 2021 World Mathematics Olynpics?

30
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,950
He won the Lucifer Prize

31
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,890
at the 2021 World Mathematics Olympics,

32
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:36,290
the first Korean and youngest to ever win the so-called Nobel Prize of Mathematics.

33
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,100
We introduce to you the star of all of that honor, Baek Seung Yu.

34
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,800
Student Seong Ye Rin, we're all ready.

35
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,060
Yes, I'm coming.

36
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,520
"You enter a room and it's completely dark."

37
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,560
"Finally, after six months or so, you find the light switch, you turn it on, "

38
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,020
"and suddenly it's all illuminated. You can see exactly where you were."

39
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,900
It's a quotation from an interview with British mathematician

40
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,850
Andrew Wiles, who studied Fermat's Last Theorem for seven years.

41
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,920
What do you think? Do you agree?

42
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,290
- To a certain extent. <br>- How did you endure that life? That darkness...

43
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,990
I waited for a certain moment.

44
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:37,610
For the moment that the answer finds me, instead of the moment of my finding the answer.

45
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,190
Just like the moment that the problem found me

46
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,280
when I wasn't looking for the problem.

47
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,220
You dropped out of high school and passed the GED. You had an early admission to college.

48
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,430
You worked for three years on you bachelor's and master's degrees

49
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,290
and submitted your thesis entitled "The Convexity Of A High-Dimensional Random Polyhedron".

50
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,420
It was the Lucifer Prize thesis.

51
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,360
All of these events happened so fast for you.

52
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,170
Yes.

53
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,970
- I wanted to be an adult as fast as I could.<br>- An adult?

54
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:13,170
So that when I put my name on what really meant a lot to me, it would mean something.

55
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,900
And...

56
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,310
To be the kind of adult

57
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,350
that someone would be able to hear about.

58
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,660
Is there a dream you have for the future?

59
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,190
My dream is...

60
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,750
This has been the Honorary Ambassador of Korea University, Seong Ye Rin.

61
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,230
I will work hard in the future for Korea University.

62
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,300
<i>Alma Mater Day <br> Publicity Day</i>

63
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,010
I'm here at the TNN Liberal Arts Pro studio.

64
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,380
Baek Seung Yu, the first Korean and youngest mathematician to win the Lucifer Prize,

65
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,100
is my best friend, everyone.

66
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,160
Here is proof! You see?

67
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,520
This will be all for today. Bye!

68
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,850
Are you doing a vlog or whatever that is?

69
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,900
Yeah, please watch it.

70
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,040
I ask for your cooperation.

71
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,750
Oh yeah, you got a note.

72
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,680
"I congratulate you on the work you have put in to be successful."

73
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,760
"Head Administrator of Aseong Mathematics and Arts Gifted High School, Noh Jeong Ah."

74
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,440
Noh Jeong Ah?

75
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,660
Wow, an Aseong High School's alumnus became this famous

76
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,490
so of course they take care of you. But it says she'll see you soon.

77
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,000
- Did you agree to meet with her?<br> - Yes.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,740
You're going to see Director Noh Jeong Ah? Why?

79
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,320
My child came to me crying.

80
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,400
Saying that many of her close friends go to school at Aseong Mathematics and Arts Gifted High School.

81
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,980
And she's sad she can't be there with them.

82
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,720
Thank you.

83
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,230
Why are you just now coming to me?

84
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,430
If you will take my child, I will do anything.

85
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,490
How much will do?

86
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,830
Su Yeong's father...

87
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,800
If you wanted my friendship,

88
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,140
I would have treated Su Yeong as my daughter.

89
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,730
Then all the students in Korea would have been jealous of Su Yeong.

90
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,930
Please, Head Administrator.

91
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,620
Thank you.

92
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,190
Prepare the transfer from for Gyeong Su Yeong, daughter of Minister Gyeong Eun Min.

93
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,390
Hello!

94
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,590
Unni!

95
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,430
Sit here, Chan's Mom.

96
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,690
Thank you!

97
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,360
- You're late. <br>- Why do you think I'm late?

98
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,550
They said they could do it. The color you like, they said they can do it!

99
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,460
- The turquoise. It's coming in next week! <br> - You've worked hard, Yu Chan's mom.

100
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,030
If Yu Chan can go to the same clinic as Jenny...

101
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,120
- I'll do anything. <br> - I understand.

102
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,820
I'll get him in.

103
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,870
Oh my gosh! Thank you so much! I won't forget this favor!

104
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,760
Please sit.

105
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,250
Applaud.

106
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,970
Happy birthday.

107
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,420
The next appointment is at the Advanced Mathematics Research Institute.

108
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,620
It's a session explaining your thesis which won the Lucifer Prize, sir.

109
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,630
Oh, right. What was your dream?

110
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,960
- You're not being serious, right? <br> - Serious?

111
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,170
You're crazy. Everyone wants to show you off and you're just doing—

112
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,730
Just? What do you mean? Did you forget my major?

113
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,960
Lets start the Q &amp; A session on Baek Seung Yu's thesis

114
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,320
which won the Lucifer Prize

115
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,440
at the 2021 World Mathematics Olympics.

116
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,490
We received questions before the session.

117
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,590
"I came to listen to this session because I'm interested in Euclidean Space."

118
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:36,430
"Would you recommend a book that I can study?"

119
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,780
There is a research paper by Professor Adolf Mueller's research team at Bonn University in Germany

120
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,330
which summarizes Euclidean space.

121
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,260
If you read that, it will help.

122
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:50,020
Someone who is "Calculus" submitted this question for you. Where are you, Calculus?

123
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,630
It seems it's a woman.

124
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,890
What?

125
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,570
What's wrong?

126
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,360
- You've worked hard. <br> - Yes. Youv'e worked hard.

127
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,500
- About what you asked me to look into before...<br> - Yes, Professor.

128
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,170
I haven't heard anything yet.

129
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,990
Please let me know when you find out.

130
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,500
But why are you looking for her?

131
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,400
Because she was my mentor.

132
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,970
Anyway, congratulations on your award. I'll see you next time.

133
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,930
Goodbye.

134
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,960
- Can you sign this for me?<br> - I don't have a signature.

135
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,570
You can at least put your name on it.

136
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,060
My name is Choi Si An.

137
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,510
- Why Calculus?<br> - My nickname?

138
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,330
<i>A pebble. It could be the source of a spring.</i>

139
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,660
1729. Do you like this number?

140
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,020
It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different pairs.

141
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,270
<i>That's what's he said.</i>

142
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:11,390
<i>Ramanujan said that to Hardy when he said 1729 was a dull number.</i>

143
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,080
Can we take a picture?

144
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,840
Thank you.

145
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,750
Hey, do you know her?

146
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,630
- No. <br> - Then why did you do that earlier?

147
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,250
Hey, don't say, is it because her nickname was Calculus?

148
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,770
Let's go.

149
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,770
It's been fun.

150
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,250
Thank you. Since school is about to start again, I'll see you all there.

151
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,300
- Happy Birthday!<br> - Bye!

152
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,490
Get home safely!

153
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,230
Bye!

154
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,010
Yes.

155
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,100
- What did you say? <br> - Kim Jin Ah, let go.

156
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,520
I don't want to. Aren't you coming out, Kim Jin Ah? Say something.

157
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,070
Let go!

158
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,090
- Hey.<br> - Let go!

159
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,990
Kim Ji Na did this!

160
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,390
Kim Ji Na, come here.

161
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,690
- You've arrived. <br> - What about Ji Na?

162
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,880
This way.

163
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,780
I'm going to sue Kim Ji Na.

164
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,080
For bodily harm.

165
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,590
Get ready to get a lawyer.

166
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,880
You know who my dad is, right?

167
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,220
Yes, of course I do.

168
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:30,030
He came to me a little bit a go. He asked a favor from me.

169
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:34,460
To take care of you, Su Yeong.

170
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,850
Kyeong Su Yeong got first place in the exam.

171
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,670
The teacher asked her what she wanted.

172
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,330
She asked for my ticket.

173
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,020
The X Boys' fan meeting ticket.

174
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,080
She said she doesn't want anything. She just wants to take my thing away from me.

175
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,350
That mean X said that.

176
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,740
This room...

177
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,050
isn't sound proof, right?

178
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,950
Mom... Let go of that.

179
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,780
You tell me.

180
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,570
What do you want?

181
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,720
Do you want me to send you to your dad?

182
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,460
Do you want to leave? Go to your dad who has a load of debt after getting a divorce.

183
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,730
We don't even know where he is.

184
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,560
No. Don't send me away.

185
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,100
Are you going to keep causing trouble?

186
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,050
Do you want to see your mom die?

187
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,840
I won't do it, Mom. I won't ever do it again.

188
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,940
You guys are good at dancing.

189
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,420
- You're no pushover either. <br> - My back is killing me.

190
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,360
Hyeon Jae, you came!

191
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,500
- What about Baek Seung Yu? <br> - What? <br> - Is Baek Seung Yu coming?

192
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,320
No, he's not coming.

193
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,320
I saw him on the broadcast today.

194
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,990
He's different now that he's famous.

195
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,380
Is it true that Baek Seung Yu will become a teacher?

196
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,360
- A teacher?<br> - That's what he said during the interview earlier. That being a teacher is his dream.

197
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,150
Hey hey, first let's toast. It's been a while since we've gotten together.

198
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,820

I asked around. Among my university professors.

♫ <i>You don't always know, what is right or wrong.</i> ♫

314
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:35,340
♫ <i>But I will be there for you</i> ♫

315
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:43,260

♫ <i>Take from me</i> ♫

317
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,750
♫ <i>Cause you're all I need</i> ♫

318
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,040
I apologize for being late. Something came up.

319
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,300
It has been a long time.

320
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,220
Ah, about the broadcast a few days before,

321
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,190
One Americano, please.

322
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,280
What were you saying?

323
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:57,240
Did my call make you uncomfortable?

324
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:04,700
Would Mr. Seung Yu ever want to meet with me?

325
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,550
I worried a lot about it.

326
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,090
Tell me why you wanted to see me?

327
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,190
Sorry for interrupting.

328
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,060
Thank you.

329
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,260
I would like to make an offer.

330
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:28,850
As you might know, the beginning students at Ahseong Mathematics and Arts Gifted School which just opened this year

331
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,400
do not have <i>Sunbaes</i> <br> <i>*Sunbae: senior</i>

332
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,170
I want to create a mentoring program for them with

333
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:40,600
Aseong high school graduates on how to study and careers.

334
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,910
What do you think about that?

335
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:47,540
I'm not sure. I'm not interested though.

336
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,640
I want to make a counter offer.

337
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,020
You will be receiving a call from the office soon.

338
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,720
Okay.

339
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,060
Hello.

340
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:45,590
This is Noh Jung Ah, Director of School Affairs of Aseong Mathematics and Arts Gifted School.

341
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:55,370
Today we are celebrating the 200th day as a school for the gifted.

342
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,860
The second semester just began.

343
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:02,870
Some very special guests are here today for the new semester.

344
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:08,500
They are none other than the alumni of Aseong High School, the predecessor of Aseong Mathematics and Arts Gifted High.

345
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:19,480
Each of these talented people will be playing the role of your mentors.

346
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:27,140
Also... I want to take a moment to introduce a very special teacher.

347
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,050
Is that Baek Seung Yu?

348
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,930
- It is Baek Seung Yu. <br> - Lucifer Baek Seung Yu.

349
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:38,910
Yes.

350
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,770
He's handsome.

351
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,880
Hello. I am Baek Seung Yu.

352
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,350
When I attended Aseong High School, the predecessor of Aseong Gifted High School,

353
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:12,630
Director of School Affairs Noh Jeong Ah said this:

354
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:16,590
Luck wins against effort.

355
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,850
I couldn't agree more with her.

356
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:25,470
I was able to come all the way here because of my luck.

357
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:28,450
That is, the natural talent I have.

358
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:34,680
I am standing here to share that talent, I lucked out.

359
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:39,560
I will share without holding anything back, so take as much as you can.

360
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:51,260
Baek Seung Yu wants to be a teacher at the special school?

361
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,610
Are you scared?

362
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,260
There is no need to get himself involved.

363
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:01,720
- Wouldn't he know? About the entire scandal about Ji Yun Su?

364
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:06,420
Is there any evidence of Ye Rin's issue left?

365
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:12,250
None. She was cleared of the allegation by Ji Yun Su that she cheated.

366
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:15,940
Even the allegations were to be revealed now, it wouldn't be a problem.

367
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,840
There isn't anyone in Han

368
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,940
Don't you think there would be talk among the school parents?

369
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,990
Who would dare now that Baek Seung Yu is coming?

370
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,350
Baek Seung Yu? Wow!

371
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:31,990
Did he choose to teach here after refusing research institutes and universities abroad? Is he stupid?

372
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,690
He's not stupid. He is majoring in Mathematics Education.

373
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,840
Don't speak reckelessly.

374
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,530
- Crazy idiot...<br>- Am I right?

375
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,980
If it was me, I would have gone to the USA or the UK.

376
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,170
Nice to see you everyone!

377
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,230
- You're here!<br>- Seung Yu came, right?<br>- Yeah.

378
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:46,090
<i>Seung Yu is the pride of our club!</i>

379
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,490
<i>Seung Yu, if you hadn't come, </i>I would have called!

380
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:49,920
Hey, Baek Seung Yu, long time no see!

381
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,600
Have you all been well?

382
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,810
Oh, interview? You're quite a celebrity.

383
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,700
I'm thirsty, let's grab a cup of coffee.

384
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,770
I have a class now.

385
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,800
Let's have a meal together soon, I'll call you.

386
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,730
Yes, yes! Your shot*, yeah?<br><i>(T/N: lit. "you're shooting", meaning he will pay the bill)</i>

387
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,370
Hey, I wanna shoot you. Can I?

388
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:07,150
<i>Seriously, how long are you gonna live?</i>

389
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,240
<i>- If you say this again—<br>- What? What's wrong?</i>

390
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,280
It's been a while.

391
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,760
- Huh? Yeah.<br><i>- A good life needs a driving force.</i>

392
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,230
What is your life's driving force?

393
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,570
See you too next time.

394
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,810
- And you?<br>- What?

395
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:26,200
- Do you have to go now too?<br>- No, let's have a coffee.

396
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,370
Let's go.

397
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,430
Oh, that's why.

398
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,580
<i>Are you gonna shoot someone?</i>

399
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,510
<i>Hey, quickly!</i>

400
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,130
Jin Ah, what are you doing today?

401
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,890
- I don't know.<br>- Let's go to the café.

402
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,210
- Let's see.<br>- What?

403
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:46,340
What I'm doing today.

404
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,340
<i>Well, but still...</i>

405
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,750
Where did you take this from?

406
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,180
At a store of second-hand books.

407
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:04,980
Classics are always good teachers.<br><i>(Degree of Mathematics by Hong Seong Dae)</i>

408
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:14,560
Speaking of which, I will introduce you to a book.

409
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,130
"The Man Who Knew Infinity".

410
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:21,900
This book is a collection of notes from the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan.<br><i>(Calculus)</i>

411
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,040
Teacher, this book is out of print.

412
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,540
Yes, it's out of print.

413
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,310
Exactly, that's why I also borrowed it.

414
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:31,400
You can get it at any library or store for second-hand books nearby.

415
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,690
Until the next class, write down what you felt after reading it.

416
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,430
The amount and format of the text are free.

417
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,310
- Understood?<br>- Yes!

418
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,470
So, let's start the class.

419
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,190
Choi Si An!

420
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,010
What is he...?

421
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,500
Does she know our teacher?

422
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,060
Right. How does he know her name?

423
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,940
- We meet again.<br>- Yes, right.

424
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,210
I saw your student record.

425
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:06,130
You have a good career at math competitions, huh? Also good grades.

426
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,590
How did you study math?

427
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,870
I studied alone.

428
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:14,110
Alone? Don't you go to any academy?

429
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,340
You said you saw my student record.

430
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,210
I came here as a student from the School Standardization Process.<br><i>(TN: a selection to help students socially vulnerable)</i>

431
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,130
I don't have the means to pay for school.

432
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,030
I have a question.

433
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:27,410
<i>So that when I put my name on what really meant a lot to me...</i>

434
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:32,590
<i>To be the kind of adult that someone would be able to hear about.</i>

435
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,990
- Ji Yun Su. <br> - What?

436
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:42,550
Mom, you haven't heard anything about Ji Yun Su teacher?

437
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:45,170
Why would you bring her up all of a sudden?

438
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,730
When did you hear about her?

439
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:50,850
After being kicked out of the school, getting divorced, and moving out of Hankuk-dong,

440
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:54,030
no one has seen her since.

441
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,060
- But still...<br>- Ye Rin!

442
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,040
Ye Rin, is this because of Baek Seung Yu? Don't mind him.

443
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,390
Would Baek Seung Yu still love Ji Yun Su after 4 years?

444
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,070
You're distracting me now.

445
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,950
He will teach the kids well, being a renowned mathematician.

446
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:14,010
As long as Yu Chan, your brother, gets better grades in math, all is well.

447
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,950
Did you get it?

448
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,670
<i> Teacher, Baek Seung Yu is a math teacher at our school now. </i>

449
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:31,000
<i> But earlier, he asked me if I knew you. </i>

450
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,770
<i>I told him I don't know you.</i>

451
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:39,200
<i>I won't ever tell him.</i>

452
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,670
<i>Ah also, teacher!!</i>

453
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:44,190
<i>By chance, do you know the book ?</i>

454
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,610
<i>I have to write an essay on it...</i>

455
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,420
<i>I have it, that book.</i>

456
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,410
<i>Great!!!!! I knew you would have it, teacher.</i>

457
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,750
Ah, that's why,

458
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,540
Choi Si An, did you get in through standardization process?

459
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:09,530
To attend this specialized high school, we gave our all since elementary school.

460
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,800
You got in so easily, huh?

461
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,850
Those who enter through standardization are exempt from tuition fees, aren't they?

462
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:18,190
And that means, you are attending this school with my parent's tax money.

463
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,610
Should I just stab her?

464
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:23,740
What? What did you say?

465
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:28,760
In the middle school I went to, if somebody is annoying they get stabbed,

with this.

00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,610
What are you guys doing?

468
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:37,030
Ji Na, she got in by reservation, did you know?

469
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:42,890
So? You were all born with a golden spoon* and she was not. <br> <i>golden spoon: born in a wealthy household</i>

470
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:46,190
- Gyeong Su Yeong , how did you transfer to our school? <br> - Oh?

471
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,980
What?

472
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:53,470
You...look much better with short hair.

473
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,160
Hey, do you have a spare of that?

474
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,570
I too, want to stab the people I don't like.

475
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:15,640
Attending the same school, doesn't mean we are on the same level. To compete with us, she won't have the time to spare.

476
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,680
Let's not mind her.

477
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:25,540
For refusing much better proposals and choosing your alma mater, I once again thank you for that.

478
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,520
I am more thankful,

479
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,880
for choosing me as a teacher, without any prejudice.

480
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:38,180
That issue back then, was such a pity.

481
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:42,820
A teacher like her had no choice but to quit the school.

482
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,260
Ah, time passes by so fast,

483
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,720
all those memories have become a blur.

484
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,050
To protect me in this school,

485
00:42:54,050 --> 00:43:00,570
no, you tried your best to keep me here, didn't you?

486
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,420
It was my choice to quit the school.

487
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,340
The school didn't expel me.

488
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:13,690
In our school, we have a special global class for international admission preparation.

489
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:17,540
What do you think about making an interesting thesis with these kids?

490
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:21,590
They are the most outstanding students of our special school.

491
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:25,240
Sounds good. I was thinking about managing a team anyway.

492
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,160
I even picked a research topic.

493
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,170
Oh is that so? What is the topic?

494
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:33,260
I will make a report when it's all sorted out.

495
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:45,840
He is quite different from someone I know.

- What? <br> - Here we go.

504
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:29,190
One, two, three, smile.

00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:31,280
Okay. See you tomorrow.

506

Get back safely.

507
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:35,900
Aigoo, teacher.

508
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,000
I didn't know I'd be seeing my student as a co-worker so soon.

509
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,850
Were you always (speaks informally), omo, Teacher Baek Seung Yu, were you always so impatient?

510
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,760
- How are you? <br> - Well, I got older.

511
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,550
- Aren't you going home? <br> - Yeah, soon.

512
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,910
Try to stay in a good shape, teacher.

513
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:52,900
These days I'm dog-tired after getting off work.

514
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,950
Here, this is a Vitamin supplement. Try one.

515
00:44:55,950 --> 00:45:00,360
Since it has a jelly formulation, it is also tasty.

516
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,710
It tastes good.

517
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:04,520
Keep it with you and eat regularly.

518
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:10,240
Ah, teacher, can I see the student records from admission to first semester.

519
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,980
Oh, here they are.

<i>What is the next proof?</i>

523
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,130
I have decided to work once again on a proof that went wrong before.

524
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,420
Reattempt?

525
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,610
I just have to be careful of one thing.

526
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:39,200
What is that? That one thing?

527
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,750
I have to be careful not to repeat the same mistake.

Of course I am glad, I'm seeing you after four years.

Is there a reason I shouldn't be glad?

Do you still have insomnia?

No matter what he does as long as it doesn't interfere with our business.

Which one was it?

Did Baek Seung Yu go to the school first or did Noh Jeong Ah recruit him?

It could be both.
