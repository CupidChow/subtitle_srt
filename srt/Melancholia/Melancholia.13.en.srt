This happened because of you.

Nothing you do will ruin Seung Yoo.

169

You can never ruin him or win him over.

I'm talking about you, not me.

You want to have Seung Yoo or ruin him.

173

It's one or the other.

174
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,422
I once thought it wasn't your fault.

175

That it was on the adults who made you this way.

176
00:12:38,422 --> 00:12:41,422
But you need to stop blaming others and take a look at yourself.

177
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,432
Look at the face you're making.

178
00:12:45,562 --> 00:12:48,062
Does doing this make you happy?

What is a proof?

185
00:14:20,263 --> 00:14:23,463
You can prove someone's mistake or wrongdoing.

186
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:26,763
But why can't love for another person...

187
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,402
be proved?

188
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:31,402
Because love...

189
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:34,442
is unstable.

190
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,412

He asked me to testify the truth.

Why didn't you come?

334

You know what will happen if I decide to speak the truth.

335

You should come up with a solution or offer me a deal.

Listen to me, Mr. Han.

I have no idea what you're talking about.

- you'll get punished. - You want me to be grateful?

How can I be grateful to someone...

We got rid of the cell phone we used four years ago for the answer sheet.

There's no evidence left.

I'd like him to prove something more meaningful and worthwhile.

00:37:55,194 --> 00:37:58,494
That Principal Noh is having an affair...

492
00:37:58,563 --> 00:38:01,234
with one of our husbands?

493
00:38:01,304 --> 00:38:03,663
- Don't. - That's so crude.

494
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,904
An affair? That's nonsense.

495
00:38:05,973 --> 00:38:07,034
I know it is.

496
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:09,944
Shouldn't we let her explain, though?

497
00:38:10,674 --> 00:38:11,714
Right?

498
00:38:11,813 --> 00:38:13,174
A special relationship?

499
00:38:14,143 --> 00:38:15,313
There is one.

500
00:38:16,444 --> 00:38:18,654
- Principal Noh. - "A special relationship"?

501
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:20,784
- My goodness. - It's true?

502
00:38:20,853 --> 00:38:22,023
Just now,

503
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:27,023
I met Minister Kyung Woo Min.

504
00:38:28,924 --> 00:38:30,023
At a hotel.

505
00:38:31,764 --> 00:38:33,063
You're aware that...

506
00:38:33,134 --> 00:38:36,163
Soo Young transferred to our school through a special program, right?

507
00:38:36,603 --> 00:38:40,534
Minister Kyung wished to show me his appreciation,

508
00:38:40,603 --> 00:38:43,174
so I met him in private.

509
00:38:46,614 --> 00:38:49,944
Jenny's father visited me many times as well.

510
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:52,284
Each time Jenny's grades slipped.

511
00:38:52,654 --> 00:38:54,114
He asked me to help his daughter.

512
00:38:54,384 --> 00:38:55,424
So what?

513
00:38:56,824 --> 00:38:57,953
Ladies.

514
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:01,623
All your children are in the Global Talent Class.

515
00:39:02,293 --> 00:39:05,364
Have any of your husbands not met with me in private?

516
00:39:05,893 --> 00:39:07,703
If not for those private meetings,

517
00:39:08,103 --> 00:39:11,574
could any of your children even attend this school?

518
00:39:13,404 --> 00:39:15,043
Why are you all so quiet?

519
00:39:16,404 --> 00:39:20,913
I guess there was a misunderstanding after all.

520
00:39:21,244 --> 00:39:23,384
Something urgent came up. I must dash.

521
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,183
- Me too. - And me.

522
00:39:26,253 --> 00:39:27,853
Wait. Don't go.

523
00:39:27,924 --> 00:39:29,583
Goodbye, ladies.

524
00:39:37,764 --> 00:39:38,893
You found out?

525
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:42,634
And? You wanted to humiliate me?

526
00:39:43,163 --> 00:39:44,273
What about your husband?

527
00:39:46,404 --> 00:39:47,973
All women are like this.

528
00:39:48,773 --> 00:39:50,344
They leave their husband alone...

529
00:39:50,773 --> 00:39:53,074
and try to go after the mistress.

530
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,083
And start a cat fight.

531
00:39:56,043 --> 00:39:59,083
How could you do this to me?

532
00:39:59,154 --> 00:40:00,154
Do you feel wronged?

533
00:40:00,953 --> 00:40:05,023
Then think about what your kids enjoyed thanks to...

534
00:40:05,393 --> 00:40:07,964
my special relationship with your husband.

535
00:40:10,293 --> 00:40:13,333
And if you still feel wronged, cough up everything I gave you.

536
00:40:15,634 --> 00:40:16,634
How about that?

537
00:40:17,433 --> 00:40:18,603
Can you do that?

538
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,844
The recipient cannot be reached...

539
00:41:36,331 --> 00:41:38,101
This year's detailed budget,

540
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,572
account book, and outsourcing contracts.

541
00:41:42,672 --> 00:41:44,101
I found lots of problems.

542
00:41:45,811 --> 00:41:47,572
I noticed hints of a rebate.

543
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:51,552
Sort it out unless you want to get into trouble for embezzlement.

544
00:41:53,851 --> 00:41:54,922
Why won't you answer?

545
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:56,152
For many years,

546
00:41:57,422 --> 00:41:59,351
if it were your command,

547
00:41:59,422 --> 00:42:02,692
I did all sorts of things and a lot of them were menial tasks.

548
00:42:02,762 --> 00:42:03,762
If you call...

549
00:42:05,532 --> 00:42:09,402
me taking a small cut for my efforts embezzlement...

550
00:42:09,532 --> 00:42:10,532
It's unfair?

551
00:42:11,931 --> 00:42:12,972
(Principal Noh Jung Ah)

552
00:42:14,472 --> 00:42:16,242
You should remember your place.

553
00:42:16,302 --> 00:42:19,541
How dare the likes of you even wish to take over Asung?

554
00:42:20,442 --> 00:42:23,342
You're just a lackey that does random jobs for a sliver of pay.

555
00:42:24,612 --> 00:42:25,652
Get out.

556
00:42:51,271 --> 00:42:52,541
Where should we meet?

557
00:43:05,052 --> 00:43:06,391
Does it hurt?

558
00:43:06,822 --> 00:43:07,922
I guarantee that...

559
00:43:08,592 --> 00:43:11,192
people will love your proof much more.

560
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:14,331
Do you know whom you're acting like?

561
00:43:14,961 --> 00:43:16,032
Principal Noh Jung Ah.

562
00:43:16,931 --> 00:43:19,771
She brainwashes and uses people to get whatever she wants.

563
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:21,242
Do you want to be like that monster?

564
00:43:49,362 --> 00:43:50,501
Are you inside?

565
00:43:52,632 --> 00:43:53,731
Let me in.

566
00:43:55,541 --> 00:43:56,942
Let me in!

567
00:44:09,152 --> 00:44:10,181
Hello?

568
00:44:18,262 --> 00:44:19,291
Have a seat.

569
00:44:24,771 --> 00:44:25,931
Would you like a drink?

570
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:35,181
So? What's your plan?

571
00:44:40,952 --> 00:44:42,021
Tell me.

572
00:44:45,552 --> 00:44:49,021
Noh Jung Ah and Sung Min Jun have never once been caught.

573
00:44:50,262 --> 00:44:51,931
They always got out of it...

574
00:44:52,331 --> 00:44:54,601
- for insufficient evidence. - I know.

575
00:44:55,961 --> 00:44:58,001
That's why I want to face them head on.

576
00:44:58,402 --> 00:45:01,302
Using the loudest means so that the whole world knows.

577
00:45:01,402 --> 00:45:02,842
Acting like friends to their faces...

578
00:45:02,902 --> 00:45:05,112
and glaring at them behind their backs is another means.

579
00:45:08,641 --> 00:45:10,112
You have material on them...

580
00:45:10,181 --> 00:45:11,981
regarding the math museum, right?

581
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:14,481
Give them to me.

582
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:16,751
Why are you trying to help me?

583
00:45:16,822 --> 00:45:18,822
- Help you? Me? - Then what?

584
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,322
I'm a victim of the scandal that those jerks fabricated too.

585
00:45:24,831 --> 00:45:25,891
Did you forget?

586
00:45:38,112 --> 00:45:40,472
She knows about us?

587
00:45:40,541 --> 00:45:42,481
Didn't you tell Hye Mi yourself?

588
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:44,311
Are you insane? Why would I do that?

589
00:45:45,581 --> 00:45:46,652
I don't know.

590
00:45:47,851 --> 00:45:49,782
Because things are unstable now...

591
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:53,192
and you want to cut all ties with me?

592
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:56,192
That's absurd. Do you suspect me?

593
00:45:56,262 --> 00:45:58,762
If that's not it, keep Hye Mi under control...

594
00:45:59,262 --> 00:46:00,331
so she doesn't cause trouble.

595
00:46:00,431 --> 00:46:03,061
So? Did you say it was true?

596
00:46:04,402 --> 00:46:07,371
How could you admit it? You should've denied it!

597
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,371
- Why should I? - What?

598
00:46:09,442 --> 00:46:11,512
Why do I care whether or not we get caught?

599
00:46:12,342 --> 00:46:15,282
It's your family's problem, not mine.

600
00:46:25,121 --> 00:46:27,452
It has information about donations, national funding, and corruption.

601
00:46:29,722 --> 00:46:32,331
You must know about the process of selecting the land...

602
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:36,262
and the contractor better than I do, so you can put it together.

603
00:46:38,302 --> 00:46:39,331
Got it.

604
00:46:40,972 --> 00:46:42,442
How's Yoon Su doing?

605
00:46:45,612 --> 00:46:46,742
I wanted her...

606
00:46:49,742 --> 00:46:51,711
to receive an apology.

607
00:46:54,882 --> 00:46:56,181
I didn't know it would be this hard.

608
00:46:56,251 --> 00:46:58,592
You wanted her to receive an apology.

609
00:47:01,722 --> 00:47:02,722
How nice.

610
00:47:03,322 --> 00:47:05,692
That's right. I have news.

611
00:47:07,262 --> 00:47:08,561
Principal Noh Jung Ah...

612
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:10,931
may be dismissed.

613
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:13,972
Yoon Su...

614
00:47:15,702 --> 00:47:17,072
made it happen.

615
00:47:32,952 --> 00:47:35,422
The phone is turned off. Please...

616
00:47:35,492 --> 00:47:37,422
(Ms. Ji Yoon Su)

617
00:47:41,431 --> 00:47:44,972
(Mr. Han Myung Jin)

618
00:47:48,271 --> 00:47:51,411
Were you two having a relationship behind Mom's back?

619
00:47:51,472 --> 00:47:53,512
No, Ye Rin, that's not it.

620
00:47:53,572 --> 00:47:55,541
Your dad promised me something.

621
00:47:56,242 --> 00:47:59,481
That he'd be loyal to me if I looked out for you.

622
00:48:00,152 --> 00:48:01,751
All he did was keep his promise.

623
00:48:01,822 --> 00:48:02,981
Be quiet.

624
00:48:03,052 --> 00:48:05,492
Don't listen to her. I'll explain everything.

625
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:06,722
Are you a child?

626
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:08,891
Do you not understand?

627
00:48:10,561 --> 00:48:13,492
He made a deal. For you.

628
00:48:17,032 --> 00:48:18,202
"For you."

629
00:48:19,202 --> 00:48:20,302
"Because of you."

630
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:23,271
- Ye Rin. - Don't lie to me!

631
00:48:24,202 --> 00:48:25,612
I thought it was real.

632
00:48:27,311 --> 00:48:28,882
I thought it was for me.

633
00:48:29,742 --> 00:48:32,181
That it was for my benefit. That I had to do well.

634
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:35,922
But... Tell me.

635
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:39,021
Was this really for me?

636
00:48:40,192 --> 00:48:44,592
No. You're lying. You deceived me!

637
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:50,061
How long did you plan to deceive me?

638
00:48:51,032 --> 00:48:52,072
How long?

639
00:48:52,802 --> 00:48:54,371
Ye Rin, the thing is...

640
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:58,001
I won't let that woman use me any longer.

641
00:48:59,211 --> 00:49:02,541
And don't you say it's for me anymore.

642
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:40,012
Thank you for coming. I had to tell you something.

643
00:49:42,882 --> 00:49:44,851
Principal Noh Jung Ah may be dismissed.

644
00:49:46,222 --> 00:49:49,322
- Really? - I'm sure she won't go quietly.

645
00:49:52,331 --> 00:49:53,961
How can you protect me...

646
00:49:57,402 --> 00:49:59,032
if I tell the truth?

647
00:49:59,101 --> 00:50:02,202
If you do, I will do everything I can...

648
00:50:02,601 --> 00:50:04,101
to make sure you're not harmed, sir.

649
00:50:06,472 --> 00:50:07,512
"Sir"?

650
00:50:12,411 --> 00:50:15,121
The student that I gave up my teaching career to help...

651
00:50:15,981 --> 00:50:18,152
doesn't show me any respect,

652
00:50:19,922 --> 00:50:21,992
but you do.

653
00:50:22,592 --> 00:50:23,762
Please, sir.

654
00:50:36,402 --> 00:50:40,172
