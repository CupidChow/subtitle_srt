Like Cantor, who developed the set theory on the concept of no limits, <br> <i>Cantor's theory of infinite sets</i>

13

14
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:17,490
we can dream with no limits and freely broaden our horizons.

15
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,280
Becoming limitless is not far into the future.

16
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,050
Right now,

17
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,060
it's up to us.

18
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,490
That's all.

19
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,940
That was very moving. My son is the best.

20
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,790
A touching speech may not be enough, though.

21
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,190
But it's very different from the other kids' presentation.

22
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:25,470
With the last speech, by student Baek Seung Yu, <br> <i> we'll be concluding the Young Adult Math Speech Competition</i>

23
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,490

<i>Episode 5</i>

25
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,270
Mm... Baek Seung Yu. His presentation is good.

26
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,890
Isn't it an unintended rivalry presenting itself?

27
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,790
No way. Seung Yu is a student I specially take care of.

28
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,320
A student that Aseong High School needs.

29
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,450
I'm going.

30
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,690
It's been a long time. Do you remember me? Noh Yeon Wu.

31
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,620
Ah... how are you?

32
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,860
Did you advise that kid Baek Seung Yu who gave a speech just now?

33
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,480
- Mm. <br> - He was good.

34
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,950
- Hello. <br> - Oh, hello.

35
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,950
The picture has to come out well, my pretty daughter.

36
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,790
Cut it out. The results aren't out yet.

37
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,000
It is a guaranteed win for you.

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,060
That Seung Yu was talking preposterous nonsense, perfect to take him out of competition.

39
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,270
You did well. Do you feel all right?

40
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,790
Yes.

41
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,150
Ye Rin, you have worked really hard.

42
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,110
I didn't know you prepared in English. It took me by surprise. It must have been hard.

43
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,890
The program is starting. Take a seat.

44
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:31,890

results and award ceremony will begin now.

46
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,860
Don't be nervous. You did well.

47
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,620
What if I don't win the award despite doing well? <br> <i> The students whose names are announced </i>

00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,330
We will be calling one more name as the last.

55
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,920
Aseong High School student Baek Seung Yu.

56

Oh! What do I do!

57
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,000
Why Baek Seung Yu...?

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,330
Two people from your school, great job.

59
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,100
Thank you.

60
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,420
We invite Minister of Education Jeong Yi Ryeong to present all four awards.

61
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:54,420
The Prime Minister award goes to Myeonghyeon High School student Jeong Hyeon Bin.

62
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:07,260
For the highly anticipated President award for the first place of this competition,

63
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,720
we request our honorable minister to announce the winner.

Congratulations.

Congratulations.

70
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,830
And we have one more award to give.

71
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,890
What? No way, joint awards?

72
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,690
What are you saying? There can't be two recipients for the President's award.

73
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:15,030
As you all know, we had decided to award three of the participants of this competition,

74
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,530
but during evaluation, another award has been added.

75
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,050
<i>Baek Seung Yu from Aseong High School...</i>

76
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,760
<i>Wasn't that boy's speech more inclined towards Humanities?</i>

77
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,780
<i>Steve Jobs. He once said that technology alone is not enough.</i>

78
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,320
<i>What makes our heart beat is technology combined with humanities.</i>

<i>I don't know about you, but when I heard Baek Seung Yu's speech, my heart was really pounding.</i>

80
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,320
It is a special jury award.

81
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,780
Aseong High School student Baek Seung Yu will receive that award.

82
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,660
One two three.

83
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,380
My Ye Rin is the prettiest of all. One two three.

84
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,800
Others step aside. I'll take a picture of just the students.

Stay there.

86
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,690
All right, I'm taking a picture. One two.

87
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,990
- I'm saying stay there. <br> - Congratulations.

88
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,560
Thank you.

89
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:05,430
Here we go. One two three.Thank you.

Seung Yu. My son, you worked hard.

92
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,040
- Let me see that award. <br> - Let's take a picture as a keepsake.

93
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,160
Mother, wait a minute. Give me some alone time.

94
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,030
Alone time?

95
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,040
Where is he going?

96
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,200
Honey, let me look at that...

97
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,280
Oh that was crazy,

98
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,820
- Congratulations, Teacher Ji Yun Su. <br> - Ah, thank you.

99
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,510
The results are good. You got two winners.

100
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,610
It wasn't my intention. I didn't think it would happen.

101
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:44,490
After we wrap up here, how about we grab a bite with the minister and vice-minister?

102
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,840
- Dinner? <br> - One second.

103
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,960
Hello, Minister. Yes.

104
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,260
I'll call you later.

105

107
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,800
Give me a minute.

108
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,790
Hello. This is Seong Ye Rin, a junior from Aseong High School.

109
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:14,460
I'm very touched to have been selected for this award.

110
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,560
Earlier, I couldn't breathe.

111
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,060
I was able to breathe only after seeing this number sequence.

112
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,980
I felt dizzy, couldn't see properly,

113
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,230
but this symmetric series was clearly visible to me.

114
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:35,970
The sounds were muffled, but I could hear your voice clearly, teacher.

115
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,000
So I was able to solve this, to find the proof.

116
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:47,790
Seung Yu. Why couldn't you breathe,

117
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:53,000
why couldn't you see or hear properly? Can you tell me?

00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,160
I saw you talking to the people from the educational broadcast earlier.

157
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,450
Ah... The evaluation for the gifted schools nomination will be soon.

158
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:31,650
I wanted to make a program on Aseong High School special math class.

159
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:35,340
Omo, that's great.

160
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,220
Let's make a toast!

161
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,360
- We've all worked hard today. <br> - Good job!

162
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:53,710
While writing his thesis, Jin Ho must have fought fiercely,

163
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:59,560
with the numbers, with time and also with himself.

164
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,690
It is a dreadful and thorough fight,

165
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,170
where you have to fight alone,

166
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:17,860
where nobody can help you nor hinder you.

167
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:27,430
Jin Ho wouldn't have felt resentment towards you, Seung Yu.

168
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:33,100
Your heong just fell in love with his proof.

169
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,430
With all his heart.

170
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,650
What are you doing here?

171
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,930
- Why aren't you picking up my calls? <br> - You called me?

172
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,540
- Oh, I didn't notice. <br> - Because you were doing what?

173
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,490
As you can see I was talking to my student.

174
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,530
You are already done talking, right?

175
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,340
I congratulate you for today.

176
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,230
Can I take your teacher with me now?

177
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,020
Seong Jae.

178
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,090
You should get back, Teacher.

179
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,000
Because of me, it must have been hard for you today.

180
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,440
Get back safely.

181
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:02,230
I turned down the dinner politely. I thought you'd feel uncomfortable.

182
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,570
About earlier... I'm sorry.

183
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,890
I was a little too sensitive.

184
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,930
- But you really don't know? <br> - Know what?

185
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,030
That boy likes you.

186
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:20,490
It could happen. At that age it's common to get first love, puppy love, things like that.

187
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,810
Don't put it like that. You don't know Seung Yu.

188
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,380
Should I know him?

189
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,160
I don't know him, but I know Ji Yun Su very well.

190
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,890
How can your heart not go out to a student who is talented in math? I understand,

191
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:41,290
but you can't hide that feeling, can you?

192
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:45,970
Everything can be seen on your face. Since there's also that issue from before, you have to be careful.

193
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,560
A rumor when repeated becomes truth

194
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,480
and a repeated coincidence becomes intentional.

195
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,520
I got it. I'll be careful.

196
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,290
Your food is ready.

197
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,600
Yes.

198
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:12,220

<i>You can't solve it like that.</i>

At the Young Adult Mathematics Speech Contest, two winners came from Aseong High School!

227
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,290
And those winners are...

- They are...<br> - They are... no other than

Seong Ye Rin and Baek Seung Yu! Applause!

Oh. He's here. Baek Seung Yu.

It's teacher Ji Yun Su, right?

239
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,380
Ah, congratulations.

240
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,820
Yesterday two students from Aseong High School won awards at the Mathematician Olympiad, right?

241
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,760
You were the teacher who coached them, right?

242
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,910
- Is this an interview? <br> - It's not an interview.

243
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,020
I was curious.

244
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:52,300
Previously, you also guided students from Ilban High School, right?

245
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,710
You are really great at this, Teacher.

246
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,200
What is your secret?

247
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,360
- I'm sorry. I have to go in now. <br> - Don't be like that. Please tell me,

248
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,430
how did you make them prepare for yesterday's competition, just a few words.

249
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,720
I'm sorry.

250
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,050
I have nothing to say.

251
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:12,760
Why? Didn't you create the winner of the President's award?

252
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,020
Our Aseong High School's Calculus Club,

253
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,750
combines knowledge of liberal arts

254
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,780
and even artistic sentiments into its math class,

255
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,780
to teach the kids. The result of that,

256
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,210
is Baek Seung Yu's speech

257
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:32,070
- which won the special jury award. <br> - Can you tell me what those pictures are?

258
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,950
What are those pictures about?

259
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,320
This is part of Teacher Ji Yun Su's special club.

260
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,110
They solve the kids' everyday troubles,

261
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,290
using mathematics.

262
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:45,650
Listen to the details from the teacher.

263
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,380
Thank you for your hard work, Producer.

264
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,870
When you're done with editing, please give me a preview.

265
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,010
Sure, I'll give you a call.

266
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,730
- Thank you for coming. <br> - Goodbye.

267
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,710
- Goodbye. <br> - Goodbye.

268
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:06,300
- Yes. <br> - We have a big problem.

269
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,630
- What happened? <br> - I just received a call from the president of Math association.

270
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,950
Some reporter came looking for him this morning.

271
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,480
- Reporter from which station? <br> - He says it's from MBS City Desk program,

272
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,400
and they were asking the reason for suddenly creating an Young Adult Speech competition in the Mathematician Olympics.

273
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,080
It is going to air immediately today, what should we do?

274
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,360
I'll check with Professor Cha.

275
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,830
- Check with the Department of Education. <br> - Yes.

276
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,550
Professor Cha, you didn't tell anyone

277
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,960
about you guiding Ye Rin, did you?

278
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,070
Of course. Why would I babble about it? I'm not a fool.

279
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,210
<i>Everything began with just this picture. <br> <i>(Assemblyman Seong Min Joon's daughter suspected of preferential treatment in competition)</i></i>

280
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,500
<i>In the International Mathematician Olympics Young Adult Speech competition,</i>

281
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,520
<i>the student in this picture, right here, won the President 's award.</i>

282
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,970
<i>They say she is the daughter of assemblyman Seong Min Jun.</i>

283
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,670
<i>Is there a problem in the award?</i>

284
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:56,730
<i>Just before the meeting, this student participated in a scholarship volunteer program,</i>

285
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,440
<i>which is revealed to be connected to the research of</i>

286
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,420
<i>Professor Cha from the Artificial Intelligence Research Center.</i>

287
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,910
<i>As you can see, the contents of this student's presentation,</i>

288
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:11,550
<i>are quite similar to the application of AI facial recognition program, in development by Professor Cha's team.</i>

289
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,340
<i>What's more shocking is,</i>

290
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,600
<i>this Professor Cha, was part of the jury of the competition.</i>

291
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,890
<i>You mean, preferential treatment was given, both in competition preparation and judging?</i>

292
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:22,860
<i>The circumstances are very suspicious.</i>

293
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,950
<i>The student in question was aware of the controversy it could cause and said that she did the preparation at school</i>

294
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,690
<i>and received advice from her math teacher.</i>

295
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,050
<i>But the investigation has shown that wasn't true.</i>

296
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,620
Oh, seriously, how do you know that?

297
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:39,280
<i>- Could you tell us how you prepared her for yesterday's competition?<br> - I'm sorry;</i>

298
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,620
<i>I have nothing to say.</i>

299
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,530
<i>Didn't you teach the Presidential Award winner?</i>

300
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,330
<i>The teacher declined to answer this question.</i>

301
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,600
<i>As an assemblyman with a child in high school...</i>

302
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,370
- When did Teacher Ji give such an interview?<br> - Has she gone crazy or what?

303
00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:00,160
Is she crazy?

304
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,030
<i>You didn't know it was an interview?</i>

305
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,620
Exactly.

306
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,010
I believe you should...

307
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,070
give a clarification interview.

308
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,980
What clarification?

309
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,730
Are you saying I should say I was in fact her advisor?

310
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,630
You have to.

311
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,910
<i>- I'll try to talk to Assemblyman Seong, so...<br></i> - No.

312
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,680
Don't do it.

313
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,670
Do you really think explaining this with lies is the best for Ye Rin?

314
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,800
The one who's the most hurt now is Ye Rin.

315
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,810
I need to think about what's best to do...

316
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,420
for Ye Rin's sake.

317
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,440
<i>- Is the broadcast about Ye Rin real?<br> - Is her dad manipulating things?</i>

318
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,810
- Wow! Politician's privileges.<br> - Will the award be cancelled?

319
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,720
I knew something like this would happen.

320
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,390
Yu Hye Mi is one foxy person.

321
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,680
She's following the lead of her assemblyman husband Seong Min Jun,

322
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,210
acting high and mighty because of the power in her hands... I knew it!

323
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,580
If that's true, they should cancel the President's award.

324
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,860
Omo, if that's the case, Seung Yu will receive it instead of her, won't he?

325
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,920
Omo, wait a minute, award, where's that award?

326
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,480
<i> Did you see the broadcast? </i>

327
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,660
<i> I'm worried. </i>

328
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,470
<i> Seung Yu </i>

329
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,010
<i> Can I make a request? </i>

330
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,270
<i>Seung Yu, can I make a request?</i>

331
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,830
This won't do.

332
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,590
Ye Rin, let's skip school today.

333
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:52,020
No, I have a performance assessment today.

334
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,830
Then, should I come with you?

335
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,970
If you come, Mom, things will blow up. Didn't you know that?

336
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,860
That girl..

337
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,750
- It's Seong Ye Rin. <br> - You are Seong Ye Rin, right?

338
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,380
How did you end up volunteering at the AI research center?

339
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,680
Is it true that you prepared for the Mathematician Olympics at school?

340
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,960
Professor Cha Seong Ho...

341
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:41,200
Teacher Ji Yun Su has something to tell you.

342
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,630
I've known how you were preparing for the competition.

343
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,800
And I thought that procedure was neither fair nor right.

344
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:57,230
I didn't give that interview on purpose,

345
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,210
but I didn't lie either.

346
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,690
So?

347
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,220
What do you want to say?

348
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,700
As you live, you come across a lot of paths.

349
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,370
Sometimes you can use a shortcut,

350
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:17,110
and overtake other people.

351
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,650
But if you cross the line and run on the sidelines,

352
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,300
you might hurt other people.

353
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,120
Moreover, you will get hurt yourself.

354
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,910
Are you trying to scare me?

355
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,470
I'm warning you.

356
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,940
Don't go down the wrong path.

357
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,170
Ye Rin,

358
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,230
you are a smart kid who can do well enough.

359
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,720
Still, if you feel anxiety somewhere in your heart,

360
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,600
let's solve it together. I'll help you.

361
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,600
What did I do wrong?

362
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,200
I...

363
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:53,120
I don't know what I did wrong.

364
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,340
By saying that the competition preparation was not fair,

365
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,300
do you mean that other kids weren't as privileged as me?

366
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,310
Is that my fault?

367
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,180
- Are you all right?

368
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:15,720
I don't feel sorry towards you at all.

369
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,360
You are more privileged than me, aren't you?

370
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,150
Because of your talent.

371

<i>Director of School Affairs Noh Jeong Ah</i>

372
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,220
<i> Assemblyman Seong Min Jun </i>

373
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,830
<i>Did you see it?</i>

374
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,920
There's no need, that's enough.

375
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,750
Please avoid contact with the media and refrain from official events.

376
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,510
What are you going to do about Teacher Ji?

377
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:05,730
We'll warn her, so that this never happens again.

378
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,600
Did you look into that reporter?

379
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,470
I did look into her, but...

380
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:13,780
I couldn't find any specific connection with me at all.

381
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,190
Got it. Let's hang up.

382
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,180
<i>Oh, just a moment.</i>

383
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,880
Say... the midterms are soon.

384
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,810
And?

385
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:26,770
Are you preparing for it?

386
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,060
- What preparation?<br> - It's...

387
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,120
What we have always done,

388
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,810
the list of the possible questions in the major subjects.

389
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,590
Assemblyman.

390
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,520
Yes?

391
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,710
I...

392
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,500
have been putting up with a lot.

393
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,500
I know. Of course.

394
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,330
<i>Director of School Affairs Noh Jeong Ah</i>

395
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,100
I have something to tell you.

396
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,060
- Congratulations. <br> - Congratulations.

397
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,160
Seong Ye Rin, you are so bad!

398
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,630
- Parent counselling? <br> - Yes.

399
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:17,830
I want to have a counseling session with Seong Ye Rin's parents.

400
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,690
Is there a problem with Ye Rin?

401
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,700
Ye Rin herself asked what she had done wrong.

402
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,680
I think that's the very problem.

403
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,570
I think you're making a big deal of this.

404
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:37,990
Indeed I want to nip it in the bud.

405
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,300
Before we go beyond the point of no return.

406
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,290
Nipping it in the bud...

407
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,220
Where precisely shall you nip?

408
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,430
Most of our Aseong School kids went to the same kindergarten, elementary school and middle school.

409
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,330
They were born in similar environments

410
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,100
I'm saying they grew up receiving similar educations.

411
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,440
These kids will soon enter prestigious universities.

412
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,090
They will take over their parents' businesses or find a career path which follows their parents' wishes.

413
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,060
They will become the leaders of our country.

414
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:09,120
Their paths have been set since birth. Where do you want to fix

415
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,260
these children whose future is set?

416
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,750
I'm really curious.

417
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,510
I don't interfere with the way you teach the children.

418
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:24,420
And parents also don't interfere with your unique teaching method.

419
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:29,760
So you also should not interfere with the parents' education of their children.

420
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,870
Before you cross an irreversible line,

421
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,540
I'll warn you.

422
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:41,330
If you cross that line, I won't be able to help.

423
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,410
You're happy, right?

424
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,850
You like to see me ruined, right?

425
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:12,290
Did you forget I asked you to beat Baek Seung Yu?

426
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:15,420
I don't care how, I just want you to beat him.

427
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:25,420
Ah! But tell me, you didn't cheat to get the higher grades too, did you?

428
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,560
What is wrong with you? I did not!

429
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,360
Right. So you didn't.

430
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,300
Oh, please. It's obvious.

431
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,570
She obviously got help from the AI Technology Institute.

432
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:44,450
After all, a high schooler getting an internship without help from their parents, is that possible?

433
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:47,920
If you pay close attention, Ye Rin's mom is really cunning.

434
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,980
She never shares privileged information beforehand, she keeps it all for Ye Rin.

435
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,580
- You're right.<br> - That's why.

436
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,300
Ye Rin's mom isn't coming today?

437
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,680
She's probably not in the mood for tea. We also find it difficult to see her these days.

438
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,500
I guess they haven't cancelled Ye Rin's award, right?

439
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,740
It must be nice to be the daughter of an assemblyman.

440
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,110
Seung Yu must be upset.

441
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:10,460
If it wasn't for Ye Rin, Seung Yu would have won that award.

442
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,350
- Exactly!<br> - Exactly!

443
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,480
Tell me about it!

444
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,410
Eonni, sit for a moment.

445
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:19,140
Sit here, please.

446
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,310
How does Seung Yu study math?

447
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,680
Give us some tips, please.

448
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,470
Gyu Yeong is number 1 in math. What tips could you need from me?

449
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,700
We're really sorry for being ignorant, Eonni.

450
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,200
How is he studying lately? Which academy does he attend?

451
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,580
Academy? Well, I'm still looking for one.

452
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:42,910
Then... how about our children teaming up to study together?

453
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,330
Yes!

454
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,880
Let's do it together!

455
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,950
Sh-shall we?

456
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:50,950
Ye Rin, what's wrong?

457
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,160
What? What? What's wrong?

458
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,210
I don't know. Ye Rin is screaming but won't open the door.

459
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,960
Open it, please.

460
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,670
Ye Rin? Ye Rin!

461
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,780
Oh, Ye Rin.

462
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,920
What? Why are you doing this with your hair?

463
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,980
Hey! You need to pull yourself together and catch up.

464
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,350
The midterms are getting close, you know.

465
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,550
Do you have the list of the expected questions?

466
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,900
This time it will be a bit difficult to get it.

467
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,230
Instead, I'll get you extra tutoring to help get good grades.

468
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,310
What's this? You're saying I won't get the list?

469
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:27,740
What will happen now? I have to be first this time.

470
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,660
What if my grades drop?

471
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,850
Please, Ye Rin...

472
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,530
You are responsible for this! This is all your fault, mom!

473
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:36,150
Do whatever you need to do to fix this!

474
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:43,100
Honey, can you please try asking Director Noh Jeong Ah one more time?

475
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,230
It's not going to be easy.

476
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:49,640
If I do something that upsets her, this may backfire on us.

477
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,400
Then, what can we do?

478
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,570
I'm worried that something bad will happen to her!

479
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,200
Why did she have to get in such a problem?

480
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,200
She should be careful with her words and actions before her wedding.

481
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,810
She didn't get her self in the problem.

482
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:07,860
I bet you two will discuss with each other a lot in your lives.

483
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:12,530
Marriage is difficult even if you meet someone with the same values.

484
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:17,200
You and she have different backgrounds. There is nothing in common.

485
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,150
That's why I like her.

486
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,150
What?

487
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,380
<i>Groom Ryu Seong Jae; Bride Ji Yun Su</i>

488
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,160
The wedding invitation came out.

489
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,240
Just do it as you please.

490
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,490
Don't laugh about it. But, keep it in mind,

491
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,420
if you marry her, you have to keep her on tight reins.

492
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,400
Yes, Mom.

493
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,390
Teacher!

494
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:46,060
- Hello.<br> - Oh, I'm tired.

495
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,220
There is much work to do inside and outside, right?

496
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,290
With the good comes the bad. I was happy two of my class's students won a huge prize,

497
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:55,360
and now this confusion happens.

498
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:01,050
<i>Ryu Seong Jae and Ji Yun Su. We are getting married!</i>

499
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:05,010
Teacher Ji! Are you getting married?

500
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:07,180
- Yes.<br> - Omo, omo.

501
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:11,570
Hey! What didn't you say it before?

502
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,640
Congratulations, Teacher.

503
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,670
Thank you.

504
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:20,500
But... how is Ye Rin?

505
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,560
Well, she will be fine.

506
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,820
Don't worry too much.

507
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,080
Did you ask for me?

508
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,970
Ye Rin, you're having a hard time, right?

509
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:57,440
You worked hard. It's sad it has happened.

510
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,240
But then, you are not to blame.

511
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,760
This is all your parents' fault.

512
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:08,170
And what about Teacher Ji Yun Su?

513
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:15,360
Is Teacher Ji not to blame?

514
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,920
Correct, Ye Rin.

515
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,820
That's right.

516
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,830
I like this attitude.

517
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:29,640
I like this. You should have said it earlier.

518
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:36,120
The upcoming midterm exams will be an important opportunity.

519
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,340
I believe you will do well.

520
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,790
Yes, Director Noh.

521
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,520
Sorry.

522
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,710
Teacher!

523
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,590
Seung Yu.

524
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,120
I'll carry it for you.

525
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,580
- Oh, there's no need.<br> - Please give it to me.

526
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,790
Thank you.

527
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,490
Hey, are you going to the self-study session today?

528
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:22,870
No. I have to go to another class.

529
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:26,820
Oh, our homeroom teacher just told us that Teacher Ji Yun Su is getting married.

530
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,570
The wedding invitation has come out.

531
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:32,090
She suggested the Calculus club prepare a celebration event.

532
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:36,060
But the midterms are around the corner. What can we do?

533
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,420
Will you go to her wedding?

534
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,500
Who is here?

535
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:47,630
Seong Ye Rin's mother, Yu Hye Mi. She asked to talk to you.

536
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:50,160
Should I let her in?

537
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,740
Tell her I'm busy.

538
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,300
Excuse me?

539
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,810
There will be no parent counseling for a while. You understand what I mean, right?

540
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:59,400
Oh, yes. I understand.

541
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,210
<i>Director of School Affairs Noh Jeong Ah</i>

542
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:07,130
Oh, how are you Vice-Principal? Should I go in now?

543
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,350
She is busy with work now.

544
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:14,870
- Excuse me?<br>- You can meet her some other time.

545
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:18,360
Vice-Principal, why are you suddenly acting like this?

546
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,530
Director Noh has a lot of work to do nowadays.

547
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,820
Goodbye, then.

548
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,720
Then, please give this to her.

549
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,110
This is a ginseng tablet I made for her.

550
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,270
She told me not to accept anything.

551
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:33,200
Well, then. Goodbye.

552
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,340
Teacher!

553
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,800
Teacher!

554
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:21,000
Teacher, are you all right?

555
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:26,300
Oh, my leg.

556
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,520
Seung Yu,

557
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,520
Get on my back.

558
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,400
What is he doing?

559
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,590
<i>Emergency Medical Center</i>

560
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,490
I'll start making the cast now, if it hurts let me know.

561
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:59,180
Yes.

562
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:05,550
Ms. Ji Yun Su's guardian?

563
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,680
Are you Ji Yun Su's guardian?

564
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,310
I am the guardian.

565
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:12,400
Fill out this form.

566
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,260
What happened?

567
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,760
She fell while riding the bicycle.

568
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,620
- Where's the patient? <br> - She's undergoing treatment right now.

569
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,490
I'm done.

570
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,690
Come this way.

571
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,690
You can leave.

572
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,880
Come in.

573
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,820
Yun Su, what happened?

574
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,860
How is she?

575
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:41,300
Fortunately it's only a ligament sprain, not a fracture.

576
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,210
Are you all right?

577
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:47,170
I'm sorry, you were shocked, right?

578
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,500
Seung Yu.

579
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,940
Are you all right?

580
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,450
Mm, I'm fine.

581
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,200
The brakes were tampered with.

582
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,560
You have to find out if somebody did it on purpose.

583
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:18,700
Send a picture to your teacher and you can leave now.

584
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:22,580
I will take care of it.

585
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:25,180
That's right. Thanks Seung Yu.

586
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,930
It's late, you should leave.

587
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,380
Let's go.

588
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:39,640
Ye Rin, what are you doing?

589
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:43,670
Omo! What are you doing!

590
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:45,170
I can't concentrate in this mess.

591
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:48,520
This brat, how long will you keep saying that!

592
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,690
What is this?

593
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:53,580
That's the medicine for ADHD*, right? <br> <i>(Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)</i>

594
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,950
Where did you get this?

595
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:56,110
Don't bother asking!

596
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,110
Give it here!

597
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,720
Let go!

598
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,500
Oh my. Why are you like this?

599
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,130
It's because of you, Mom!

600
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:10,480
If I were born smart, I wouldn't need these medicines to study.

601
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:16,240
I wouldn't be feeling nervous every exam, worrying what if I don't come first.

602
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,930
Aren't you smart enough?

603
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:20,580
And we take special care of you, don't we?

604
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:25,090
To make you get good grades, me and your dad are giving our all right now, aren't we?

605
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:26,480
So keep doing that, this time too!

606
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,310
Do whatever it takes to make me come first in school.

607
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:34,180
Otherwise, it's none of your business, whether I take medicines or not.

608
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:45,530
How are you feeling?

609
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:47,570
I'm fine.

610
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:55,870
It'd be good to report to the police.

611
00:45:55,870 --> 00:46:00,510
- Make a report? <br> - What they did means they had the intention to hurt you.

612
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:04,360
What if it was one of my students' doing?

613
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,440
Let's not report yet.

614
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,190
I'll find out who did it first.

615
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:13,570
Then let's check the security camera. It happened near the parking lot, right?

616
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:14,890
I'll be back, wait for me.

617
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:18,620
You can't see now because it's dark.

618
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:24,170
Even if you could, there's nobody there at this time. I'll check tomorrow morning.

619
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:28,360
You must. This is not something you can overlook,

620
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,660
do you understand?

621
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,410
Yes.

622
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,700
That boy is way over-reacting.

We have to pop a champagne, shouldn't we?

633
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,540
That was quite a successful move.

Let's do this, you and I, let's roll in the mud until one of us dies.

If I felt like it, I could have exposed more things.

639

From cheating in the Aseong High School entrance exams to bribes given to get the private school license,

640
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,440
what about all the money siphoned away with the excuse of developing the school?

641
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,520
So, why didn't you reveal everything?

642
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,660
Because if I go down, you go down too, isn't it so?

643
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,780
You're right. So for now, I'm warning you.

644

- Ah, for now. <br> - If my warning doesn't get through, I don't know either

So, take it easy.

647
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:32,450
I can't stand watching you fill your back pockets by selling off our Aseong foundation.

What's with this fighting for justice act?

649

You think I don't know?

650
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,520
About how evil you are? If you can't eat you're making sure others can't eat too.

651
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:48,180
Yeon Yu, what are you so afraid of?

652

In any case, you know you are the real leader of this family.

What were you doing all that time?

There is no CCTV at the parking lot.

Still, it's fortunate that my car was parked there.

It's enough if we watch since the afternoon, right?

They say you and Seong Ye Rin are close since childhood.

Then my son Gyu Yeong wasn't mistaken, I guess.

He said their relationship was unusual.
