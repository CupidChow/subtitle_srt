Good luck, everyone. Shall we start now?

Not yet. There's still some time left.

Sure. We should start on the scheduled time.

Second year, class 8 Baek Seung Yu came to take part in the competition.

23
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,510
- Why am I the one who's nervous when the kids are the ones taking the exam?<br> - Right?

24
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,950
Wait, wait. I had such a great dream last night.

25
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,450
- What kind of dream?<br> - My Ye Rin riding a really pretty elephant.

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,450
- Is that a good dream?<br> - Of course!

27
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,110
The elephant signifies honor, academia, and awards.

28
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,220
I guess Ye Rin is going to win first place today too.

We'll see once the results are out.

30
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,280
My Ye Rin always tries really hard, but she tried especially hard this time around.

31
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,880
It's not just any competition. It's one to choose a candidate for the International Mathematical Olympics.

32
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,870
- We didn't order madeleines. <br> - It's on the house.

33
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,660
- For what?<br> - Because I have something to celebrate.

34
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,210
Celebrate what? Did something good happen?

35
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,320
I didn't want to say all of this but...

Seung Yu got into the Specialized...

37
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,480
Honey, didn't Seung Yu come here?

38
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,520
What do you mean? Why would he come here?

39
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,150
This punk disappeared.

40
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,120
He won't pick up his phone. Where did he go?

41
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,280
- I'll enjoy this complimentary sweet. <br> - Me too.

<i>The entire exam will consist of descriptive questions?</i>

48
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,150
Yes. Because the process of problem solution

49
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,400
is more important than solving problems rapidly.

50
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,700
- Was that decision made by Teacher Ji Yun Su? <br>- Yes.

- I'm not going there to win.<br>- Then why are you going?

64
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:39,000
Then why are you trying to go? Do you like math?

I... have to do well.

66
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,770
That's my reason.

67
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,260
Why are you being like this all of a sudden?

68
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,200
- It's not all of a sudden.<br> - What?

69
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,060
I've never disliked math.

You and Baek Seung Yu.

80
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,010
The punk who was always last place is a mathematical genius.

So what now? Who's going out to the Olympics?

Aside from who's going to participate in the Olympics,

I am so happy that I am seeing you again.

I didn't come back because of you.

85
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,250
You told me you solved that problem, right?

86
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,540
Is it this?

87
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,840
- Why are you erasing it? <br> - This isn't the answer.

88
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,970
There was a part in the middle that I messed up on.

89
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,660
All right.

90
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,700
That can happen.

91
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,950
How did the talk with your dad go?

92
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,970
Don't tell me that you didn't...

93
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,390
- Give me your dad's number. <br> - I'll do it.

94
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,910
Are you really going to do it? You're going to do math with me, right?

95
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,800
Yes.

96
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,840
Oh, right. I misunderstood.

97
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:14,050
- What? <br> - I thought you were trying to get me to go to a specialized academy.

98
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,490
<i>Come to the office. The director of School Affairs wants to talk to you.</i>

99
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,910
Seung Yu, do you want to go more in depth about it?

100
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,520
I think that Seong Ye Rin is the right choice for Aseong High School's representative.

101
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:37,810
I know because I've taught her since she was a freshman. Ye Rin memorizes the problems and knows how to solve them all.

102
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,590
We have to acknowledge her hard work and effort.

103
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,300
- Math isn't about memorizing. It's about understanding.<br> - You're always trying to brag.

104
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,970
Seung Yu's answer sheet solved the problems in a creative but effective way.

105
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:53,540
The way he solves them is unique but it's all perfectly correct.

106
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,740
Only one can go to the Olympics. What are we supposed to do?

107
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,820
What if we make them take another exam?

108
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:05,140
We can choose the winner between the two students who got a perfect score and see who scores the highest on my exam.

109
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,910
Yes, by the way. Why did two students get a perfect score?

110
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,860
If we had made it more difficult, this wouldn't have happened.

111
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:20,870
If we had known these results would have come out, we would have made it more difficult.

112
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,950
I understand. You can both leave.

113
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,580
Yes.

114
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,780
Do you have something to say?

115
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,760
What's going on? Why's she not coming out?

116
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,370
You wanted to send Seung Yu to the specialized school?

117
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,930
Yes, I did.

118
00:10:53,930 --> 00:11:00,530
Didn't I tell you not long ago that the kid who correctly answered the club question would stand out soon?

119
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:04,040
- That child was Seung Yu. <br> - I know. So?

120
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,130
This child has a lot of potential.

121
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:13,000
I dare to guarantee this. I believe he will become a mathematician who will make a significant mark in our country's mathematics world.

122
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,710
That he was a student here at Aseong where he grew as a mathematician,

123
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:22,260
wouldn't that be a great thing for your resumé as well?

124
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,890
I'll get going.

125

<i>Assemblyman Seong Min Jun</i>

126
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,550
- Hello, Vice-Principal. <br> - Welcome.

127
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,130
You said Seung Yu came to school?

128
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,980
Follow me, please.

129
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,390
You must have heard about the International Mathematician Olympics.

130
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,300
Yes. It is scheduled to take place next month in our country.

131
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,540
It seems that Seung Yu wants to participate in the Olympics.

132
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,220
I asked you both to come because I have something to say.

133
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,370
First of all, take a seat.

134
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,090
Ah, Seung Yu scored 100 points?

135
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:31,000
Then, what's going to happen? You said each country can send only one representative.

136
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,150
Hence I'm asking this.

137
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:39,490
Assemblyman, could you find out from the organizer?

138
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,010
Yes, I understand. Thank you!

139
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,380
There is a school which isn't going to participate, so there is a special opportunity.

140
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,370
He said they can give the special opportunity to our Aseong High School, but—

141
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,230
It's settled then, they'll be joint representatives.

142
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,200
Are they really going as joint representatives?

143
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,920
If not, we'll do another test and eliminate one.

144
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,650
Let them do it together nicely.

145
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,250
I'll let you know what happens.

146
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,850
Oh yes, I understand.

147
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,350
Thank you.

148
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,410
Professor Cha, this is Noh Jeong Ah.

149
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,190
It's our student I mentioned earlier, Seong Ye Rin.

150
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,400
She will participate in the research according to her schedule.

151
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:56,190
I was taking the exam and then something popped into my head.

152
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:04,800
There was a problem Teacher Ji Hyeon Su had given me. I felt I could solve it.

153
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,370
But I didn't solve it. I have to try solving it again.

154
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,200
Do you like it that much?

155
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:24,060
It's been a long time since I've heard you speak more than five words to your father.

156
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,080
Do you like mathematics that much?

157
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:38,200
All those mathematicians you like are attending.

158
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,270
Go and take a look.

159
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,280
AI Technology Center?

160
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,880
Ye Rin will be working as an intern there.

161
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,320
Did you already talk about it with them?

162
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,840
They will help with her research related study and preparation for the Olympics.

163
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,560
She has to do well.

164
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,000
I didn't mean to overreact earlier but I was so baffled...

165
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,270
It's not as though she flunked the test, but still...

166
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,160
By the way...

167
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,820
what happens to our deal?

168
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:28,340
What do you mean? Under the condition that Ye Rin wouldn't have to worry about Baek Seung Yu,

169
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,680
I was going to make efforts to designate this as a gifted school.

170
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,690
If you don't keep your promise,

171
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,830
Ye Rin's Father...

172
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:44,860
Am I the only one who will benefit when our Aseong High will be transformed to a gifted school?

173
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,450
- What? <br> - Ye Rin's younger brother, Yu Chan, is going to be joining this school in a few years.

174
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:53,010
It's going to be a school for the gifted in math and the arts.

175
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:58,830
My ultimate goal is not to transform this into a school for gifted students.

176
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,200
My dream...

177
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:08,350
it is to make Aseong Academy into the Eton of Korea.

178
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:13,090
A school that doesn't receive monetary support from the Ministry of Education nor has to conform to education reforms.

179
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:17,590
An independent school that depends only on tuition fees and sponsors.

180
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:24,760
In ten years, all of our finest lawyers, attorneys and politicians will have attended Aseong Academy.

181
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,750
After fifteen years, their children will also be attending this school.

182
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:36,190
The talents of our Aseong will be the ones who rule this world.

183
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:42,070
Thus, what's important is the fame of Aseong High School, isn't it?

184
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:46,630
This exceptional student is saying that he'll study at Aseong High School and not at the specialized school.

185
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:52,760
To cultivate a student who raises the status of the school is always a pleasure.

186
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,780
<i>Mathematician Olympics Joint representatives:<br> Seong Ye Rin, Baek Seung Yu</i>

187
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,730
Isn't this crazy? Why Baek Seung Yu?

188
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:04,050
Earlier I heard the maths students saying that Baek Seung Yu was... who was it? Baek Min Jae

189
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,240
Yes, that's who.

190
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,960
The math genius who attended MIT at ten years old?

191
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,300
Hey, Lee Hyeon Jae, Park Hyeon Do, did you guys know all along?

192
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,790
They didn't know either. Wow!

193
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:22,960
- Joint representatives? <br> - It was a difficult decision. You should help and guide them well.

194
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,140
Sure. I'll work hard. Thank you!

195
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:32,580
From now on, record the preparation process for the Olympics and give me a report.

196
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:38,080
If an eminent mathematician is created by Aseong High School, as you said,

197
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:44,330
the records of the education he received will become important.

198
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,990
Yes. It's a heavy responsibility.

199
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,050
Yes.

200
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,330
They decided that two kids will be going out to the Mathematicians Olympics.

201
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,320
Juniors in Class 8 Seong Ye Rin, Baek Seung Yu

202
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,460
- The teacher in charge is?<br> - Teacher Ji Yun Su.

203
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:15,900
I want to know about the preparation process, in detail. Especially for Seong Ye Rin.

204
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,050
Congratulations, Ye Rin and Seung Yu.

205
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,280
Then, let's start preparing for the Mathematicians Olympics.

206
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,120
<i>Youth Mathematics Speech Competition</i>

207
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,120
It's a math speech contest.

208
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,190
Yes. You need to speak for three minutes about the given subject using mathematical language and content.

209
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,120
Oh, Honey! What happened?

210
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,970
What? Joint representative?

211
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:03,290
Omo, oh, what. First place?

212
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:08,220
But, wait a minute. What about the specialized high school?

213
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:15,350
Omo. He's participating in the Mathematician Olympics?

214
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,720
Knock, knock. What are you doing?

215
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,940
Call me back, Honey.

216
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,290
What do you mean?

217
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,470
He must have cheated. There's no way your son scored 100, don't you think?

218
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:35,310
Look here, Ye Rin's mom. Do you have dementia? Don't you remember?

219
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:41,490
When my Seung Yu and Ye Rin went to the math academy, they were at the same rank. It's a big change.

220
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,430
- What?<br> - Don't be so arrogant.

221
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:50,330
Among people who raise kids, forever first and forever last

222
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,900
don't exist.

223
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:58,790
Also, it's been bothering me since long ago. Why are you talking casually to me?

224
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,120
I'm at least two years older than you.

225
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:08,490
From now on, call me <i>Eonni</i>.

226
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,760
Move aside.

227
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,100
Take it away.

228
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,510
Haven't you any manners?

229
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,620
Hi, there!

230
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,220
No pictures please.

231
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,580
These will be helpful in deciding the topic of your speech.

232
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,320
- Look over them and you can borrow whatever you need.<br> - Yes.

233
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,700
<i>Come straight home after finishing up. We have to talk.</i>

234
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,510
Teacher, is it all right if I leave?

235
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,290
Mm?

236
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,540
I have to go to the after-school academy.

237
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:54,990
Then, before next session let's decide individually about the topic to choose.

238
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,670
Yes.

239
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,690
- Did you decide?<br> - Yes.

240
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:16,000
"Geometry and the Imagination" and "Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy". Okay.

241
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,210
<i>Geometry and the Imagination</i>

242
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,400
Ye Rin. Ye Rin.

243
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,500
Open the door.

244
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,430
- Ye Rin. <br> - Why? Why? Why? What's up with Ye Rin?

245
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:48,270
She shut herself in her room as soon as she came and won't come out. She hasn't eaten yet either.

246
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,400
Ye Rin.

247
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,220
She's furious. So furious. That ridiculous guy from nowhere!

248
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,900
Why did you make things like this?

249
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,770
You should have cut it off from the start!

250
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,620
Don't mind Baek Seung Yu. He's not in the game.

251
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:10,060
You told me. You have to be born with luck to win.

252
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,150
How do I beat a racehorse born to run?

253
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,450
You are not in the same start line as the other kids.

254
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,820
Because you met a dad like me.

255
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,220
<i>IAIT - Institute of Artificial Intelligence Technology</i>

256
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,390
Yes!! I got into Calculus!

257
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,950
Aw man.

258
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,030
- I, Lee Hyeon Jae, got into Calculus!<br> - He got in too?

259
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:51,470
Baek Seung Yu! You know we're in the same club? This is because I submitted your application with mine!

260
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,130
Didn't you get 87 points in the contest?

261
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,610
- So what?<br> - Uh, I got 93 points. Why did you fail?

262
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:01,160
Jang Gyu Yeong didn't make it either.

263
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,770
- Hey, let's go.<br> - Where?

264
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:08,650
To talk about this. Does this make sense?

265
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,940
Yeah, let's go.

266
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,860
- But what do we say?<br> - We have to cause a scene.

267
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,120
So that they reevaluate the people they chose or get rid of the club.

268
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,410
Hey, let's go! Let's go!

Why?

273
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,280
What's wrong, Seung Yu? I have to get ready for the club lesson.

274
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,950
There are lots of complaints because of that.

275
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,700
Is that so?

276
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:58,220
The kids here aren't very kind. They don't let anything come between them and their grades.

277
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:03,370
I don't know what they'll say to you. More than that, I don't know what they'll do to you.

278
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:06,770
Don't worry. I won't let that happen.

Hey, hey.

- Teacher.<br> - Teacher!

281
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,860
Teacher, what are the criteria for getting into the club?

282
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,600
<i>Scores were not taken into account.</i>

283
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,160
- That's right. Selection wasn't based on your ranking.<br> - Then what?

284
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,690
When calculating, I gave extra points for creative and logical solving.

285
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,960
- Then why did she score us?<br> - Please show us the scores.

286
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,680
Sure, as much as you want.

287
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,490
But guys, what's the reason you want to be a part of the math club?

288
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:44,500
- To write it on our resume. That we were a part of the math club. <br> - Yes, that's it.

289
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,360
If it's a reason like that, then you shouldn't be upset that you didn't get in.

290
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,230
Because I'm going to allow everyone to participate in math related events even if you're not a part of the math club.

291
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:54,930

292
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:59,010
You're being harsh in your tone, Jang Gyu Yeong. Watch your manners.

If you're curious, come by during lunch tomorrow.

296
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:16,570
Pythagoras said, "everything is number."

I'm always late to tutoring after school because of the traffic.

Representative algorithm expression. You go to Group 2. What's your worry?

304
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,390
My head is a little big...

305
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,490
Do you want to try Geometry?

306
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,100
Everybody's doing it. If we don't participate...

307
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,480
For now, I'll go check it out!

308
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:13,080
<i>CALCULUS - Name list of accepted students</i>

309
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,360
Does it make any sense that my Gyu Yeong didn't get into the Calculus club?

310
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,020
The kid that is last in the class even got in.

311
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:25,320
I heard he was a genius all along. Seung Yu's mom was right.

312
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,410
- That's what I'm saying.<br> - Sure... a genius.

313
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:33,180
That's not the problem right now. This shouldn't be allowed.

314
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,460
Why are you ripping this? My Ye Rin's name is on it.

315
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:44,820
Oh, so you're saying that there are no issues, just because Ye Rin got into Calculus. You're always like this.

316
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,690
What? "Like this"?

317
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,720
Are you glaring at me right now?

318
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,050
I'm going to make an end to this today. Or ask to switch math teachers.

319
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,390
- I agree with that.<br> - I also agree.

320
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,020
I agree!

321
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:13,160
Don't you think Teacher Ji Yun Su is a bit... special?

322
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:20,020
Right. Isn't it weird that she's letting anyone and everyone into the club she made?

323
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,140
If it's about that, don't worry about it.

324
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:29,130
I was about to have a conversation with Teacher Ji Yun Su about the club and its activities.

325
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:37,120
Please choose the members again. Didn't you say that this math club was being made for our kids?

326
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,620
That's what I'm saying. I guess that Teacher Ji Yun Su isn't cooperating?

327
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,090
I really don't like her.

328
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,710
Please be patient even if you don't like her.

329
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:54,830
Do you think I would really do something that harms Aseong High Schools students and parents?

330
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,460
I chose her because I need her.

331
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,320
You'll be thanking me later about it.

<i>Assemblyman Seong Min Jun</i>

334
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:14,670
And from now on, if there is an issue like this, I would appreciate it if one of you came as a representative to speak about it.

335
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:17,160
I'll get up first.

336
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,330
Ah, yes.

337
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:27,870
She's getting more full of herself every day.

338
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,230
<i>You're not picking up. Would you like to have dinner together later?</i>

339
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,820
Teacher.

340
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:39,660
Was that phone call earlier from my husband?

341
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,220
Yes, we decided to have dinner together.

342
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,930
- Dinner?<br> - He said that he has something to discuss with me about Ye Rin's competition.

343
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:51,330
Oh, Ye Rin. Teacher, thank you for your time.

344
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,660
- Yes, then.<br> - Goodbye.

345
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,230
Congratulations on going to the Mathematician Olympics.

346
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,270
But it doesn't seem like it's all good.

347
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:10,520
Since you're co-representing with the guy who's last place in our class.

348
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,090
You should be nervous.

349
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:19,760
You might not be able to be first place in math anymore.

350
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:28,540
Because kids like Baek Seung Yu are born with it. People like you and me can't catch up to him, no matter how hard we try.

351
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,790
- Did you call for me?<br> - If a branch or leaf is dead, it's best to cut it right away.

352
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:49,070
So that the healthy ones don't get their nutrition taken away.

353
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:55,190
I saw that you began the math club lessons.

354
00:29:55,190 --> 00:30:00,070
Are you going to keep allowing all the students be a part of it?

355
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,270
That's my plan.

356
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:08,960
To make it fair, right?

357
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:19,530
In the past the bigger number had the bigger power. But nowadays it's not like that, Teacher.

358
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:25,690
Now, it's the smaller number that has the power. The first place, the top 1%.

359
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,380
To those who got up there with their hard work,

360
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:34,380
"fairness" could mean that you're taking away from their effort.

361
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,290
You understand, right?

362
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:40,160
I don't.

363
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,170
Surprisingly, I'm weak with numbers.

364
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:50,260
I have a class to teach so I'll get going.

365
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,220
Teacher.

366
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:06,240
Here's a gift. Take good care of it.

367
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,230
I'm curious to see how you will raise this plant with your stubbornness.

368
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,030
You're here.

369
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,300

370
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:46,020
- First, I want to visit an AI related Research lab.<br> - Oh, is that so?

371
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,240
Once I have decided exactly what I want to speak about, I'll let you know.

372
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,960
If you have any questions or need help with anything, let me know.

373
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,670
- What about you, Seung Yu? <br> - I haven't decided yet.

374
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,860
I finished reading this but...

375
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,290
I recommend reading this.

376
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,740
<i>A Mathematician's Apology</i>

377
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,160
- Have you read this?<br> - No.

378
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,570
It's an old book.

379
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:22,400
It's an essay, written in the early 20th century, by Godfrey Harold Hardy,

380
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,270
an emblematic British mathematician.

00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,570
By chance, did you write this?

397
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,240
No. Why are you asking?

398
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,980
I found memos like this in the other book I borrowed from you, so I looked them up.

399
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,960
It came out in a research paper on study of vector equations*<br><i>(equations that identify a vector)</i>

Is that so? Did you read that paper?

402
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,530
Yes.

403
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,840
I was curious about a lot of things while looking through it.

404
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,240
Will you come with me somewhere when the school is over?

405
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,180
Where?

406
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:24,570
To meet someone who can answer your questions.

00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,670
Sure.

412
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,820
How many steps?

413
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,080
Three.

Right?

415
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:46,580
The least number of steps to catch this king with the knight.

416
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:53,590
He's not in his room, is he out for a walk?

417
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:58,450
Ah, no, until awhile ago he was taking a nap.

418
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:01,260
I'll try looking for him.

In that note, is this person...?

424
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,760
Yes. He is the author of 'Pattern of Vector equation that follows

425
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,770
Knight's movement from a m by n matrix'.

426
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,520
It's time for my walk.

427
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,930
Let's go together.

428
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:53,140
Ah, yes.

429
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,770
Did you ask him about what you were curious about?

430
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:04,150
Not yet.

431
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,040
What relationship do you both have?

432
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,590
Ask about that memo earlier.

433
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:19,210
This one.

434
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,980
Ha,

435
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,490
It's a cool pattern.

436
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,550
What I'm curious about is,

437
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:32,710
when the start point differs, will there be an universally applicable formula?

438
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:37,320
Also, each of these diagonals have the same number.

439
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:42,730
Pattern is not just present here.

440
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:45,400
It's there too.

441
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,540
What do you see?

442
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,750
It's a fractal.

443
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:09,160
Small pieces forming a repeating structure just like the whole.

444
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,030
You can see this anywhere in the world we live.

445
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:24,200
Infinity in a finite space.

446
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,900
Beautiful.

447
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,560
It's gone.

448
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,540
It has disappeared.

449
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,900
What's gone?

450
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,310
Where did this go?

451
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,460
That woman took it away with her just now.

452
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,930
Father, Father!

453
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,490
Leave me, no!

454
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,780
I have to find it. It was an important piece.

455
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,100
I'm sorry but could you call some people over?

456
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,150
Wait a second.

457
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:15,310
Teacher!

458
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,310
I'm okay. Quick.

459
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,050
This way!

460
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,250
We'll take care of it. Leave him.

461
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,030
Brother, why are you like this?

462
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,670
My number!

463
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,990
That memory! That rascal...

464
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,790
took away my key!

465
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,150
Teacher, your arm.

466
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,540
I'm fine.

467
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,350
I'll do it.

468
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,690
You must've been surprised.

469
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:18,780
It's been around ten years since we came to this nursing home.

470
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:26,190
At times his mind is clear, like the time he was a Math professor.

471
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,150
Today his condition must have been bad.

472
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:37,590
Doesn't he recognize you either, Teacher?

473
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,640
Sometimes he recognizes me.

474
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,050
Once in a while.

475
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,570
Let's come back some other day.

476
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:54,850
I want to talk with the professor.

477
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,250
Sure, let's do that.

478
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:09,410
Still, thanks to the professor, I got an idea about the topic of my speech.

479
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:12,360
Really? What's that?

480
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:18,140
Not yet.

481
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,550
I'll let you know once it's settled.

482
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,540
Good, I'll be waiting.

483
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,960
Yes.

484
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,490
Let's leave, it's late.

485
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,210
Yes.

486
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,190
Is the topic not interesting?

487
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,320
Can you handle it? It won't be easy.

488
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,290
But there is a mathematician who proved it, isn't there?

489
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,830
Roman Opalka*, Escher**,<br><i>*Polish concept artist</i><br><i>**Dutch graphic artist</i>

490
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:08,850
Kusama Yayoi*, Van Gogh**.<br><i>*Japanese installation artist</i><br><i>** Dutch painter</i>

491
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:12,600
These people are inseparable from your subject.

492
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,850
So I pass?

493
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:20,850
Yes. It's remarkable. I love it.

494
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:26,930
I don't know how to link this to the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

495
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:30,340
Don't worry. I'll help you with that.

496
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,620
By chance, there are a lot of exhibitions connected to this.

497
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,630
It'd be nice if we could go there too.

498
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,800
Where?

499
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,470
Jeju Island.

500
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:45,210
Those exhibitions are essentials. Too bad.

501
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:48,160
First, let's start by going here.

502
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,740
<i> Artists Who Paint Time: Roman Opalka </i>

503
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,460
Oh, Ye Rin.

504
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,080
Do you want to come with us to an art exhibition?

505
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,810
We are going there to prepare for his speech.

506
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,210
Today I have to go to the Research lab.

507
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,490
Ah, is that so?

508
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:26,530
I'll see you later.

509
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:28,080
Yes.

510
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,600
<i>Come quick.</i>

511
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:02,480
Artist Roman Opalka

512
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,320
started writing down from number 1 in 1965.

513
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,090
Until when?

514
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:12,820
Until he passed away in 2011.

515
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,780
This piece is one in a series.

516
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:19,850
No matter what I do, time always passes by.

517
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:24,330
I wanted to catch time, the bad guy, in a bundle, so

518
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:27,000
I write down the numbers.

519
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,590
What I want to show you is the story of us living a finite life.

520
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:36,830
Humanism, time.

521
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:39,960
And finally, space.

522
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,980
Thank you.

523
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:58,380
Aren't you preparing for the Olympics?

524
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,800
It looked like Baek Seung Yu went somewhere with the teacher after the lesson was over.

525
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,830
Why are you interested?

526
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:06,020
Win.

527
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,810
Beat Baek Seung Yu.

528
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:13,390
Because I think if he were to win instead of you, my pride would hurt even more.

529
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,010
It's infinite because you don't know what number you're going to end up on.

530
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:30,330
And its finite because the numbers will eventually stop.

531
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,020
Infinite and finite, both of them are involved.

532
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,790
That's right.

533
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:41,350
It'd be nice if we could see Escher's works too, too bad they're not exhibited.

534
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:45,560
I know where we can see them.

535
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:52,910
<i>A mathematician who visited an art gallery</i>

536
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:59,020
The stairs keep going up and down but there is no end.

537
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:01,670
Like a Möbius strip*.<br><i>(a surface with only one side and only one boundary curve)</i>

538
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:03,710
Yes.

539
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:08,310
The Penrose triangle is impossible to exist in three-dimensional space.

540
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:11,090
Do you know this picture?

541
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:14,700
Melancholia?

542
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,740
That's the title of this picture.

543
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,640
Doesn't that mean depression?

544
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,450
That's right.

545
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:29,040
Usually, the word "depression" means heaviness,

546
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,650
and the feeling of being down.

547
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:40,070
But if you keep sinking down, you will eventually hit the ground.

548
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:42,850
I could say it brings about a state of aimlessness?

549
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:48,510
Once you get emptied like that, you eventually start to dream a new beginning.

550
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,660
Maybe that's why...

551
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,170
there's a light coming through here.

552
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:56,140
You're right.

553
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,120
I guess it's a new finding.

554
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,600
Before the light disappears.

555
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:14,030
Thanks to you, I think I decided on my topic.

556
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:16,030
I'm glad.

557
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:19,680
It's already so late.

558
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:32,590
I've been hungry for a while, too.

559
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:35,360
We're all prepared.

560
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:52,080
Did you know that when you're focused on something, you have a particular expression on your face?

561
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:58,490
You have this face when you're solving a math problem, and even earlier when you were looking at the picture in the book.

562
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:00,330
It's good to see.

563
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:01,690
Excuse me.

564
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:03,330
Yes.

565
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:06,310
-Enjoy your food.<br>-Thank you!

566
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:08,890
Wow, it looks so good. Let's eat.

567
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:11,230
Thank you, I'll enjoy the meal.

568
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,850
Let's go. It's really late.

569
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:17,450
Yes.

570
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,870
Heol, daebak!

571
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:40,390
- What?<br> - Look.

572
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:42,310
What is this?

573
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:46,070
Isn't this Teacher Yun Su and Baek Seung Yu?

574
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:48,400
Who posted this?

575
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:53,010
I'm so surprised. Where did this picture come from?

576
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:55,010
Hey Jang Gyu Yeong.

577
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,970
Let's go.

578
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,480
Your joke is a little too much.

579
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,390
It's too much? What is?

580
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:06,080
I saw what you posted. You're being too much.

581
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,040
Do you know what I saw last night?

582
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,290
What did you see?

583
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:13,300
I saw Ji Yun Su and Baek Seung Yu on a date.

584
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,190
A date?

585
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:18,580
Late at night. Just the two of them. It looked like they had something going on.

586
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,960
They said they were going to an exhibition to prepare for his Olympics speech.

587
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,470
Isn't that a misunderstanding?

588
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:27,030
Well, even if it was a misunderstanding, I have to make it look like it's not.

589
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,870
What do you mean?

590
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:30,390
Just wait.

591
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:34,680
I'm going to make sure Baek Seung Yu, that jerk, can't go to that competition.

592
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,090
<i>Is there a controversial error in Professor Ji Hyeon Yook's proof for 'Jones Conjecture' ?</i>

593
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,200
- Look! <br> - That's high quality.

594
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,270
Look at these two.

595
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:00,160
What is it?

596
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,620
- What are you guys looking at?<br> - Look at her pose. Look.

597
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,470
Ah, what's up with him?

598
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,720
The body somewhat matches Ji Yun Su.

599
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,970
Wow.

600
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:16,830
I saw him following her before. He seemed to be stalking her.

601
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:18,080
- I knew it! <br> - What? Really?

602
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,240
You don't believe me?

603
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,110
Seriously.

604
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:22,570
If you don't believe me,

605
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:25,890
then just go to...

606
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,800
Hey, what?

607
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,160
Hey Seung Yu, what's wrong?

608
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,640
What's wrong?

609
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:48,360
Delete it.

610
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,990
This punk.

611
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:57,370
Hey!

612
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:58,830
Hey, stop it.<br>Somebody stop them.

613
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:01,670
Let this go!

614
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:03,330
Stop it!

615
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:05,230
Baek Seung Yu and Jang Gyu Yeong?

616
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:08,870
Yes. They were fist-fighting.

617
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:13,160
I think it's because of this.

618
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:25,350
Why did you two fight?

619
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:28,900
Jang Gyu Yeong, you tell me first.

620
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:34,270
Are you not going to answer? Why did you two fight?

621
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:40,910
You tell me, Baek Seung Yu. Why did you two fight?

622
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:47,610
These kids... Why aren't you talking?

623
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,540
Did you call for me?

624
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,710
Did you see this too?

625
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:01,710
Yes.

626
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:07,110
I heard Jang Gyu Yeong uploaded this.

627
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:09,360
Do you know why he did this?

628
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:17,550
You know, but you're in a sticky situation, so you'd rather not say anything.

629
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:20,380
I didn't see it in person.

630
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:23,670
You're really nice, Ye Rin.

631
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:29,230
Look at Gyu Yeong. Seung Yu is rising up so he's trying to knock him back down.

632
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:32,900
But you're careful in even what you say?

633
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,110
This is why I can't trust you.

634
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:40,000
You can leave.

635
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:46,510
He said he saw Seung Yu and Teacher Ji Yun Su out together late at night.

636
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:47,870
Gyu Yeong did?

637
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:49,680
Yes.

638
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,920
He said they looked close.

639
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,580
They looked close?

640
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,060
What do you mean?

641
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:58,150
Are you not going to talk?

642
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:01,940
Do you want the disciplinary board to open up?

643
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:06,640
Don't you two know how devastating it is if it's left on your record?

644
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:12,110
You. You can't be the school representative if you get put on probation.

645
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:14,680
Does it still not matter?

646
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,560
Teacher.

647
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:24,620
I'll talk to them.

648
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,710
Will you?

649
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:32,590
Second year class 8, Jang Gyu Yeong and Baek Seung Yu. The Student Department will take over from here.

650
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:34,390
Follow me.

651
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:43,610
They're really causing trouble.

652
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:51,080
- Hello?<br> - Have you left yet?

653
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,230
What?

654
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,980
Isn't the bridal salon appointment today at 6 p.m.?

655
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:58,230
Oh yes, I'll be right there.

656
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:02,120
Hurry and come. I'm taking my mother.

657
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,510
All right.

658
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,610
Teacher, I have something, so I have to leave.

659
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:13,970
Will you call me and update me on Seung Yu and Gyu Yeong?

660
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:16,250
Yes. I will.

661
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:19,950
If she's at home, why is there no word about the furniture?

662
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:24,670
She said she was very thankful and that she loves it.

663
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:28,020
I meant to tell you but I totally forgot.

664
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:31,180
You liar.

665
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:34,880
I hope she doesn't think I like her because I gave her a gift.

666
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,380
I removed it because I was worried it might be a flagship product.

667
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,890
Please open your heart up to her, mother.

668
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:42,920
Since you already allowed our marriage.

669
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,940
I didn't allow it, we made a deal.

670
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:48,610
Don't forget.

671
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:54,560
You promised me that in return for allowing you to marry her, you would do something big for your father.

672
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,090
Yes.

673
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:01,640
Teacher Ji Yun Su is comfortable around Seung Yu...

674
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:05,810
And has been close with him with the excuse of the Mathematician Olympics.

675
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:08,070
This is what you're saying?

676
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:09,320
Yes.

677
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,190
All right, you can leave.

678
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:14,300
How are you going to punish Seung Yu?

679
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:19,080
Why? You want him to be taken out of the competition?

680
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:22,260
Don't worry about it.

681
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:27,650
Worry about the competition, not Baek Seung Yu. And remember...

682
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:32,410
Teacher Ji Yun Su taking care of Baek Seung Yu...

683
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:35,560
is nothing compared to how much

684
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,000
I care for you, Ye Rin.

685
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,710
Make sure that I get some results from you

686
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,400
equivalent to all the affection I've poured over you.

687
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,360
Yes, Teacher.

688
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,360
What about Teacher Ji Yun Su?

689
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,530
She said she's getting off work.

690
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:09,660
She went home?

691
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,450
She said she had personal reasons.

692
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:14,870
She asked the homeroom teacher, Kim Jin Hui to keep her informed

693
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:17,530
of what happens with the students.

694
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:19,550
Should we go to the Student Department?

695
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:21,920
No, let's leave it for now.

696
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,390
- Ji Yun Su and Baek Seung Yu?<br> - Yes.

697
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:25,810
My son Kyu Young says he saw it.

698
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:29,780
She said "Let's go together" when it was past ten in the evening.

699
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:32,600
Alone? In the middle of the night? Where would they go?

700
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:39,770
I don't know about that, but the mood was slightly strange. As if they were having a fling.

701
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:41,170
Aren't they crazy?

702
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:42,140
Eonni.

703
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:46,050
I've already heard, from Teacher Han Myeong Jin,

704
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:48,190
that Ji Yun Su is always hanging around Baek Seung Yu.

705
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,260
- Hanging around?<br> - Yes.

706
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:53,990
Should Baek Seung Yu go as Olympics representative or not.

707
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:56,060
But, they are strange?

708
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:57,380
Can we leave this alone?

709
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,550
- No! <br> - Of course not!

710
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:04,510
- That teacher, it hasn't been long since she came to this school... She's pretty daring! <br> - Ah, really!

711
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,880
Omo, Homeroom teacher?

712
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,230
What's up?

713
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:11,860
Hello, Teacher.

714
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:15,020
What did you say?

715
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:17,830
My Gyu Yeong? Why?

716
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:30,670
Oh, you're here?

717
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:33,310
I'm sorry I'm late, Mother-in-law.

718
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:34,240
Prepare that.

719
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,980
Yes, Madam.

720
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:38,570
- Please come this way. <br> - Keep that for me.

721
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:00,310
<i>Teacher Kim Jin Hui</i>

722
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,160
<i>Teacher Kim Jin Hui: Image</i>

723
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,650
<i>The bride is coming out.</i>

724
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,790
This is the dress. What do you think, Mother?

725
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,210
Who's calling me? Look up for me.

726
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:32,500
Teacher Kim Jin Hui. She keeps calling.

727
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:34,190
Give it to me.

728
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:36,470
- Now? <br> - Yes.

729
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:42,360
Yes, Teacher.

730
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,590
Text message?

731
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:47,250
No, I'll check it now.

732
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:57,530
Is something going on?

733
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:59,850
I have to get back to school.

734
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:03,270
Mother-in-law, I'm sorry. I have to leave now to take care of something.

735
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:05,360
I'm really sorry.

736
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:10,600
Mother.

737
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:12,450
What happened?

738
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:13,720
I'm sorry. I'll call you.

739
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,720
Tell me now. You're not a homeroom teacher, why do you have to go to school at this hour?

740
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,590
I'll explain it later. It's a really important matter.

741
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:24,860
A really important matter? More important than our marriage preparations?

742
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,560
What are you doing there? Come out.

743
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:33,120
Explain everything later. It better be really important.

744
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:59,570
I...

745
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:02,550
I'm saying I saw that child, Baek Seung Yu.

746
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:03,720
Where is he?

747
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,690
Right now they are the Student department, receiving guidance, ma'am.

748
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:11,090
Guidance? My boy Kyu Young, only took hits. What guidance does he need!

749
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:13,440
Please calm down a little.

750
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:20,320
By chance... are you that Maths teacher?

751
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,980
Yes, it's me.

752
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:26,330
Why did you let things get to this?

753
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:31,130
Don't you know? Maths Club was controversial from the start.

754
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:34,560
Ever since the problem with Selection, the weird matters were not just one or two.

755
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:37,540
At last it causes this problem. Ah, my head is throbbing.

756
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:39,760
This time, regardless of the reason,

757
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,520
Kyu Young has to apologize to Teacher Ji Hyun Su.

758
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,880
How could a student do this to a teacher...

759
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,250
The Teacher must have made some kind of mistake.

760
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:53,820
Don't you have to be careful about your actions?

761
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:56,020
I don't need anything,

762
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:59,130
bring my kid and Baek Seung Yu here.

763
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:00,800
Call his parents too.

764
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,070
I want to receive apology and punishments have to be given.

765
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:08,300
Do you understand that Kyu Young's father is the editor-in-chief of TJN?

766
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:12,300
Do it as I say, if you don't want things to be blown out of proportion.

767
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,610
Now.

768
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:16,230
Right now...<br>I'm telling you to bring him right now.

769
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:20,890
So, Kyu Young's father is a press editor.

770
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:26,670
Is it okay if I tip off this picture?

771
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:33,740
This is Kyu Young...

772
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:36,470
Omo, he must've been crazy.<br>Nowadays, for taking pictures of others and circulating them,

773
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:38,870
the punishment is very strict.

774
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:44,380
If he's a chief editor, he must know better than anyone, how grave this situation is.

Due to violation of teachers' rights, disciplinary action can be taken through the Committee <br> for Teachers' protection.

Ah, teacher...

778
01:01:57,030 --> 01:02:01,850
From fines and volunteering to suspension and transfer recommendation,

779
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:03,580
many punishments are possible.

780
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:05,750
You got so angry.

781
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:09,570
What do I do? That is quite ag, aggravating.

I'll call Kyu Young here

to Teacher...

784
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:17,550
Not just me, Student Baek Seung Yu was also a victim.

785
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:22,570
I request a genuine apology and self reflection from Kyu Young regarding me and Seung Yu.

786
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:25,850
If you don't want that, we'll follow the procedure and take disciplinary action.

787
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:28,740
Oh, no, he'll apologize. Of course.

788
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,750
If one did wrong, he must beg.

789
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:34,580
Like this with both hands together? Oh, um, Seung, Seug Yu, where is he?

790
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:40,760
Kyu Young has to apologize to him.

791

Teacher, where is Seung Yu?

His mouth is shut tightly.

794
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,010
He didn't say why he hit him, also won't write the apology letter.

01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:34,130
In any circumstances, violence is wrong.

01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:47,210
You have to be angry about these things.

I'm glad.

Why didn't you tell her that I photoshopped the picture?

By any chance, do you like Ji Yoon Su teacher?
