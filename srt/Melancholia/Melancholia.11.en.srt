00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,520
You couldn't solve it? I'm asking if you solved it.

7
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,320
That's right, I couldn't solve it. So what?

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,530
Do I have to solve this? Then what?

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,630
Why are you so angry?

10
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,130
Are you embarrassed? Because you can't solve that problem?

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,390
I don't have that anymore.

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,150
What difference does it make to my life whether or not I can solve a math problem?

13
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,720
Will it change anything?

14
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,910
Who cares about math?

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,780
You wanted to solve it!

16
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:59,520
You kept going at it and you ran here because you want to know the answer!

17
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,430
Even if I try not to think about it, I think about it.

18
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,650
I can visualize it even if I don't want to.

19
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,150
My head, my hands...

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,000
keep going on their own.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,330
We came to school and spent the whole night

22
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,720
going through math problems together.

You did the same for me. So don't close your heart,

26
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,340

<i>Episode 11</i>

29
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,890
- Are you leaving?<br>- Hm.

30
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,250
Let's go together.

31
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,340
Si An is with Professor Ji,

32
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,470
so let's go there together.

33
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,310
I'll go home.

34
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,330
Drive safely.

35
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,070
<i>There was another team beside us.</i>

36
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,260
- Is this everything?<br>- Yes, madam.

37
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,230
I followed him to the library, but...

38
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,700
I withdrew because I thought he might notice me there.

39
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,040
- Please, leave.<br>- Pardon?

40
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,080
I said to go away!

41
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,350
Y-yes, madam.

42
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,430
<i>They say you manage a very special academy.</i>

43
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,810
<i>You must have a very special instructor, right?</i>

44
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:16,380
<i>Our instructor will take care of Jin Ah just like she does with Si An.</i>

45
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,190
<i>The teacher said she would like to meet you in person.</i>

46
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,090
<i>That sounds good.</i>

47
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,510
<i>Aigo, I'm sorry I'm late.</i>

48
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,580
<i>- Did you come alone?<br>- I got a call earlier,</i>

49
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,090
<i>and the instructor said something came up.</i>

50
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,570
It's one of the questions you assigned.

51
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,370
You said you solved it with the Professor's help. So I came up with a great solution.

52
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,390
- Would you like to see it?<br>- That's a school assignment.

53
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,850
Do you think you can show me before submitting it?

54
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,890
You're right. Sorry. I am a bit overexcited.

55
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,930
- Say goodbye.<br>- Professor, I had so much fun today.

56
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,120
Have a good night.

57
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,020
Wait for me outside.

58
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,500
Professor,

59
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,350
even if you scold me, I have no excuse.

60
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,080
I like your daughter a lot.

61
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,730
I know.

62
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,980
You are worried and uncertain about this, right?

63
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,060
But please, believe in just this one thing.

64
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,120
My feelings...

65
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,870
are sincere.

66
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,660
There is no error...

67
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,870
or contradiction.

68
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,520
Are you alright?

69
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,640
Let's just go anywhere.

70
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,570
<i>When someone does wrong to someone else, causes them pain</i>

71
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:20,950
<i>and ruins their life, they're supposed to apologize.</i>

72
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,720
<i>They're supposed to admit they did something wrong.</i>

73
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,090
<i>What would have happened if I hadn't exposed that photo back then?</i>

74
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,160
<i>I have someone I like.</i>

75
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,470
<i>Someone I met after a long time and I like more now.</i>

76
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,030
<i>Many things will probably change.</i>

77
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,980
<i>To be honest, you were not an issue to me.</i>

78
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,270
Did you tell Seung Yu everything?

79
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,000
- No. <br> - What is it then?

80
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,960
Doesn't it make you angry?

81
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,560
He lied to you and used you.

82
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,320
So what?

83
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,910
I've used and lied to him in the past too.

84
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:21,650
It makes me feel better now that

85
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,580
it seems like we're even.

86
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,960
I've always wanted Seung Yu to fail.

87
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,020
I wanted him to get hurt and be imperfect like me.

88
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:40,510
So that I wouldn't seem pathetic

89
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:45,450
and incomplete next to Seung Yu.

90
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,350
Hey Seong Ye Rin.

91
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,920
What am I supposed to do?

92
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,710
Where did it all go wrong?

93
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,320
I don't know.

94
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,470
<i>Why math? Why?</i>

95
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,650
Please prepare it right away.

96
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,050
I'm here, Father.

97
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,820
Oh you're here.

98
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,760
Like this?

99
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,640
You've gotten so much better.

100
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,230
You must've practiced a lot.

101
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,620
It's came from Jeju Island this morning.

102
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,260
I know white wines go well with seafood but

103
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,660
I've been really into this one lately.

104
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,700
It's a great pairing with a dry aged beef.

105
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,310
Here you go.

106
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,630
-Try it. <br>-Alright.

107
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:39,100
You guys know that the Foundation has an opening for a Director, right?

108
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:44,900
We'll decide which one of you two will take that spot during the Director meeting this week.

109
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,550
-Keep that in mind. <br>-Yes, Father.

110
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,160
Okay.

111
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,880
Is it going well with the guy you're seeing these days?

112
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,180
How could I not know? You're my one and only younger sister.

113
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,660
Does it bother you that Seong Jae has

114
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,890
-bad feelings towards you?<br>-I'm just worried you're going to get used.

115
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,870
Why is it Ryu Seong Jae?

116
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,860
Do you feel accomplished or something if you take him

117
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,500
before Ji Yun Su?

118
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,800
You've always seem to be conscious about it.

119
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,050
Aren't you the one that's the most conscious about it?

120
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,400
You know Ji Yun Su is back, right?

121
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,740
I'll be watching.

122
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,430
<i>Assemblyman, be a little bolder.</i>

123
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,320
This is definitely Noh Jeong Ah's voice.

124
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,020
Why's she flirting?

125
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,460
<i>Go in. Once this is over, let's pop this bottle of wine together.</i>

126
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,470
Honey is just dripping from his voice.

127
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,790
Are they...

128
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,820
What are you doing?

129
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,310
I thought I dropped my lipstick in here last time.

130
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,680
Come out. I have to go now.

131
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,660
You're going out again?

132
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,930
You came home late last night, too.

133
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,390
Did you know Ye Rin likes Baek Seung Yu?

134
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,200
What? Baek Seung Yu?

135
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,210
Take care of her a little more.

136
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,800
Baek Seung Yu of all people?

137
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,060
Wait a minute. What wrong with Baek Seung Yu?

138
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:51,960
He's smart and handsome with a great future.

139
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:57,010
What? Director Noh Jeong Ah and Assemblyman Seong Min Jun?

140
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,400
That's what I'm saying.

141
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:06,080
They were so sweet with each other.

142
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,360
Oh hi!

143
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,090
Be careful about what you say. You shouldn't say other peoples business so easily.

144
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:15,200
Where should I put this?

145
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,290
Wherever is fine.

146
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,160
Right here?

147
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,870
-What's this for?<br>-I bought one for you while I was buying one for my house.

148
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,190
Please eat some.

149
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,750
Oh my.

150
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,210
What's the occasion?

151
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:38,590
My son's going to come over for dinner later so it worked out perfectly.

152
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,020
That's so great. I picked all the big and good ones.

153
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,690
Eat it well, Unni.

154
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:51,010
What did you just call me? Unni?

155
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,760
I should've treated you like an older sister (unni) earlier.

156
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,040
It's a bit late now, isn't it, Unni.

157
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,650
Let's hang out like sisters from now on.

158
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,460
I mean...

159
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:14,840
Anyways, thanks. I'll eat it well... dongsaeng (younger sister).

160
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,530
Thank you!

161
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,830
They're really scary people. Baek Seung Yu and Ji Yun Su.

162
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,920
Let's quit it all.

163
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,110
Send Baek Seung Yu out first and make it so that Ji Yun Su can never come back to step foot in Korea.

164
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,680
What about the museum?

165
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,920
We'll have to shut it down. We have no choice.

166
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,370
There's an opening in the Foundation.

167
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:47,980
My father said he will choose who he'll seat there between me and Yeon Woo.

168
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,340
Then the person who get's this will be the next President elect?

169
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:58,030
For a guaranteed win, I need Baek Seung Yu.

170
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,780
-Yes?<br>-There's something you have to check.

171
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,430
Choi Si An?

172
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,320
Okay.

173
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,360
I want to see Ji Yun Su.

174
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,370
I should see her at least once, don't you think?

175
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:45,980
And then from there, we'll think about how to separate

176
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,200
those two.

177
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,460

00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,030

I'm sorry but will you erase that picture?

Oh yes, I'm sorry.

00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,450
Do you have to go now?

204
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,470
You should leave after we eat.

"Do you like math?"

210
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,770
"No, I don't."

211
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,560
"Try solving the problem."

212
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,290
"Why would I?"

213
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:06,740
A guy like that won an award, wrote a book

214
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,770
and grew a lot, right?

215
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,000
I knew you would do it.

216
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:15,520
Although you kept saying "No, I don't", Why would I?",

217
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,270
your talent was not hidden.

218
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,270
I'm not talented.

219
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,220
Someone who believes in me.

220
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,550
Someone who says "you can do it".

221
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:29,040
If there's only one person like this in my life,

222
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,490
I can do it all.

223
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,690
Your proof...

224
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,350
- Will you continue it?<br>- I want another award.

225
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,510
I hope you keep moving forward.

226
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,840
Instead of looking back.

227
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,210
I need to take a picture.

228
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,790
Please, take it.

229
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,120
Let's see.

230
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,290
What are you doing?

231
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,580
Your disciple wrote a book and dedicated it to you.

232
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,200
I need a commemorative photograph.

233
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,520
Now.

234
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,000
One, two, three.

235
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,940
Again.

236
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,850
Smile a little.

237
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,890
- Forget it.<br>- Just once.

238
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,870
Right.

239
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,740
One, two, three.

240
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,340
Do you still love Ji Yun Su?

241
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,090
To whom and what do I do?

242
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,800
Love is not a great deal.

243
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,430
But you know, both you and I fall in love

244
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,970
with people who make us eager to win.

245
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,520
What are you saying so suddenly?

246
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,320
I saw Ji Yun Su in Hangok-dong.

247
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,030
You knew this, didn't you?

248
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,370
Have you met her?

249
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,340
Do I have to answer this?

250
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,120
Give me her phone number.

251
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,430
At the next board meeting,

252
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:46,610
Noh Jeong Ah or I will be elected as a director.

253
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:50,020
If Yun Su's motive to return is Noh Jeong Ah,

254
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,110
I'll need her help.

255
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,860
Are the shoes comfortable?

256
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,960
Yes.

257
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,190
- They are.<br>- They suit you.

258
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,580
Stay safe.

259
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,980
Thank you for coming here today.

260
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,640
I'm also thankful.

261
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,140
I'm thankful for the shoes.

262
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,580
Whenever I'm in a bad mood, I love to drive your car.

263
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,540
That's good.

264
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,950
How about...

265
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,500
grabbing a beer nearby?

266
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,980
Sure.

267
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,600
How absurd.

268
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,540
Won't you get off?

269
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,980
Go in.

270
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,450
Hello, Teacher Ji.

271
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,960
Hello.

272
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,540
It's been a long time.

273
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,310
True.

274
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,730
It's been a long time. Have you been well?

275
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,290
Yes, I have. I also live here.

276
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,740
By the way,

277
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,370
I guess you both are still pretty close.

278
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,470
Did you get closer in the past 4 years?

279
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,380
You haven't changed.

280
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,430
You still believe in the assumptions you make.

281
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,200
It was nice meeting you, Gyu Yeong.

282
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,000
See you next time.

283
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,070
Leave.

284
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,820
He's here.

285
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,300
Is it Seung Yu?

286
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,530
Honey.

287
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,690
Welcome home.

288
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,490
Mother.

289
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,280
Welcome.

290
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,210
Are you hungry?

291
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,690
Yes.

292
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,680
What is this, hm?

293
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,720
Is it <i>cheonggukjang</i>?<br><i>(TN: a fermented soybean paste)</i>

294
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,590
I know you like it.

295
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,440
I'll prepare it.

296
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,430
My son can also cook, huh? All grown up.

297
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,900
Eat it while it's hot.

298
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,110
It looks delicious.

299
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,980
Let's eat then.

300
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,490
Oh goodness.

301
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:57,000
The smell isn't good but the taste is amazing, huh?

302
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,390
She's right.

303
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,540
Eat a lot. Your mom...

304
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,270
prepared all the dishes you like.

305
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,380
It seems...

306
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,290
like a birthday.

307
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:15,200
Exactly.

308
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,730
I'm as happy as on the day you were born.

309
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,070
So come home often, understand?

310
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,700
Yes.

311
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,660
So let us eat.

312
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,200
Eat a lot.

313
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,020
Why did you buy macaroons?

314
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,030
Because I know you like them.

315
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,900
Teacher Baek Seung Yu's mother made them herself.

316
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,160
- Are these from his parents' shop?<br>- Yeah. I'm a regular there.

317
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,140
We're very close.

318
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:52,650
You have to study math hard so you don't embarass Teacher Baek Seung Yu!

319
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,740
Why talk about this?

320
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,520
Oh you, really!

321
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,880
Oh, quickly!

322
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,280
Here, Seung Yu.

323
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,470
Aigo, Yu Chan's mother bought those.

324
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:11,240
- They're very sweet and refreshing.<br>- You can't accept gifts from the students' parents.

325
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,870
Oh, aigo... It's not...

326
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,050
It's not like a parent...

327
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:19,230
But it's a present between sisters.

328
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,450
I got it. I'll be careful from now on.

329
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,880
How long do you plan on staying at that school?

330
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,850
You're not going to keep teaching the kids there, are you?

331
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,330
- I think—<br>- Oh! They say this is so sweet. Honey, try it first.

332
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:36,050
Try this. Eat it.

333
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,230
Oh, Seung Yu, you too.

334
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,230
Eat it quickly and I'll cut some more.

335
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,080
Yes, I've arrived. Please come to the second floor.

336
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,730
What happened?

337
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,260
You contacted me first, even after

338
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,880
telling me to pretend I don't know you.

339
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,990
- You're being investigated, correct?<br>- Yes.

340
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,050
Why?

341
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,850
Will you introduce me to a good lawyer?

342
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,880
Why would I?

343
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,640
It seems I wouldn't do any good to you since I'm under investigation.

344
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,120
- Are you threatening me now?<br>- Ye Rin.

345
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,490
I am your teacher.

346
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:44,460
- What the hell are you trying to— <br> - So then, Teacher.

347
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,270
Listen carefully.

348
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,770
If you talk about past things, you'll only face more charges. There are no benefits.

349
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:53,660
Therefore, accept whatever punishment for the things you've done.

350
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,670
Don't ever think about returning to the school.

351
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,980
Right.

352
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,280
Yes, let me take all the blame.

353
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,610
Do you think, just because you were a minor then, you can get out of this?

354
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:10,670
You, Seong Min Jun, Yu Hye Mi, and Noh Jeong Ah.

355
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,270
We are all accomplices.

356
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,480
Do you think I'll allow you to make just me take all the blame?

357
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,120
We're not in the same class to be called accomplices.

358
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,520
- Ye Rin.<br> - Don't make a fuss out of it.

359
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,060
I'm telling you clearly.

360
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,760
By any chance, was it you?

361
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:32,500
After Baek Seung Yu came back, you felt uncomfortable about the past,

362
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,020
so you had me fired? To get rid of me?

363
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,960
Don't you still not understand?

364
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,930
It was Noh Jeong Ah, not I, who got you fired.

365
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,000
<i>Time is the Necessary Proof</i>

366
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,030
<i>Time is the necessary proof.</i>

367
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,050
<i>They turned out nice.</i>

368
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:26,990
<i>Sleep well.</i>

369
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,960
Sleep well.

370
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,800
I'm Noh Yeon Wu. Please call me at this number.

371
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:52,960
<i>I have something to tell you. About Principal Noh Jeong Ah.</i>

372
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,940
- Hello. <br> - Sorry for calling so late.

373
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,520
<i>I found it.</i>

374
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,350
At first he didn't answer my call. Teacher Han Myeong Jin will be investigated according to an article.

375
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,620
I think he changed his mind.

376
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,590
He should be seen. What are you going to do?

377
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,440
I'll meet him.

378
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,000
Thank you for working so hard.

379
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,870
- I can't believe it. <br> - Is she crazy?

380
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:43,350
- I won't let this slide. <br> - She treated someone like a thief.

381
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,920
You're here.

382
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,000
Hey, Choi Si An.

383
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,700
You're really shameless.

384
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,900
You made a fuss that I copied your assignment. Why did you copy it?

385
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,360
What are you talking about? Tell me so I can understand.

386
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,150
This is you, right?

387
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,430
<i>10/10</i>

388
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,010
<i>10/10</i>

389
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,380
What's this again?

390
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,830
Isn't this about our school?

391
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:40,050
I think a student from our school posted a picture of her assignment on the math community bulletin board.

392
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:44,020
Excuse me. Teacher Baek, come and look at this.

393
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,190
Excuse me?

394
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,630
<i>Plagiarism by gifted students?</i>

395
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,630
What? My father's research paper?

396
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,430
I really didn't know.

397
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:02,890
Even the professor didn't talk about his research. He just helped me.

398
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:07,810
Yes. If you knew, you wouldn't have posted it on an internet bulletin board.

399
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:10,060
Have you talked to Teacher Baek?

400
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,070
Not yet.

401
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,780
Student Choi Si An.

402
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,340
The Principal is summoning you.

403
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,820
Teacher, I'll talk to you later.

404
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,110
Hurry, quickly!

405
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,570
<i>Sharing a problem it took me a week to solve.</i>

406
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,970
<i>I think I saw this in a paper somewhere.</i>

407
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,640
<i>Then it's plagiarism.</i>

408
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,660
<i>If the key idea is similar, isn't it plagiarism?</i>

409
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,660
<i>Is it plagiarism?</i>

410
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:01,800
It's a fact that you solved the problem with the help of an old professor, whom you know well.

411
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,020
Didn't you know some of the solutions were in the professor's paper?

412
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,350
Yes. I swear I didn't know.

413
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:11,010
That's your story. Is there anyone who will confirm it?

414
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:13,050
Confirm?

415
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,510
The professor lives in a nursing home now. How could I...?

416
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:22,490
- That professor, that is, the name of the paper's author is Ji Hyeon Wook, isn't it? <br> - Yes.

417
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:29,610
The daughter is Ji Yun Su, your clinic instructor and your guardian.

418
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,630
She may be able to explain it.

419
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:40,720
As you say, she will know her father's condition and his relationship with you, better than anyone else.

420
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,290
- That is... <br> - She needs to give a good explanation.

421
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:46,310
If she doesn't,

422
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,000
For you who have committed the error of plagiarism and stained the reputation of our Aseong Gifted School

423
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,410
in addition to termination of you scholarships, I, in the exercise of my authority as principal,

424
00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:00,130
could order severe discipline such as suspension from school, transfer to another school or even worse—

425
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,810
complete expulsion from school.

426
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,820
<i>Hello</i>

427
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,170
I heard from Si An.

428
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,500
Actually, I'm on my way to the principal's office.

429
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,750
I heard that the professor helped her. I had no idea something like this would happen.

430
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:17,210
Both Si An and Father would not have known that it would be mischaracterized as plagiarism.

431
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,330
Mischaracterized?

432
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:23,130
This is my suspicion. I think Principal Noh Jeong Ah knows everything.

433
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,660
Both that I am in Hangok-dong and that I tutor Si An. That's why things have been blown out of proportion.

434
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,300
That's why this has been blown out of proportion.

435
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,360
Let me see her first.

436
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,410
Let's go.

437
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,110
Go on in.

438
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,220
Choi Si An didn't intend that.

439
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:03,570
But because she did not site her source, I'll give her a score of zero.

440
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:06,090
Please do so.

441
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:08,150
Is that all?

442
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:13,310
Is there anything else you want?

443
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,960
You should go to your class.

444
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,170
<i>For now, I decided to give her no points.</i>

445
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:29,590
<i>I'll call you if something else happens.</i>

446
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:33,860
Teacher, I truly am sorry.

447
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,290
Can you come to school now?

448
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:11,060
<i>Aseong Academy of Mathematics and Art</i>

449
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,990
Welcome, Teacher.

450
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,670
Take a seat.

451
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,980
It's been a long time.

452
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,720
Have you been well all of this time?

453
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,350
Wow.

454
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:18,130
I didn't expect to meet you like this. Did you hear what I want?

455
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:23,110
Professor Ji Hyeon Wook's statement that Si An did not intend to plagiarize and

456
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:27,440
a medical certificate saying in his condition he's not competent to make such a statement.

457
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,250
- Did you bring it? <br> - No.

458
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:34,000
In any case the outcome is already decided.

459
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,820
Because even if I prove it, I know you can make it wrong.

460
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:47,650
You understand me well now.

461
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,170
Why did you do that?

462
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:56,830
You should have not touched my family.

463
00:42:56,830 --> 00:43:02,370
We're meeting this way after a long time but it is so distasteful.

464
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,950
Even so, one fortunate thing is,

465
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:13,530
more than I expected, you haven't changed much.

466
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:19,780
Because Si An tripped, should I say you were true to your nature to come running to save her?

467
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:24,640
You know, if you sharpened your knife and came all the way here,

468
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,590
you shouldn' t have kept them close to you.

469
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:31,280
Beings whom you cherish and want to protect

470
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,170
like Choi Si An

471
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,790
and Baek Seung Yu.

472
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:41,120
Naturally, because you're close to them,

473
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,410
you wouldn't know how fortunate it is for me.

474
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:56,750
I thought I was the only one afraid.

475
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:00,420
I guess

476
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,900
you are also afraid.

477
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:10,870
Calling me like this and scaring Seung Yu by threatening Si An.

478
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:13,970
It makes me very happy.

479
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:22,380
Do you perhaps know your daughter well?

480
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:26,990
You need to watch out for that child.

481
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:30,140
Especially the thieving.

482
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,450
I heard Teacher Ji Yun Su came to the school.

483
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:36,730
- Teacher Ji Yun Su? <br> - For real?

484
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,450
Yes, I just saw her.

485
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:40,470
What?

486
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,900
In the future, even if you don't entrust Ji Na to me,

487
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,950
I will continue to watch her intensely.

488
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,880
There's no guarantee that Ji Na won't become like a second Ye Rin.

489
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:03,420
Oh! There's something you cherish more than Ji Na, isn't there?

490
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,750
This Aseong School.

491
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:17,740
It cannot be more impressive. It's gotten more elaborate and grander.

492
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:23,910
Then, until we meet again.

493
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:41,170
Don't you... want to apologize to me?

494
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:49,470
I will.

495
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:16,520
If the pain, anger, and sadness that you must have suffered

496
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:23,380
over the last four hellish years can be washed away with my apology,

497
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,900
I will do anything you like.

498
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,000
Isn't it futile?

499
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,690
Pretending to be virtuous, pretending to be different,

500
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:49,840
how are you any different from me now?

501
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,870
However...

502
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:26,400
When did you arrive? Did you meet Noh Jeong Ah?

503
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:32,090
Why did you come here without telling me? Don't you trust me?

504
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:34,420
I'm glad I came here.

505
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,820
It sobered me up.

506

507
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,500
Prepare it.

508
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:06,270
An event commemorating the Memorandum of Understanding between the National Mathematical Museum Committee and Aseong.

509
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:08,000
You have to do it well.

510
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,180
If you have any reason to continue to stay at our school.

511
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:16,990

512
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,190
Sure. I'll do my best.

513
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:26,610
You sure are patient. There must be many things you want to say.

514
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:29,070
Do I look patient to you?

515
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:34,570
See you at the event.

516
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:01,900
<i>Aseong International Middle School</i>

517
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,430
You cannot enter like this—

518
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:21,000
That's okay. You can go now.

519
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,710
You should've called first. What can I do when you come in like this?

520
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:41,280
Are you going to meet Noh Jeong Ah?

521
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,720
What do you know?

522
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:49,380
Tell me everything you've got.

523
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:51,650
The international middle school?

524
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:54,870
Yes, it looks like she went there.

525
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:00,630
Please bring the academic and accounting reports for the upcoming board meeting.

526
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,020
I need to review them again.

527
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,540
Yes, I'll bring them.

528
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,200
I collected tons of evidence on Principal Noh Jeong Ah's

529
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,040
corruption and irregularities in the past four years.

530
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,980
But, if it were done for the sake of Aseong School as a result,

531
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,590
my father won't consider it corruption.

532
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:25,490
Then?

533
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:30,240
If the family is rashly messed with, in the disgrace only I will bear my father's wrath.

534
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:36,770
However, there is one point which would make my father get rid of Jeong Ah:

535
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,750
Father's money.

536
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:44,090
If she siphoned the money or cheated him, the story will be very different.

537
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,710
I heard that the director of the academy where you work

538
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:53,340
and Jeong Ah have created a scholarship foundation.

539
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,680
How did you know that?

540
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:59,600
From Ryu Seong Jae.

541
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:03,390
Seems like a request was made to the Department of Education for permission.

542
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:10,030
Did you get my contact number from him? I didn't know you were acquaintances.

543
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:12,880
We became acquaintances,

544
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,350
after he broke up with you.

545
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:20,780
We both have the same goals. Since Noh Jeong Ah ruined his wedding,

546
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,760
he wants to give back as much as he received.

547
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:27,610
So, what is it that you want from me?

548
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:36,130
- Hello?<br>- Teacher Ji.

549
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:41,540
I'm sorry. Because of me, you're having a hard time.

550
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,520
Where are you? At school?

551
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,640
No.

552
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,830
<i>Sunstone City</i>

553
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:49,580
I went there,

554
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,850
they told me not to go there anymore.

555
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:59,070
Because I caused trouble at school, they won't give scholarship anymore.

556
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:00,680
What?

557
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:05,330
Ji Yun Su instructor?

558
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,960
I regret having to tell you this.

559
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,660
Then, she has been planning this from the start,

560
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,540
she was kicked out.

561
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:18,210
She is using you to get back at me.

562
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,700
Get in.

563
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,850
Hello, Principal.

564
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:26,040
Hello, Instructor Ji.

565
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,340
You met Director Noh, correct?

566
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,000
You must have heard about me, probably.

567
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:40,570
She is right. It is true that I have unpleasant feelings towards her.

568
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:47,580
So, you must be feeling awkward to have me around. I came here to tell you this.

569
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:52,140
No matter what you do with her, always keep this in mind.

570
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:58,050
She is always ready to pin everything on you.

571
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,170
It would be good for you to be prepared.

572
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:06,690
I... could help you with getting prepared.

573
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:10,620
Think about it and then give me a call.

574
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,300
Hello. You are assistant Park Hye Young, right?

575
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,390
Yes.

576
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:37,280
I only did what Teacher Han Myeong Jin told me to do.

577
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,670
- Miss Assistant! <br> - Yes.

578
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:45,950
- Can you sort this by school year and subjects and put them into an envelope for me? <br> - Sure.

579
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:47,600
<i>2017 2nd semester Mid terms <br> 2nd school year Math Key</i>

580
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,070
They fired me unfairly.

581
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:55,170
He fired me because he felt he might get caught.

582
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,820
There is just one thing I want.

583
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:02,830
I want to snatch Aseong School from Director Noh Jeong Ah.

584
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:05,800
I want the same too. Although, I'm not sure it would become mine.

585
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,120
I am not interested in that.

586
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,800
I will give you call after I think over it.

587
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,570
You are capable of changing too, huh?

588
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:21,580
When we were in high school, I changed but you held fast till the end.

589
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:26,020
Having a person who is firm and not broken by anything by one's side

590
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:31,280
is more uncomfortable than you could imagine. Like a thorn stuck to your side.

591
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,250
Probably that's how Seong Jae felt when you were by his side.

592
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:40,360
You both are together, am I still a bother?

593
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:52,450
You waited a lot, right?

594
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:54,400
No, it's okay.

595
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,350
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

596
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:58,370
What will you eat?

597
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:01,040
Shall I take your orders?

598
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,860
Two portions of <i>sundae</i>.<br><i>(TN: a Korean type of sausage)</i>

599
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:10,180

00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:26,130
Si An.

601
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:30,210
Can you promise me one more thing?

602
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:36,400
From now on, if you're having a hard time at school,

603
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:41,220
don't keep it to yourself or try to solve it by yourself,

604
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,570
Tell me everything. Understand?

605
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:46,220
Yes, Teacher.

606
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:52,240
Also for the meanwhile, let's meet outside rather than academy.

607
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,770
Yes.

608
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,650
- Let's talk. <br> - Okay.

609
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:14,360
All the files related to that incident from 4 years ago, hand them over to me. Everything.

610
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:19,760
No, you hand over whatever you know to me. Everything.

611
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,260
I will find another means that's not you.

612
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:25,400
- Another means? <br> - They found about you anyway.

613
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,440
They must be watching you, there is no meaning in working together.

614
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,560
Didn't you think that this might be what they want?

615
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,410
For us to part our ways.

616
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:36,320
I will give them what they want, then.

617
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,430
Why are you being like this? Are you sick of this already?

618
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,400
If not, are you scared?

619
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,440
I became sure after I saw Director Noh Jeong Ah today.

620
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:47,030
I won't hand over to anyone. I won't leave it to anyone's care.

00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,720
Did you really change your mind?

636
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:23,580
I'm considering it.

637
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:35,230
It was the first time in my life that part of my life was messed by someone else's action.

638
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:39,470
I didn't trip over myself,

639
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:45,290
but because I tripped over someone else' foot, I couldn't fix it.

640
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:49,540
I think time stopped for a while.

641
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:54,790
We need to resolve this. I think I can't look back anymore.

642
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:57,280
I hope so.

643
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:02,580
If we are to be together, there is one condition.

644
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:04,690
Yes, continue.

645
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:09,750
I'm going to subtract Seung Yu from this.

646
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:17,530
I have one question.

647
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:22,150
Just what is Baek Seung Yu to you?

648
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:25,810
A man?

649
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:29,310
It wasn't that way before, but is it like that now?

650
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:32,420
- If you're done talking <br> - I'm asking you.

651
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,590
Oh, Minister, have you been well?

652
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:44,390
This way.

653
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:47,100
- It's been a while, Assemblyman. <br> - Yes.

654
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:50,160
- Hello. <br> - Hello.

655
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,390
-Your face looks better! <br> - Ye Chan's Mom!

656
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:55,060
- Hello. <br> - You came early.

657
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:57,780
What are you talking about?

658
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:02,010
Why isn't Seung Yu here yet?

659
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:04,070
So, is there even a name in the sequence of events?

660
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:05,390
Hello.

661
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:08,370
Hey, I'm here to look around. Why are we doing this?

662
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:10,820
- In the wish they will screw up. <br> - I'm sorry.

663
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:12,780
- Ye Rin! <br> - Hi.

664
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,800
- You're here? <br> - Ye Rin, the more the days go by,

665
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:20,250
the cooler you look. Daebak!

666
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:22,420
I thought it was a celebrity.

667
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:28,760
The principal arrived.

668
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,260
Hello.

669
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,930
Welcome, Minister.

670
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:35,660
- She's so beautiful. <br> - Thank you.

671
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:50,550
That person, is he your other card?

672
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:54,790
Do we have to hold hands with him now?

673
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:59,890
Do you trust him more than me?

674
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:08,070
Do you know who is giving me the hardest time now?

675
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,590
It's you.

676
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:15,570
Baek Seung Yu is making me suffer like crazy the most!

677
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:20,160
So

678
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:24,210
stop bothering me and drop out of this, please.

679
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:27,430
Why are you have a hard time because of me?

680
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:29,540
Why am I making you suffer?

681
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:32,350
I am also like that.

682
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:35,880
Because of you, it's crazily annoying, and I'm having a hard time. But...

683
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:39,630
I know why I did that.

684
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,920
Try to find the answer.

685
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:46,260
Why are you suffering like crazy and having a hard time because of me?

686
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:51,830
I've already been through it for four years so I know the answer.

687
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:06,630
Hello.

688
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:08,030
Welcome, Minister.

689
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:10,590
Today, you are dazzlingly beautiful.

690
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:12,240
Thank you. Please go in.

691
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,530
- Minister. <br> - Assemblyman.

692
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:15,920
Let's go.

693
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,860
Oh, how are you?

694
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:22,490
Baek Seung Yu is not here yet. He is not having second thoughts, is he?

695
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:26,150
Since it's time, let's get started.

696
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,760
<i>Asung Academy of Mathematics and Art</i>

697
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,830
I'd like to express my gratitude

698
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:38,950
to everyone who came here to celebrate the agreement between the National Mathematics Museum Promotion Committee

699
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:41,810
and Asung Academy of Mathematics and Arts.

700
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:46,130
I'm the principal of Asung Gifted School, Noh Jeong Ah.

701
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:57,830
Before the event, our school's math teacher,

702
01:03:57,830 --> 01:04:01,360
Baek Seung Yu, winner of the Lucifer Award,

703
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:06,680
wants to tell you the purpose of building a mathematics museum.

704
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,630
He came just in time.

705
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:21,550
I'm sorry for being late.

706
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:23,600
Please start.

707
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:40,250
Hello. I'm Baek Seung Yoo, a math teacher at Asung Gifted School.

708
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:44,910
I heartily thank those of you who are interested

709
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:47,580
in building a national mathematics museum.

710
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:03,770

<i>F</i>

712
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:14,470
There are only two things in a mathematical proof:

713
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:16,570
True and False.

714
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,590
You cannot say True is something false.

715
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:21,700
You cannot say False is something true.

716
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:25,470
Mathematicians can not lie.

717
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:38,550
<i>Just what is Baek Seung Yu to you?</i>

718
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,160
<i>A man?</i>

719
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:50,410
But in this world we live in, something true can become false and

720
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:55,570
sometimes something false can become true.

721
01:05:55,570 --> 01:06:00,640
Four years ago, at Aseong High School, the predecessor of Aseong Gifted School,

722
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:03,550
indeed that's what happened.

723
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:12,290
A rumor that an Aseong female math teacher and an Aseong male student had an inappropriate relationship

724
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:18,160
spread quickly and grew to set Hangok-dong buzzing.

725
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:25,210
True became false, and False became True.

726
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:30,750
The male star of the inappropriate relationship scandal, an Aseong junior,

727
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:34,360
was me.

728

<i>Find the answer.</i>

<i>I told you I know. I know very well, why I am doing this.</i>

<i>Do you want to try to go head to head against me?</i>

741

<i>Principal, you should go head to head, too.</i>

742

<i>Wait a little bit more. Until only Ji Yun Su and Baek Seung Yu remain.</i>

746
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:30,280
<i>Why isn't there something made false in spite of being true?</i>
