because he was injured.

set foot on the basketball court again.

Yes, yes. Get them here.

Listen. Here's the thing.

60
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,030
Recently, a student at school broke a bone

61
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,030
while playing soccer.

62
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,280
For your safety,

63
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,760
let's kick shuttlecock instead.

64
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,080
Get him to the infirmary.

65

66
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,290
A student got hurt from kicking a shuttlecock.

The final exam is coming soon.

68
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,200
Watch out for your safety.

69
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,850
Don't kick shuttlecocks.

70
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,940
Get him to the infirmary.

71
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,450

75
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,210
Don't run.

76
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,640
Get him to the infirmary.

77

78
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,690
Sir. Sir.

79
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,780
I heard you would have a leave again next class.

80
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,780
Your class teacher wanted
extra time for his lesson.

81
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,250
Why don't you give us a supplementary P.E. class?

82
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,780
I'll give it a try.

83
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,160
Anyway, the P.E. class of Class 6 has been canceled.

84
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,250
I can leave the time to your class.

85
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,070
The teachers of Class Six
also occupy their P.E classes.

86
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,520
No, they volunteered to give up on P.E.

87
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,880
and asked the teachers to give them extra classes.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,450
They said they would do much better

89
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,960
than you in the final exam.

90
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,230
Li Gang must be afraid
that they can't beat us in basketball

91
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,940
so they make the final exam another battlefield.

92
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,320
He tries to attack our weakness.

93
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,570
So despicable.

94
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,640
Are your feet better?

95
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,710
I'm fine.

96
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,490
I can beat Class Six

97
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,090
even with a cane.

98
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,580
Last night, I saw Class Six

99
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,420
studying even after school

100
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,510
and didn't return until
the dorm was about to close.

101
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,600
The enemy is working hard. We should, too.

102
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,020
Class ranking is based on the total score.

103
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,310
So, we need to do great for the overall grade,

104
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,660
and the glory of Class Two.

105
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,150
We can do it!

106
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,070
Beat them

107
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,140
with all our strength.

108
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,840
We need to have a systematic review.

109
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,100
Textbooks are the basics,

110
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,740
but we also need
notes, papers and error collection.

111
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,230
Keep improving our knowledge system

112
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,010
with the help of these materials.

113
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,070
These would be enough.

114
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,330
The questions setters are not that smart.

115
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,460
I've just got all the important points down.

116
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,640
Remember all these in a short time.

117
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,670
They can answer most questions.

118
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,820
Read them if you want.
