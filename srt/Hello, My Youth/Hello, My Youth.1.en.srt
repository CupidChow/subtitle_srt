00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,720
[Just as I expected from a key high school,]

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,720
[sunny campus,]

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,270
[a view as nice as pictures,]

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,140
[and all these robust teenagers.]

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,600
[It's great to be]

16
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,720
[a transfer student here.]

17
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,430
[I have to perform well!]

18
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,720
[There's already an opportunity to show myself?]

19
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,810
[What's going on?]

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,640
[Bro, are you from this school?]

21
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,520
Excuse me, do you need a hand?

22
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,890
Sure, thanks!

23
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,600
[Just a step ahead from me!]

24
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:25,430
[Such a bad beginning!]

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,430
Excuse me.

26
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,270
Hello, do you need any help?

27
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,720
Middle school is over there.

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,390
[Junior High]

29
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,430
[Oh, no!]

30
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,640
[I forgot to change the middle school badge!]

31
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,100
You can just put it here.

32
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,680
Thank you!

33
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,930
Do you have anything else?

34
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,310
Do you have anything else?

35
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,640
That's it.

36
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,020
Then I'll leave first.

37
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,850
[I'm not wearing a uniform anyway.]

38
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,020
[I'll just walk around first.]

39
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,470
[First time entering the classroom
is very important.]

40
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,430
[I must enter after all the other classmates]

41
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,310
[and before the teacher.]

42
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,270
[Stay for a few more seconds.]

43
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,600
[so all the classmates' attention]

44
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,680
[will focus only on me]

45
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,390
[and wonder who this boy without a badge is.]

46
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,100
Please go back to your seat.

47
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,890
Why would this straight line be like on the plane?

48
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,390
It would actually be like this.

49
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,310
It means point A belongs to α.

50
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,060
Point B belongs to α.

51
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,180
[This is how a high school should be!]

52
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,560
[The class is so rhythmic.]

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,470
[But it's too fast!]

54
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,810
Is there anything you don't understand?

55
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,770
What are you doing?

56
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,850
I'm doing art.

57
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,100
Security room.

58
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,100
I found a suspicious boy on the field.

59
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,220
Please send someone here.

60
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,020
What happened?

61
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,560
Hello, Principal!

62
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,310
I don't know where this person came from.

63
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,810
I was just checking on him.

64
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,310
Hello, Principal!

65
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,310
I came in from the main entrance.

66
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,680
If you suspect me,

67
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,680
then there's something wrong with your security.

68
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,970
Mindful your words!

69
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,220
Come with me to the security room.

70
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,890
Okay.

71
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,350
Show me what you've drawn.

72
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:58,810
Here you are.

73
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,180
It's pretty good!

74
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,600
Did you draw it?

75
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,350
Yes.

76
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,270
OK. Go back to your work, please.

77
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,520
Leave this to me.

78
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,810
Yes, Principal.

79
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,390
Which class are you from?

80
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,970
[Which gang?]

81
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:16,560
[Blue Dragon gang?]

82
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
[No, too ordinary.]

83
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,100
[Dark moon?]

84
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,850
[Too graceful.]

85
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,560
[Overlord club?]

86
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,390
[Too childish.]

87
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,270
[Ao'tian Tribe?]

88
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,220
[Too exaggerated.]

89
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,310
Soul Eating gang!

90
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,970
I asked you which class!

91
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,640
Grade 10...

92
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,890
Grade 10 Class 2.

93
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,430
Grade 10 is in the opposite building.

94
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,100
[Grade 11 Class 2]

95
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,810
[I went into the wrong classroom?]

96
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,890
The principle is here!
