[Episode 2]

14
00:00:54,437 --> 00:00:55,979
Trying to steal my spotlight again?

15
00:01:14,812 --> 00:01:15,479
Zheng Dian.

16
00:01:15,937 --> 00:01:16,687
Chang Yan.

17
00:01:16,937 --> 00:01:18,104
Come up here, please.

18
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:28,729
Are you Zheng Dian?

19
00:01:30,062 --> 00:01:31,395
You skipped class  first day of school.

20
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,687
Teacher, I went to the wrong classroom.

21
00:01:36,104 --> 00:01:37,104
Where's your badge?

22
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,145
I've brought it,

23
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:40,645
but wrong one.

24
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:43,520
It's the first day of school, so I understand.

25
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,312
But, we can't break the rules.

26
00:01:47,812 --> 00:01:49,104
500 words self-criticism.

27
00:01:49,395 --> 00:01:51,812
[No way! Self-criticism on the first day!]

28
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,270
You're Chang Yan, right?

29
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:55,104
Where's your uniform?

30
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,687
I just transferred here, I haven't got it

31
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:58,187
[You're gonna write 1000 words.]

32
00:01:58,437 --> 00:02:00,020
Get them at the logistic department later.

33
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,770
I'll take you there.

34
00:02:02,062 --> 00:02:02,645
Thank you.

35
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,937
[This is unfair!!]

36
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:07,812
I forgot to introduce myself to you.

37
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,520
My surname is Yan,

38
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,020
as in Lord Yan*.
(*Lit: King of Hell)

39
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:13,354
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

40
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:15,312
[What's there to thank the King of Hell?]

41
00:02:15,312 --> 00:02:16,437
You can go back to your seats.

42
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:17,229
Sir.

43
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,437
I'd like to switch seats
with this guy next to me.

44
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:21,645
[Are you kidding me?]

45
00:02:22,104 --> 00:02:24,062
[You've already stole my spotlight,
now you're stealing my seat?]

46
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:24,645
OK.

47
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,770
Switch seats with him.

48
00:02:31,687 --> 00:02:32,187
[Bro.]

49
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:34,229
[Not bad.]

50
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,520
[I'll make you pay]

51
00:02:37,062 --> 00:02:39,020
[for this later.]

52

[Restrain yourself a bit.]

54
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:51,187
[Do you think you're great just cause you're handsome?]

55
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:52,395
[Brother, we still have a long way to go.]

56
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,937
[Please take care of me.]

57
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:55,562
[Just endure it.]

58
00:02:56,187 --> 00:02:57,937
[We'll switch seats soon anyway.]

59
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,645
Hi!

60
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,145
Sorry.

61
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,062
I came late.

62
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,229
I'm Zheng Dian.

63
00:03:09,562 --> 00:03:10,062
Hello.

64
00:03:10,062 --> 00:03:11,104

67
00:03:14,187 --> 00:03:14,854
Hello.

68
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,062
This is my first time staying in a dorm.

69
00:03:27,395 --> 00:03:28,270
I'm so excited.

70
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,562
Hi, I'm Chang Yan.

71
00:03:29,854 --> 00:03:30,520
Huang Da Chuan.

72
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,479
Hi, I'm Chang Yan.

73
00:03:31,604 --> 00:03:33,229
My dorm mates are all friendly,

74
00:03:36,395 --> 00:03:37,937
except this one.

75
00:03:43,437 --> 00:03:44,104
Bro.

76
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:46,145
Do you like the upper bunk or the bottom one?

77
00:03:46,562 --> 00:03:47,312
Bottom.

78
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,062
What a coincidence!

79
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,145
Me, too.

80
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,812
Actually, climbing is annoying.

81
00:03:53,437 --> 00:03:53,729
How about this?

82
00:03:54,187 --> 00:03:55,354
I'll let you have it.

83
00:03:55,645 --> 00:03:57,812
I'll take the upper bunk, you take the other.

84
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,562
Sure.

85
00:03:59,062 --> 00:03:59,854
Do you play games?

86
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:02,104
Not interested.

87
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:03,895
Then what are you interested in?

88
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:04,687
Drawing.

89
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:06,520
Drawing?

90
00:04:07,354 --> 00:04:07,979
What a coincidence!

91
00:04:08,354 --> 00:04:09,812
I've been learning drawing recently.

92
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,812
Borrow me two of your textbooks.

93
00:04:12,395 --> 00:04:12,895
Sure.

94
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,937
Remember to return them.

95
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:15,687
Of course.

96
00:04:18,395 --> 00:04:21,437
Boys, this is the new dorm guidelines.

97
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,145
Please read them carefully.

98
00:04:24,437 --> 00:04:27,104
I'll emphasize the main points for you guys.

99
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:28,812
You are not allowed to use any electronics.

100
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:30,270
Anything for entertainment

101
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,895
and unrelated to your studies
will be taken away.

102
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,187
You're not allowed to go out
or make any loud noises.

103
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,520
If you don't return at night,

104
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,104
I will mark your name once if you get caught.

105
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:41,770
The person on duty
will clean the trash can every day.

106
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,270
There shouldn't be any trash in the trash can.

107
00:04:43,687 --> 00:04:45,437
There shouldn't be any trash in the trash can?

108
00:04:45,604 --> 00:04:47,062
Then what's the trash can for?

109
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:49,187
I'm talking about during inspection.

110
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:50,937
Is that clear?

111
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,104
Who's your dorm supervisor?

112
00:04:57,187 --> 00:04:58,312
[Will there be special privileges]

113
00:04:59,062 --> 00:05:00,479
[if I become the dorm supervisor?]

114
00:05:01,895 --> 00:05:03,229
[I've never been a dorm supervisor before.]

115
00:05:04,145 --> 00:05:06,062
[Dorm supervisor? I should give it a try too.]

116
00:05:06,645 --> 00:05:08,145
[Can I draw anytime
if I become the dorm supervisor?]

117
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:15,479
[@Who's the Dorm Supervisor?]
