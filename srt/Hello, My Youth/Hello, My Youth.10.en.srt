Does anyone know the answer?

16

Wake me up after class.

Please.

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,350
The answer is "loose".

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,640
Yes, very good.

20
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,550
Alright, second question.

00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,640
Look at this table first.

Poke me hard

31
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,140

Report, he's not feeling well

49
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,690

50

What you thought the best way

62

Look at his eyes.

70
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,310
No wonder he's sitting so uptight.

71
