Use the "join the private group" function.

The code is 1212.

19
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,360
Only one of you is not in now.

20
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,610
Who is it?

21
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,810
It's me. I don't have my phone with me,

22
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:22,970
Fine.

23
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,310
The rest of you, hand in your phones.

25
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,020

43
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,900
Good! Please come up here to solve this question.

44
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,040
