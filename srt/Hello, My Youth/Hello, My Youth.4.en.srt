[Why did he take the blame?]

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000

[Episode 3]

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,940
Let's select a dorm supervisor!

13
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,120
I'm not in.

14
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,880
He's playing cool again.

15
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,000
This is a man-to-man battle.

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,670
Fine, I'll be the judge.

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,430
He wants to be the judge?

18
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,490
Set the rules.

19
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,300
Okay.

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,450
Stand up on one foot

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,660
for five minutes.

22
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,970
When both of your feet touch the ground, you lose.

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,340
Easy piece, come on!

24
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,400
Time starts.

25
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,160
[Round 1]

26
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,910
Why did you push me?

27
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,620
I...

28
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,440
You can't make it for five minutes?

29
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,900
No, this is too difficult.

30
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,380
You are too lame here.

31
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,470
Why don't you give it a try?

32
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,980
Try ten minutes!

33
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,870
Say fifteen minutes.

34
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,450
Time me.

35
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,670
Alright, no score for this round.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,850
Round two.

37
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,260
He's so good at it!

38
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,270
Rock, Paper, Scissors for the second round.

39
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,090
Do it with your feet not your fingers.

40
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,290
Are your ready?

41
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,670
I'll count to three.

42
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,000
Three, two, one, jump.

43
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,950
One more time.

44
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,610
Three, two, one.

45
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,340
One more time.

46
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,500
Three, two, one.

47
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,110
Yeah! I won.

48
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,690
No, no, that doesn't count.

49
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,050
He jumped too high.

50
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,610
He could see my move.

51
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,530
One more round.

52
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,510
That wasn't a problem.

53
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,200
I didn't say you have to
touch the ground at the same time.

54
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,970
That's not fair.

55
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,670
You didn't understand the rules.

56
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,850
He used to be a jock.

57
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,170
He jumps higher than us.

58
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,100
You're taller than me,

59
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,480
but you can't jump higher than me.

60
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,270
You lose.

61
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,790
One more round.

62
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,150
One more game.

63
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,160
Round three.

64
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,030
Anybody who speaks first would lose from now on.

65
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,630
[I want some bedtime chats.]

66
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,300
[Dose somniloquy count?]

67
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,420
[I can't fall asleep.]

68
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,310
Why are you all so quiet?

69
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,350
What about your dorm supervisor?

70
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,970
Are you the dorm supervisor?

71
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,570
I'm not.

72
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,380
Whose comic book is this?

73
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,350
It's mine.

74
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,100
[Why did he take the blame?]
