[Episode 15]

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,590
Caught a cold?

13
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:45,980
I'm fine.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,720
Eat something.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What?

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,340
Why are you so happy?

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,620
What happened? Tell me.

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,690
Okay, I can tell you now.

19
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,670
My comic got in.

20
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,580
We're signing the contract tonight.

21
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,280
We should celebrate.

22
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,060
How do you leave? Have you thought about it?

23
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,810
You can't tell your family.

24
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,920
Never mind.

25
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,140
When Zhao and Huang are back,

26
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,390
we'll figure something out together.

27
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,590
Huang Da Chuan tried to catch a cold

28
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,340
by pouring cold water on himself.

29
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,280
After testing it personally,

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,800
he realized that it didn't work.

31
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,490
But I think

32
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,240
you don't have to torture your body

33
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,970
if you want to fake sickness to get a leave note.

34
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,310
We need to do this

35
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,010
with wit.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,830
Like drilling wood for fire.

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,090
38.5 C.

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,720
Got it.

39
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,360
Doctor, I'm not feeling well.

40
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,580
What's the matter?

41
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,390
I have a fever.

42
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,330
Let's take your temperature.

43
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,480
You're fine.

44
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,010
What do you feel?

45
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,150
Only dizzy, no headache.

46
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,630
Failed.

47
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,230
Chang Yan, if only you could have a period.

48
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,860
Chang Yan.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,400
How about inflammatory bowel disease?

50
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,420
Chang Yan, do you have more comic books?

51
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,120
At this point,

52
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,500
we'll have to take extraordinary measures.

53
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,090
Come on, come on.

54
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,130
Miss, sign the leave note please.

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,310
Where is your class teacher?

56
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,270
He's not here.

57
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,750
Who's this?

58
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,440
My brother.

59
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,750
Your brother?

60
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,040
Cousin.

61
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,000
My cousin's parents can't come.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,910
I'm here to pick him up.

63
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,420
You can call his parents to confirm it.

64
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,070
Is this Chang Yan's father?

65
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,620
Yes, I am.

66
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,760
Here's the thing.

67
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,870
I'm calling from school

68
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,980
to confirm you're Chang Yan's father.

69
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,550
No problem. Thank you.

70
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,880
Alright, bye.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,320
I still need to confirm with your class teacher.

72
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:06,860
Sir.

73
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,410
Sir, how do we generate the derivatives 
of the compound function?

74
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,550
Wait a minute.

75
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,460
Sir. Sir.

76
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,260
I have a question for you, too.

77
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,190
I didn't quite understand

78
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,290
this linear equation in two variables.

79
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,650
Wait a minute.

80
00:04:26,437 --> 00:04:27,000
[I'm in a meeting.]

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,021
[Have you contacted Chang Yan's parents?
 He's applying for a leave.]

82
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:29,062
[Yeah. Confirmed.]

83
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,880
Wait for a minute.

84
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,790
Let's do this now.

85
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,560
Please look at this triangle.

86
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,340
How do I know how long its edges are?

87
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,050
Wait a minute. Wait.

88
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,650
Wait, wait.

89
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,780
Wait until I'm done using the bathroom.

90
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,770
Wait for a second.

91
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,120
-Thank you, sir.
 -Thank you, sir.

92
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,950
Okay, you guys wait a minute.

93
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,730
[Seems like we did it.]

94
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,830
You are...

00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,170
