[Episode 11]

10
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,840
Let's go.

11
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,690
So comfy.

12
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,200
[Chang Yan.]

13
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,880
[I will let you have it this time.]

14
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,480
Are they holding grudges?

15
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,780
Maybe.

16
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,610
It doesn't feel good,

17
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,950
defeated by your good buddy.

18
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,430
Watch them when you get back.

19
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,690
Relax,

20
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,470
I will protect Chang Yan well.

21
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,580
Eat something.

22
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,220
Not hungry.

23
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,350
Let's chat.

24
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,590
No.

25
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,160
What's going on with these two?

26
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,930
You didn't say anything today.

27
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,950
What are you thinking?

28
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,270
Your crystal throne still?

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,190
It never occurred to me

30
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,480
there is a surveillance camera
for the crystal throne especially.

31
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,040
Lao Yan scolded me harshly in his office.

32
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,220
Lao Yan is too...

33
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,160
Calm down.

34
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,710
I'm even worse.

35
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,440
Spot check.

36
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,650
Again?

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,150
There's nothing in the closet but clothes.

38
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,780
How could we hide anything in that small gap?

39
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,670
I heard that recently,

40
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,370
the dormitory supervisor won't 
come to our dormitory anymore.

41
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,900
That's good, right?

42
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,590
How long have you been saving these?

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,260
Not long.

44
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,810
Starting from day one of school.

45
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,020
You've done a great job.

46
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,910
Wash them now.

47
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,020
What are you saving them for?

48
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,290
I'm just passing by.

49
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,420
It's me.

50
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,630
You scared the hell out of me!

51
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,200
Are you going to a cybercafé? Count me in.

52
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,510
Are you still mad?

53
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,560
I have some real business to attend to.

54
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,520
Do I look like such a petty person?

55
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,120
Okay, okay, let's go.

56
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,050
