00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,610
Aren't you close with the principal?

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,260
Meeting him last time was just a coincidence.

I'm sorry, Principal.

44
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,140
I didn't do well in the monthly exam.

45
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,190
I feel sorry for our school

46

61
