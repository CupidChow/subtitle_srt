It's Lao Yan's only blind spot.

I call it the Crystal Throne.

Crystal is invisible.

As the best student in Dorm 213,

62
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,790
I asked the top students for some tips

not the three long ones.

68

90
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,850

the admission form first day of school.

98

Never mind. I won't read it anyway.

99
