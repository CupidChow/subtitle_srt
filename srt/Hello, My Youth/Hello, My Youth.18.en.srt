Sir.

00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,320
Please let us have our original seats.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,420
I promise I'll study hard.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,610
Me, too.

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,490
Are you gonna make any more trouble?

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,030
I have to think about it.

7
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,950

What's going on?

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,980
I'm a non-resident student now.

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,540
What?

19
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,980
The school actually agreed?

20
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,440
I told my mother

21
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,210
that I wasn't accustomed to living on campus.

22
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,960
I couldn't eat or sleep well.

23
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,470
I hated the place

24
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,020
and the people.

25
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,830
My study was severely affected.

26
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,890
She agreed.

27
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,050
Guys, I am officially out of this shit hole

28
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,560
and free.

29
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,470
We'll see each other later.

00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,710
Goodbye.

We will walk you out.

32
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,380
Guys, I am back again.

33
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,640
Hey, why are you back so soon?

34
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,430
I was afraid

35
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,950
that you missed me too much.

36
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,500
[It was just seven hours.]

37
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,280
How is your hand?

38
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,060
It's good.

39
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,560
Don't mind me.

40
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,720
Let me unpack my things.

41
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,700
Are you in the dorm?

42
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,420
Listen to me carefully.

43
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,490
Just stay at school

44
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,470
and behave.

45
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,650
Don't come home as you want.

46
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,320
[This is so embarrassing.]

47
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,390
So cute.

49
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,550
[Don't even think about it.]

50
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,730
Pets are not allowed at school.

51
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,750
[Karma is here.]

52
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,420
[Mint?]

53
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,490
What's wrong with you?

54
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,490
What?

55
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,740
You made mints with chalk.

56
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,490
Where did you get that idea?

57
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,870
I didn't give it to you, neither did I say it was mint.

58
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,260
You do this kind of shit all the time.

59
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,760
I can't focus on my study now!

60
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,260
Study? You?

61
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,050
Who do you want to choke

62
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,380
with so much chalk dust?

63
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,900
Get out, both of you.

64
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,100
You two like to fight, don't you?

65
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,730
Go on.

66
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,730
Why are you looking at me?

67
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,060
Is there anything on my face?

68
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,000
Why the ground now?

69
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,560
Looking for answers?

70
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,010
Lift your head.

71
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,940
Why are you looking at the blackboard?

72
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,310
Read the book.

73
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,720
Let's move on to the next question.

74
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,430
What?

75
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,190
What do you want?

76
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600

Me, too.

80
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,590
Are you gonna make any more trouble?

81
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,130
I have to think about it.
