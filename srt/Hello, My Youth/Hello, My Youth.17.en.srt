31

90

To tell you the truth,

91
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,390
I asked Yuan Yuan to 
decorate the ladies' rooms as well.

92
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,450
Am I considerate enough?

93
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,750
Self-righteous.

94
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,730
What do you mean?

95
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,050
I was afraid you'd get angry 
and tried to make amends.

96
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,050
You make no sense.

97
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,770
I make no sense?

98
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,400
I did this for your own good.

99
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,550
You are so ungrateful.

100
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,530

Lin Gao Yuan is so good at
 playing with his left hand.

104

105
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,450
Lin Gao Yuan has rich experience.

106

Fan Zhen Dong has talent and is young.

107
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,690
Lin Gao Yuan will definitely win.

108
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,380
Fan Zhen Dong must be the winner.

109
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,710
Shut up!

110
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,840
Do you even know Ping Pong?

111
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,000
When, where and why did you

112
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,200

113
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,570
Right now and right here.

114
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,420

115
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,380
Why do you care?

116
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,530
Go, Lin Gao Yuan!

117
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,210
What are you two fighting about?

118
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,760
They are both Chinese.

119

It doesn't matter who wins.

120
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,220
It matters.

121
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,640
Lin Gao Yuan. Lin Gao Yuan.

122

123
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,700
Go to the classroom if you want a fight.

124

Stop making noises in the dorm.

125
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,820
You are bothering others.

126
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,360
A sudden loss of hearing in the left ear.

127
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,060
It's neurological dysfunction 

128
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,810
caused by recent pressure 

129
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,570
and lack of sleep.

130
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,830
Noise stimulation can also be one of the reasons.

131
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,680
Go to the hospital if you have time.

132
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,570
And rest more.

133
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,150
I'll write you a leave note.

134
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,150
Thanks.

135
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,540
It hurts.

136
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,360
Minor joint trauma.

137
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,610
Don't move around these days.

138
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,440
I'll write you a leave note.

139
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,720
Have some rest.

140
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,420
It's a blessing in disguise.

141
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,860

Doctor,

145
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,740
can you lift my right arm too?

146
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,390
No.

147
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,390
Can I take two more weeks off?

148
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,080
It really hurts.

149
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,150
A week is enough.

150
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,720
But it really hurts.

151
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,300
It's unbearable.

152
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,700
You can go to the infirmary
to take the pain-killer injection.

153
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,910
That's right.

154
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,230
Come to the infirmary with me later.

155
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,220
Never mind.

156
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,880
I was just stimulated

157
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,190
by something.

158
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,410
I just need some time.

159
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,910
Thank you, Doctor.

160
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:10,730
But how did you two

161
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,190
become like this?

162
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,160
The two of them did strenuous exercise in bed

163
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,870
and made the bed collapse.
