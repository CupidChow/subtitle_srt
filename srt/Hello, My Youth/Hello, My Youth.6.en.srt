Emergency!

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,610
Lend me your phone.

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,120
Why?

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:06,920
I was so close to finish

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,160
the sixth chapter.

6
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,690
Teachers are watching these days.

7
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,770
Your meals on me this month.

8
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,580
This is too high of a risk.

9
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:20,170
I can give it to you.

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,000
But, you have to read it in my way.

11
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,450

[Episode 5]

20
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,030
These are for you.

21
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,040
I have more if you need.

22
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,760
Where did you get all these treats?

23
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,910
They aren't for you.

24
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,500
I wonder, I'm as handsome and decent

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,740
as you are.

26
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,810
Why did nobody care about me?

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,030
I brought these myself.

28
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,100
There's a new hot pot restaurant near school.

29
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,650
Shall we order delivery tonight?

30
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,950
Yan is here.

31
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,230
Give me the book.

32
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,750
Jiang Hao Chen.

33
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,170
I gave you my heart.

34
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,390
But you...

35
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,410
You broke my heart

36
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,580
and teared it into pieces.

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,300
Have you no conscience?!

38
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,470
I won't give it to you.

39
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,350
Yuan Yuan, you are an expert.

40
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,000
Tell me.

41
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,480
Why?

42
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,430
Why does Jiang Hao Chen die in the end?

43
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,950
Why? Why? Why?

44
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,080
Read something else.

45
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,660
Thank you.

46
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,510
But, I will never love anyone anymore.

47
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,410
[He really is a drama queen.]

48
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,250
Yuan Yuan 

49
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,670
seems careless.

50
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,640
Can't believe she reads so many novels.

51
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,050
We have similar tastes.

52
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,890
She has a tiny bit of courtesy.

53
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,670
Act on it if you like her.

54
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,760
Stop it. I won't be your love rival.

55
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,920
She hates me but likes you.

56
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,840
I hope you two can be happy together.

57
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,360
You're over-thinking it.

58
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,650
Emergency!

59
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,880
Lend me your phone.

60
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,860
What?

61
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,210
I was so close to finish

62
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,470

65

This is too high of a risk.

66
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,550
I can give it to you.

67
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,370
But, you have to read it in my way.

68
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,730
What are you doing?

69
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,270
What are you doing?

70
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,980
A written self-criticism of 3,000 words.

71
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,680
Look what you are reading.

72
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,540
Total garbage.

73
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,430
This is poison to your mind.

74
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,100
Zheng Dian.

75
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,090
