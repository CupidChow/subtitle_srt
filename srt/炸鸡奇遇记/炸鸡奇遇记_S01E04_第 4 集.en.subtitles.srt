Boss?

3
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:29,297
THE DAY BEFORE

4
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,310
Cha Eun-woo!

5
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,863
I know it was too much to ask,
but isn't that the point of this thing?

6
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,242
Anyway, this is not how it works, huh?

7
00:01:58,868 --> 00:01:59,869
Okay.

8
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:05,792
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S A BOOKSTORE

9
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,647
Hello, sir?

10
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,026
Sir, hello?

11
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,534
Well, sorry to wake you up,
but it's urgent.

12
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,036
Hello, sir!

13
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,051
Oh no! What's happening?

14
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,600
Hi, is this 911?

15
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,685
There's a man here who's not breathing!

16
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,271
Yes, I'm at a bookstore.

17
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,523
Well, the name of the bookstore is

18
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,693
"I Can't Believe It's a Bookstore."

19
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,945
No, that's not my opinion.
That's the name.

20
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:20,074
Yes, it's urgent.
It's an old man. He's not waking up!

21
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,367
And he just did!

22
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:26,331
I'd appreciate your interest and support
in reviving the used book industry.

23
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,584
This is I Can't Believe It's a Bookstore.
Thank you.

24
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,464
Are you here for books?

25
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,759
Actually, I called you earlier.

26
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:44,390
I'm the one who called and asked
whether you had these books.

27
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:49,646
They are probably somewhere up there.

28
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,482
But I can't climb up a ladder, you know.

29
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,942
-Oh, right.
-Yes.

30
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,152
I'll do it, then.

31
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,542
DR. YOO IN-WON'S STUDY ON MECHANICS

32
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:48,997
Sir?

33
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,248
Oh no!

34
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,334
Mister!

35
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,253
I'm still inside!

36
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:56,921
Mister--

37
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,724
This is nice.

38
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:54,896
It was really stuffy being in a cool place
without direct sunlight.

39
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,648
Let's come out more often.

40
00:05:58,983 --> 00:05:59,859
Hang on.

41
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,944
You look a bit dry.

42
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,492
Look at me.

43
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,161
A premium starch syrup?

44
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,539
I'd be happy
with just the regular Ottogi ones.

45
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,376
It kept bothering me
how it was attracting bugs.

46
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,128
This keeps pests away.

47
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,714
It should feel much lighter
on your skin too.

48
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,675
It sure is light and refreshing.

49
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,804
I'm sorry I didn't bring it sooner.

50
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,182
Why would you say that?
You always do things for me.

51
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,683
Just let me keep doing this.

52
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,520
It makes me really happy.

53
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,026
Min-ah, you're blushing!

54
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,029
Spicy chicken nugget?

55
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,949
Stop teasing me.

56
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,541
Min-ah.

57
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,084
What is it?

58
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,297
Oh! You don't have to spend money
on this kind of stuff.

59
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,967
King-size sesame seeds
are really expensive.

60
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,101
It looks so good on you.

61
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,563
I don't think I deserve all this.

62
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,814
Yes, you do.

63
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,150
You're the most beautiful chicken nugget
there is.

64
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,240
There's a tofu.

65
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,870
Isn't it dangerous for a tofu
to not wear a helmet?

66
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,789
It must be suffocating.
He could do with a walk in the park.

67
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,377
-Oh my! Are you okay?
-Tofu?

68
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,504
Oh my goodness.

69
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,966
My tofu's become a silken tofu!

70
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,301
Oh no!

71
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,720
Don't worry.

72
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,014
We're not tofu.

73
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,725
It just breaks my heart.

74
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,103
Min-ah.

75
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,234
My blood sugar is too low.

76
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,697
I want some candy too.

77
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,453
But you can't eat candy.

78
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,122
I can. Give me one.

79
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,753
-But how can you--
-I said I can.

80
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,688
Mister!

81
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,608

82

MR. KIM

83
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,411
Hey, I'm out of battery. Be super quick!

84
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,622
Okay. I talked about that machine

85
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,291
over a drink with a colleague
from Dr. Yoo's lab!

86
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,294
I heard there was a research assistant
who joined after I quit.

87
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,421
Anyway, I managed to get his contact.

88
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,466
But Mr. Choi's phone is off,
so I called you!

89
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,302
Thanks, Mr. Kim! Text me his number!

90
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:20,017
Is this 911? I'm calling
from I Can't Believe It's a Bookstore.

91
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,230
Are you the one I spoke to earlier?

92
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,399
This isn't good.

93
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:36,993
It's okay.

94
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,663
It's okay. It's been a fruitful day today.

95
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,125
My blood sugar has dropped!

96
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,348

101
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,584
Holy fuck!

102
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,801
Not there.

103
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,057
Not there.

104
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,600
Are you

105
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,977

call me.

If you find it,

110
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,919
don't go inside it.

111
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,058
Do you have a daughter?

112
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,727
Or a son?

113
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,646
One daughter and one son.

114
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,108
So,

115
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,778
never go inside.

116
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,322
-Got it?
-Okay.

117
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,283
Big trouble.

118
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,249
Call me.

119
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,554
Quit drinking.

120
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,063

00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,828
How much are they?

124
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,725

00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,404
Foo?

132
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,949
-Food!
-Food.

133
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:45,908
Food.

134
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,576
The food we eat?

135
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,869
That food.

136
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,247

meal you're having there, huh?

140
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,808
I don't think that's soup.

141
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,228
You should chew your food.

142
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,760
A chicken nugget?

143
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,442
I'm curious,

144
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,361
but I don't want to know.

145
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,655
This is just how I like it.

146
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,282
I should go to the sauna.

Hello, sir. Yes.

150
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,047
Is it causing you trouble again?

151
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,091
What could be the problem?

152
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,176
I'm on my way.

153
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,722
The machine at Healing Shop in Bupyeong
is acting up again.

154
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,099
I'll pay them a visit.

155
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,185
Okay, please take care of it.

156
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,869
What about Dr. Yoo's research assistant?

157
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,332
He said he was free at lunch,

158
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,584
so I asked him to meet us at one o'clock.

159
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,044
Since we still have time,

160
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,840
I'll get changed
and head straight to the meeting place.

161
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:48,841
Okay.

162
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,676
You should get changed too.

163
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,428
Okay, I will.

164
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,681
It'll be noticeable this time
that you have changed.

165
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,072
-See you then.
-Yes, sir.

166
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,241
Daddy will be back.

167
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,409

and only one security camera.

171
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,465
How naive.

172
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,053
That's why you're about to lose
something valuable, man.

You'll get a phone call in a few days.

00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,829
Tell them you've been fully informed about
the coverage and that you understand.

181
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,999
They need to check everything,
so you'll get a lot of questions.

182
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,876
You just need to answer as you ticked.

183
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,169
Do I tick them all?

184
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,129
"No" for everything, please.

00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,632
The insurance coverage for this plan
is very simple.

186
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,133
More pain in death, more money.

187
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,136
It's a fair deal.
I hope you get paid a lot.

188
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:21,225
If I pretend to be really sick
before I die, will I get paid more?

189
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,434
That's a lame joke.

190
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,228
I could say the same about you.

191
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:30,526
So, you really did work
at that lab, right?

192
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,237
Of course I did.
I may be an insurance broker now,

193
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,906
but believe it or not,
I was a hopeless researcher.

194
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,617
Still with the lame jokes?

195
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,206
I can see why you got fire-- No.

196
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,834
That's why you left the job, right?

197
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,752
That's the reality of the science field.

198
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,963
I'd appreciate any kind of information.

199
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,340
Please tell us something now.

200
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,050
I'll be honest with you.

201
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,513
I was hired
as Dr. Yoo's research assistant, but…

202
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,392
I could tell right away why they hired me.

203
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,020
He was obsessed with some metal junk,

204
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,231
so there was nothing
an assistant could do.

205
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,651
He just hired me
to qualify for some government funding,

206
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,070
so I got canned when that was cut.

207
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,365
I didn't have any regrets
because I did nothing.

208
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,869
About the metal junk, I mean,

209
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:27,749
while studying the machine,
did Dr. Yoo get any kind of results?

210
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,209
Not that I know of.

211
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,171
-There's got to be something--
-Hang on.

212
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:36,800
Here.

213
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,387
This machine is
what Dr. Yoo was obsessed with.

214
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,307
He kept saying some delusional stuff

215
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,727
about how this drawing and the machine
are from 200 years ago.

216
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,770
But what's surprising is

217
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,981
he was right.

218
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,066
How did you verify that?

219
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,236
Thanks to Prof. Wang Jong-geun
of Authentic Masterpieces, K1 University.

220
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,487
Wang Jong-geun?

221
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,697
It's old craft paper.

222
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,240
A crap paper?

223
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,742
No, craft paper.

224
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,952
It's used to make a fan.

225
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,871
Very durable.

226
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:10,042
But this one seems to be
about 200 years old.

227
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,251
Really?

228
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,503
Is it a drawing or some scribbles?

229
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,590
It even has a seal here
as well as some thumbprints.

230
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,258
I think it's some kind of a joke.

231
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,677
-Do I really have to estimate its value?
-Yes.

232
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,722
The machine from the drawing
is actually at our lab.

233
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,806
What kind of machine?

234
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,392
-A machine to look at.
-A machine to look at?

235
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,727
Yes, we just look at it.

236
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,939
Is Dr. Yoo fucking with me or what?

237
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,315
Fuck, I don't know. Bye.

238
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,608
Hold on a sec.

239
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:38,862
Same seals. See?

240
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,365
-Why is this seal here?
-What's wrong?

241
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,533
This is Jeong Hyo-bong's seal.

242
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,451
Jeong Hyo-bong?

243
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,369
JEONG HYO-BONG

244
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,411
Who is Jeong Hyo-bong?

245
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,623
Born into a prominent Namin family
in the 15th year of Jeongjo's reign,

246
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,375
he was Joseon's brightest prodigy.

247
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,919
What's with the random history class?

248
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:58,006
There was a prime minister in his family,
and his father was a Silhak scholar.

249
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,510
King Jeongjo wanted to hire his father,
but he wasn't interested in politics.

250
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,720
Why? Because he was a Catholic.

251
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,806
His son is Jeong Hyo-bong,

252
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,475
who mastered reading and writing
as he learned to speak,

253
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,853
and at the age of five,
he wrote poems and started to draw.

254
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,022
His works were so outstanding.

255
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,109
It's even written in the Veritable Records
of the Joseon Dynasty

256
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:20,362
that Jeongjo called him into the palace
and exchanged poems with him.

257
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,573
He was literally a prodigy
walking the road to success.

258
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,617
A guy like that made a doodle like this?

259
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,035
We don't know if it was him.

260
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,290
Because, as Queen Dowager Jeongsun served
as regent after Jeongjo passed away,

261
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:36,420
the conservative ruling faction
began a full-scale Catholic persecution.

262
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,756
Jeong Hyo-bong's father was executed
during the Sinyu Persecution,

263
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,174
and the rest of his family

264
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,678
was either demoted to the lowest class
or taken to be government slaves.

265
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,014
But there's no record of him since then.

266
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,349
So what you're saying is

267
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:54,646
we can assume that this drawing
is from 200 years ago, right?

268
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,441
Putting aside what the craft paper is,

269
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,485
why should I care whether the drawing
or that metal junk is older?

270
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,738
And think about Jeong Hyo-bong's seal.

271
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,032
The owner of the seal
was demoted to a slave.

272
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:08,368
I don't care how the seal
ended up on the paper.

273
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:12,789
But Dr. Yoo became even more obsessed
after he heard that, didn't he?

274
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,541
How did you know?

275
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:19,171
He got even crazier after that point,
arguing that there must be another machine

276
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,798
and that he had to have both
to make them work or something.

277
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,759
So he made a machine tracker.

278
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,968
A machine tracker?

279
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:29,473
It's another machine that responds
to these machines to track them.

280
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,310
Actually, Dr. Yoo's nephew
spurred him on with that.

281
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,728
His nephew?

282
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,647
Come to think of it,
I wasn't the only research assistant.

283
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,691
Technically, he wasn't a researcher,

284
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,611
but at some point, he started
to spend a lot of time in the lab.

285
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,489
The younger one was a smart kid,

286
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,700
but he followed his machine-crazy uncle
around until he went crazy too.

287
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,452
I don't know where he is now.

288
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,038
Dr. Yoo said he was quite a prodigy.

289
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:56,291
But in my eyes, he was just a nutjob.

290
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,586
He kept saying he was 22,
but he had the face of a 50-year-old.

291
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,383
So Dr. Yoo was looking
for the machine we have now,

292
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,219
and we are looking for the one he had.

293
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,221
To be exact, we are looking for Dr. Yoo.

294
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,973
Maybe he has changed
into something as well.

295
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:15,143
Why do they have different marks
if they do the same thing?

296
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,939
Exactly. Is it some kind of brand mark?

297
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,357
They could be characters.

298
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,785
-The machine.
-Min-ah!

299
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,956
Min-ah!

300
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,252
-Min-ah!
-Min-ah!

301
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,004
-Min-ah!
-Min-ah!

302
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,217
Min-ah!

303
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,970
-Min-ah!
-Min-ah!

304
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,223
Min-ah!

305
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:55,767
Min-ah!

306
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,353
Min-ah!

307
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,021
Min-ah!

308
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,461
I thought it could only
turn things into humans.

309
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,134
A mirror

310
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,012
shouldn't be like this.

311
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,473
Why are you lying?

312
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,584
Where are you going?

313
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,129
The office.

314
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,048
I'm heading there too.

315
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,301
One of us must be facing
the wrong direction, right?

316
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,401
Min-ah's not here?

317
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:17,325
Hey, the camera at the door is broken.
What happened? Did you know that?

318
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,203
Where has the machine gone?

319
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,040
Did we get robbed?

320
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,668
But there's nothing to take in here.

321
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,628
Did they just grab that useless machine?

322
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,130
Darn it, I'm calling the cops.

323
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:31,840
There's nothing to take?

324
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,135
Really?

325
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,179
Just the scrap metal we have
would be worth a lot!

326
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:39,848
Why are you so upset?

327
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,516
Let's say there's nothing to take.

328
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,936
Does it make sense
they just grabbed whatever they could?

329
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,856
If robbers were that impulsive,
what would happen?

330
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,899
They'd end up getting caught.

331
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,568
Robbers should be calm!

332
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:54,112
Why are you worried
about some robber's personality?

333
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:57,657
What do you mean
there's nothing to take in here?

334
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,576
There is! My life!

335
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,287
My life belongs to me

336
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,707
My life was here!

337
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,375
It was here.

338
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,046
Fine. Then I'll report
that your life has been stolen.

339
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,297
No need for that.

340
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,134
Mr. Ko broke it while moving it.

341
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,262
I did, didn't I?

342
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:23,224
When will you stop being
so careless at work?

343
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,018
Follow me.

344
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,555
You're going to die soon.

345
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,641
You will die,

346
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,435
but you won't be dead.

347
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:09,729
Because now,

348
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,940
I'm going to become you.

349
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,625
What? Go away!

350
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,044
Hey! Go away!
