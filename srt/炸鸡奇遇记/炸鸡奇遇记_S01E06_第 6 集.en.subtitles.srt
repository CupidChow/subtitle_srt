1
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:39,956
Stop, you bastard!

2
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,460
Stop!

3
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,473
"Vindicate me, my God, and plead my cause
against an unfaithful nation."

4
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,933
"Rescue me from those
who are deceitful and wicked."

5
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,936
"You are God my stronghold.
Why have you rejected me?"

6
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,773
"Why must I go about mourning,
oppressed by the enemy?"

7
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,317
"Send me your light and faithful care.
Let them lead me."

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,320
"Let them bring me to your holy mountain,
to where you dwell."

9
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:14,574
"Then I will go to the altar of God,
to God, my joy and my delight."

10
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:18,787
"I will praise you with the lyre,
O God, my God."

11
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,961
I'm not religious, but amen.

12
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,214
I've met the Lord.

13
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:34,302
Whoever you saw was just a poor sinner
before he met the Lord.

14
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,306
-That man is only 25 years old.
-What?

15
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,517
The herbal medicine I gave him went wrong,

16
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,187
so I can't blame him
for harboring so much hatred.

17
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,482
It's the Lord's will.

18
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,986
I understand
why you're acting like this, Mr. Choi.

19
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,741
First, let's take a seat.

20
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,875
You should unload the remaining bullets.

21
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,837
-I fired four times, right?
-Yes.

22
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,463
That was all.

23
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,714
Put it in here.

24
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,347
Now, come this way. Here.

25
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,309
I'm the one who took the machine
and the chicken nugget.

26
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,146
Well, I stole them.

27
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:27,981
I am sorry.

28
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,566
Please go on.

29
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,448
This is…

30
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:41,035
This is the drawing we saw
on Mr. Du Don-man's phone.

31
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,037
He thought the drawing and the machine

32
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:47,542
were nothing but useless scrap paper
and chunks of metal.

33
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,669
I used to think the same, actually.

34
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,839
My father would show me this drawing
and tell me a story,

35
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,509
but it was such a boring fable,
and fables are made-up stories anyway.

36
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,513
But once it was verified
that this was actually drawn 200 years ago

37
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,141
and my uncle checked
the material of the machine,

38
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,603
he began to believe that fable.

39
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,355
I came to believe it too.

40
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,399
However…

41
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,364
All this crap ever does is blow up.

42
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,658
We need to find the other machine.

43
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,703
According to what your father said,

44
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,373
we'll need both machines
to find out anything about them.

45
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,750
Find it where?

46
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,045
It'd be quicker to make a machine tracker.

47
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,465
Yes. That's it!

48
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,342
I can definitely make that.

49
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,387
Call me once you have, man.

50
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,514
I'm out of here.

51
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,017
Show some respect.

52
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,062
You're only 23.

53
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,439
Actually, I'm 22.

54
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,236
A few months later, my uncle succeeded
in making a machine tracker.

55
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,612
What now?

56
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,864
You've actually made that?

57
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,616
I mean, that's…

58
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,666
Damn it! Mom!

59
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,669
And that night, he went missing.

60
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,592
If Uncle went there
with the machine tracker,

61
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,345
the machine had to be
somewhere around there.

62
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:26,015
I was convinced his disappearance
was connected to the machine.

63
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,812
I came to think that my father's story
was true to some degree.

64
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,647
Have you seen anything like this?

65
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,483
-I did all I could for a few days.
-I don't know.

66
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,652
But I couldn't find the machine there.

67
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,821
I saw that some retail spaces are empty.

68
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:44,659
Did anyone vacate the building between
the fourth and the seventh of the month?

69
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:48,579
Residents are always moving in and out.
I can't name them all.

70
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,250
But recently, a pizza shop closed down.

71
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,544
Could you print out
everyone's contact details?

72
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,087
Why? Are you a detective?

73
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,049
That's personal information.
I can't just give it to you.

74
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,636
It's a missing persons case,
so please cooperate.

75
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,224
Get some food in you, Detective.

76
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:17,358
I had to find the machine
that was removed from the shut-down lab

77
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,611
and start all over again by myself.

78
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,605
Fuck.

79
00:05:56,272 --> 00:06:00,318
I regretted not having helped my uncle
because I thought it was all meaningless.

80
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,987
Two years later,
when the tracker was almost complete…

81
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,121
Three, seven, two, four.

82
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,208
Four, five, eight, four…

83
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,793
For fuck's sake.

84
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,130
It's somewhere here.

85
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,179
NOBLEMAN'S CHICKEN NUGGET

86
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,014
NOBLEMAN'S PIZZA

87
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,183
That couldn't have been a coincidence.

88
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,573
The machine wasn't there,

89
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,577
and the shop and the house were a mess.

90
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,539
We work at a company nearby
called More than Machines.

91
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,958
Why do you want the delivery guy?

92
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,711
Well, he left some kind of machine
outside our office…

93
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,548
That's when I overheard your conversation.

94
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,174
-A person--
-No, actually…

95
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,843
More than Machines?

96
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,975
After I worked around the clock to fix
the tracker, I went to More than Machines…

97
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:19,355
But why are you so obsessed
with the machines?

98
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,900
This isn't something
that can be resolved by humans.

99
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,529
It can't be understood by any
of our Lord's insignificant creations.

100
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,908
If this is Satan's scheme,
should we keep silent and conform?

101
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:31,993
No way.

102
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,953
Then who do you think can resolve this?

103
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,622
This matter is sacred,
not to be handled by humans.

104
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,624
Only the Lord can resolve this.

105
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,043
Who is the Lord's messenger? Who is it?

106
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,839
The fact that my family is involved,
that I was born a genius,

107
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,425
that Dr. Yoo's my uncle,
that I had the herbal medicine,

108
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,720
and that I met the Lord as a result.
Could this all be a coincidence?

109
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,888
All of this…

110
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,933
is the Lord's will.

111
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,312
Did I make myself clear?

112
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,813
Yes.

113
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,232
-Do you agree?
-What?

114
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,567
Yes, of course.

115
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,156
It seems that I nearly shot
a 25-year-old Lord's messenger to death.

116
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,658
I apologize.

117
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,369
-Amen.
-Not religious, but amen.

118
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,747
Now I will tell you my story.

119
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,876
Actually, I was contemplating
retirement back then.

120
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,960
Retirement?

121
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,296
Scientists also need
some sort of inspiration.

122
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:29,634
But I had unexplained lethargy
that wouldn't go away.

123
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,678
When I was about to let go of everything,

124
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,098
I came across that machine.

125
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,728
But it wasn't a machine.
It was more like a force of nature.

126
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:41,896
To humanity,

127
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:46,067
science was something
akin to a convenience store.

128
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,654
A little store we built nearby
for our own convenience.

129
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,614
Something we can live without.

130
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,074
However,

131
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,078
I decided to take on
an impossible challenge.

132
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,665
Some said it was nothing but metal junk,

133
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,292
and one by one, they all left.

134
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,258
But I didn't mind at all.

135
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,301
I guess I wanted to have it all to myself.

136
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,846
It'd be quicker to make a machine tracker.

137
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,058
Yes. That's it!

138
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,812
Have you ever looked into the eyes
of an old, retired fisherman

139
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,773
collecting his catch from the net?

140
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:30,528
Oh, how those eyes shone
like he was roaming the ocean once more.

141
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,029
That is what happened to me.

142
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:43,040
Why did I try to conquer the machine?
I should've waited until it accepted me.

143
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,514
But I was blind then.

144
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,401
NOBLEMAN'S PIZZA

145
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,925
I just wanted to check
if it was the same machine.

146
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,012
I couldn't think of anything else
that might happen.

147
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,499
Just like that,

148
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,377
I lived for two years as a caterpillar.

149
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,253
-A caterpillar.
-A caterpillar.

150
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,089
-Larva?
-Larva.

151
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,718
BAEKJUNG CHICKEN NUGGET

152
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,178
CLOSED FOR BREAK

153
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:35,820
Are you serious?

154
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,823
A customer left that food behind.

155
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,449
I think they'll come back for it.

156
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,417
You too?

157
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,502
Even though we made that, it's not ours.

158
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,504
Because that's been paid for.

159
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,132
You're not listening.

160
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,561
Are you serious?

161
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,312
You guys are not human!

162
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,256
Wow, gizzard!

163
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,467
Raw gizzard!

164
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,604
Don't worry.

165
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,564
We also eat raw food sometimes.

166
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,858
I'm sorry.

167
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,110
-We'll make a new one.
-We're fine.

168
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,362
No, we ate up all your nuggets,
so let us--

169
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,657
We're not terrified because you ate
our chicken nuggets, you know.

170
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,326
Anyway, I will remake your--

171
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,661
I said we're fine.
We hate chicken nuggets.

172
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,427
Why are we making chicken nuggets?

173
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,553
Too late for regret.

174
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,347
Our chicken nuggets amazed people.

175
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,599
And I was amazed to see them amazed.

176
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:32,770
"Delicious food seems to make them happy,
so let's make delicious food."

177
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:36,732
Selling food makes us money,
and we make a living with that money.

178
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,235
I mean, why chicken nuggets of all foods?

179
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,737
Chicken, duck, horse, or beef,
does that even matter?

180
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,739
What matters more is

181
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,991
why we are doing this here.

182
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,326
What if

183
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,162
we hadn't gone with chicken nuggets?

184
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:51,914
Chicken nuggets?

185
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,085
But there's another chicken nugget place
just across the street.

186
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,462
They also just opened recently.

187
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,297
Oh, is that so?

188
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,632
Yes.

189
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,885
Talk about business ethics.
That might not be the nicest move.

190
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,972
But that's the only trade we have, so--

191
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,849
Maybe it would be better for you.

192
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,184
Why do you think
the properties are cheap here?

193
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,894
There's not much foot traffic.

194
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,772
Go to the next neighborhood.
You'll find nice properties.

195
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,816
No. It has to be this area.

196
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,861
Have you met a fortune teller?
Did they recommend this spot?

197
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,612
-Yes.
-Come on!

198
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,698
Believing that kind of stuff
will only bring…

199
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,907
Great success.

200
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,368
Goodbye, then.

201
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,536
-Bye.
-Okay.

202
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,128
You're selling the same shit as me
right across the street?

203
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,589
Let me see your boss! Right now!

204
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,299
Write your name and wait outside.

205
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,842
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

206
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,469
How many people?

207
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,597
-I came alone.
-Then write "one."

208
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,391
The Arabic numeral "one."

209
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,479
KIM BAE-DAL
ONE

210
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,568
-Kim Bae-dal, one person.
-Me! That's me!

211
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,570
I'm Kim Bae-dal!

212
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:08,949
I am Kim Bae-dal!

213
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:13,078
I'm Kim Bae-dal!

214
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,080
You sell the same shit as me
across the street?

215
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,833
Let me talk to your boss. Right now!

216
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,792
I'm the boss.

217
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,338
-You're selling the same shit as me?!
-Yes.

218
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,672
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

219
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,057
What's that sound?

220
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,771
Fuck, I can't do it.

221
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:43,776
What's this?

222
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,695
What's this?

223
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,531
The chicken? Or the machine?

224
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,741
Or the chicken nugget?

225
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:51,909
This is a machine?

226
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,328
Do you know what it is?

227
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,043
How would I know what this is? What is it?

228
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,963
-Why do you care if you don't know?
-Would you tell me if I do?

229
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,926
-So you know?
-I said I don't.

230
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,392
-It's a secret process.
-A secret process?

231
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,604
Put a chicken in it and press the button,
then out comes a delicious nugget.

232
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,950
Are you picking a fight?

233
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,243
Didn't you start all this?

234
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,494
Shit, that's right.

235
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:52,052
Everyone was talking about how I failed
at my research and had depression,

236
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,097
and that's why I chose to disappear.

237
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:56,807
That's not true.

238
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,851
How did you know Min-ah turned into--

239
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,770
My story is about to be continued.

240
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,941
I was locked inside the machine
as a caterpillar.

241
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,861
That's the fastest shutdown
I've ever seen.

242
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,904
Maybe it's because of the name.

243
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,282
I mean, why would a nobleman make pizzas?

244
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:17,953
A name like "Vincenzo's Pizza"
would have led to a jackpot.

245
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,121
Fucking prick.

246
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:23,042
And the next day,
I was moved to a tiny, little apartment.

247
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:27,588
However, I was thankful
that our pizza-man-turned-builder

248
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,548
left the TV on whenever he went to work.

249
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,259
A drama channel at that.

250
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,932
The TV welcomes me home again.

251
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,684
He was a lonely man.

252
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,644
Those dramas were his only friends.

253
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,982
He was truly a remarkable man who watched
Be Melodramatic over and over again.

254
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,654
Cheers.

255
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,533
After a while,
I had almost memorized all the lines.

256
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,828
That drama is a must-watch,
and it's more fun the second time around.

257
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,247
I think we're straying too far off-topic.

258
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,167
I lived like that for two years,
stuck on that machine.

259
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,004
Surprisingly, my caterpillar body
didn't grow or die.

260
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,839
You should sleep too.

261
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,770
Time passed by.

262
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:29,191
Then he opened a chicken nugget joint
with his hard-earned money.

263
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,317
NOBLEMAN'S CHICKEN NUGGET

264
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,624
Fuck chicken nuggets!

265
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,836
But business doesn't
always work out as you hoped.

266
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,712
Then one day…

267
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,881
Put in a chicken and out comes a nugget?

268
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:00,097
That crazy bitch.
How dare she mock me with some bullcrap?

269
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,683
How dare you trick a nobleman!

270
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,811
I don't see a fucking button in here!

271
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:09,189
You are dead meat
if this doesn't work, damn it.

272
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,109
What?

273
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,117
What the hell!

274
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,528
Let's go! Let's fucking do this!

275
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,071
Do it!

276
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,161
A zombie bird?

277
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,330
That's absurd.

278
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,831
It is absurd.

279
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,833
Just like your yellow pants.

280
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,129
But I'm telling the truth.

281
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,465
I've seen and gone through
all of it myself.

282
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:03,011
The chicken nugget, the caterpillar,
and the zombie bird.

283
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,515
Was it that zombie bird
that killed him, then?

284
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:10,269
I overheard your conversation
and found out he was dead.

285
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,520
He died?

286
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,314
Is he really dead?

287
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,733
Yes. I heard that it was a hit-and-run.

288
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,950
Are you crying?

289
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,747
He was my friend like no other.

290
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,162
Enough of that.

291
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,621
You can stop.

292
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,040
So,

293
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,918
that's why he couldn't come back.

294
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,097
What was that?

295
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,267
What the fuck is going on?

296
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,867
More than Machines.

297
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,121
More than Machines.

298
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,247
MORE THAN MACHINES

299
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,672
They're going to think
I'm a fucking nutjob.

300
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,927
Fuck. Should I bring that crazy bird?
