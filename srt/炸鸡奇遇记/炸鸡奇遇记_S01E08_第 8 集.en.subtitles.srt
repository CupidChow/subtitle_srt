1
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,876
200 YEARS AGO, JOSEON

2
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,193
You scoundrels!

3
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,196
You must be the purple monsters!

4
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,657
Just because I ran off
unlike a true nobleman,

5
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:18,828
do I look like someone who would die

6
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,414
at the hands of you animals?

7
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:25,168
My father is Jeong In-seon of Songdo
who was considered

8
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,755
the greatest scholar of Joseon
until he was executed by the cursed Kims!

9
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:33,760
And I exchanged poems with the king
at the age of five.

10
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,096
Gyeongbok Palace was my playground.

11
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:39,349
And I would piss
in the Gyeonghoeru pond as a child!

12
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,771
I am… Jeong Hyo-bong.

13
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:53,488
Almost late for clock-out time.
What a productive day I had.

14
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,240
Now, let's go home, everyone!

15
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,617
Oh shit! You scared me.

16
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,953
Excuse us.

17
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,288
You should've said that
before I turned around.

18
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,206
Who are you?

19
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,125
As you can see, we are

20
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,043
humans.

21
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,091
Oh, I mean…

22
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,845
a group of four.

23
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,685
I can see that, and I'm so damn puzzled.
What's your deal?

24
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:24,602
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,230
We'll just look around a bit.

26
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,735
What? Are you realtors?

27
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,862
Why look around?

28
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,113
Who are you

29
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,573
guys?

30
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,658
I apologize
for our lack of social skills--

31
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,910
What do I care if you lack social skills?

32
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,371
Who are you? Why are you here?

33
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,623
That's right!

34
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,293
People usually talk about that first!

35
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,461
Well, we sell chicken nuggets.

36
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,549
What the fuck? Am I high or something?

37
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,677
But we're not here
to sell chicken nuggets.

38
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,637
We're just looking for a machine.

39
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,514
Are you in charge here?

40
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,226
No, my boss is on a business trip.
What machine are you looking for?

41
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,399
Well, it's a sensitive matter.

42
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,862
You're driving me crazy!

43
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,572
I need to go home. Just tell me!

44
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,823
Don't get me wrong.

45
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,534
I'm just curious because it's pretty.

46
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,703
It's this one.

47
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,248
It was here. What on earth is it?

48
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,418
Where is it now?

49
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,045
What does it do anyway?

50
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,088
I don't know.
I just think it looks pretty.

51
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,548
It's just an ordinary cabinet.

52
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,800
I find it pretty. So where is it?

53
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,594
Why ask me? Ask the guy who stole it.

54
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,511
Stole it?

55
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,055
It's been stolen.

56
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,266
Why would anyone steal it
if they don't know how to use it?

57
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,852
They're thieves.
They don't care about manuals.

58
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,520
Did you report this?

59
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,690
Wait, why do I have to answer
all of your questions?

60
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,859
Also, this company doesn't sell machines.

61
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,238
You're making me work overtime.
How are you going to make up for it?

62
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,699
CALL THE POLICE IF WE'RE NOT BACK
MOUNT 21, CHANGCHEONG-RI

63
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,078
When did your boss go on the trip?

64
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,663
I got a text this morning and…

65
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,830
I'm answering again!

66
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,791
Let's go, guys.

67
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,376
'Twas entertaining!

68
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,254
What? "Twas entertaining"?

69
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,757
Forgive me.

70
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,509
We had fun, sir.

71
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,763
That's not what I meant!

72
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,766
That wasn't a regular theft.

73
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,686
Wait, so you're saying this is--

74
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,528
Hey.

75
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,947
It's true that it's been stolen.

76
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,117
He wouldn't have gone on a trip
if his kid had turned into a nugget.

77
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,119
He wrote that it might be dangerous,

78
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:50,039
meaning he went to get the machine back,
and he might run into danger there.

79
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:50,957
Hello?

80
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,044
Then there are at least two groups
who know about our machine.

81
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,964
The owner of More than Machines
is desperate but innocent.

82
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,466
What matters now
is the intention of the thieves.

83
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,970
If they know what it can do,
they must be up to no good.

84
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,556
That's the thing.
Humans are not yet considerate enough.

85
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,434
And we've been imitating them
all this time.

86
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,853
Shouldn't we wait for at least two days?

87
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,354
That's not being considerate.

88
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,316
It's also our fault
that humans ended up using the machines,

89
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,485
so we need to find them and stop them
before they make more mistakes.

90
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,654
Kwangdae is right.
Let's go to this address.

91
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,072
We must find the machine first.

92
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,870
But hey.

93
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,204
What?

94
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,540
Even if we find it,

95
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,170
will those inconsiderate humans
give it back to us?

96
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,130
How do we get it back if they don't?

97
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,673
Kill them all?

98
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,520
Did you tell it to attack me?

99
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,273
No.

100
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,859
It's just programmed that way.

101
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,569
When does it shoot?

102
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,447
When it thinks it should.

103
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,449
Of its own accord.

104
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,714
Bulgogi or spicy pork?

105
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,383
-I'll have the pork.
-Pork.

106
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,177
-I'll have bulgogi.
-Bulgogi.

107
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,139
-Bulgogi for me.
-Bulgogi--

108
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,182
-You can have pork. I--
-I--

109
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,643
-I'm happy with bulgogi.
-Bul--

110
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,646
-I'll--
-I'm fine!

111
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,523
Share.

112
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:22,817
Share.

113
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,953
You smile a lot.

114
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,621
I didn't know you were that type.

115
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,915
Young people know how to smile too.

116
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,376
We just have no reason to.

117
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,752
How eloquent.

118
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,631
Tell us the story, then.
The fable passed down in your family

119
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,884
that your dad used to tell you.

120
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,177
It's not a fable.

121
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:53,848
There are animals in it, but I'm not sure
what animals the purple monsters are.

122
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,516
A folktale, then.

123
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,476
Yes, a folktale.

124
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,228
No, it's a true story.

125
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,232
Year 1801,
the first year of King Sunjo's reign.

126
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:07,862
Queen Jeongsun, who served as regent,
ordered the prohibition of Catholicism.

127
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,115
"Catholics are beasts
who follow heretic beliefs

128
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,826
and corrupt our moral principles,

129
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,078
so enlighten them and convert them."

130
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,081
"If they don't repent,
they shall be executed for treason."

131
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:23,127
That night, outside the Seosomun Gate,
knelt Jeong In-seon,

132
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,172
who had King Jeongjo's favor
and held important posts.

133
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:30,801
He was a Silhak scholar
and a devout Catholic

134
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,763
who dreamed of giving
practical help to the people.

135
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,140
So he stepped down from his office

136
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,559
and dedicated himself
to fulfilling that dream.

137
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,604
And even in the face of death,
his resolution didn't waver.

138
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:46,609
After his execution, his family
was dispersed to distant regions.

139
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,862
Women were sent to the provinces
as government slaves,

140
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,658
and men barely preserved their lives
and were demoted

141
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:57,078
from noblemen to commoners or lowborns.

142
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,624
Among those men was the son
of Jeong In-seon, Jeong Hyo-bong,

143
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,960
who was called the prodigy of the time.

144
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,296
Thank you for the meal.
And you don't have to bring food anymore.

145
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,007
Then how will you get yourself fed?

146
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,301
With only one mouth to feed,
I'll find a way.

147
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,263
I've been here a while.
I shouldn't be a sponger.

148
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,810
But thanks to you, the village kids
are learning to read and write.

149
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:21,978
Let us feed you, sir.

150
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,563
An equal world will come.

151
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,856
They should be ready for that.

152
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,025
And please don't call me "sir."

153
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,652
But I'm just a lowly commoner.

154
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,364
Twerp, if you are a lowly commoner,
then I am too, and so is the king.

155
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,783
Gosh, don't say such a thing!

156
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,912
Just let me bring your meals,
although it isn't much.

157
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,791
It's tough these days to get by.
That's why bandits are everywhere.

158
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,335
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

159
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,184
Oh my.

160
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,644
Sir!

161
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:07,231
Jeez, you might hurt yourself doing that!

162
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,485
Goodness, wood chopping
isn't for everyone.

163
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,155
I'm fine. I should get used to doing this.

164
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,407
You'll get hurt, seriously.

165
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,869
I'm always bringing you firewood.
You don't have to do this.

166
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,538
Wimp, I can get my own firewood.

167
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,374
Just leave it to those
who are used to doing this, okay?

168
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,753
If you really want to help,

169
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,506
go up there for fresh air
and bring back some twigs.

170
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,676
All right, then. I'll do that.

171
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,054
Oh man.

172
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,184
Gosh!

173
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,895
-Stick to the hiking trail!
-Okay.

174
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,400
This is not good.

175
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,654
Is it meant to be this hard to tell

176
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,615
if I'm on the right trail?

177
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,873
Oh, my back.

178
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,167
What's with this wind?

179
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,346
Wait, what is…

180
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,487
It seems ridiculous, right?

181
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,489
Yes, I understand.

182
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,241
I'll just ask one question.

183
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,952
How long have you lived in this village?

184
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,913
I'm 30 years old, so 30 years.

185
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,249
I'm the same age as him,

186
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,417
so 30 years as well.

187
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,461
Have you ever been outside this village?

188
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,587
Not once.

189
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,338
Why would we do that?

190
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,674
How big is the Qing Empire
compared to Joseon?

191
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:41,677
Any idea?

192
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,305
It's hundreds of times bigger.

193
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,558
How many countries are out there
as big as the Qing Empire?

194
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,477
Countless.

195
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,896
-Gosh, really?
-Is that so?

196
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:56,025
What you see here is not that surprising
in the big world out there.

197
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,945
I wondered if I was destined
to make fans for the rest of my life.

198
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,867
But it seems my father, who's in heaven,
is giving me a chance.

199
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,913
A chance to change the world.

200
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:12,291
Wimp? Twerp? Are those even human names?

201
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,335
We're not dogs, are we?

202
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,755
We are all precious, all equal humans.

203
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,341
So why don't we have
the same opportunities?

204
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,721
Well then,
I'll do whatever you tell me to do.

205
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,225
Then I should get myself a new name.

206
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,893
-Right?
-Right.

207
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,397
Stamp this.

208
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,651
In this small thatched cottage
in the small land of Joseon,

209
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,487
we will make an oath for a new world.

210
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,490
And the outcome of this

211
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,201
will be remarkable.

212
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,913
-Go on, stamp it.
-Okay.

213
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,004
A new world is sure to come.

214
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,653
My dear husband.

215
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,285
Why are you dressed up like that
when you never even go out on a stroll?

216
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,663
I like this.

217
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,667
Why don't you go out pheasant hunting?

218
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,254
Or you can visit a courtesan house
and listen to them sing.

219
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,632
If you spend some intimate time
with the girls,

220
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,552
wouldn't it liven you up a little?

221
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,887
I like this.

222
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,598
Then

223
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,143
it doesn't matter if it's day or night.

224
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,604
Let's have some time together.

225
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,898
In our room. Okay?

226
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:03,485
Perhaps we can change
into something more comfortable…

227
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,743
If you dislike me, at least bring
a concubine to carry the family line!

228
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,245
Your father-in-law is here.
Please calm down, miss!

229
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,542
This bitch called me "miss"?

230
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,295
Are you assuming that I'm still a virgin?

231
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,339
Can't you see the binyeo in my hair?

232
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,135
Why am I carrying this? Am I a widow?

233
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:32,097
Even widows would've done it
with their husbands at least once!

234
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,850
You're right.

235
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,519
-I'm a virgin.
-Please forgive me, miss--

236
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,604
Oh fuck!

237
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,897
You nasty bitch.

238
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,359
I'll make your husband a eunuch today.

239
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,276
Get over here!

240
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,271
Wait.

241
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,482
So it was real?

242
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,954
Oh man.

243
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,583
The world is really going to change.

244
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,044
Hey, what he said was all true!

245
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,087
You look like me.

246
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,134
Wait. You are me!

247
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,429
Then who am I?

248
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,222
Put him in here.

249
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,348
-Okay.
-Okay.

250
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,062
We're not going to hurt you,
so spend some time

251
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,730
in another body, okay?

252
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,274
We're just borrowing your body
for a good cause.

253
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,235
-Really?
-Yes.

254
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,322
Please go in.

255
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,854
What?

256
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,653
What is this?

257
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,113
What is it?

258
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,615
Sir?

259
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,784
What did you turn him into?

260
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,453
-A stone.
-A stone?

261
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,371
A stone.

262
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,126
What are you talking about?

263
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,461
You can't turn a man into a stone!

264
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,880
Don't raise your voice, fucker.

265
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:52,840
Sir!

266
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,342
You're older than me, idiot,
so stop calling me "sir."

267
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,970
Wait. Am I older now?

268
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,181
Young Master!

269
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,308
Young Master!

270
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,394
Hey, I'm here!

271
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:08,730
Both of you.

272
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,525
I hated your good looks.

273
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,734
What?

274
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:16,029
It disgusts me to see you lowly commoners
with good-looking faces.

275
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,114
Young Master!

276
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,450
Hey, kill these two,

277
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,494
and dump those objects in the river.

278
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,454
-Yes, sir!
-You fucking piece of shit.

279
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,623
You scum will pay for kidnapping him.

280
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,708
Beat them up!

281
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:47,978
Honey?

282
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,691
What happened?

283
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,782
Come to our room.

284
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,203
Our room? What for?

285
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,624
To do husband-and-wife things, of course.

286
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,835
A nobleman should have at least 12 sons.

287
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,047
He must've gotten hurt badly.

288
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,382
Who cares?

289
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,384
Should I prepare a bath?

290
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,471
No need. There's no time to waste.

291
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,556
I need to hurry
before he changes his mind.

292
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,894
As soon as I enter the room, lock us in
and don't bother us, even for a meal.

293
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,062
Yes, miss.

294
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,941
I know this place
is in the middle of nowhere,

295
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:37,694
but these bastards
don't deserve their government posts.

296
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,614
I'll go to the capital and fix everything.

297
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:48,163
-Have a safe trip home, sir.
-Sir, have a good night.

298
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,581
Let's go.

299
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,023
Jeong Hyo-bong.

300
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,693
We've spent years looking for you.

301
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:21,446
We won't harm you if you tell us
where the objects that changed you are.

302
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,644
You scoundrels!

303
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,105
You must be the purple monsters!

304
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,734
Just because I ran off,
unlike a true nobleman,

305
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,693
do I

306
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,155
look like someone who would die

307
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,699
at the hands of you animals?

308
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:09,494
As I said, I'll spare your life
if you tell us where the objects are.

309
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,706
Those objects?

310
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,541
Well, well.

311
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,835
You pathetic, dull creatures.

312
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,963
Did you think that I kept them?

313
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,716
I dumped them into the Socheon River,
you idiots.

314
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,260
Is that true?

315
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,430
They may have sunk
or floated down the river.

316
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:33,018
That spot has a strong current,
so the latter would be more likely.

317
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,270
Satisfied?

318
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:41,234
How much longer
will it take us to find them?

319
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,785
What are you doing?

320
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,579
You bastards. Are you making fun of me?

321
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,998
We can't harm humans.

322
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:55,916
What?

323
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,210
Why, you fucking losers!

324
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,337
Then I will kill you!

325
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,400
We can never harm humans.

326
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,984
We will try to negotiate,

327
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,446
but should things get dangerous,
we'll only threaten them.

328
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,575
We can't do anything right now
because there's no one here.

329
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,037
But the GPS led us to this spot.

330
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,173
There they are!

331
00:23:58,937 --> 00:23:59,771
What you doin'?

332
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,731
These machines have lives.

333
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,276
And they've just come alive.

334
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,528
So they're working now?

335
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,612
Temporarily.

336
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,364
It's like CPR.

337
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,949
Then why are you doing nothing?

338
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,493
What am I supposed to do?

339
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,703
Why are you asking me?

340
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,622
You should make them work!

341
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:21,334
And how do I achieve that?

342
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,377
Damn it!

343
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,089
Then what are you doing now?

344
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,799
I'm calling their owners.

345
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:31,845
I'm sure they have sensed
that these machines are here.

346
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,222
The owners of these living things.

347
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:35,640
The masters!

348
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:36,808
Has he gone senile?

349
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:40,395
Once they arrive, we will kneel down
and offer this world to them.

350
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,565
I hate wars. I hate disasters.

351
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,109
But humans,

352
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:51,114
these savage humans
are breaking their own home!

353
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,784
With their own hands! Crazy bastards!

354
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:58,455
They will protect this crazy world.

355
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,540
We should be ruled.

356
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,751
Only then can we live.

357
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,754
Okay.

358
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,758
Okay, I get it.

359
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,511
Right.

360
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:13,929
You're right.

361
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,891
In any case,

362
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,560
these will work at least once.

363
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,604
Right?

364
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,356
Probably.

365
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:27,817
All good, then.

366
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,072
You're so adorable!

367
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,865
What's its name?

368
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,242
Epicyon.

369
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,663
Epicyon's been dead for ages. Get over it!

370
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,376
All right. Epicyon, it is.

371
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:45,919
Fine.

372
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,046
They don't look alike at all.

373
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,549
Because it has been reborn stronger.

374
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,300
Epicyon.

375
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,010
-Bite!
-What?

376
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,478
What was that? You madman!

377
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,856
You're pathetic.
I know what your ulterior motive is.

378
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,859
You deserve a good beating.

379
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,696
How am I going to introduce you
when the masters arrive?

380
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:16,241
-You're an embarrassment!
-You're crazy!

381
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,701
You are crazier than me.

382
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,868
Wake up!

383
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,954
A new world will come!

384
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:24,749
Thunder!

385
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,272
Stop this.

386
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,108
You stop this.

387
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,737
Fine, you can do whatever you want.
Just stop this!

388
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,822
You stop this first!

389
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,949
Are we going to stay like this all day?

390
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,161
What's happening? It sounds like a fight.

391
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,371
Too bad we can't see inside.

392
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,123
What should we do?

393
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,961
We don't know what might happen in there,
so let's find an escape route first.

394
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,505
Let's take a look around.

395
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,175
All right, stop!

396
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,053
Let's stop on the count of three!

397
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,137
Okay.

398
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:20,930
One.

399
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:22,932
Two!

400
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,311
-Three.
-Thunder!

401
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,207
Stop.

402
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,380
Stop.

403
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:56,841
Min-ah!

404
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:57,759
Min-ah!

405
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,180
Thunder!

406
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,016
Truce!

407
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,602
-Thunder!
-Epicyon!

408
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,445
We'll talk later.

409
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,534
I told you to trust me and wait!

410
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,077
Go back in there.

411
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,413
Here's what you don't know
about being a dad.

412
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:30,250
We stick our necks out
for our kids, motherfucker!

413
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,631
What's going on?

414
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,639
Flame formation!

415
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,311
-Fire.
-What the hell is that?

416
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,691
-Growl.
-Fire.

417
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,110
The chicken nugget lady?

418
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,611
You're right.

419
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,572
Fuck this shit!

420
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:08,997
Growl.

421
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,506
What? Who are you?

422
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,009
It's me, sir. It's Twerp.

423
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,344
You're alive?

424
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,096
Yes.

425
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,682
Wimp is dead.
I thought I was going to die as well.

426
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,646
Despite being buried alive,
I couldn't die because I felt so wronged.

427
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,114
Fuck.

428
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,326
You said you would change the world.

429
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,370
I…

430
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,124
I was going to do it.

431
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,927
But you guys are just so stupid.

432
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,012
So it will never change.

433
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,778
I should get some rest too.

434
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:24,823
Fuck.
