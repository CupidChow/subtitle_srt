1
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,905
What?

2
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,865
Go away!

3
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,116
Hey!

4
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,896
Uncle.

5
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,026
Someone's after the machine.

6
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,778
This makes it clearer.

7
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,405
Any chance that Min-ah
has not turned into a nugget?

8
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,532
Seems to be zero.

9
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,868
They took Min-ah as well.

10
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:03,248
They knew the nugget wasn't just a nugget,
and, like us, they couldn't tell the cops.

11
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,167
Meaning they must also have a reason
to keep this a secret.

12
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,335
What would that be?

13
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,212
They were also looking for the machine,

14
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,965
assuming they needed two machines
for them to work.

15
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:16,678
Then it's possible
they now have both of the machines.

16
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,887
That means Min-ah is…

17
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,514
A test subject?

18
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:21,808
No!

19
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,436
YOU'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF THE GAME

20
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,699
Pull yourself together.

21
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,242
We have to stay strong.

22
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,743
We need to get her back!

23
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,287
Boss! How about

24
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,165
we slap each other's face just once?

25
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,082
-What?
-Okay?

26
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,710
You can slap me first. Do it!

27
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,385
Has slavery returned to this damn world
while I was at the sauna?

28
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,138
He got slapped for leaving the office?

29
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,514
What happened to human rights?

30
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,561
How much did this damn world change
while I was at the sauna?

31
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,526
I think that worked.

32
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,904
No, I said just once.

33
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,614
No, I said once!

34
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,658
Sir! Your phone! You got a phone call.

35
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:24,954
Hello?

36
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,583
Where? Pajeon?

37
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,126
Pajeon!

38
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:31,544
Pajeon!

39
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,048
Why would you

40
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:38,092
pop out of there?

41
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,109
Here you go.

42
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,490
You're better than your uncle.

43
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,201
Do you know what they call a kid like you?

44
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,119
-Prodigy.
-Correct.

45
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,917
You got it right.
Three plus four equals seven.

46
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,919
-Remember that.
-Okay.

47
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,255
-Give me a harder problem.
-Shall I?

48
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,132
-Can I go outside and play?
-Sure.

49
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,344
You're only a sixth-grader,
but you got three plus four right.

50
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,470
Yay!

51
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,689
Fuck.

52
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,652
Honey.

53
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:41,572
Why are you lounging in a suit
when you've never had a job in your life?

54
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,617
Because I like it.

55
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,881
Have Tae-young drink these
before he gets worse.

56
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,635
Don't let my brother take them.

57
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,346
He doesn't like anything bitter.

58
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,601
Drink it all up, okay?

59
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,593
Will you…

60
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,638
go out with me?

61
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,026
I LOVE YOU, TAE-YOUNG

62
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,904
Babe!

63
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,949
It wasn't a no.

64
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,619
She wants to focus on her studies.

65
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,830
She'll think about it
once she gets into college.

66
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,760
Will you go out with me?

67
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,975
What brings you all the way here?

68
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,561
Tae-man,

69
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,147
you'll be okay without me, right?

70
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,150
Seo-gyeong, what are you talking about?

71
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,778
You know, I'm into smart guys,

72
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,614
and I've never met anyone
smarter than you.

73
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,325
So I did find you attractive.

74
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,161
But no matter how hard I try…

75
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,376
I don't think I can kiss you.

76
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,585
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,671
I'm really sorry.

78
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,167
Your looks complete your style.

79
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,254
Your hair completes your looks.

80
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,967
Complete yourself as a man.

81
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,608
How long do you plan on living like this?

82
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,818
No one would plan to live like this.

83
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,238
Am I even living at all?

84
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,334
Poop. Bust.

85
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,378
Poop.

86
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,296
Mom.

87
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,257
This isn't poop or bust.

88
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,551
It's a scratch ticket.

89
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,095
Dad.

90
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,349
What are you doing here? You're dead.

91
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,059
Go back. You can't be here.

92
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,981
See that?
Even my mom treats me like a dead person.

93
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,446
Soon-sim. Are you back?

94
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,323
Yes.

95
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,576
When I come back to my senses,
how long does it last?

96
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,286
Five to ten minutes.

97
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,454
I see.

98
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,082
I might not be able to come back again.

99
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,919
I suppose I should organize
your dad's stuff.

100
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,379
Will you help?

101
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,216
What is even there to organize?

102
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,017
I see no nest egg.

103
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,563
Look at all these useless clothes.
They're all fake too.

104
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,025
Please take care of him.

105
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,903
If only he hadn't stolen
Tae-young's herbal medicine--

106
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,321
Tae-young gave them to me,

107
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,240
and it was Uncle who brought them!

108
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,667
What is this?

109
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,629
Oh dear, was this in there?

110
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,424
What is it?

111
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,051
It's our family heirloom.
Don't you remember?

112
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,887
Your dad would often
sit you and Tae-young down

113
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:01,434
and tell you the story
passed down in the family.

114
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,394
Damn, that stupid nonsense?

115
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,606
In goes a monster, and out comes a human?

116
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,275
-How lame.
-This one.

117
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,445
This looks familiar.

118
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,448
Why don't I know about this
if it's a family heirloom?

119
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,950
Because you stayed abroad
for your studies.

120
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,119
I've actually seen this thing, though.

121
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,414
What are you on about?
There's no way that actually exists.

122
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,959
Do you still remember
that story you were told?

123
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,879
I do, but does it really exist?

124
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,381
Hi, Dr. Yoo.

125
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,674
Feel free to dig around!

126
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:39,055
I've never seen
a material like this before.

127
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,223
Well, isn't it just aluminum?

128
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,893
It's similar,

129
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,645
but not quite.

130
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,261
I'm back.

131
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,429
What?

132
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,770
I'm ba--

133
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,114
BAEKJUNG CHICKEN NUGGET

134
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,991
We're out of ingredients,
so we're closed for the day.

135
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,204
You can't be out of ingredients
this early.

136
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,540
Yes, we're out of ingredients this early.

137
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,584
You should've told us earlier.
I've waited for two hours.

138
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,752
I've worked for nine.

139
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,714
Do you think I give a crap? Ma'am?

140
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,550
Do I give a crap
that you've waited for two hours? Sir?

141
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,260
-What the heck is this?
-A restaurant.

142
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,680
We are closed for today, right?

143
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,682
-I'm heading out.
-Where to?

144
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,476
Not there again?

145
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,895
-I'll be back.
-Stop going there!

146
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,772
What if they get suspicious?

147
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,360
I'll be back.

148
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,611
Come on!

149
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,114
NOBLEMAN'S CHICKEN NUGGET

150
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,327
PAJEON

151
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,418
That was quick. He's over there.

152
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,341
Excuse me.

153
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,553
I got fired before the owner died.

154
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,512
What?

155
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,099
I heard you were looking for me
over an incorrect package,

156
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,019
but I think the owner
delivered the machine.

157
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,857
A well-built man with an angular face
who's always angry, right?

158
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,568
-So he was the owner?
-Yes.

159
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,988
You know Baekjung Chicken Nugget,
the new place across the street?

160
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,741
He said they were the reason
he was losing business,

161
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,493
not the bad nuggets he made.

162
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,788
Anyway, he fired me to save money
and delivered the food himself.

163
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,748
MORE THAN MACHINES

164
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:15,252
The one who delivered the machine is dead.
The one who studied it is missing.

165
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,712
What will become of Min-ah?

166
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,513
Why didn't you go home?

167
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,057
Boss.

168
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,477
I got a call from Dr. Yoo In-won.

169
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,937
What do you mean?

170
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:37,358
-How can a missing man call you?
-I don't know. He called the office.

171
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,151
I'm not sure what's going on, but…

172
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,574
we can meet him at this address tomorrow.

173
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,659
MOUNT 21, CHANGCHEONG-RI

174
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,540
-Is this the right place?
-Yes, according to the address.

175
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,626
It's the only house here anyway.

176
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,795
But why would he be in a place like this?

177
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,171
This leaves me no choice.

178
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,842
-Mr. Ko, you should go back.
-Why?

179
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,886
Everyone involved with the machine
is either dead or missing.

180
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,431
We don't know what might happen,
so you go back.

181
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,268
-That's why I can't go back.
-I can't put you in danger.

182
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,436
No. I have to go there.

183
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,615
Cheeky little bastard.

184
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,142
Who are you?

185
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,519
-Who is he?
-Dunno.

186
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,604
Who are you?

187
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,857
I was just passing by, and

188
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,775
I wanted to help.

189
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,402
-Help us?
-No, him.

190
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,528
Oh, him?

191
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,656
Then why were you hitting him
instead of us?

192
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,866
I wasn't hitting him.

193
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,160
I was putting antiseptic on him.

194
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,788
-What?
-That's dope!

195
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,333
How did you do this?

196
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,335
-Quickly.
-Quickly?

197
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,753
-Real fast.
-Real fast?

198
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,797
Is this even possible?

199
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:27,468
You know how they flip the dough
when they pound rice cake?

200
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,386
-Yeah!
-That's basically how it works.

201
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,478
Are you a good fighter?

202
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:38,896
I suck like hell.

203
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,773
It'd be easy to beat you up, then.

204
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:41,941
-Right?
-Yeah.

205
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,067
Relatively, yes.

206
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,902
You motherfucker!

207
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,280
What the fuck is this?

208
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,657
Eat it. It's gelato.

209
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,742
-Min-ah!
-Oh, it's gelato?

210
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,994
-Are you a friend of his?
-Just an acquaintance.

211
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,204
Oh, an acquaintance.

212
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,247
I'm going to kick you there. Block me.

213
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,129
I said block me, not just look down there.

214
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,465
What are you doing?

215
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,509
Run!

216
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,913
I can't believe you went in there to put
antiseptic on him. Weren't you afraid?

217
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,002
I couldn't just ignore what I saw
and walk by.

218
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,965
You're just giving them an excuse
to bully another person.

219
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,301
So next time,
you should ask for help first.

220
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,013
Okay, I will.

221
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:56,932
Anyway,

222
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,935
I saved you once today, Baek-joong.

223
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,437
Remember that.

224
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,149
Sure. I will remember it.

225
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,401
How could I forget this?

226
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,495
I have to go.

227
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:21,749
Mr. Ko!

228
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,669
This time,

229
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,756
I'll be the one saving you, Min-ah.

230
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,981
Welcome, Mr. Ko Baek-joong.

231
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,110
Hello, Dr. Yoo.

232
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,697
You must be Mr. Choi Sun-man.

233
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,658
Yes, I'm Choi Sun-man.

234
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,743
Nice to meet you.

235
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,538
-This is my nephew.
-Nephew?

236
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,876
Hello. I'm Yoo Tae-man.

237
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,882
You're already gone
from this world anyway.

238
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:16,428
I, Tae-young, will turn you into gold bars
and put them to good use.

239
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,388
Everything must have a purpose, after all.

240
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:36,615
Why isn't it working?

241
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,077
Fuck!

242
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,122
Fucking hell!

243
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,502
It's always like this.

244
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,878
All the time!

245
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,596
Uncle.

246
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:09,898
Uncle.

247
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,070
What happened to you?

248
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,368
Is it you, Tae-man?

249
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,287
What the hell happened?

250
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,251
I have no energy.

251
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,503
You know how that machine works, right?

252
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,049
Min-ah!

253
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,093
You were looking for her, right?

254
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,845
How much do you know?

255
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,055
Take a seat first.

256
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,807
I have a lot to tell you.

257
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,767
I didn't want to come empty-handed,

258
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,478
so I brought some fruit.

259
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,647
Why? You didn't have to do that.

260
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,694
-I've never seen this fruit before.
-This is how you eat it.

261
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,615
-Sir!
-What are you doing?

262
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,575
-Please calm down!
-Mr. Ko.

263
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,452
Go get Min-ah.

264
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,830
Go! Now!

265
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,583
Don't move.

266
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:14,796
Be careful.

267
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,427
Min-ah.

268
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,972
Min-ah!

269
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:24,973
Mr. Choi!

270
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,225
Don't move.

271
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,518
I think there's a misunderstanding.
Calm down!

272
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,312
I…

273
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:36,109
I am someone who can help you.

274
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,861
I won't harm you, Doctor.

275
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,321
As you said,

276
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,740
you need to help me.

277
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,325
But

278
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,036
I'm not sure about that guy.

279
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:49,164
Are you aware
that Yoo Tae-man is trying to kill

280
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,291
Yoo Tae-young, his own brother,

281
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,085
and you, his uncle?

282
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,253
What?

283
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,092
Do you happen to have
the younger son's contact?

284
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,219
I don't have anything like that.

285
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,680
He would just call up once in a while,

286
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,891
ask if his mom's still alive,
and then hang up.

287
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,852
Was he questioned by the police
about Dr. Yoo's case?

288
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:11,770
He was.

289
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,398
Can I have a look at his room, please?

290
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,568
Why are you doing this to me?
I'm not even part of this family!

291
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,736
MASTER TROT CONCERT

292
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,864
Please take your time.

293
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,284
-Have you eaten yet?
-Yes.

294
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:26,910
You can go upstairs.

295
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,372
I can't believe this!

296
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,919
I'LL END YOU, YOO IN-WON
TAE-YOUNG, YOU'RE NEXT

297
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,508
KILL YOO TAE-YOUNG

298
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,093
KILL YOO IN-WON

299
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,178
I'll explain.

300
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,638
Please put that down first.

301
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,265
You are going to explain?

302
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:34,186
I know the situation you're in,
so I get why you're acting this way.

303
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,230
Since you understand,
you can excuse us once more.

304
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:38,815
Mr. Ko.

305
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,859
-Yes?
-Tie them up.

306
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,322
Don't move.

307
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,032
Yoo Tae-man, stop.

308
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,993
Tae-man, what are you doing? Stop!

309
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,127
Stop, you bastard. Stop!
