1
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,583
MY DAUGHTER TURNED INTO A CHICKEN NUGGET

2
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,669
Your daughter? Why do you refer
to the nuggets as your daughter?

3
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:48,006
I just like them very much.

4
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,259
I'm very fond of chicken nuggets,

5
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:55,388
and I'm particularly fond of one of these.

6
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:00,477
You said the nugget wasn't my daughter.
How do you know that?

7
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,604
She's the blogger I told you about.

8
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,522
The best food columnist in Korea,

9
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,690
Hongcha.

10
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,360
Where did the belly go?

11
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,322
Do you have a six-pack?

12
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,824
This is humiliating!

13
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,911
-Why are you touching me?
-Humiliating?

14
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,538
I used to rub your tummy with these hands.

15
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,333
What's with the gross conversation?
How do you know her?

16
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,002
She's my ex. We broke up three years ago.

17
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,713
But you don't go well together.

18
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:32,550
Don't lie with those big, swollen lips.
It was two years ago, not three.

19
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,927
Leave my lips alone.

20
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,515
We broke up three years ago,
but you didn't accept it for a year.

21
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,391
Breakups happen by mutual consent.

22
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,894
-No, they happen when one grows cold.
-Selfish jerk.

23
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,480
All I'm hearing is bullshit, but okay.

24
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:48,316
So you can tell
which ones are from Baekjung?

25
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,984
She will say she can

26
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,862
as a Baekjung chicken nugget expert.

27
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,281
I know you've been
snooping around my blog.

28
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,534
-Got any feelings left?
-No.

29
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,786
That's how I can still respect you
as a blogger.

30
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:00,829
-Okay, so--
-Asshole.

31
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,248
-You asshole! He is an asshole.
-Don't swear at me!

32
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,958
Do you still have feelings?

33
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,503
I do! Because you're the most
perfect-looking guy in the world!

34
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,135
Fingers resembling fatty beef intestines.

35
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,348
Dark red lips
that look like duck gizzards.

36
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,185
What completed your looks

37
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,438
was your belly hanging over your belt
like an oversized burger.

38
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,067
Why have you become so scrawny?

39
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,277
This isn't you!

40
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,114
-This is me!
-It's not you! Not you!

41
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,283
Snap out of it. Stop!
What is wrong with you?

42
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,076
We had something good going on.

43
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,333
Don't go back. Don't go into a flashback!

44
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,003
Get out of there!

45
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,549
Don't go there!

46
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:00,305
-One mulnaengmyeon here, please.
-Sure!

47
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,891
Excuse me, sir.

48
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:06,060
We're out of tables.
Would you mind sharing yours?

49
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,229
I'll give you each a free dumpling.

50
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,523
-Of course not. No problem.
-Thank you.

51
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,358
You're by yourself, right? This way.

52
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:14,903
Thank you.

53
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,446
What can I get you?

54
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,698
-Mulnaengmyeon, please.
-Sure thing.

55
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,537
Thank you.

56
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,831
You're welcome.

57
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,136
Do you like Pyongyang-style naengmyeon?

58
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,304
I do.

59
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,643
It tastes a bit different here though.

60
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:48,853
How so?

61
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,939
They use buckwheat
and sweet potato starch,

62
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,233
not the normal buckwheat
and flour combination.

63
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,028
-You know your stuff.
-Yes.

64
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,405
Let's guess the proportions.

65
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,115
-What?
-How about a bet?

66
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,201
Loser buys half a suyuk.

67
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,037
Okay.

68
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,544
Since it's slightly tough
and I can't bite through it with my lips,

69
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,298
I'm guessing 60% buckwheat
and 40% sweet potato starch.

70
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,176
I say 70% buckwheat
and 30% sweet potato starch.

71
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,345
Seventy-thirty?

72
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:24,973
Excuse me.

73
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,725
It's 70% buckwheat
and 30% sweet potato starch.

74
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,145
Thank you.

75
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,231
Could we have half a suyuk, please?

76
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,983
-Sure.
-Thank you.

77
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,652
I lost the bet.

78
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,321
Let me pay for the suyuk.

79
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,948
I actually knew the answer.

80
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,741
Did you?

81
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,080
I swear it was chewier than that ratio.

82
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,586
"Hongcha"?

83
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,172
-The Hongcha?
-Do you know me?

84
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,759
I'm your fan! My goodness! Ms. Hongcha!

85
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,137
This is crazy!

86
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,723
You were like the broth
in Pyongyang naengmyeon.

87
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,059
Clear, transparent,
with a rich aroma of meat.

88
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,687
You blinded my eyes with your pure color

89
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,897
and intoxicated me
with that impure fragrance.

90
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,275
Yes, meat aroma and all,

91
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,152
they are amazing, so now--

92
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,570
But it didn't last long.

93
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,074
Don't go!

94
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,618
Don't look back!

95
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,787
Open your eyes, would you?

96
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,748
-Baek-joong.
-Yes?

97
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,250
-That's mint chocolate.
-Yeah.

98
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,712
-What about it?
-Nothing.

99
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,408
-Here's your tangsuyuk.
-Thanks.

100
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,285
Enjoy.

101
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,044
I'm sorry. It was a reflex.

102
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:22,548
With Tangsuyuk, you pour the sauce
made with starch water, vinegar,

103
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,509
sugar, and soy sauce over fried pork.

104
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:26,844
I get it.

105
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:30,723
If you don't pour the sauce,
it would just be fried meat.

106
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,558
Okay.

107
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,644
-And we ordered tangsuyuk.
-I said okay.

108
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,687
I'll pour it next time.

109
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,945
Hongcha!

110
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:45,947
Don't!

111
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,033
No need to get mad about it!

112
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,328
I'm not mad, okay?

113
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,497
I'm freaked out.

114
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,416
Freaked out by pineapple on pizza?

115
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,542
But it's pizza.

116
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,878
Pineapple on pizza. Seriously?

117
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,756
You did it on purpose, right?

118
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,717
Are you saying I did it to annoy you?

119
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,011
If not, why did you order it
before I arrived?

120
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,431
You never did that before.

121
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,392
Whatever. Forget it.

122
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,560
You creep me out.

123
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:16,853
Creep you out?

124
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,607
You just let me walk away like that.

125
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,360
Bastard.

126
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:28,281
You acted like a foodie who enjoys
Pyongyang naengmyeon alone,

127
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,074
but you're a tangsuyuk sauce dipper

128
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,285
who likes mint chocolate
and fruit on pizza.

129
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,704
You're so uptight.
You don't respect diversity!

130
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:38,708
If diversity means creating wrong things,
confusing people, and causing controversy,

131
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,042
then I'll destroy it!

132
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,836
Mint chocolate

133
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,505
is popular already.
It will never be destroyed!

134
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,551
This is why I couldn't let you go.

135
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,722
-That annoying backbone of yours.
-You're so annoying!

136
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,183
Now, please

137
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,602
tell me about it!

138
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,520
Why do you keep asking? Tell you what?

139
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,564
You said the nugget wasn't my daughter!

140
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,191
I did.

141
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,360
Does that mean
you can single out a nugget from these?

142
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,737
I can.

143
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,073
-But I don't think I want to get involved.
-What?

144
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,868
Not with someone
who calls chicken nuggets their daughter.

145
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,539
Can't you see
which one of us is the weird one?

146
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,179
I'm still on Team Mint Chocolate.
I dip my tangsuyuk--

147
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,765
-That's just fried meat then!
-Fine.

148
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,225
And I still

149
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,853
enjoy pizza with pineapple topping.

150
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,065
But the ordeal I'm facing
is not simply a matter of taste.

151
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,442
It's a matter of humanity and dignity.

152
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,195
I can't explain all of it,

153
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,490
but we need your help, so please…

154
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,826
help us.

155
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,835
I didn't really want to hear
your love story,

156
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,131
but I had to listen to it
all this time right next to you.

157
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:10,883
Please!

158
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,470
Please help us!

159
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,238
This one?

160
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,782
Unlike other nuggets

161
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,618
that have a touch of yellow
from the ground peanuts,

162
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:41,038
this one seems a little pale to me.

163
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,961
She must have been cold.
Min-ah gets cold very easily.

164
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,630
-Are you sure?
-Don't you know who I am?

165
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,592
I mean,
this is really important, that's all.

166
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,676
I'm not doubting you.

167
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:02,935
Fine.

168
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,147
This is the one,
but I'll check the smell to be sure.

169
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,357
-Thanks!
-I appreciate it.

170
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,028
Careful!

171
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,449
Baekjung chicken nuggets have
a subtle scent of perilla oil.

172
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,742
But this one doesn't.

173
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,625
-Did you make this one?
-What?

174
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,669
Why do I smell mint chocolate
on a chicken nugget?

175
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,047
Mint chocolate? What is it?

176
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,007
Here!

177
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,884
-Min-ah!
-Gently!

178
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,511
-What is it?
-She's right.

179
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,639
Because Min-ah is also
on Team Mint Chocolate.

180
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,642
Min-ah!

181
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,436
Thank you, Ms. Hongcha!

182
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,979
How can I ever repay you?

183
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,066
Just get a grip.

184
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,651
Of course! I'll get a grip!

185
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,486
Thank you, really.

186
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,742
Do you still

187
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,661
write songs?

188
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,371
Yeah.

189
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,040
I post them on my YouTube channel.

190
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,291
Good to hear that.

191
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,209
What?

192
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,920
Nothing. Bye.

193
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,883
I got asked to appear on EXchange.

194
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,135
Tell me if you're up for it.

195
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:22,890
I'm good.

196
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,072
Isn't this unbelievable?

197
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,619
My wife died after giving birth,
so I raised Min-ah by myself.

198
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,789
Min-ah is everything to me. And yet

199
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,624
I can't tell her apart.

200
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,211
I asked a total stranger
to find my daughter out of the bunch.

201
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,506
And there's nothing I can do
but believe what she told me.

202
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,925
I'm in love with Min-ah.

203
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,095
Sorry to surprise you,
but I'm telling you this

204
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,557
because I want to tell you
that you're not alone.

205
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,851
And I want to tell you
that I want to be alone.

206
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,228
-I'll be with you till the end.
-Darn.

207
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,229
Please trust me.

208
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,065
-I know that's Min-ah.
-Sure.

209
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,276
-You should go home now.
-No.

210
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,193
Why should I?

211
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,155
It's late. It's the weekend.
And there's the employment law.

212
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,073
-I'm not on duty.
-But you are--

213
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,535
I told you. We are all we have, Father!

214
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,288
-Father?
-Father of machines.

215
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,497
Father of machines.

216
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,378
Right, that's what my job was.

217
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,675
That's it. I should make a machine
that can preserve Min-ah.

218
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,971
Right! A safe machine to maintain
the optimum temperature and humidity!

219
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:48,225
I'll text you the parts I need.
Can you go to the warehouse and grab them?

220
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,268
Yes, sir!

221
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,106
What is it?

222
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,692
-I've never seen you do this.
-Do what?

223
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,278
Try to make a machine
that is actually useful.

224
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,655
Now make yourself useful
and get moving, please.

225
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,573
Yes, sir!

226
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,488
Found it.

227
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,114
MORE THAN MACHINES

228
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,581
BAEKJUNG CHICKEN NUGGET

229
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,390
This is it, right?

230
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,475
Did you feel it too?

231
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,144
I felt it.
It's the same as that rainy day.

232
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,605
It seems like

233
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,608
we're about to get
a real chance this time.

234
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,832
To sum it up,

235
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,459
Min-ah went into the machine,

236
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:42,047
shouted "chicken nugget,"
and turned into a chicken nugget, right?

237
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,340
That's right.

238
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,553
Then if we put this chicken nugget
back into that machine

239
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:51,682
and shout "Choi Min-ah,"
shouldn't it turn back into Min-ah?

240
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:52,975
Who is going to shout it?

241
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,854
Also, what if the nugget gets burned
or turns into pickled radish?

242
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:03,110
Until we figure out what that machine is,
we can't try anything recklessly.

243
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,070
I said it out of frustration.

244
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,574
I even thought it might be a time machine.

245
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:12,328
How can someone enter a building
and disappear without a trace?

246
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,292
Then Min-ah might be somewhere,
fighting desperately right now

247
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,002
to come back here.

248
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,670
But she doesn't like adventures.

249
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,589
Or she might be somewhere,

250
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,925
enjoying her stay

251
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,636
because she loves it there.

252
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,618
Why would the warrior-eunuchs
do her nails?

253
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,038
-What a filthy imagination.
-I apologize.

254
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,500
This kind of dirty fantasy
tends to ruin romantic relationships.

255
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,503
-You have no relationship with my kid.
-I have a crush on her.

256
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,297
And I'm sorry for that.

257
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,511
Min-ah is not a vain girl at all.

258
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:14,014
Even during her exams,
she did volunteer work.

259
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,766
Then she might be somewhere

260
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:20,062
in a different dimension,
watching us right now.

261
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,897
Just stop imagining!

262
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,516
No.

263
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,602
Don't go in there.

264
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,456
Please!

265
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:32,843
Min-ah.

266
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,889
Hold on, I'll try and connect--

267
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,349
Chicken nugget!

268
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:54,948
Min-ah?

269
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,367
Min-ah?

270
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,088
This makes the most sense for now.

271
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,965
I'm sorry. I'm just so frustrated.

272
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:13,967
How about this?

273
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,012
I will get into…

274
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:20,891
that machine myself.

275
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,351
Don't do it.

276
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:26,063
If it's something that makes you
turn into anything you say

277
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,107
or some teleporting machine,

278
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,276
this is the only way to find out.

279
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,695
How are you going to tell me
once you find out?

280
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,697
Sorry?

281
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,243
If you also turn into a chicken nugget,
how are you going to tell me?

282
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,286
I just said it out of frustration.

283
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,914
Stop frustrating me
by saying things out of frustration.

284
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,624
-Okay.
-I thought about going in.

285
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:49,044
I thought about it a million times,
but if something happened to me,

286
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,672
who would turn Min-ah back to herself?

287
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,092
I can't take such careless risks.

288
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,637
We need to find Dr. Yoo In-won.

289
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,268
Min-ah.

290
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,814
Today I'll look into Dr. Yoo.

291
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,315
By the way,

292
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:15,320
about the machine that Dr. Yoo once had,
do you reckon it was disposed of?

293
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,490
Should I look into
the management team at his lab?

294
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,159
-Yes, please do that.
-Yes, sir.

295
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,702
And here.

296
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,623
Could you try and find
these books I've written down?

297
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,668
Dr. Yoo wrote them,
but they're hard to find.

298
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:33,172
I'll search thoroughly offline and online.

299
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,089
Okay.

300
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,549
All right.

301
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,011
Daddy will be back.

302
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,096
-I'll be counting on you.
-Okay.

303
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,188
I can't show
the investigation reports to a civilian.

304
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,772
But I can promise

305
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,275
I won't stop you
running your own investigation.

306
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:04,870
Number 40.

307
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,714
Apart from his studio and the house where
his sister-in-law with dementia lives,

308
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,759
he never went anywhere else regularly.

309
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,137
Why are you looking for him? Who are you?

310
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,473
I'm studying the same machine he did.

311
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,724
So sick of this.

312
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:30,062
She was his only relative,
so did you put up flyers, or--

313
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,773
No need for flyers.
The whole thing was on the news.

314
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,192
But still--

315
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,527
Guys are the problem in this family.

316
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,820
Excuse me?

317
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,406
Her husband was always
well-dressed in a suit

318
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,867
but took naps in it
because he was a lazy bum.

319
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,787
But he did his wife a favor
with his untimely death.

320
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,413
And her two sons?

321
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,708
The older one hasn't been in touch
since he became a celebrity.

322
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,252
He never visits his mom.

323
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,088
The younger one was a smart kid,

324
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,508
but he followed his machine-crazy uncle
around until he went crazy too.

325
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,968
I don't know where he is now.

326
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,137
After all that happened,
her condition got worse.

327
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,098
I see. I'm sorry.

328
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:10,143
Do you know the places he frequented, or--

329
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,396
The lab.

330
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,232
He sometimes came to check on her.

331
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:19,987
He was totally broke, as he blew
all the government funds he got.

332
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,905
Any other place he might have visited?

333
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,658
Go tear the lab down and dig under it.
You'll find him.

334
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,410
He had nowhere else to go anyway.

335
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,133
Why did he go all the way to the building?

336
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,680
He was famous enough to be on the news,
but there are only ten articles about him.

337
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,391
After all,
people don't care about scientists.

338
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,727
He must've been a lonely guy.

339
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,355
KO BAEK-JOONG

340
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,817
-Yes, Mr. Ko.
-Sir, I found the head manager

341
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,362
of Dr. Yoo's lab,
and I spoke to him over the phone.

342
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:06,199
Luckily, he was my school friend's
mom's cousin's second cousin's teacher's

343
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,201
first love's older brother's friend.

344
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,746
I bet it was harder
to find out all those connections.

345
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,830
It sure was.

346
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:17,002
After Dr. Yoo went missing,
researchers discarded the core materials,

347
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,838
and a contract company
took the remaining scrap metals.

348
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,925
But no one knows what became
of the machine Dr. Yoo was studying.

349
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:29,848
If it wasn't classified as core materials
and looked like a normal cabinet,

350
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:33,393
it might have been sold as office goods
in a secondhand market.

351
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,270
That is a plausible theory.

352
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,606
Do you know
where this disposal company is?

353
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,276
Yes, they're located in Gimpo.
Should I pay a visit just in case?

354
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,612
No, I'm close by, so I'll go.

355
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:48,033
Text me the address,
and please look into those books.

356
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,076
Yes, sir.

357
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:23,944
What, lady?

358
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,987
What is it, lady?

359
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,450
You…

360
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:44,840
Min-ah.

361
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,591
My dear girl.

362
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,177
Min-ah!

363
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,723
Daddy's coming!

364
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,026
Hello.

365
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,865
I'm Ko Baek-joong,
an intern at More than Machines.

366
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:15,829
November 20, 2022, 14:04.

367
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,708
Min-ah turned into a chicken nugget
three days ago,

368
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:21,960
and I'd like to record

369
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,045
Min-ah's state.

370
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,508
She was exposed to direct sunlight
for several hours.

371
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,803
She even had a fall
but fortunately suffered no damage.

372
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,182
Texture and moisture of the sauce,

373
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,558
all clear.

374
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,606
My blood sugar has dropped
due to a long period of fasting,

375
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,566
so my hands are a bit shaky.

376
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:48,904
Still, this chicken nugget
doesn't seem like food to me.

377
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,364
My mental state, normal.

378
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,909
Min-ah's appearance, normal.

379
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,494
Normal?

380
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,579
Should I call it "normal"?

381
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,885
Even I don't know how this song will go.

382
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,513
There are no melody or lyrics.

383
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,474
I'll let my heart lead the way

384
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,228
to express my frustration.

385
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,813
It has a title. It's called…

386
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,276
"A Chicken Nugget Rhapsody."

387
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,044
Have you seen this?

388
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,505
I know this.

389
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:50,924
I know.

390
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,801
This is that thing.

391
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,302
Do you remember it?

392
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,763
Did you dispose of it?

393
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,515
No!

394
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,810
I didn't.

395
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,689
Was it taken by that secondhand store?

396
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,526
-I think I left it here somewhere.
-Where did you leave it?

397
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,237
Maybe somewhere over there?

398
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:38,305
Yes! I'll be right there. Yes.

399
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,974
Yes, thank you!

400
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,238
You may not know
how to become good-looking…

401
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,326
but you're on your way.

402
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,405
Min-ah.

403
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,302
Cha Eun-woo!
