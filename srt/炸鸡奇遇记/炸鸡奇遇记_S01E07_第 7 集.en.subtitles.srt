1
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,340
Kyochon Soy Garlic

2
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,343
Golden Original, Pepper Crispy
Pelicana Seasoned, Bburinkle

3
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,472
Let's take one of each
Chicken platter

4
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,642
Can I have one of each?
Chicken platter

5
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,564
Can anyone make a platter
And sell it to me?

6
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,405
Can anyone make a platter
And sell it to me?

7
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,908
Sell it to me?

8
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,540
That's how I got
inside More than Machines.

9
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,751
And tragically…

10
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,544
-Min-ah.
-Louder!

11
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,754
Min-ah!

12
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,132
A chicken nugget?
Who could imagine that would happen?

13
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,717
No one. What the hell?

14
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,552
You look very upset.

15
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,389
I mean, even as I'm talking about it,
it's just completely nonsensical!

16
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,476
But Larva, what happened, happened.

17
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:45,230
I turned into a caterpillar
and watched Be Melodramatic.

18
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,564
How ridiculous is that?

19
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,817
Do you want to know what I think?

20
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,361
I wouldn't care
if I turned into a caterpillar

21
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,405
and watched Be Melodramatic
or Money Heist: Korea

22
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,325
and got eaten by a zombie bird,
as long as Min-ah comes back!

23
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,995
Let's get back to the point.

24
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,996
Okay.

25
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,394
Anyway, after all that,
I was moved to this warehouse.

26
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,279
And I was turned back, as you can see.

27
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,698
That means those two machines…

28
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:41,995
One makes us turn into whatever
we have seen right before it's activated.

29
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:45,582
And the other one
turns us back to how we were.

30
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,252
This nonsense is starting
to make sense. Good!

31
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,630
Let's put Min-ah in that machine--

32
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,799
-It's not possible.
-Larva!

33
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,217
Why?

34
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,304
You spouted all that
just to say that it's impossible?

35
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,598
You said that as if it was nothing

36
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,267
to a father whose child
has turned into a chicken nugget!

37
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,895
If you think your temper can fix this,
then go ahead.

38
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,147
Why would I stop you?

39
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:19,616
I would've brought her back already
if it were possible.

40
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,161
I wouldn't have started with
why we brought that machine here.

41
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,174
Now,

42
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,678
I'm going to tell you
everything I know about these machines.

43
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,977
What do you think
the phase of this material is?

44
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,479
That material?

45
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,399
Larva!

46
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,362
-Larva!
-Wait.

47
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,588
You should've told us first!

48
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,884
These machines are made

49
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,680
with a material that hasn't yet been
invented nor discovered on Earth.

50
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,056
My theory is that

51
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,643
these were made
about 200 years ago in secrecy

52
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:32,605
by a genius scientist
or a group of such individuals.

53
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:37,777
With confidence that it was made by mixing
dozens or hundreds of materials,

54
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,697
I spent years analyzing the material.

55
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,824
I was going to continue my research,

56
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,951
but ever since I got my body back,

57
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,997
the machines have not responded at all
for some reason.

58
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,374
Simply put, they are broken?

59
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,668
There are no grounds to say that,

60
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,295
but it's true, they don't work.

61
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,421
So they're broken?

62
00:04:56,504 --> 00:05:00,258
I can't say that they're broken
until the cause of failure is found.

63
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,718
So they're broken.

64
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,847
Why are we so unnecessarily obstinate
at such a vital moment?

65
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,307
Stop it.

66
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:08,933
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,396
They don't need electricity to operate.

68
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,109
I simply thought they absorbed energy
from their environment,

69
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,279
which means there shouldn't be any limit
to the number of operations.

70
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,489
But I was wrong.

71
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,782
So what's your point?

72
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,492
I am certain!

73
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,953
On the day these machines accept us,

74
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,790
humanity will encounter
a new civilization!

75
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,710
Until then,
no one can find out about this.

76
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:39,964
As soon as human greed gets involved,
everything will be ruined!

77
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,634
Yes, we know that.
That's why we didn't report this anywhere.

78
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:47,305
But you and Yellow Pants
are already aware of this.

79
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,140
Am I Yellow Pants?

80
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,059
Well, you kept calling me Larva, so…

81
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,769
I see that's been bothering you.

82
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,438
I mean, is it a problem
that we know about this?

83
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,774
My daughter is involved in this.

84
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,862
What's wrong with me?

85
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,030
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:07,408
I cannot be sure
how long this research will take.

87
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:10,661
Weird.

88
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,164
I am well aware of your situation,

89
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,959
but you might grow impatient
and ruin the whole thing.

90
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,836
What does that mean?

91
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,758
What's wrong with me?

92
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,055
What's happening?

93
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,974
Also, Yellow Pants
is not even your family.

94
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,895
I'm going to lock you up
until the research is completed.

95
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,405
You crazy bastard!

96
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,033
I'm falling.

97
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,536
Boss!

98
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,496
Min-ah!

99
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,086
I'm falling.

100
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,506
Min-ah!

101
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,465
Min-ah!

102
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,969
Mr. Ko, protect Min-ah.

103
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,179
This is what's best for Min-ah.

104
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,390
Min-ah.

105
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,724
Am I a villain?

106
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:17,687
This study can't get any support
from the government.

107
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,522
Are you worried? Don't be.

108
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,943
At the same time,
this study doesn't require any support.

109
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,780
Why? Because I am the best scientist
of humankind!

110
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,073
Amen.

111
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:33,035
Fuck, that doesn't mean you can drug us!

112
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,372
You could've put us to sleep instead,
you bastards!

113
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,418
Please trust me and wait for a while.
I'll get it done quickly.

114
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,503
Wait like this, you mean?

115
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,880
Tae-man, let's move them.

116
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,798
We'll move you safely.

117
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,176
Does it look like we are safe?

118
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,846
-Just relax.
-Min-ah!

119
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,724
Why do you keep crawling?
What are you, a caterpillar?

120
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,309
Min-ah!

121
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,311
Min-ah!

122
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,647
-Min-ah!
-Min-ah!

123
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,899
Min-ah!

124
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:12,325
Min-ah!

125
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,874
What qualities do you look for in a man?

126
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,001
First, a kind heart.

127
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,837
Second, a good-looking face
that everyone likes.

128
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,714
Third, a sexy, grown-up bod.

129
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,177
You may not know
how to become good-looking,

130
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,262
but you're on your way.

131
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,222
What?

132
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,183
You might not have the ability
to change your face,

133
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,393
but you change how others see you.

134
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,438
You're doing your best
at something along those lines.

135
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,108
Have you written any songs recently?
Will you sing me one?

136
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,680
"Inner beauty"?

137
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,975
I used to think
that it was a pathetic cliché.

138
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:23,479
Something that's said
by those who are jealous of outer beauty,

139
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,899
or an idea of kindness
forced upon us by a hypocritical society.

140
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,194
But I changed my mind after I met you.

141
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,573
Inner beauty doesn't only mean
you have a kind heart.

142
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:37,493
It's like you have
a wonderful world inside you.

143
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,663
In that wonderful world,
there's great music.

144
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,332
Do you want to Netflix and chill?

145
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,596
Larva!

146
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,853
I can't believe they chained us up!

147
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,481
I think the drug is wearing off.

148
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,984
There's no way
they could have left us paralyzed.

149
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,362
They'd have had to wipe our butts
if they did.

150
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,783
Being tied up like this,

151
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,786
I miss my daughter even more.

152
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,913
You'll be able to see her soon.

153
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,166
I guess I owe your parents an apology…

154
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,379
for putting you through this…

155
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,006
in your first job.

156
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,470
Well, my parents wanted me to study
mechanical engineering and get a job.

157
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,726
Baek-joong, what's your dream?

158
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,395
To become a singer-songwriter.

159
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,563
That's an amazing dream. I support you.

160
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,815
Thank you, Father.

161
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,275
So you should study
mechanical engineering.

162
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:38,823
Am I misunderstanding the curriculum
of mechanical engineering?

163
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:41,784
Think about it.

164
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,163
To live as a singing, music-making loser,
you need to earn money.

165
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,998
Mechanical engineering will get you a job.

166
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,418
-Father, but--
-Are you saying that I'm wrong?

167
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,921
-There's a tiny problem.
-Let's not argue over little things.

168
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,048
I wouldn't say my dream is a little thing.

169
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,591
Then I should just die.

170
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,553
I'd do that for the sake of your dream.

171
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,639
I'll call our elders to say goodbye
before taking my own life.

172
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,350
Do it in the bathroom
so it's easy to clean up.

173
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,019
You're always like this!

174
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,813
Both of you!

175
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,648
Every time!

176
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,025
Then you must know how this will end.

177
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,287
I support your dream, son.

178
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,387
You're one crazy kid.

179
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,391
Those yellow pants were your way
of rebelling against your father?

180
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,644
Man, this is good.

181
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,730
Cute pants.

182
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,690
That was his mistake.

183
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:40,444
Because he was too stubborn
to take anything back.

184
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,282
I think marketing
is all about storytelling.

185
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,369
I'm prepared to tell a new story
at Major Company

186
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,287
using my exceptional language skills.

187
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,581
Sure. That's nice.

188
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,208
2021 MAJOR COMPANY RECRUITMENT

189
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,127
You have good grades, so what's wrong?

190
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,296
What do you think of our company?

191
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,465
Yes.

192
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,969
-Major Company?
-Why do you want to join us?

193
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,179
To replace your vice chairman
who is in jail.

194
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,473
You think we'd replace him
with a new recruit?

195
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,684
I think I can do better
in creative accounting.

196
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,185
He was pardoned recently.

197
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,521
-Oh, I didn't know that.
-Too bad.

198
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,035
Cute pants.

199
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:40,963
Have some.

200
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,684
Cute pants!

201
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,146
How do you keep gaining weight
when you've eaten gruel for the last year?

202
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,064
Stop doing this.

203
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,234
Cute pants!

204
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,863
-He's still relentless.
-Here, have some.

205
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,657
I can't believe
someone could be so unreasonable.

206
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,744
Why didn't you just become a musician?

207
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,787
My father was actually right.

208
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,915
I'm happy with my life now.

209
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,210
Because I'm doing both what I can do
and what I want to do.

210
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:24,590
I'm listening to my father,
but actually, I'm in the driver's seat.

211
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,179
Right. That's it.

212
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,140
Dr. Yoo In-won is our only hope.

213
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:36,894
I also understand why he had to do this,
but we should take the lead.

214
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,771
That's right.

215
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,440
Let's get out of here first

216
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,484
and take down Larva and Tae-man.

217
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,569
We should be stronger than them.

218
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,238
But what if Larva refuses
to continue his research?

219
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,116
Larva and Yoo Tae-man would never do that.

220
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,952
I don't know what they're thinking,

221
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,746
but they're desperate just like me.

222
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,624
Whatever that is, all that matters
is that Min-ah comes back.

223
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,376
You're right.

224
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,920
But what do we do about this?

225
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,466
It was a mistake
to lock me up in a place like this.

226
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,802
Did you forget who I am?

227
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,555
They used to call me
the Neighborhood MacGyver.

228
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,766
I'm going to make a thermite flamethrower.

229
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,771
A racing bike is made
with flammable magnesium

230
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,815
that is light and durable.

231
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:28,237
When ignited with a mixture
of metal powder and metal oxide,

232
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,572
it instantly generates
a high heat of 3,000 degrees.

233
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,037
I'll use the emergency flare to ignite it.

234
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,001
There!

235
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,178
Dude, going somewhere?

236
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,097
To the convenience store.

237
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,932
A great place for kids your age.

238
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,143
Are you taking the bike? Is it far?

239
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,478
MacGyver wouldn't talk so loudly.

240
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,646
You heard us.

241
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,149
You heard from outside?

242
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:06,942
No way.

243
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,236
Thunder!

244
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,832
It even has a name?

245
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,625
So you're Thunder!

246
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,960
It's really well-made.

247
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,378
It's like your Pokémon.

248
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,297
Can it also shoot electricity?

249
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,140
It's versatile.

250
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,017
Just don't try to do anything.

251
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,269
You'll get really hurt next time.

252
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,814
If you don't let us go,
the police will look for us.

253
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,941
I'll send texts with your phone.
Don't worry.

254
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,277
Don't do that,
or it'll be reported to the police.

255
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,363
Do you think I came here
without a backup plan?

256
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:57,201
You will get in trouble
if the police find us tied up like this.

257
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,871
Dr. Yoo is our only hope anyway.

258
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:04,083
We will wait here quietly,
so get rid of this at least!

259
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,918
I'm sure my uncle has a plan.

260
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,669
He probably won't take long.

261
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,588
Get some rest in the meantime.

262
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,928
What backup plan?

263
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,555
Thunder's still here.

264
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,755
MORE THAN MACHINES

265
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,428
Good mor--

266
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,056
I came in 20 minutes late like a boss.

267
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,475
I guess they won.

268
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,357
What the heck?

269
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,068
Way to start the day
by reading a bunch of nonsense.

270
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,238
I'm free!

271
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,577
It's fun playing under the radar.

272
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,537
Not fun to play out in the open.

273
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,500
KO BAEK-JOONG

274
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,047
The person you're calling is unavailable…

275
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,050
KO BAEK-JOONG
I'M IN A MEETING, PLEASE LEAVE A TEXT

276
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,803
Wait. Something's off.

277
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,433
This doesn't sound like them.
And they rarely text me.

278
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,437
How unusual. Something must've happened.

279
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,272
In that case…

280
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,195
I should go to the sauna
before they come back.

281
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,868
WE'RE GOING ON A BUSINESS TRIP
TO GET MATERIALS

282
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:45,953
IT MIGHT BE DANGEROUS

283
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,205
SO CALL THE POLICE
IF WE'RE NOT BACK IN TWO DAYS

284
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,790
ADDRESS: MOUNT 21, CHANGCHEONG-RI

285
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,375
BAEKJUNG CHICKEN NUGGET

286
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,518
Are you going to stay like that?

287
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,189
You didn't do it on purpose. It's okay.

288
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,691
Do you really think so?

289
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,196
You can't undo it anyway.

290
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,416
Fuck. Should I bring that crazy bird?

291
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,568
NOBLEMAN'S CHICKEN NUGGET

292
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,500
It suddenly disappeared.

293
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,338
I'm tired of this now.

294
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:21,673
Let's go.

295
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:26,678
Where?

296
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,847
Where should we go?

297
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,682
You know where.

298
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,770
Baekjung Chicken Nugget?

299
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,772
On Earth?

300
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,024
Enough. Stop that.

301
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,360
Let's go.

302
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,949
Slow down!

303
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,218
No.

304
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,971
-What are you going to do?
-What do you mean?

305
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,766
It was a person.

306
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:13,767
What about us?

307
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,061
What are we?

308
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,489
Do some work at least.
We're short-staffed.

309
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,203
"Chicken Nugget Rhapsody"?

310
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,705
Watch it.
It's weird as fuck, but it's addictive.

311
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,042
What the fuck is that?
A bunch of nuggets singing a rhapsody?

312
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:42,003
"Chicken Nugget Rhapsody"
is the fucking title, you dumbass!

313
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,132
Shit, just stuff your fucking face
with this, dumbass.

314
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:48,677
Stop the fucking lovers' tiff.
Let's just check it out.

315
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,680
CHICKEN NUGGET RHAPSODY

316
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,099
Fuck. It has a lot of views.

317
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,521
Is he a fucking genius?

318
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,857
I told you! This shit's fucking lit!

319
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,529
My heart feels like it's going to burst…

320
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,780
Hey, it's that guy!

321
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,365
What guy, you crazy bitch?

322
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,202
I told you someone was singing
while walking down the street, remember?

323
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,954
-Yeah.
-That's him!

324
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,789
That friggin' nerd was him?

325
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,374
Shit, that's fucking sick!

326
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,669
I know, right?
No wonder he fucking caught my eye.

327
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,796
This asshole looks like
that antiseptic guy.

328
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,341
Excuse me, could you keep it down?
There are other customers here too.

329
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:32,721
And stop swearing. Do you have to say
"fuck" and "shit" all the time?

330
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,014
Yes.

331
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,474
You're fucking right we do.

332
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,058
We're fucking sorry, damn it.

333
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,064
-What a fucking boomer.
-It's okay. They're just kids.

334
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,859
Who is he calling "kids"? So annoying.

335
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,903
-Don't do it.
-Are you gonna flip the table?

336
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,404
So we won't have to pay, then.

337
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,114
We're almost done eating anyway.

338
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:54,117
Let's stop. This could hold me back
when I'm a fucking big shot.

339
00:24:54,618 --> 00:25:00,040
I found it!

340
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:03,293
You can't be rude to customers
just because you're so popular!

341
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,045
Guys, just say sorry!

342
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,963
We're sorry!

343
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:10,884
This person…

344
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,428
Could you give him this note?

345
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,850
MY DAUGHTER TURNED INTO A CHICKEN NUGGET

346
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,143
I was foolish.

347
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,103
He was here before.

348
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,691
But can it turn a person
into a chicken nugget?

349
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,698
Out of ingredients already?

350
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,534
They do this all the time.

351
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,369
I know, right? Stupid chicken nuggets.

352
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:43,041
I'd cross the universe for it

353
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,005
If this is what love feels like

354
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,174
I need you back

355
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:55,220
Even if you need to cross the universe

356
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:59,891
I can't let you go like this

357
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:04,896
Please come back as if nothing happened

358
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:11,236
I need you back
Please come back

359
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:17,242
I need you back
Please come back

360
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:23,540
I need you back
Please come back

361
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,877
I need you back

362
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,629
I'll wait for you

363
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:59,701
All I want to be honest with
Is this feeling I have

364
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:05,874
Even if the bitterness comes
After the sweetness

365
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:11,004
I think of you day and night

366
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:17,552
I can't give up on my growing hope

367
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:24,017
I'll fold this order form
With my confession written on it

368
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,479
And I'll throw it to you

369
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:30,482
I'm now confessing my love

370
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,986
I'd cross the universe for it

371
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:41,284
If this is what love feels like

372
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,411
I need you back

373
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,207
Even if you need to cross the universe

374
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:52,087
I can't let you go like this

375
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:56,925
Please come back as if nothing happened

376
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:03,431
I need you back
Please come back

377
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:09,479
I need you back
Please come back

378
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:15,902
I need you back
Please come back

379
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,948
I need you back

380
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,200
I'll wait for you

381
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:29,249
Let me describe
The taste of my secret crush

382
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:35,797
It was dry but also moist
So I can never forget it
