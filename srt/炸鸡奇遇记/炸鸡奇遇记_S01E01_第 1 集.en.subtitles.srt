1
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:27,087
WHAT IS IT LIKE
TO LIVE AS A CHICKEN NUGGET?

2
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:32,092
At first, I thought
my whole body was paralyzed.

3
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,429
"So this is how it feels to be paralyzed."

4
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,849
"Like I'm deep-fried in oil
and covered in starch syrup."

5
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,185
That's how I felt.

6
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,520
And lethargic too.

7
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,148
WHICH IS HARDER?

8
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:51,236
TO LIVE AS A CHICKEN NUGGET FOR 5 DAYS
OR AS A HUMAN FOR 50 YEARS?

9
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,949
By the way, am I a human or a chicken?

10
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,367
I'm not even a chicken.

11
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,036
I'm just a piece of fried chicken meat.

12
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:05,917
HOW WOULD YOU HAVE ANSWERED THE QUESTION?

13
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,421
"Although you can't hear my voice,

14
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,882
I respect your decision."

15
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,562
Every time I think about you

16
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,648
I sing this song

17
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:35,155
I wasn't going to sing this song…

18
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:38,366
Hey, someone is actually singing
while walking down the street.

19
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,201
I don't know the song.

20
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,370
I'm just surprised to see it.

21
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,956
I need to get my mind straight

22
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,917
I need to hide my feelings…

23
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,461
Now he's dancing.
He's not your average weirdo.

24
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,298
Today, I'm pressing your number again

25
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,885
I'm pressing it, so remember

26
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,104
Maybe a melody came to mind.

27
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,649
Now he's writing on music paper.
Perhaps he's a songwriter?

28
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,612
Why am I still looking at him?

29
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:17,864
Dunno.

30
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,493
It's sad, but I can't stop watching.
It's quite enjoyable.

31
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,544
Why are you staring at me?

32
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,714
It's hard not to when you're doing that.

33
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:36,716
Good point!

34
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,555
I wasn't going to sing this song

35
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,308
I wasn't going to sing it, not today

36
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,147
Strange, but I can't stop watching.

37
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,734
Norang Tongdak, Kyochon Soy Garlic

38
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,820
Golden Original, Pepper Crispy
Pelicana Seasoned, Bburinkle

39
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,990
Let's take one of each
Chicken platter

40
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,242
MORE THAN MACHINES

41
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,411
Can I have one of each?
Chicken platter

42
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,581
Can anyone make a platter
And sell it to me?

43
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,838
Can anyone make a platter
And sell it to me?

44
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,423
Sell it to me?

45
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:43,866
Hello.

46
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,878
Good morning, sir.

47
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,174
Same outfit as usual, Mr. Ko.

48
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,468
You don't own multiple sets, do you?

49
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,388
You're right. I have seven sets in total.

50
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,807
Why ruin your looks with that outfit?

51
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,684
Because I want to express myself.

52
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,854
You're not expressing anything
if you have to explain it.

53
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,939
You've never paid me this much attention.

54
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,524
Does this mean you approve of me?

55
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,612
As you know, I'm not an ambitious man,
so I'm already living my dream.

56
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:25,366
My only dream was to get by,
maintain the status quo,

57
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,578
and stay away from any incidents
until the day I die.

58
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,789
But the sight of those yellow pants
is a major incident to me.

59
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,207
I do have red ones at home.

60
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,295
I guess this was a minor incident, then.

61
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,180
That's the machine Mr. Kim sent.

62
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,223
But he only sent it yesterday.

63
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,434
-It was here when I came in--
-Good morning.

64
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,977
How is this a good morning?

65
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:58,274
What's good about earning a lousy wage
at a company that has no vision?

66
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,275
It was a greeting.

67
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,660
Says the man
with lousy skills and no vision

68
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,372
who has no chance of getting another job.

69
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,123
But you still turned up on time.

70
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,549
Lousy company!

71
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,385
-Staff with lousy skills--
-Stop it.

72
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,180
Don't be inappropriate.

73
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,932
Was everything else appropriate?

74
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,017
Sorry, sir.

75
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,769
Now, let's get to work.

76
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,118
It's lunchtime.

77
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,661
Okay.

78
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,456
-Enjoy your meals.
-Are you not having lunch?

79
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,250
My daughter will be here.

80
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,296
Min-ah's coming?

81
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:21,899
Min-ah.

82
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,365
I have a question for you.

83
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:34,954
I'm asking this to see
what women in their 20s prefer.

84
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,958
What qualities do you look for in a man?

85
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,420
First, a kind heart.

86
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,088
A kind heart.

87
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,175
Second, a good-looking face
that everyone likes.

88
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,759
Third, a sexy, grown-up bod.

89
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:53,764
Sexy and grown-up.

90
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:59,145
Your first preference
would be your most important one,

91
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,899
but are you okay with a man
who only has a kind heart?

92
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,317
What I meant was,

93
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,903
a kind heart is useless
without the face and bod.

94
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:11,866
Sure.

95
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,365
I'm hopeless.

96
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,419
Baby

97
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:09,966
Please don't leave me

98
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:15,346
I'm withering like a dried-up flower

99
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:21,102
I remember the days
When I was a pretty bloom

100
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:23,938
Baek-joong.

101
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,399
Baek-joong?

102
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,400
Let's go.

103
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,653
I'm thinking about going on a diet.

104
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:35,908
Are you? So I won't have to look
at your faces when I eat today?

105
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,911
My appetite is waking up
like a bear's after winter.

106
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,254
BAEKJUNG CHICKEN NUGGET
TAKEOUT ONLY

107
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,433
-Dad.
-Hey, you're here!

108
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,145
-I have to use the toilet.
-Okay.

109
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,025
Hi, Min-ah.

110
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,322
Where should I look?

111
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,365
At my forearms, please.

112
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,626
Please stop. They might snap.

113
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,553
Are they Baekjung chicken nuggets?

114
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,971
BAEKJUNG CHICKEN NUGGET

115
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,352
These nuggets are good cold, too,

116
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,687
so keep the leftovers
in the fridge for later.

117
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,105
This is a rare treat.

118
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,358
The line's always long,
and they don't deliver.

119
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,819
It's strange.
This was the go-to place in Seoul.

120
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,865
Most shops make it big in the suburbs
then move to Seoul, but not this one.

121
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,701
The high rents in Seoul are discouraging.

122
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,829
I heard they were doing
well enough to expand.

123
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,248
Some burn out after a successful run.

124
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,708
Is that a thing?

125
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,211
We're worrying
about rich people, you know.

126
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,963
We are! How pointless.

127
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,009
I'll bring you nuggets every now and then.

128
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:19,970
Every now and then?

129
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,266
May I ask

130
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,062
how you define "every now and then"?

131
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:32,942
Often?

132
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,235
Often.

133
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,321
How do you define "often"?

134
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,033
When you're craving it.

135
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,627
You see, I'm into good-looking guys.

136
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,630
I'm aware.

137
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,882
You may not know
how to become good-looking…

138
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,802
Well, I'm not against plastic surgery--

139
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,429
…but you're on your way.

140
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,430
What?

141
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,477
Hey, what's that cabinet doing out here?

142
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,479
The design isn't finished yet.

143
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,898
It's a machine
that helps you recover from fatigue.

144
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,401
-I want to try.
-What?

145
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,737
I only had 14 hours of sleep,
so I'm tired.

146
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,198
Oh, you only had 14 hours of sleep.

147
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,744
She must be tired.

148
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,583
You didn't tell me
what it is that I'm doing.

149
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:35,337
You might not have the ability
to change your face,

150
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,423
but you change how others see you.

151
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,801
You're doing your best
at something along those lines.

152
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,137
With all due respect, I don't understand.

153
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,513
Think about it.

154
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,103
How does this work?

155
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,023
Where's the switch?

156
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,818
Is this it?

157
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,955
Hey, it's not plugged in yet.

158
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,124
Does it have a battery?

159
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,627
Min-ah, are you making that sound?

160
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,004
Hold on, I'll try and connect--

161
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:19,548
Chicken nugget!

162
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,054
Min-ah!

163
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,058
Min-ah!

164
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,065
Why are you looking for Min-ah in here?

165
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,775
Min-ah.

166
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:38,901
Min-ah?

167
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,446
Stop playing around.
I'm hungry. Let's go for lunch.

168
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:44,657
Min-ah?

169
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,575
Choi Min-ah?

170
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,870
Min-ah.

171
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,873
Who are you calling Min-ah?

172
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,794
I mean, that's not a who. What are you--

173
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,212
If you can hear me,

174
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,842
try rolling over to the side.

175
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,305
Or try and shake off
one of your sesame seeds.

176
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,057
Is that too difficult?

177
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,851
Can you do anything?

178
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,018
-Hello?
-Hey, Kim.

179
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,103
What is it?

180
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,938
About the machine you sent us…

181
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,356
I haven't sent it yet.

182
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,357
You haven't?

183
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,777
It was pouring down yesterday,
so I was going to deliver it in person.

184
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,862
Then what's this?

185
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,239
What? Never mind.

186
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,367
He didn't send this?

187
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,744
But…

188
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,291
What kind of machine
doesn't have a serial number?

189
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,462
Min-ah.

190
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,631
-Why are you doing that?
-Call her name.

191
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,342
-What?
-You try calling her.

192
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,468
She might answer.

193
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,054
-Are you mad?
-We have to do something! Go!

194
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,643
Mi…

195
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,478
Min-ah.

196
00:14:59,023 --> 00:14:59,857
Again.

197
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,775
-Min-ah.
-Louder!

198
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,068
Min-ah!

199
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,075
You got a feeling it was her, right?

200
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,201
I don't know.

201
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,787
I just don't…

202
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,414
I don't know.

203
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,419
You brought this machine inside, right?

204
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,630
Yes, I found it outside this morning.

205
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,132
-You didn't check the sender?
-I thought it was Mr. Kim.

206
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,801
There has to be an invoice!
Where's the box?

207
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,553
The box? The recycling dump!

208
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,514
Watch it!

209
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,767
Place her down.

210
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,477
You're wiping her sauce off!

211
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:37,853
I'm sorry.

212
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,229
Min-ah.

213
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,191
Min-ah!

214
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,506
Wow, chicken nuggets?

215
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,928
Baekjung chicken nuggets, no less!

216
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,974
What a rare sight in this office.

217
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,108
There's nothing on it.
You didn't see anything?

218
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,026
I didn't check it at the time,

219
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,654
but why would someone
have taken the invoice?

220
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,698
There's no sign of stickers
having come off.

221
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,492
If it wasn't from a courier,
then who sent it, and why?

222
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,412
THE GIRL YOU'RE FLIRTING WITH
TURNS INTO A CHICKEN NUGGET

223
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,622
I'm searching for the machine,

224
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,000
but I can't find anything like it.

225
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,256
Just admit this was a prank,

226
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,842
and I'll let you off
with a cute pinch on your cheek.

227
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,390
What was that for?!

228
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,226
This is not a dream. Wake up!

229
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,860
Is it really not a dream?

230
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,779
Most definitely not!

231
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,576
Then who left this here? For what?

232
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,911
First, let's check the security cam.

233
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,580
-Security cam?
-Yes.

234
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,998
Security cam?

235
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,797
I thought you were out for lunch.

236
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,215
Where is my daughter?

237
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,760
Am I supposed to know where she is?

238
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:33,927
She was right here.

239
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,222
No, I mean, the chicken nugget!

240
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,350
-It was here, so I--
-You ate it?

241
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,643
No!

242
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,312
Don't say that!

243
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,357
Did you eat it?

244
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,526
Did you?

245
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,611
Did you really?

246
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,279
Min-ah!

247
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,782
-Well, it was--
-Min-ah!

248
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,785
It was right here on the table, so I--

249
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,079
Savage! Cannibal! Piranha!

250
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,955
Hamster!

251
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,461
What the heck? Are you doing a sketch?

252
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:08,796
A sketch?

253
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,048
A sketch?

254
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,426
If you'd lost someone precious,

255
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,762
would you describe this reaction
as a sketch?

256
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,722
Look at him with your own eyes!

257
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,725
Can't you see fatherly love in action?

258
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,521
Can't you see a man's pure affection?

259
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,356
What's the matter with you?

260
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,239
SURGERY/DELIVERY

261
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:46,750
Honey, it's Min-ah.

262
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,381
JO A-HYE

263
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:13,485
Hi, Mommy. How have you been?

264
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,030
I'm not getting any better
at tying her hair.

265
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,076
I think I should make a tool for it.

266
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,673
FOR MIN-AH ONLY

267
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,591
Here.

268
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,599
Ta-da!

269
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,100
So pretty!

270
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,319
-Can I help you?
-Yes, well…

271
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,779
My daughter…

272
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,365
she started her period.

273
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,783
She's about this tall.

274
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,952
I don't need to know that.
Hang on a second.

275
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,464
Min-ah, let's eat.

276
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,965
-Is it ready?
-Yeah.

277
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,383
Can't wait!

278
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,260
Can't wait!

279
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,680
Ta-da!

280
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,035
Bring her back!

281
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,745
Bring her back!

282
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,705
Bring the nugget back!

283
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,123
What about the nugget?

284
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,377
How can you do this to me?

285
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,881
I get paid so badly that I considered
bringing packed lunches,

286
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,718
but I didn't because I was scared
of being a loner in a three-man company!

287
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,805
And you've never treated us to a meal
like a real boss!

288
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:08,850
When I saw the nuggets, I thought,
"I didn't know this place had perks."

289
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,687
"But I should wait
until the boss and Baek-joong get back."

290
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,855
So I put them in the fridge!

291
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,941
Min-ah!

292
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,988
How dare you treat me like this
over some nuggets?

293
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,531
How much are they?

294
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,615
16,000 won?

295
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,243
Fine! Not cheap. I get it!

296
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,622
Cup noodles.

297
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,875
-Min-ah!
-Min-ah.

298
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,047
I see more than 20 nuggets-- No.

299
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,967
More than 20 Min-ahs.

300
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:49,975
Min-ah.

301
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:51,810
Don't worry, sir.

302
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,937
I can find her.

303
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,272
I remember this for sure.

304
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,190
On Min-ah's coating,

305
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,359
there were exactly three sesame seeds.

306
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,531
But the seeds could have gotten stuck
to the other nuggets.

307
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:11,246
No. The nuggets are coated
with starch syrup that has high viscosity.

308
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,956
Cold nuggets are stickier.

309
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,500
You could say they're glued together.

310
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,129
Careful now.

311
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,264
See?

312
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,515
Are you sure?

313
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,392
Three sesame seeds?

314
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,935
I'm certain.

315
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:34,853
Then

316
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,565
we have to find the one with three seeds.

317
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,484
One, two, three.

318
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,778
All 20 nuggets… No.

319
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,238
All 20 Min-ahs have three sesame seeds.

320
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,825
That's impossible!
Seeds are randomly sprinkled.

321
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,621
How can all of them have three seeds?
Were they intentionally placed?

322
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,831
-I'm wondering the same thing.
-Move aside!

323
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,136
Not this one either.

324
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,100
Min-ah takes moisturizing very seriously,

325
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,851
but this one's too dry.

326
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,064
Not this one.

327
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,194
Let's look closely at their colors.

328
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:27,656
I think she might be paler
than the other nuggets.

329
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,074
It's cold in the fridge.

330
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,578
Min-ah

331
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,915
is very sensitive to the cold.

332
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,459
My girl.

333
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,505
It must have been cold for you.

334
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,091
Min-ah.

335
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,894
Min-ah.

336
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,743
I'm dying to know what they're up to,

337
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,955
but it feels kind of nice to be left out.

338
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,791
Security cam!

339
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,961
-Let me see it.
-Yes, sir.

340
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,346
What's he doing?

341
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,307
Show your face, man.

342
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,185
There! He's looking!

343
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,190
What?

344
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,109
"Fucking asshole."

345
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,572
Is he swearing?

346
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,907
-I think so.
-Why?

347
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,366
Because no one's coming out?

348
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,411
We can't work nights
for a fucking midnight delivery.

349
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,205
Please don't swear.

350
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,873
But that guy's so selfish!

351
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,708
See? Then he just takes off.

352
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,341
Wait. He's vaguely familiar.

353
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,761
-Don't you know him?
-What do you think?

354
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,346
We have to find out who he is.

355
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,556
Are you asking me to pretend that I know?

356
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,978
Boss, don't you think
we should report this to the police?

357
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,940
-Let's say you're a cop.
-Okay.

358
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,817
A man calls to say
his kid's turned into a nugget.

359
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:28,735
What would you do?

360
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:29,903
I'd gently hang up.

361
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:34,533
Let's say they investigate it
and believe us. What would happen next?

362
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,803
Min-ah! Daddy's sorry!

363
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,891
-I'm going to clock out now.
-Okay.

364
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,519
Forget about what happened earlier.

365
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,063
These nuggets aren't edible, after all.

366
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,816
I don't care
if they're edible or ornamental.

367
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:08,733
Bye, then.

368
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,819
Goodbye, sir.

369
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,159
Out-toeing?

370
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,329
A severe case of out-toeing?

371
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,457
-Out-toeing?
-What are you muttering about?

372
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,792
I've seen it before.

373
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,836
-Out-toeing.
-Out-toeing?

374
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,254
Out-toeing!

375
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,132
Why does this song come to my mind?

376
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,633
-What song?
-You know.

377
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,886
Remember the song I sang to you?

378
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,764
The jingle I made for the company.

379
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,349
Boss.

380
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,313
I've made a song
to help promote the company.

381
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:49,524
You've made a song
for a company that makes machines?

382
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,067
So talented yet untalented.

383
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,486
Well, let's hear it.

384
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,404
Okay.

385
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,495
A corporate man on the fast track

386
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,581
Envied by everyone else

387
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:08,335
Great at his job
But he left to start his own business

388
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,587
An employee and an intern

389
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,839
And the boss who envies both of them

390
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,300
Now sing the song
that will help my company.

391
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,053
More than Machines

392
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,430
We build machines
We need R&D

393
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,724
More than Machines!

394
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:28,647
Okay!

395
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,440
I endured it yet again.

396
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,275
Now explain it.

397
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:36,029
I know who this person is.
