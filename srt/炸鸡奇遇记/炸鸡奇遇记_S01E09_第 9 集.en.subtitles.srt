1
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,374
-Fire.
-Growl.

2
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,418
Fire.

3
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,545
-Growl.
-Fire.

4
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,800
All right.
They are surely threatened by now.

5
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,767
I see you two are confronting each other.

6
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,852
But do not dare to fight us.

7
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,062
As you just saw,

8
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,939
we are significantly powerful.

9
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,483
What was it that we saw?

10
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,777
But we have no intentions of harming you.

11
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,903
Harm us how?

12
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:10,862
Don't be scared.

13
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:11,780
Don't be scared.

14
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,323
-Of what?
-What do you want?

15
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,908
Why are you here?

16
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,705
Are you here because of the machines?

17
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,165
Do you know about them?

18
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,835
Of course.

19
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,295
Because they are ours.

20
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,675
You've visited our restaurant.
Did your child turn into a chicken nugget?

21
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,177
So you know how they work?

22
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,971
-I told you that they are ours.
-What's going on now?

23
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:40,475
-Are you the owners of these machines?
-Yes, we are.

24
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,935
Did you make them?

25
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,812
Our race did.

26
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,063
Race?

27
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,274
-That's bullshit.
-Are you humans?

28
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,069
Kind of.

29
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,237
Answer my question!

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,739
We are hu--
I mean, we are much like humans.

31
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,741
Why are you even asking that?

32
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,244
And what do you mean by
"much like humans"?

33
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,996
Lies. The owners of these machines
cannot be human.

34
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,500
Okay, that's enough!
We need to take them down too.

35
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,377
We have significant power!

36
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,545
You saw it!

37
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,546
Saw what?

38
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,547
Don't be scared!

39
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,465
-Don't be scared.
-Of what?

40
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,925
Just take those assholes down!

41
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,176
Quiet!

42
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,011
Yoo Tae-man, Larva,

43
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,013
and you. Everyone shut up.

44
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,182
I'm capable of anything right now.

45
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,978
You lot, tell me straight.

46
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,021
They're lying. The owners can't be human.

47
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,566
Mr. Choi, let's tie them up first.

48
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,693
And just wait patiently.

49
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,111
Trust me, for goodness' sake!

50
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,487
Uncle, you're full of shit.

51
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,198
No one would trust a man
who makes a weird flag and prays.

52
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,952
You pretended to be a Christian
and tried to take your brother's body!

53
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,704
Zip it, or I'll kick your ass!

54
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,456
Those sons of bitches. I knew it!

55
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,376
You crazy bastards!
A person's life is in danger!

56
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,880
Everything will be back in its place
when we find the machines' owners.

57
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,090
The whole world will change!

58
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,467
Stop already, you crazy old geezer!

59
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,469
We need to take those pricks down first!

60
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,347
I'm going to deal with you two first.
No, I'll kill you.

61
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,349
-I'm going to kill you!
-Wait! Stop!

62
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:08,313
I mean, we can prove
that we are the owners of those machines!

63
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,315
All right. Let's calm down.

64
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:13,151
Okay. Let's see. Go ahead!

65
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,529
But we need the others
tied up as hostages.

66
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,865
Look what happened to my daughter.

67
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,367
What if they're
just a bunch of crazy bastards?

68
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,621
Do you have any other way?
You can't do anything by yourself!

69
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,291
Why is your daughter still stuck
as a chicken nugget?

70
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,960
-The machines won't work.
-You don't know how to use them!

71
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,256
I'm telling you that I will do it for you.

72
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,558
We are…

73
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,812
what earthlings call aliens.

74
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,899
Aliens who've been living as earthlings.

75
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,390
Let's look in the Socheon River first.

76
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,476
How big is the Socheon River?

77
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,436
Smaller than the Han River.

78
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,939
Great. Then it won't take long.

79
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,524
About 500 years?

80
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,485
Let's eat first.
I grabbed this from the courtesan house.

81
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:41,114
This is supposed to be
the most delicious thing on Earth.

82
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,573
Here.

83
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,800
Holy fuck, these taste awful!

84
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:04,304
Try some more.
We need to get used to their food.

85
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,222
You are totally an earthling now.

86
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,558
You say the word "fuck" quite fluently.

87
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,810
Because I am a fucking earthling.

88
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,687
Motherfucker.

89
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,147
Did you practice too?

90
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,525
Earthlings are still very foulmouthed.

91
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,236
What's the use
of having a beautiful alphabet?

92
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,698
Let's not get used to speaking like this.

93
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,534
I don't think
I'll get used to this food either.

94
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,287
When can we go home?

95
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,122
How long do you think it will take?

96
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,791
200 years.

97
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,793
It's been over 200 years.

98
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,213
We are earthlings,
and, at the same time, aliens.

99
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,633
When you import cows
and raise them here for a few months,

100
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,927
you call them domestic.
It's something like that.

101
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,471
Domestic aliens.

102
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,432
No. Earth aliens…

103
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,060
Earth human? What?

104
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,145
-What are we?
-Stop!

105
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,607
A person's life is at stake here,
and your greed has caused this madness!

106
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,609
I'm not doing this for my own greed!

107
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,028
I'm trying to save the world.

108
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:05,865
The world you live in
and that your children will live in!

109
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,034
Stop being so delusional!

110
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,327
Aliens?

111
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,037
Yes, aliens.

112
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,165
That was one of the possibilities
I considered.

113
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,958
Good.

114
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,377
Then prove it.

115
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,628
Fucking hell!

116
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,671
Something beyond human capability.

117
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,298
Show me that thing!

118
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,716
You said you are aliens!

119
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,636
Go ahead! Take us down, then!

120
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,845
We can't do that.

121
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:32,183
We're not allowed to use more power
than the earthlings whilst on Earth.

122
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,894
If we break that rule, we'll be punished.

123
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:42,527
A crazy uncle, a crazy nephew,
and four crazy aliens.

124
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,570
They all went insane over those machines.

125
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,240
-We need to take them all down.
-I agree with you.

126
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,491
That's too bad!

127
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,578
Because I'm thinking the same.

128
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,706
It won't be easy.

129
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,291
Do you think you can beat us?

130
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,836
Can humans beat robots?

131
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,255
-A dad sure can.
-Enough!

132
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,174
If you keep this up,
we will have to use our power.

133
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,592
We might end up harming you!

134
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,344
Harm us, for goodness' sake!

135
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,054
Let's first turn the nugget into…

136
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,306
No, turn the person into…

137
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:16,227
Let's just turn things back to how
they were. Shouldn't that come first?

138
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,772
I'll go and have a look.

139
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:20,773
Don't move!

140
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,858
These are mine!

141
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,568
A human can't own those machines!

142
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,570
I'll take care of that old lunatic.

143
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,197
I'll take care
of that old-looking young lunatic.

144
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,491
Let's take them down first.

145
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,661
Thunder.

146
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,998
I did warn you!

147
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,082
Please listen!

148
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,334
I said we can prove it!

149
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,211
Let's bring the person back first!

150
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,715
Do you wage war
before looking for a solution?

151
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,925
Is that your way?

152
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,135
That is too foolish!

153
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:54,182
You humans always drive your friends
and family into the battlefield like this

154
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,393
and feed the greed
of those who avoid death!

155
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,242
Am I wrong?

156
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,119
This is no good.

157
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,663
I don't think they're going to listen.

158
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,501
If we end up using our power,
they'll get hurt, and we'll get punished.

159
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,418
What do we do?

160
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,962
We cannot intervene
in a war among earthlings.

161
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,757
As always, let's stay away from the fight
as much as we can.

162
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,091
Don't let them attack us.

163
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,426
Please help my daughter.

164
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,427
Threaten them!

165
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,725
Missile!

166
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,397
Missile!

167
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,402
A missile
is the most fearful thing on Earth.

168
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,781
Missile!

169
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,789
Nuclear!

170
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,124
Missile!

171
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,047
Nuclear!

172
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,758
You've got to make it specific.

173
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,803
Missile!

174
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:15,805
Nuclear!

175
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:19,976
Nuclear!

176
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,812
Missile!

177
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:24,897
Deer!

178
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,778
-What the fuck?
-A deer?

179
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,197
If I were a deer, wouldn't that scare you?

180
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,325
Missile!

181
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,119
-Go away.
-Nuclear!

182
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,954
Missile!

183
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,498
BTS.

184
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,292
BTS.

185
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,961
No one on Earth can mess with BTS.

186
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:54,844
BTS.

187
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,388
Fuck, I almost danced along.

188
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,433
Missile!

189
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,143
-Nuclear!
-Deer!

190
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,811
Missile!

191
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,314
-Deer!
-Missile!

192
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,732
-Nuclear!
-Deer!

193
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,400
Tie up these assholes!

194
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,611
Die!

195
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,839
Tae-man!

196
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,759
Deer!

197
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,991
Deer!

198
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,660
Shit.

199
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,995
Are you okay?

200
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,624
Are you okay?

201
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,439
Missile!

202
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,012
Deer!

203
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,322
Epicyon!

204
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,416
Boss!

205
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,267
They're here.

206
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,644
They're here!

207
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,327
No!

208
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,247
Are you crazy?

209
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,124
You can't attack humans!

210
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,626
We should go home.

211
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,378
Let's go home now.

212
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,296
No.

213
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,298
My daughter.

214
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:25,883
No!

215
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,052
Boss!

216
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,810
Stop it!

217
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,812
If you attack humans,

218
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,482
you'll be left alone
on the Planet of Darkness forever!

219
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,399
It's okay.

220
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,152
I've already killed a human.

221
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,988
That was an accident.
There was room for forgiveness!

222
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,451
Look at the machines.

223
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,663
They ran out of energy.
They won't work anymore.

224
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:59,083
If we go to the way station,
we can use the emergency energy just once.

225
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,585
As I need to get punished,

226
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,462
I'll go first.

227
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:07,216
I'll let them know the situation here.
They will come to take you back.

228
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,133
Then…

229
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,931
Are you going to live here?
We have no choice.

230
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,559
I'll take responsibility for everything.

231
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,936
Bullshit.

232
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,649
All right.

233
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,151
Whether you're aliens,

234
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,113
God, or whatever,

235
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,739
you're saying

236
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,659
the machines will work one last time.

237
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,576
Step back.

238
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,328
I also have things to protect.

239
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,496
Then kill me.

240
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,581
That's the only way to stop me.

241
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,460
There's no way in hell I'm backing down!

242
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,758
If the machines are yours…

243
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,013
aren't you accountable for them?

244
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,431
You caused an accident,

245
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,100
but all you care about
is saving your own neck.

246
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,602
That doesn't make any sense!

247
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,147
Stop!

248
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,481
You have to stop!

249
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,816
We need to go back.

250
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,027
At least you guys can go home.

251
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,409
Stop!

252
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,434
Why?

253
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,727
Drained already?

254
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,082
You savage bastards.

255
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,750
Don't even dare to defeat them!

256
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,252
They are our masters!

257
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,549
Bring my daughter back.

258
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,017
They also have families.

259
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,018
You bastard.

260
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,020
So what?

261
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,356
So what?

262
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,608
Bring my daughter back!

263
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,568
Stop!

264
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,695
Please stop it!

265
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,323
Mister, I have an idea.

266
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,700
There is a way.

267
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,660
Man.

268
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,496
Damn those fuckers.

269
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:50,087
Baekjung takes your daughter
to our planet.

270
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,549
There he turns your daughter
back into herself,

271
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,593
and she can come back here
along with those who will fetch us.

272
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,554
Do you expect me to believe that?

273
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,721
You can believe us.

274
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,682
It only takes one day.

275
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,641
One day?

276
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,894
But

277
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:10,524
a day on our planet is 50 years on Earth.

278
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,484
You're insane!

279
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,694
At least…

280
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,240
your daughter won't die.

281
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,661
We have families too!

282
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,414
We also have our home.

283
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,166
We feel love too.

284
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,459
We love our family.

285
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,128
We love friends.

286
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,339
-And our lovers--
-Stop!

287
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,134
You crazy jerks.

288
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,218
I'll be

289
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,182
105 years old 50 years from now!

290
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,560
We've been stuck here for 200 years.

291
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,355
We can't harm any life.

292
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,065
We can't lie either.

293
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,027
That's the way we've evolved.

294
00:19:56,486 --> 00:20:00,157
They'll… bring your daughter back
for sure.

295
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,077
If she comes back after we die,
it's like she's already dead to us.

296
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,996
Even if she does come back,

297
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,291
we will be dead to her!

298
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,710
We're sorry!

299
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,213
We're sorry.

300
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,473
Min-ah is all I have.

301
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,477
I was just…

302
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,564
I was just living with my daughter.

303
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,485
But you disrupted our lives!

304
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,364
Poor Min-ah.

305
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,117
She didn't do anything wrong.

306
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,412
She is such a sweet girl.

307
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,250
Min-ah!

308
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,336
No! Boss, I don't think this is right.

309
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,381
Don't listen to them, boss!

310
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,759
You can't forgive them!

311
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:06,014
We have to turn Min-ah back to herself!

312
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,475
You savage bastards.

313
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,436
Who forgives who?

314
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,651
They are our masters.

315
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,162
Min-ah!

316
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,456
Min-ah! Hey!

317
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,418
Hey. How do you get these to work?

318
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,171
Come forward if you know.

319
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,549
I said come forward!

320
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,634
They don't work. They don't!

321
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,094
Shut up!

322
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:47,973
You've been looking down on me
all this time!

323
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,058
-Me?
-I can see it in your eyes!

324
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,019
No, my eyes aren't like that.

325
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,562
Calm down, Tae-man.

326
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,646
Put that down.

327
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,817
I just can't stand the way
that Yellow Pants jerk looks at me.

328
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:00,986
Hey.

329
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,031
Am I a joke to you?

330
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,115
No.

331
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,033
No, sir.

332
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,577
Mr. Yoo, I never looked at you like that.

333
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,246
I'm "Mr. Yoo" now? You fucking bastard!

334
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,956
-You're making fun of me!
-No!

335
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,083
I won't call you that, shithead!

336
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,002
I'll just stay still!

337
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,213
-Don't move!
-Stay still!

338
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,799
Hey, alien.

339
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,635
What's up with you?
You threw us around earlier.

340
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,888
Try it again. Do it!

341
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,436
You're ignoring me?

342
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,856
Am I ignored again?

343
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,526
-Again!
-No!

344
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,528
My life has been fucking miserable.

345
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,032
But I'm not that kind of person.

346
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,367
I hear you.

347
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,701
I'm not a loser.

348
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,787
Not a loser.

349
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,248
I'm a cool guy.

350
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,127
Let me show you, okay?

351
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,296
I'll show you.

352
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,717
-No!
-Min-ah!

353
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,346
Min-ah!

354
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,640
Min-ah!

355
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,937
Min-ah.

356
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,314
Min-ah, are you okay?

357
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,026
Thunder.

358
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,736
You little shit.

359
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,229
Let's go.

360
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,316
Let's go, Min-ah.

361
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:07,904
Boss.

362
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:12,659
What are you doing?

363
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,328
The way station?

364
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,081
Don't you need to go there?

365
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,130
Min-ah.

366
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,636
You'll have to travel a bit far.

367
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:34,806
My daughter.

368
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,059
Min-ah!
