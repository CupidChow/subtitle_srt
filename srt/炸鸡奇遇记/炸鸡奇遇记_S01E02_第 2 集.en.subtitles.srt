1
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,918
I know who this person is.

2
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,673
The delivery guy
from Nobleman's Chicken Nugget.

3
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,508
What an unexpected twist!

4
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,178
We ordered from them
when we were working late, right?

5
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,307
It's the deliveryman from back then.
I'm certain of it.

6
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,311
More than Machines

7
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,438
We build machines
We need R&D

8
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,690
More than Machines!

9
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,367
That was the most dreadful minute
of my time here. So impressive.

10
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,953
Let this new jingle
for our company be heard

11
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,789
by no one.

12
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,853
Sorry, we didn't hear you.

13
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,523
"More than Machines"
but no fucking doorbell, huh?

14
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,358
Enjoy.

15
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,073
Goddamn it.

16
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,414
"Fucking"?

17
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,626
Fucking.

18
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,670
Out

19
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,631
toeing

20
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,634
Out-toeing

21
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,222
Out-toeing, out-toeing

22
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,517
That's the way he's fucking walking

23
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,687
Out-toeing, out-toeing

24
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,691
My life is out-fucking-standing

25
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,570
Out-toeing

26
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,699
I was inspired by the word "fuck"

27
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,576
and his out-toeing, so I made a song

28
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,953
called "My Out-fucking-standing Life."

29
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,705
Would you like to hear it?

30
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:44,914
Fuck no.

31
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,459
Anyway, that's how I remember it.

32
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,586
It's him.

33
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,337
I'm sure of it.

34
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,340
Min-ah brought us
Baekjung Chicken Nuggets,

35
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,676
but why Nobleman's?

36
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:02,098
Why would their delivery guy
bring us this machine?

37
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,183
We'll have to ask him.

38
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,646
I mean, why the hell
would the delivery guy from Nobleman's

39
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,982
bring a machine like that here? Why here?

40
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,568
How would I know?
He was the one who brought it here!

41
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,446
-Why raise your voice?
-Only because you did it first.

42
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,114
You can't do everything I do.

43
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,493
-This doesn't make sense.
-Does anything make sense right now?

44
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:24,621
Boss.

45
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,292
Look at Min-ah.

46
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:31,920
She's a chicken.

47
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,715
No, chicken bits. She's chicken bits,

48
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,592
deep-fried and covered with sauce.

49
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:38,635
Stop!

50
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,762
Min-ah is stuck
in this unbelievable reality.

51
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,723
If we break down like this,
who will she depend on,

52
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,808
and how will she get through this?

53
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,227
Boss.

54
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,066
Until Min-ah comes back,
we only have each other.

55
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,324
I hate this, but you're right.

56
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,826
Min-ah.

57
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,828
Dad will be right back.

58
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,622
Don't touch them.

59
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,374
Where are you going, sir?

60
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,585
Nobleman's. I need to check.

61
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,630
Take me with you!

62
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,635
-Why are they already closed?
-Maybe because they're open all year.

63
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,719
That can't be.

64
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:26,432
Baekjung closes early because
they run out of ingredients quickly.

65
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,810
That's why this place
is always open till late.

66
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,687
They're no longer in business.

67
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,729
My goodness!

68
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,607
They closed down for good? Why?

69
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,984
The owner died.

70
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:36,901
What?

71
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,570
We ordered in just a few days ago.

72
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,781
-The owner died yesterday.
-Why yesterday?

73
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,993
What do you mean?
Do you have your death scheduled?

74
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,786
A hit-and-run, apparently.

75
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,040
It was pouring down that night.
I doubt there were any witnesses.

76
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:55,503
Well then, do you happen to know
the delivery guy here?

77
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,464
I do. He bought our pajeon quite often.

78
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,635
Then could you please give us his number?

79
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,054
Why are you asking for his--

80
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,639
Well, he--

81
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,391
Is he the hit-and-run driver?

82
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,893
Are you detectives?

83
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,230
No, we're not. Does this look
like something a detective would wear?

84
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:19,652
We work at a company nearby
called More than Machines.

85
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,321
Why do you want the delivery guy?

86
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:26,409
Well, he left some kind of machine
outside our office,

87
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:30,455
and the thing suddenly went "boom,"
and a person turned into a chi--

88
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,833
No, actually, there was a misdelivery.

89
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,960
So, could you tell me his number?

90
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,420
That I don't know.

91
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,964
What is it that you do know?

92
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,217
How he looks?

93
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,511
We already know that.

94
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,389
Am I somehow expected
to know something you don't?

95
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,600
Well,

96
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,062
let me give you my business card.

97
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,898
Could you please give this to him
when you see him?

98
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:57,899
Sure.

99
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,443
In return, buy yourself a pajeon.

100
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,155
-I'll only charge 30,000 won.
-What's the original price?

101
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,114
Market price.

102
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,159
-Market price for pajeon?
-Stop it.

103
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,411
We'll take one.
It must be a wild-caught pajeon.

104
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,038
Here's my card.

105
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:15,500
I'll be reachable anytime,
so please give him my card.

106
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,543
Sure thing, dear customer. Wait a moment.

107
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,753
Sure. Thank you.

108
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,926
More than Machines?

109
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,102
Mr. Kim.

110
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,479
Right now?

111
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,189
No problem. Not at all.

112
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,775
I'm out, but I'm on the way back.

113
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,985
See you then.

114
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:47,907
Here.

115
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,327
You take it.

116
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,722
You're early today.

117
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,016
Good morning.

118
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,062
What's this pajeon?

119
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,981
I didn't go home yet.

120
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,149
It's nighttime.

121
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,987
And this is the takeout pajeon
you bought earlier for 30,000 won.

122
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,448
It was a tough day. You should go.

123
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,408
I think it'd be tougher to just go home.

124
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,454
You should stay strong.

125
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,332
Have some. You haven't eaten anything.

126
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,459
Min-ah…

127
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,004
makes good pajeon.

128
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,883
Now adding seafood.

129
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,219
-More?
-Yes.

130
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,933
This pajeon is so chubby!

131
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,110
How is it? Is it good?

132
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,361
Try some.

133
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,078
Take this.

134
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,748
Roll it up.

135
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,335
How is it?

136
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:23,753
Is it good?

137
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,256
Add this.

138
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:30,760
Good, huh?

139
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:33,930
Right?

140
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,724
Cheers.

141
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,902
This was something

142
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,447
we used to enjoy eating.

143
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,456
Let's pull ourselves together.

144
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,762
Good evening.
Sorry to bother you on a Friday night.

145
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,305
-It's fine. Have a seat.
-Okay.

146
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,268
Here are the blueprints, manual,
and papers you requested.

147
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,352
Cold water for you.

148
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,354
Cold water? How kind of you.

149
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,856
It's Friday. Aren't you going home?

150
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,359
We received a machine
that we shouldn't have--

151
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,990
You guys have that thing too?

152
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,367
What a surprise.

153
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,620
Mr. Kim. Do you know what it is?

154
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,788
Yes, I do.

155
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,874
What is it?

156
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,544
What's wrong?

157
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,962
What on earth is it?

158
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,088
It's a machine.

159
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,549
What kind of machine?

160
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,302
What's up with you two?

161
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,221
-Tell us. You said you know about it!
-I do, but not really.

162
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,181
I actually want to ask you what it is.

163
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,891
You said you know what it is!

164
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,894
I mean, I've seen it before, to be exact.

165
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,027
Three years ago, I participated

166
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:16,157
in Doctor Yoo's New Carbon Composite
Material Development Project.

167
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,158
Dr. Yoo must be--

168
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,827
Dr. Yoo In-won,
the first Asian winner of the ASME Medal,

169
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,455
the so-called Nobel Prize
of mechanical engineering?

170
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,789
ASME!

171
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,917
Right, but what's the point?
He was obsessed with that weird thing.

172
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,462
So what on earth is that machine?

173
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:33,049
I told you I don't know.
Plus, I never even went near the thing.

174
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,982
Wait.

175
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,277
Is something in there? Why does he…

176
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,657
What are you doing?

177
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,287
Dr. Yoo, can I help you with anything?

178
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,247
-I told you not to come in!
-Well…

179
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,041
Epicyon!

180
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,418
Bite!

181
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:13,381
He'd had a dog for 20 years, but it died
a year before the project started.

182
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:17,093
He was having a really hard time
and didn't stop grieving.

183
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,429
I started to think
that he was completely broken mentally.

184
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,014
Crap.

185
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,725
Seriously?

186
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:28,854
Damn it.

187
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,283
Hello, sir.

188
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,376
Dr. Yoo, what's the deal
with that machine?

189
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,585
I don't know what it is.

190
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,882
-Why are you so obsessed with it?
-Because I don't know what it is.

191
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,553
Our current project
has been dragging on for too long.

192
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,931
There's a record
that this machine existed 200 years ago.

193
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,766
Do you know

194
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,228
what material
that machine's exterior is made of?

195
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,563
Some metal--

196
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,689
Duralumin.

197
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,232
-Dural--
-Duralumin.

198
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,695
It's a high-tensile aluminum alloy
with age-hardening properties

199
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,531
used to make
the outer skin of aircraft, but…

200
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,701
they had duralumin 200 years ago?

201
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,536
I thought it was duralumin, but it's not.

202
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:30,708
A 20th century material existed
in the Joseon dynasty in the 19th century?

203
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,376
If that's true, Korean history…

204
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,087
no, world history would change.

205
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,089
I don't get what you're talking about.

206
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,716
Me neither.

207
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,927
All I know is that
the exterior material of that machine

208
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,014
is at least ten times stronger

209
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,141
yet lighter than duralumin.

210
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,434
200 years ago!

211
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:53,022
A material that could only exist
in the future was used 200 years ago!

212
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,192
I think you've become weak
from concentrating too much.

213
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,193
Right.

214
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,153
Possibly.

215
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,113
But you know what?

216
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,201
I found something even more interesting.

217
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,246
What is it?

218
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:19,840
To be continued.

219
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:20,966
Fu--

220
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,969
-Why can't you continue it now?
-This is the worst.

221
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,598
We concluded he was completely delusional,

222
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:31,143
believing he could revive his dog
with that ridiculous machine.

223
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,897
Anyhow, are you saying
that's the machine you saw back then?

224
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,273
Yes.

225
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,567
Wait. It isn't.

226
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,986
-What?
-It's got a different symbol.

227
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,782
Everything else looks the same,
but the one I saw then was like…

228
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:48,160
Does it mean
there are more machines like that?

229
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,246
So what is that?

230
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,415
We said we don't know.

231
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,085
Well, that's not important.

232
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,171
Like it or not, the machine's here,
so we should know how it works

233
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,507
so that we can either fix it or sell it.

234
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,302
Speaking of which, can you give us
Dr. Yoo's contact information?

235
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,263
You haven't heard?

236
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,931
It was on the news. He's missing.

237
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,432
-What?
-Missing?

238
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,226
-It's been a while.
-What happened?

239
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,520
No one knows. That's why he's missing.

240
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,981
Then what on earth is that--

241
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:21,151
I have no idea what happened after that.
His research was stopped.

242
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,654
We lost all the funding too.

243
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,406
Doctor Yoo In-won,

244
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:29,410
a mastermind in mechanical engineering
and the first Asian winner of the ASME,

245
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,579
has been missing for a week,

246
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,874
and the scientific community
is left in utter shock at the news.

247
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,711
The CCTV footage of him running urgently
to somewhere on the 4th,

248
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,922
the estimated date of his disappearance,

249
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,757
is the only lead left to explain this…

250
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,259
FIRE IN A POORLY MANAGED LAB IN INJU

251
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,219
-There was also a fire.
-And the machine?

252
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,806
Machines have to be disposed of
when a project is halted,

253
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,224
but I really have no idea.

254
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,225
I don't know what is good for you, Min-ah.

255
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,772
Maybe let you get some sunlight?
But I'm worried you might dry out.

256
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,149
Should I apply some starch syrup?

257
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,568
No.

258
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,409
INJU POLICE STATION

259
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,546
Are you tired?

260
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,715
Yes.

261
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,675
Me too.

262
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,177
Please leave.

263
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,020
I'm not asking you to find him.

264
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:20,938
Good call.

265
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,983
When someone goes missing,
those who are involved get tired.

266
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,317
I'm not trying to tire you.

267
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,237
There must be records
from the investigation.

268
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,074
Do you think we're amateurs?
We're not talking about school records.

269
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,287
I see you have a daughter.

270
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,999
So do I.

271
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,709
Let's say, one day,

272
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,505
your beloved daughter
turned into this energy drink.

273
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,340
Are you insane?

274
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,300
You don't know why. It just happened.

275
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,013
But then, I just twisted off her neck.

276
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:54,930
You're mad.

277
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,516
How would I have known
it was your daughter?

278
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,144
But when you go back home,
she is nowhere to be found.

279
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:04,023
Turns out she was the drink
the crazy guy twisted the neck off of.

280
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,192
You want to find the bottle,
but it's been recycled.

281
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:11,071
Whenever you see these drinks,
you feel like they're your daughter.

282
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,824
When you hear someone
twisting the cap off,

283
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,827
you feel like your neck's being wrung.

284
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,871
Please don't.

285
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:19,872
No!

286
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,292
Stop it!

287
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,588
In this world, there are so many dangers
that we cannot prepare for.

288
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,630
And my daughter!

289
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,383
My daughter is in such danger!

290
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,845
You must be crazy!

291
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,976
Min-ah…

292
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,103
For goodness' sake.

293
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,399
You creeped me out with that story.

294
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,946
The thing about Dr. Yoo's disappearance

295
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:57,493
is that we had to put our backs into it
because he was such a big name.

296
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,789
Telling you this would hurt my pride,

297
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,168
but he didn't go missing.

298
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,629
He evaporated.

299
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,005
What?

300
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:12,925
Evaporated?

301
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,595
On the day he disappeared,
he rushed out of the lab.

302
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,599
They had cameras everywhere,
as you'd expect from a research lab,

303
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,477
and all of them were working normally.

304
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,438
There were no blind spots,
so his every move was captured.

305
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:31,151
There are so many CCTVs in Korea
that I wonder

306
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,363
why anyone would commit a crime,
so tracking him down was easy.

307
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,949
But for whatever reason,

308
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:40,035
he went into a locked building
through a window.

309
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,079
And surprisingly,

310
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:43,872
that was it.

311
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:49,711
The footage showed him
entering the building but not coming out.

312
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,880
We checked all the CCTV cameras

313
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,967
within a five-kilometer radius
just in case

314
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,009
but found nothing.

315
00:18:56,718 --> 00:19:00,639
There's no way anyone
could've got in and out of that building,

316
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,599
even through the sewers.

317
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,979
We treated everyone connected
to that building as murder suspects.

318
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,482
We got desperate
and went beyond normal procedures.

319
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,498
I mean, a 200-year-old machine?

320
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,292
Time machine?

321
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,212
He didn't go missing. He evaporated.

322
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,255
Invisible man?

323
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,299
Can this get any more absurd?

324
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,594
Nothing tops the chicken nugget incident.

325
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,564
Why did you bring it out? It's dangerous!

326
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,941
We have to figure out which is Min-ah.

327
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:57,237
Among these chicken nuggets,
I'm going to find out which one is Min-ah.

328
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,281
By just standing here?

329
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:03,493
I've been running simulations in my head,
considering different variables.

330
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,370
What is your Plan A?

331
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,874
I did thorough research
on their chicken nuggets,

332
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,293
and I found something quite astonishing.

333
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,211
Go ahead.

334
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:16,381
Baekjung Chicken Nugget
has its own special recipe passed down

335
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,635
for four generations and has maintained
its taste for 200 years.

336
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,719
200 years?

337
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,263
But the thing about chicken nuggets is,

338
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,600
they became common and popular
fairly recently.

339
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,893
200 years ago,

340
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:32,147
people rarely fried chicken meat
because cooking oil was scarce.

341
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,317
The industrial mass production
of cheap cooking oils

342
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,986
like corn oil and cottonseed oil
began after the 1960s.

343
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,822
Poultry farming boomed, too,

344
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,534
so both oils and chicken
were very rare ingredients before then,

345
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,579
which means they must be lying.

346
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,332
But what does that have to do with us?

347
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,333
They are not lying.

348
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,128
Hongcha, the best food columnist in Korea,

349
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,340
held a grudge against them
because they refused to be interviewed.

350
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,093
She posted her findings about them
on her blog.

351
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,638
There's a lot of evidence
they were making fried chicken in sauce,

352
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:10,143
namely chicken nuggets, 200 years ago,
when even noblemen couldn't afford them.

353
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:13,814
Had it not been for that columnist,
no one would ever know,

354
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:17,192
which means they invented the dish
at least 150 years before anyone else

355
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,195
and didn't use that fact
to promote themselves! Such confidence!

356
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:24,616
What's more, the current owner,
the fourth generation to run this store,

357
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,035
grabbed a chicken nugget
on his first birthday,

358
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,204
anointing himself
the next successor at age one.

359
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,540
He doesn't allow
even the slightest change in its taste,

360
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,127
making him the living human treasure
of chicken nuggets.

361
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,212
-So?
-He's the right person for us.

362
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:41,717
He could easily pick out a chicken nugget
that he didn't make, don't you think?

363
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,429
He will definitely find Min-ah.

364
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,640
Let's go.

365
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,365
-How do you do?
-Hello.

366
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,450
Get out…

367
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,411
side and wait in line, please.
I'll call you in order.

368
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:13,123
We're actually here
to see the owner of this restaurant.

369
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,083
What is this about?

370
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,460
Well…

371
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,129
He will decline all offers
to open franchise stores

372
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,006
or appear on broadcasts.

373
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,342
Please talk to me
if you have any complaints.

374
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,094
Do you have any other business?

375
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:27,888
Well…

376
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,556
What was your Plan B?

377
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:30,724
Franchising inquiry.

378
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,392
And Plan C was TV appearance?

379
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,519
Yes.

380
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,563
What's Plan D?

381
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:41,526
We are from a company
called More than Machines.

382
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,778
Every year,

383
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:46,782
we find the best restaurants of the year
and give them a star rating.

384
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,450
Korean Michelin Guide, so to speak.

385
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:53,663
We came to tell you that your restaurant
has been awarded two stars.

386
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:57,209
Now bring the owner outside
to receive a huge cash prize!

387
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,668
Just pay one million won.

388
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:02,255
My boss will only accept your gratitude.

389
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,132
Here.

390
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,677
-Lay it down.
-Sorry?

391
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,430
Place your gratitude on my hand.

392
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,286
It has been well received.

393
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,455
Ten million won!

394
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:37,833
That's the prize money.

395
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,293
He'd rather you give it
to small businesses in need.

396
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,837
-A hundred million.
-Ten billion.

397
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,257
That's the minimum amount
he'd agree to receive.

398
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,258
Well, then.

399
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,217
The owner here

400
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,719
was our boss's friend from school.

401
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,597
Our chairman was an outcast,

402
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,308
but your boss always helped him out.

403
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,394
He wants to repay his kindness.

404
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,439
But my boss was homeschooled.

405
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,065
He was homeschooled, huh?

406
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,195
What was that?

407
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,700
Let's just tell her the truth.
The chicken nuggets might go bad.

408
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,993
Out of the question.

409
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:16,705
If word gets around,
Min-ah could be in danger.

410
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,040
Why would anyone spread
such a ridiculous story?

411
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:19,958
No way!

412
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,378
Curiosity makes people do anything.
I can't take the risk.

413
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,213
What if Min-ah stays this way forever?

414
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,633
You can't even recognize your child
when she's in front of you!

415
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,343
What is the greater risk?

416
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,389
Just trust me this once.

417
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,573
She's coming.

418
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:56,745
Excuse me.

419
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,916
Could you give him this note?

420
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,016
Come with me, please.

421
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,570
Min-ah!

422
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,487
No!

423
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:18,660
Min-ah!

424
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,245
Where is she?

425
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,584
Careful!

426
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,546
There are some here too.
I'm sorry, everyone.

427
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:34,718
Please let me pay
for your beer and chicken nuggets.

428
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,531
It's all my fault!

429
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,744
All my fault!

430
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:09,586
You can have them.

431
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,463
Let's go.

432
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,468
Min-ah!

433
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,263
That's not your daughter, mister.

434
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:24,684
Sorry?

435
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,478
That is not your daughter.

436
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,534
MY DAUGHTER TURNED INTO A CHICKEN NUGGET
