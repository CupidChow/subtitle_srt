1
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:45,837
50 YEARS LATER

2
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,222
How was your flight?

3
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,059
Well,

4
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:03,354
I miss the old days when you'd have
a meal and take a nap on the flight.

5
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,608
You don't have time for a nap
before landing these days.

6
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,321
Have you tried the sleeping machine
from More than Machines?

7
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,615
Yes, that was good.

8
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,826
It allowed me to have a sound sleep
for the time I set.

9
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,162
It's going to be a huge hit yet again.

10
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,164
It's a large company now.

11
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,335
They made it!

12
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:28,922
TV.

13
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,884
That's impressive, sir!

14
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:40,183
Good morning. You're watching
a live broadcast of Newsroom.

15
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,102
Yellow Pants has just returned

16
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:45,188
from his 50th anniversary
world tour concert.

17
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,648
At the age of 78,

18
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:51,111
he has toured around 23 cities
in 20 countries across the world.

19
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,614
He'll soon be having
his farewell concert in Incheon.

20
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:58,118
His fan club, Yemy,
is converging here in Songdo, Incheon,

21
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,912
to witness his final performance.

22
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:04,791
The international city of Songdo
is already covered in yellow.

23
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:09,671
Reporter Kang Tae-su will now give you
a view of Songdo from up in the sky.

24
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,756
I'm above Songdo International City.

25
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,675
REPORTER KANG TAE-SU

26
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,553
Looking down from the sky,
Songdo is full of yellow.

27
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,347
It's not a field of forsythia
or a flock of chicks.

28
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,892
Members of Yemy from all around the world
have gathered here in Songdo

29
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,978
to see his goodbye concert.

30
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,230
What a magnificent view.

31
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,983
On the ground, we have
Park Ju-yeong on the line with us.

32
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:30,942
REPORTER PARK JU-YEONG

33
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,153
I am in front of Songdo Central Park.

34
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,573
As you can see, everyone behind me
is wearing yellow pants

35
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,158
and headed to the same place.

36
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:42,912
They are all waiting here
to catch a glimpse of Yellow Pants.

37
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,498
Let me interview
one of his fans from overseas.

38
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,583
-Hi.
-Hello.

39
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,459
-Where are you from?
-I'm from Iran.

40
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,003
-Do you speak Korean well?
-Yes.

41
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,881
I learned it because I like Yellow Pants
and Korean dramas.

42
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:56,217
Is there anything
you want to say to Yellow Pants?

43
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:01,055
Yellow Pants is loved by people
of all religions and races.

44
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,143
But I'm disappointed that the Middle East
was not included on the tour list.

45
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,021
That didn't stop you from coming here?

46
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,272
Well, I couldn't miss it.

47
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,527
The House of Saud expressed disappointment

48
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,614
even though I stressed that
the locations were selected in rotation.

49
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,201
They asked for a couple of tickets
for the Crown Prince and his wife.

50
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,745
The time has passed
for currying such favors.

51
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:27,040
But there's a political and economic side
that we can't ignore.

52
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,460
Give them back-row seats.

53
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,212
Certainly.

54
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,591
Why don't you greet your fans
before you leave for your health checkup?

55
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,468
Sounds good.

56
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,638
Magnifier.

57
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,561
Here you are, sir.

58
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,865
See you all next week!

59
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,751
Min-ah!

60
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,259
Where are you going, sir? Follow him!

61
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,176
Okay, ma'am.

62
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:53,876
Boss.

63
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,257
Let's go.

64
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,057
Excuse me! Hey!

65
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,520
Let me come with you.

66
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,730
You wish!

67
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,648
I can harm humans.

68
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,233
I beg you.

69
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,611
I'll just watch.
I won't pull any tricks on you.

70
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,157
All I want is to worship them, you know.

71
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,076
Let me see them off. Please?

72
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:29,829
Let's take him.

73
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,539
What can he do anyway?

74
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,299
Hands.

75
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,273
Do you think we're going on a picnic?

76
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,025
That's it. A picnic.

77
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,028
Life is like a picnic, you see.

78
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,280
It's all fun and games until you die.

79
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,866
We are merely specks of dust
floating around on Earth.

80
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,868
Sir, he's not in his right mind!

81
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,870
No! I'm sorry.

82
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,206
I'm just too excited, that's all.

83
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,085
Yellow Pants,
the one who fought with his life.

84
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,586
You were so awesome!

85
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,214
That's the power of love.

86
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,174
One-way love!

87
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,967
I told you I can harm humans.

88
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,928
I'll take that back. Forgive me, sir.

89
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,805
Let's go. Yeah.

90
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,268
Bro.

91
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,819
Fine. Shut up.

92
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,991
I felt the scent of your shampoo

93
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,285
In the swaying flowers

94
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,487
Big Bang.

95
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,032
Have you figured out the Big Bang?

96
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,659
Where it all started?

97
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,287
Probably at YG Entertainment.

98
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,540
It's incredible
that you can make this kind of joke!

99
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,502
Come on. If you could please tell me--

100
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,753
I can't tell you.

101
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,007
That means you do know something.

102
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,550
Just a little bit.

103
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,635
Can't you just give me a hint?

104
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,636
I can't tell you.

105
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,892
Then do you believe in God too?

106
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,352
I can't tell you.

107
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,645
Oh man!

108
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,482
At least tell me why you came here.

109
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,816
Kind of a tour.

110
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,488
What are those marks on the machines?

111
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,990
Something like travel agency logos.

112
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,451
-They look like Hangul, though.
-We use Hangul too.

113
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,746
But why?

114
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:20,541
It is the most perfect writing system
we have discovered so far.

115
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,085
That is the only thing
where Earth is ahead of our planet.

116
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,339
Now I'm high on Korean pride!

117
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,425
Do you people have cats

118
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,260
or other pets like dogs?

119
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:32,970
We do.

120
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,433
We don't keep them. We protect them.

121
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,520
We're the top species,
but we don't own the planet.

122
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:45,066
Is there any way we can keep in touch?
Email or something?

123
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:45,983
That's impossible.

124
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,610
What do I do if I miss you?

125
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,694
Please stop.

126
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,782
I'm so sorry, but I love you
It was all lies

127
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,283
Stop it.

128
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:59,038
I didn't know
Now I realize that I need you

129
00:08:59,121 --> 00:08:59,956
Seriously, stop.

130
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,335
-Do you like karaoke?
-Stop!

131
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,678
Min-ah!

132
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,571
Min-ah.

133
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,107
Min-ah.

134
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,376
MORE THAN MACHINES

135
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,266
What is it?

136
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,269
I want you

137
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,563
to take over this company.

138
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,233
What's going on?

139
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,154
And what's up with you?

140
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,240
Stop joking now.
You guys are already a joke.

141
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,162
I get it now. I'm sorry.

142
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,915
I was really tired yesterday,
so I went to the sauna.

143
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,505
All right, I went to an Internet café too.
I'm sorry.

144
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,964
That's what I'm talking about.

145
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,843
You've always been professional
about slacking off.

146
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,471
You calculated the time,
every single day without fail,

147
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,807
slacking off diligently and persistently.

148
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,934
Yet you always finish your work.

149
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,811
Never ever dropped the ball.

150
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,939
In a way, you're a genius, kid.

151
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,273
Okay, you can stop.

152
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,108
I will slack off less from now on.

153
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,236
-No, I'll stop.
-I'm being serious, kid.

154
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:44,740
If you just build an ownership mindset,
you are sure to make it.

155
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,910
Please look after this company.

156
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,578
Has something happened to you?

157
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,708
I have to live a long life.

158
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,585
Until I'm 105.

159
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,503
No,

160
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,880
I have to stay healthy until I'm 106,

161
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,926
which means I'll have to get away
from this factory and this city.

162
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:05,928
This city.

163
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,221
This city.

164
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,806
This factory. This…

165
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,228
Mr. Ko.

166
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,231
Yes?

167
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,691
Do music.

168
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,025
Sorry?

169
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,737
I don't know much about music,
so I'm not sure if you're good at it,

170
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,366
but you should follow your passion
while you're still young.

171
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,952
If you get old and still can't make it,

172
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,745
More than Machines will rehire you.

173
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:33,789
Right?

174
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,041
Well, I guess so.

175
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,711
But boss, you are still young too.

176
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,380
How are you going to make a living
until you're 106?

177
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,632
I'm going

178
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,176
into the wilderness.

179
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,978
Come to think of it,
we've never had a team dinner.

180
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,187
Let's go.

181
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,857
Let's have some beer with chicken nuggets.

182
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,734
BAEKJUNG CHICKEN NUGGET

183
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,530
Ko Baek-joong, three people.

184
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,448
Here.

185
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:08,908
Come in.

186
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,334
Well, it's good to have
a little get-together like this.

187
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,585
What's good about it?

188
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,171
A boss who ditches his company
to live longer.

189
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,673
A coworker who tries to make music
in a machine company.

190
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,300
How can that be good?

191
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,510
It's just good to be out
during office hours.

192
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,732
Look at you shamelessly smirking
after being called a skilled slacker

193
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,984
and running your mouth on top of that.

194
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,569
You're really something else.

195
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,368
An irresponsible boss
and a shameless successor!

196
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,661
What a mess this is--

197
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,912
Enough.

198
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,414
You always take it too far.

199
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,002
But just how far is too far?

200
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,714
I'm sorry.

201
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,232
"A Chicken Nugget Rhapsody"?

202
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,109
Right, it's him!

203
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,405
You're a YouTuber, right?

204
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,615
What? I'm--

205
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,575
You sang "A Chicken Nugget Rhapsody"!

206
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,828
Oh my God, this is crazy!

207
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,830
I mean, I do upload songs on YouTube--

208
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,416
Are you in a band?

209
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,418
I'm just a one-man band.

210
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,004
That's freaking sick!
Can we take a picture with you?

211
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,755
-Yeah, sounds good.
-Let's go!

212
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,800
-You should make a video now.
-Okay.

213
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:50,843
Hurry up.

214
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,886
By the way, what's the name of your band?

215
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,932
Yellow Pants?

216
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:03,605
Yellow Pants!

217
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,607
-Let's take a picture!
-Do it now!

218
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,945
Okay. Here we go.

219
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,280
Nice!

220
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,470
I love you!

221
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,896
JUST CHICKEN NUGGET

222
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,867
Aren't those chicken nuggets?

223
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:00,537
For 50 years, my grandma was a fan
of "A Chicken Nugget Rhapsody."

224
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,875
She told me she saw you
before you became popular as Yellow Pants

225
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,128
when you were singing and dancing
while walking down the street.

226
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,965
She said that she might be
your first-ever fan.

227
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,134
Is that so?

228
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,096
Where is your grandmother now?

229
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,891
She passed away last month.

230
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:25,395
I always had chicken nuggets with her.

231
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,320
Would you like to join me?

232
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,782
Shall I?

233
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,183
What a beautiful moment this is.

234
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,726
A grandmother who is no more.

235
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,979
A fan of 50 years who passed away.

236
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,274
A girl shares the memories
of her grandmother,

237
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,693
and Yellow Pants
eats chicken nuggets with her.

238
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:16,071
Media and critics
from all around the world

239
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,699
described this day
with the following sentence.

240
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:23,120
"A great poet who sang about peace
and love for humanity for half a century."

241
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,665
Can there be any reason left
to prevent him

242
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,333
from receiving the Nobel Prize?

243
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,669
Thank you for watching Newsroom.

244
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,129
That guy never grows old.

245
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,006
I could say the same of you.

246
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,633
You're right.

247
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,386
I've had this face for 60 years.

248
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,221
I think it's time now. Shall we go?

249
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,267
Let's go, then.

250
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,701
A month ago,

251
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,955
I sent this new product
made by More than Machines

252
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,542
to my old friend as a gift.

253
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:14,880
I saw him on the news today,
and he looks even younger now.

254
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,595
Baek-joong always looked young
for his age.

255
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,430
Look.

256
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,599
That guy really loves to drink.

257
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,643
But his eyes shine brighter than ever.

258
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,311
What's his secret?

259
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,772
Can you believe he is 78?

260
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:34,858
Hello.

261
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,446
I'm Yoo Tae-man, the principal engineer
and CEO of More than Machines.

262
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,573
How old do I look?

263
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,079
I'm 75. Can you believe that?

264
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:51,124
I met BLACKPINK at an event
the other day.

265
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,252
They treated me like their nephew.

266
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,337
Can you guess why?

267
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:58,840
All right.

268
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,093
I won't drag this out.

269
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,595
The secret is in sound sleep.

270
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,430
Let me introduce

271
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,599
More than Sleep.

272
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,859
You can sleep soundly
whenever and however long you want.

273
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,866
First of all,

274
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,911
I'd like to express my appreciation

275
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:33,208
to the late Chairman Kim Hwan-dong,
who, for a very long time,

276
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:37,504
had always supported us
in inventing machines for mankind.

277
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,259
And also to my uncle,
who was also a principal engineer,

278
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,512
the late Dr. Yoo In-won.

279
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,056
To this day…

280
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,476
I'm thankful to them.

281
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,065
YOO TAE-MAN, KIM HWAN-DONG, YOO IN-WON

282
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:27,888
You are here.

283
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,737
Sorry to disturb you at this hour.

284
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,573
No. Don't be.

285
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,882
Why is she still…

286
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,301
I'll explain now.

287
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,847
250 years ago,
shortly after we were trapped on Earth,

288
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,101
weapons of mass destruction
were invented here.

289
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,562
Earth was then classified
as a travel-banned planet,

290
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,565
and, as a result,
all the machines were discarded.

291
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,695
I took back the only remaining machine,

292
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:29,282
but I needed one more day
to recharge its energy.

293
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,829
But, as you know, taking another day means

294
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:37,499
there will be no one left on Earth
who remembers Min-ah.

295
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,171
Thanks to your kind heart, my friends
and I were able to meet our families.

296
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,881
But I couldn't turn--

297
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,134
You wouldn't have known
what was to happen.

298
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,430
I am aware that your kind cannot lie.

299
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,806
I'm sorry.

300
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:57,185
I didn't have much time
to find another way.

301
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,146
If you press this button,

302
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,940
you'll go back in time
to the point you desire.

303
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,152
But you'll lose all of your memories
up to this point.

304
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,160
But what about the billions of people
in this timeline?

305
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,328
Memories will be gone,
but fate won't change.

306
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,956
Only Min-ah's life will be added to it.

307
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,710
I'm sorry

308
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,963
to leave you with such a tough decision.

309
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,656
I should invite the boss here.

310
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,701
You might not see me again,

311
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,745
but we'll be back in three days.

312
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,080
If I find Min-ah as she is now,

313
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,625
we'll take her back with us.

314
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,627
If traveling to Earth has been banned,

315
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:08,048
does that mean that aliens
are not coming to Earth anymore?

316
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,090
No.

317
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,301
The human race evolves
through a considerate heart.

318
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,387
Weapons and wars will all disappear.

319
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,725
And at the peak of that evolution,
we will all meet again.

320
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,187
Someday.

321
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,898
Yes. Someday.

322
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,260
It's been a while.

323
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,888
I missed you.

324
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,902
Ma'am, could you call Mr. Choi in?

325
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,240
-Guys, pack up quickly.
-Yes, sir.

326
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:16,908
Let's go home.

327
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,660
Hey, excuse me.

328
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,416
We're here to meet Mr. Choi.

329
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,333
Who?

330
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,463
-Isn't this where Mr. Choi Sun-man lives?
-Oh, Sun-man?

331
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,010
I fucking want to see him too.

332
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,428
Why curse?

333
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:39,556
We came to film
Into the Wilderness, but we couldn't.

334
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,643
Look at our guy over there.
He broke his leg while following him.

335
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,022
He can't be 105. He's 500 years old.
He's not even human. Hey!

336
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,774
Tell the What in the World! guys
to take over.

337
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,193
At least tell us where he is.

338
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:59,242
Over there.

339
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,077
There.

340
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,871
Look closely. He'll jump once more.

341
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:03,788
One, two…

342
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,374
There! That's a person.

343
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,794
It's not some weird natural phenomenon.
It's a flying person.

344
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,880
He even caught a boar and trained it

345
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,466
so that it wouldn't ruin the crops
in the village.

346
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,301
The boar nodded as if it heard him.

347
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,094
Unbelievable, right?

348
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,430
I'll show you
something even more unbelievable.

349
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:21,681
There.

350
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,350
Where did he go? There.

351
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:26,561
Over there. He's so damn far away, right?

352
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,730
Now he'll pop up here.

353
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,441
See?

354
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,154
I won't die!

355
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,452
I won't die!

356
00:27:58,968 --> 00:27:59,969
I'm ready.

357
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,955
Welcome, boss.

358
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:35,880
Boss.

359
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:40,343
Boss?

360
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:42,846
Boss!

361
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,796
What is it like…

362
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,842
to live as a chicken nugget?

363
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:22,677
I'm not sure.

364
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,889
But that's not what really matters.

365
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:31,436
Which is harder?
To live as a chicken nugget for five days

366
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,648
or a human for 50 years?

367
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,986
How would you have answered the question?

368
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,531
I respect the time you have lived so far.

369
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,659
The time I spent was too short
compared to that.

370
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:51,164
Of course, what I saw in that short time
was truly invaluable.

371
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:55,502
I saw how deeply you and my dad loved me.

372
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,463
I also saw another world

373
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:01,758
that could someday be our future
here on Earth.

374
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,136
Everyone was happy there.

375
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,806
They didn't try to share
their happiness with others.

376
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,935
They just let the happiness flow naturally
to where it needed to go.

377
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:16,523
There was pain too,
but people weren't afraid of it,

378
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,819
because everyone tried to lessen the pain
by sharing it.

379
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,196
A wonderful place, isn't it?

380
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,492
I'll lose my memories of that place,

381
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,245
but they're not as important
as the time you've lived.

382
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,957
Giving you back the time
you should have spent with your father.

383
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,754
I think that's the right thing to do.

384
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,424
I believe…

385
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,513
that you'll understand my decision.

386
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:02,527
BAEKJUNG CHICKEN NUGGET

387
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,165
Dad.

388
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,501
Min-ah!

389
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,044
Min-ah!

390
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,839
You must be hungry.
I brought chicken nuggets.
