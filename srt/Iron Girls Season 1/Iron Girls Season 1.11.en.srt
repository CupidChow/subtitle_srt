00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,819
(Cycling, 40km)

00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,389
(Running, 10km)

00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,420
(Total of 51.5km)

5
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,149
(Triathlon is a sport that pushes one's limits.)

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,621
(They came together to become Iron Girls.)

7
00:00:24,886 --> 00:00:27,296
(Their movie-like story)

8
00:00:27,731 --> 00:00:29,060
(She was afraid of water.)

9
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:30,900
(She was afraid of cycling.)

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,560
(She was afraid of running.)

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,701
(She had poor stamina.)

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:42,111
(They all lacked in one area,)

13
00:00:42,311 --> 00:00:46,079
(so it seemed impossible.)

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,049
(There's no such thing!)

15
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,120
(I won't give up.)

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,820
(Their only...)

17
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:54,821
(goal is to complete the race.)

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,290
(They worked hard for 120 days just to complete the race.)

19
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,290
(Blood)

20
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:02,060
(Sweat)

21
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:04,299
(Tears)

22
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,299
(They've worked hard with their blood, sweat, and tears.)

23
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,070
(This is the end of their grueling journey.)

24
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:11,670
(Their final goal)

25
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,940
(A triathlon competition)

26
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:17,610
(The ending of their story...)

27
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,610
(was decided from the start.)

28
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:22,250
(Iron Girls)

29
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:26,151
(Their final story)

30
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,451
(It starts now.)

31
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:32,690
(The day of the competition is finally here.)

32
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:36,630
(The participants have gathered from early dawn.)

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,171
(Participants have lined up.)

34
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,141
Don't just stand still.

35
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:49,011
(Iron Girls are ready to get going too.)

36
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:52,010
(About 1,300 participants)

37
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,811
(They wear different-colored caps based on their swimming records.)

38
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:59,520
(The participants are divided into groups in the match.)

39
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,050
(Based on the previous year's swimming records)

40
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:06,290
(The gold swimming caps of the leading group)

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,100
(Under 28 minutes, black swimming caps)

42
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:15,600
(Under 32 minutes, under 36 minutes, under 40 minutes, over 40 minutes)

43
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:17,440
It's going to be real quick now.

44
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,211
- We must focus. - Focus on the competition.

45
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,211
Why am I feeling nervous?

46
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:23,479
It's starting now.

47
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,639
(With the competition organizers' cooperation,)

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,741
(Iron Girls wore neon-colored swimming caps.)

49
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,781
Let's do this.

50
00:02:28,311 --> 00:02:30,379
Bye, we're off now.

51
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,781
- Let's go. - Let's go.

52
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:35,150
(Swimming course)

53
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:40,461
(First course, start)

54
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:43,190
(After doing a lap and coming up)

55
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:48,270
(Second course)

56
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:51,700
(A course of a total of 1.5km)

57
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,970
- Let's go. - Let's go.

58
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:55,070
(A 4-month journey to become Iron Girls)

59
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,609
(The only thing left is the actual match.)

60
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,880
Let's do this.

61
00:02:58,281 --> 00:02:59,341
We can do this.

62
00:03:00,811 --> 00:03:02,610
It's right in front of us.

63
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:05,521
Five, four,

64
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,121
three, two, one.

65
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,660
(The competition starts.)

66
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:14,259
They've started.

67
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,859
(The gold swimming caps of the leading group start.)

68
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,001
It's started.

69
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,371
I am getting very nervous.

70
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,170
You too? I'm getting nervous.

71
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,140
Start, they're entering the water in front.

72
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,210
(The black swimming caps enter the water.)

73
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:31,009
They keep entering the water.

74
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,081
Oh, dear.

75
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:35,610
(The green caps enter the water.)

76
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:39,721
Goodness, they keep jumping in.
It's going to be us soon.

77
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,450
- Look forward. - Okay.

78
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:45,259
- You can do it, Seo Yeon. - Of course, I can.

79
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,389
Go!

80
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,359
(The red caps right in front of Iron Girls enter the water.)

81
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,560
You can do it!

82
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:52,400
Oh, my gosh. It's us!

83
00:03:52,401 --> 00:03:55,370
(We are up next.)

84
00:03:55,371 --> 00:03:57,341
It'll start right away.

85
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,810
Let's go in. You'll start immediately.

86
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:02,210
Move in.

87
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:04,410
- Go in. It'll start immediately. - Okay.

88
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,841
Let's go, my members.

89
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:08,310
Right away. Get your watches ready.

90
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:10,350
- It'll be us soon. - The watch.

91
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:11,750
Let's do this.

92
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,221
(Feeling nervous,)

93
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:16,919
(Iron Girls stand at the starting line.)

94
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,991
Five.

95
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,021
Five in a line.

96
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,260
You can do it.

97
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,930
- Let's do this. - You'll start soon.

98
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,159
Warm up.

99
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
Let's do this.

100
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:27,370
- Good luck. - Thank you.

101
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,230
Do your best.

102
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,799
You'll start soon.

103
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,300
You can do it!

104
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:36,011
- Warm up. - Let's do this.

105
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:38,011
What should I...

106
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:39,840
- Go. - Let's go!

107
00:04:39,841 --> 00:04:41,250
Let's go.

108
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:42,951
- Go. - Let's go!

109
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,150
(The race to complete the competition...)

110
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,249
(has finally begun.)

111
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,249
Go!

112
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:55,229
(Iron Girls start the swimming course.)

113
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,691
Go!

114
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,200
Hello.
This is the 2024 Tongyeong World Triathlon Cup.

115
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:09,410
Swimming 1.5km, cycling 40km, and running 10km.

116
00:05:09,511 --> 00:05:11,010
They must finish the race in 3 hours 30 minutes.

117
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,010
Team Iron Girls consists of Uie, Seol In Ah,

118
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:14,609
Park Ju Hyun, and Jin Seo Yeon.

119
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,521
The participants wearing pink caps started the race just now too.

120
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:23,350
(Uie, In Ah, Ju Hyun, Seo Yeon)

121
00:05:25,321 --> 00:05:29,990
(Iron Girls move ahead with vigor.)

122
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:35,971
(How is the situation like in the swimming course?)

123
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:40,441
(The group that started ahead...)

124
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:44,141
(and the groups that started later are combined.)

125
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,609
(Ju Hyun, Uie, In Ah, Seo Yeon)

126
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,249
(It is like a battlefield.)

127
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,250
(Seo Yeon, Ju Hyun, Uie, In Ah)

128
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:53,721
(Iron Girls are thrown into the vast swimming battle.)

129
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,821
(In the middle of a fierce battlefield)

130
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,761
(Toward the front line,)

131
00:06:02,891 --> 00:06:06,860
(Uie swims at an incredible speed.)

132
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,470
(Swimming at high speed from the start)

133
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,770
(Uie)

134
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:19,510
(She catches up to the red-cap group instantly.)

135
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:22,249
(Uie)

136
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,619
(While Uie advances quickly...)

137
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,891
- Goodness. - Go.

138
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,090
(In Ah, Ju Hyun)

139
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:35,691
(In Ah starts speeding up too.)

140
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:41,401
(With wide gliding,)

141
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,201
(she overtakes a red-cap participant.)

142
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,980
(After overtaking the red cap, In Ah starts speeding up.)

143
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,920
(And Ju Hyun chases after In Ah.)

144
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,950
(She follows her calmly using her bilateral breathing.)

145
00:07:01,951 --> 00:07:03,391
(Left)

146
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:10,600
(Ju Hyun swims past the red cap too.)

147
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,100
(The younger members overtake the participants in front.)

148
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:20,341
(Seo Yeon is still near the starting point?)

149
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,510
(Perhaps due to the pressure of the competition,)

150
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:25,841
(her breathing is unstable from the beginning.)

151
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,881
(The members have disappeared from her sight already.)

152
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,990
(Swimming cutoff is 50 minutes.)

153
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:41,190
(She must finish the swimming course to carry on with the competition.)

154
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:44,160
(Seo Yeon)

155
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,370
(She stops not long after again.)

156
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:54,471
(She fought against her fear of water for 4 months for today.)

157
00:07:55,211 --> 00:08:00,610
(But the real competition isn't easy.)

158
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:04,350
(On top of it, the participants behind her...)

159
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:08,521
(keep passing Seo Yeon who is swimming slowly.)

160
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,031
(In the end, she stops again.)

161
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:22,701
(It's been 4minutes since they started.)

162
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:27,100
(She only swam 100m.)

163
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,440
(Currently, 60 minutes estimated for 1.5km)

164
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:31,341
(At this pace, she will be cut off.)

165
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,381
(Can Seo Yeon speed up?)

166
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:40,891
(Uie, the leading member of Iron Girls,)

167
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:44,490
(quickly overtakes the red-cap group.)

168
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,359
(She passes 1 person.)

169
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,560
(She passes 2 people.)

170
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:52,100
(She passes 3 people.)

171
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:55,331
(She quickly overtakes other participants.)

172
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,400
(Then she enters the congested area with a lot of physical fights.)

173
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,269
(Uie)

174
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,170
(Even when she overtakes one participant in front of her,)

175
00:09:03,171 --> 00:09:06,441
(other participants block her way.)

176
00:09:07,451 --> 00:09:12,120
(The swimming course is full of participants.)

177
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,420
(But...)

178
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,061
(she can't slow down here!)

179
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,930
(From the congested inner side,)

180
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:24,600
(she turns outward.)

181
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:31,301
(Uie swims to the outside?)

182
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:37,071
(She positions herself at the outer course.)

183
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:43,211
(The outer course has fewer people, but she must go a longer distance.)

184
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,650
(But she overcomes it with stamina, which is her strength.)

185
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,890
(Uie passes the 1st floating mark at 6 minutes 27 seconds.)

186
00:09:52,221 --> 00:09:55,130
(She turns the corner quickly using the inner course.)

187
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,701
(She positions herself at the outer course again.)

188
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:12,640
(She swims faster after the leading group.)

189
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:15,849
(Uie)

190
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,649
(Current location)

191
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,650
(Uie passes the 2nd floating mark at 7 minutes 13 seconds.)

192
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,790
(In Ah)

193
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:28,191
(Meanwhile, In Ah enters the congested area too.)

194
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,301
(What is Iron In Ah's strategy?)

195
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:38,500
(When those in front block her way,)

196
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:45,040
(she bulldozes her way through.)

197
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,779
(Even at the congested floating-mark area,)

198
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,181
(Iron In Ah doesn't get pushed away.)

199
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:54,250
(Even when someone in front of her suddenly stops,)

200
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,790
(she passes by and swims forward without stopping.)

201
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,529
(In Ah)

202
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,130
(In Ah passes the 2nd floating mark at 8 minutes 15 seconds.)

203
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:10,571
(While Uie and In Ah are heading toward the 500m point,)

204
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:16,311
(Ju Hyun is swimming behind them.)

205
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:21,811
(Participants taking a break in front of her)

206
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,850
(She collides with them.)

207
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,619
(This time, she is kicked by the participant...)

208
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,120
(in front of her.)

209
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,860
(She was kicked so hard that her cap came off.)

210
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:40,129
(Ju Hyun)

211
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,801
(The 3rd collision)

212
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:51,110
(She is flustered by the first physical fight she is experiencing.)

213
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,010
(She gets hit.)

214
00:11:56,311 --> 00:11:59,520
(She gets hit again.)

215
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:03,791
(She keeps colliding with other participants.)

216
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,860
(She barely makes it to the 1st mark which is the 420m point.)

217
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,130
(At the war-like corner,)

218
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,441
(her breathing becomes unstable.)

219
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:22,571
(With much struggle,)

220
00:12:22,671 --> 00:12:24,109
(Ju Hyun)

221
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,411
(Ju Hyun passes the 2nd mark at 9 minutes 24 seconds.)

222
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,291
(And Seo Yeon hasn't even made it to the 1st floating mark.)

223
00:12:36,051 --> 00:12:39,661
(She keeps pausing due to the unfamiliar environment.)

224
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,690
(She has endured the 120 days of hard training.)

225
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:47,100
(She can't end it here.)

226
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,931
(Just a bit more.)

227
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,701
(One more time.)

228
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,411
(She finally arrives at the 1st floating mark.)

229
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:02,310
(Now that she has warmed up, Seo Yeon keeps going nonstop.)

230
00:13:02,311 --> 00:13:05,321
(Seo Yeon)

231
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,750
(She swam without resting from the 1st floating mark.)

232
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:39,421
(She resumes swimming right away.)

233
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,519
(Seo Yeon)

234
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,421
(While warmed-up Seo Yeon slowly adjusts to her pace,)

235
00:13:44,661 --> 00:13:47,729
(Uie in the lead...)

236
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,960
(Uie)

237
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:53,360
(She is in the middle of the red-cap group.)

238
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,129
(Uie the Mermaid sets her eyes on her target.)

239
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,541
(Uie the Shark sets her eyes on her target.)

240
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,301
(Speeding up)

241
00:14:01,411 --> 00:14:02,411
(Overtaking 1)

242
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,640
(Overtaking 2 and 3)

243
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
(Overtaking 4)

244
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,349
(She overtakes one after another...)

245
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,321
(and makes it to the forefront of the group.)

246
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,519
(In front of the red caps...)

247
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,951
(are the yellow caps.)

248
00:14:17,661 --> 00:14:20,930
(She makes a dash...)

249
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:25,630
(toward her next target, the yellow caps.)

250
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:29,499
(I found you,)

251
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,700
(yellow caps.)

252
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:33,200
(Uie)

253
00:14:33,201 --> 00:14:34,210
(Overtaking 1)

254
00:14:34,211 --> 00:14:36,311
(Starting with one yellow cap in front of the red caps,)

255
00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:39,740
(Uie the Shark chases after them.)

256
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:41,479
(Overtaking 2 and 3)

257
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,950
(Uie)

258
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:45,181
(Overtaking 4 and 5)

259
00:14:45,321 --> 00:14:47,890
(Uie)

260
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,520
(Uie the Shark passes everyone whenever someone is in sight.)

261
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,660
(Uie)

262
00:14:51,661 --> 00:14:55,560
(As Uie struggles to pass the yellow-cap groups,)

263
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,460
(Uie)

264
00:14:57,461 --> 00:15:00,161
(she reaches the 1st-course passing point.)

265
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:08,009
(Uie's record in the 1st course of 870m: 14 minutes and 14 seconds)

266
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,140
- Nice. - Let's go!

267
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,239
(Uie)

268
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,280
(She has to run to save some time for cycling.)

269
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:17,681
(She hurriedly enters the 2nd course.)

270
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:30,348
(By the way, where is In Ah?)

271
00:15:30,789 --> 00:15:33,689
(She's leading the red-cap group,)

272
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:38,698
(swimming at the very first.)

273
00:15:41,598 --> 00:15:46,139
(She swims with vigor, like a triumphal general.)

274
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:54,279
(In Ah's record in the 1st course of 870m: 16 minutes and 24 seconds)

275
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:57,149
(Iron In Ah starts running as soon as getting out of the water.)

276
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:02,588
(She dashes to fight in the next battleground.)

277
00:16:02,988 --> 00:16:04,857
(She dashes with her great stamina...)

278
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:06,159
So, we start off now!

279
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:08,559
(and dives in right away.)

280
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:10,858
Be careful of the people ahead of you!

281
00:16:15,469 --> 00:16:16,469
(Ju Hyun)

282
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,299
(In the meantime, Ju Hyun, who lost her pace tussling with others,)

283
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,809
(now bumps into the lane.)

284
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:29,479
(She continuously loses directions and bumps.)

285
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:33,049
(It seems like she has trouble recovering her pace.)

286
00:16:33,878 --> 00:16:37,088
(Then, there's only one way left.)

287
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:40,558
(She endures with all her might...)

288
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,088
(and will.)

289
00:16:43,888 --> 00:16:47,799
(If something's ahead of you, bump into it and get through it.)

290
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:54,039
(As focusing on just moving ahead,)

291
00:16:54,438 --> 00:16:58,479
(she reaches the 1st-course passing point.)

292
00:16:58,908 --> 00:17:02,078
(Ju Hyun's record in the 1st course of 870m: 18 minutes and 49 seconds)

293
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:03,378
This way!

294
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:04,878
Be careful of people ahead.

295
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:07,988
You start after checking if there's no one ahead of you!

296
00:17:07,989 --> 00:17:09,587
(Ju Hyun)

297
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:12,918
(Ju Hyun also joins the 2nd-course race.)

298
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:14,058
(Seo Yeon)

299
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:20,228
(She's the only one left in the 1st course.)

300
00:17:20,229 --> 00:17:23,127
Jin Seo Yeon, Park Ju Hyun, Seol In Ah,

301
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:26,568
and Uie are now playing in the game.

302
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:27,569
(Uie appears.)

303
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,768
Isn't she one of the members of Iron Girls?

304
00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:31,538
- Oh, that's right. - You're right.

305
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:33,038
- It's Uie. - Yes, Uie.

306
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,508
As anticipated, she proved...

307
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:36,877
- her great skills in swimming. - Indeed.

308
00:17:36,878 --> 00:17:39,718
When I saw her last time, her kicks were amazing.

309
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:42,449
- She's doing well. - Truly amazing.

310
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:46,918
(Thanks to the commentators' praise,)

311
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:50,258
(Uie)

312
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:52,799
(she passes the 3rd floating mark...)

313
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:57,299
(and dashes to the 4th one.)

314
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:02,668
(Uie passes the 4th floating mark.)

315
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:08,148
(Now is the straight course left.)

316
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:12,979
(She gives the final spurt.)

317
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:16,949
(To the finish line,)

318
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:22,959
(she has only 100m left.)

319
00:18:23,628 --> 00:18:28,229
(She gives a full spurt for it.)

320
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:30,327
(Uie)

321
00:18:30,328 --> 00:18:35,108
(Uie even caught up with the green-cap group!)

322
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:44,748
(Uie)

323
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:48,949
(Uie's 1.5km swimming record: 26 minutes and 48 seconds)

324
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:53,959
(She is in 1st place of the women's swimming affinity group.)

325
00:18:54,188 --> 00:18:55,488
(Uie)

326
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:59,927
(When Uie heads to the transition area...)

327
00:18:59,928 --> 00:19:02,299
- You got this. - Let's go!

328
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:03,627
- Uie! - Let's go!

329
00:19:03,628 --> 00:19:05,798
(Seo Yeon)

330
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:10,009
(Seo Yeon finished the 1st course.)

331
00:19:10,438 --> 00:19:14,808
(Seo Yeon's record in the 1st course of 870m: 26 minutes and 55 seconds)

332
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:16,107
(Seo Yeon)

333
00:19:16,108 --> 00:19:19,719
(Until the cutoff time of 50 minutes,)

334
00:19:20,148 --> 00:19:23,549
(she has 23 minutes and 5 seconds left.)

335
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:24,718
(Seo Yeon)

336
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:28,029
(Will she be able to arrive within the cutoff time?)

337
00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:37,299
(Now Uie is heading to the transition area.)

338
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:38,969
(It's this far...)

339
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,509
(from the finish line of swimming.)

340
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:47,338
(Time doesn't wait for her.)

341
00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:52,449
(She starts getting changed as soon as she arrives.)

342
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:54,848
For me,

343
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,088
cycling is always a fear.

344
00:19:57,789 --> 00:20:00,088
"It's my last chance, so let's go."

345
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:02,558
"I'll ride at the full speed possible."

346
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,858
- Uie, you got this! - Thanks!

347
00:20:05,158 --> 00:20:07,729
- Let's go, guys! - Go for it!

348
00:20:09,368 --> 00:20:13,798
(The cutoff time of cycling: 2 hours and 30 minutes)

349
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,038
(Uie)

350
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:17,068
- Uie, you got this! - Thanks!

351
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:18,979
(2 hours left)

352
00:20:20,378 --> 00:20:26,848
(Will Uie be able to finish the race within the given time?)

353
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:34,088
(Uie starts cycling.)

354
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:37,157
(Starting point)

355
00:20:37,158 --> 00:20:38,398
(1st turning point)

356
00:20:38,898 --> 00:20:40,228
(2nd turning point)

357
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:47,568
(From the halfway point of 22km to the starting point)

358
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:49,868
(It's a total of 40km.)

359
00:20:50,368 --> 00:20:52,539
(The cycling course in Tongyeong is...)

360
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:56,279
(full of endless uphill roads.)

361
00:20:56,779 --> 00:20:57,847
(These roads make everyone humble.)

362
00:20:57,848 --> 00:21:01,279
(Gasping)

363
00:21:01,949 --> 00:21:04,618
(After the uphill roads in the downtown,)

364
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:07,157
(sharp curves...)

365
00:21:07,158 --> 00:21:11,328
(and steep slopes are waiting for them.)

366
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:18,569
(It's a grave for all triathletes.)

367
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:24,269
(The camelback course on the coastal road)

368
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:29,449
(It's an endless uphill from start to finish.)

369
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:33,549
(The nightmarish cycling course)

370
00:21:34,678 --> 00:21:39,658
(Uie enters the uphill road in the downtown.)

371
00:21:40,219 --> 00:21:42,858
(The steep slope welcomes her from the beginning.)

372
00:21:44,088 --> 00:21:47,158
(It seems like there's no end to this uphill road.)

373
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:51,668
(But she skillfully downshifts...)

374
00:21:52,898 --> 00:21:58,378
(and climbs up while speeding up.)

375
00:21:58,408 --> 00:21:59,408
(Uie)

376
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:03,479
(She even gets past a few participants.)

377
00:22:05,118 --> 00:22:08,388
I had a feeling that I should give a full spurt from the start.

378
00:22:09,084 --> 00:22:12,554
At least, I knew I was good at riding on the uphill roads.

379
00:22:12,588 --> 00:22:13,588
(She makes use of her strength on the uphill.)

380
00:22:13,888 --> 00:22:15,559
"I have to run at full speed from the beginning."

381
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:20,128
(Her tactic was to speed up early.)

382
00:22:21,969 --> 00:22:24,428
(She's fine on the uphill road.)

383
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,667
(But once she passes the uphill,)

384
00:22:27,668 --> 00:22:29,568
(there's a downhill road.)

385
00:22:29,569 --> 00:22:32,178
(From here, the downhill road begins.)

386
00:22:32,838 --> 00:22:36,479
(Until now, Uie was afraid to speed up on downhill roads.)

387
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:40,719
(She enters the downhill road.)

388
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,559
(On the steep downhill, she starts pedaling!)

389
00:22:47,588 --> 00:22:52,199
(She was afraid to speed up on a downhill road before.)

390
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,528
(But she goes down with confidence.)

391
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:57,668
Is she Uie?

392
00:22:58,098 --> 00:23:00,469
- There she is. - It's Uie.

393
00:23:00,638 --> 00:23:03,538
When I was watching her on the TV, she was afraid of cycling.

394
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,309
But she doesn't seem afraid at all.

395
00:23:08,078 --> 00:23:12,449
(Now she has overcome her fear.)

396
00:23:12,578 --> 00:23:13,818
(Uie)

397
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:14,848
Let's go, Uie!

398
00:23:15,588 --> 00:23:18,918
(On the flatland, she is in her element.)

399
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:24,088
(Not to be cut off, she should ride at 25km per hour.)

400
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:27,398
(Her current speed is 29km per hour.)

401
00:23:28,969 --> 00:23:32,199
(Her speed is pretty stable.)

402
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:33,239
(Uie)

403
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,569
(She passes the 4km point only in 7 minutes.)

404
00:23:38,108 --> 00:23:39,809
This feeling... Okay.

405
00:23:42,348 --> 00:23:45,978
(While Uie, who has improved greatly, is cycling,)

406
00:23:45,979 --> 00:23:50,417
(Finish line)

407
00:23:50,418 --> 00:23:53,988
(In Ah is almost at the finish line.)

408
00:23:53,989 --> 00:23:54,989
(In Ah)

409
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:59,628
(From the forefront of the red-cap group,)

410
00:24:00,158 --> 00:24:03,799
(she overtakes the yellow-cap swimmers in front of her.)

411
00:24:04,229 --> 00:24:08,098
(She is now right in front of the finish line.)

412
00:24:08,668 --> 00:24:12,678
(What is In Ah's swimming record?)

413
00:24:15,408 --> 00:24:19,779
(In Ah's 1.5km swimming record: 30 minutes and 58 seconds)

414
00:24:20,678 --> 00:24:25,618
(Shortened by 2 minutes 50 seconds compared to the mock triathlon)

415
00:24:26,388 --> 00:24:27,417
You're awesome.

416
00:24:27,418 --> 00:24:29,888
(The spectators are amazed by her fast record.)

417
00:24:30,588 --> 00:24:32,758
- You can do it! - You're amazing!

418
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:33,759
(Without a moment of rest,)

419
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:38,199
(she sprints to the transition area.)

420
00:24:39,368 --> 00:24:40,739
- Let's do this! - Seol In Ah! You can do it!

421
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:43,509
(She changes her output quickly.)

422
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,539
You're amazing.

423
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:47,708
(She puts on her cycling shoes...)

424
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:50,348
(and gets hydrated.)

425
00:24:51,078 --> 00:24:52,577
Seol In Ah! You can do it!

426
00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:54,219
(She sprints again wasting no time.)

427
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:56,048
- Seol In Ah! You can do it! - Let's do this!

428
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:57,948
(Time spent at the transition area: 3 minutes and 9 seconds)

429
00:24:57,949 --> 00:24:59,417
Don't run!

430
00:24:59,418 --> 00:25:01,729
Move more forward and start cycling there!

431
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:03,458
You can do it!

432
00:25:03,459 --> 00:25:06,199
(In Ah starts cycling.)

433
00:25:06,658 --> 00:25:07,828
You can do it!

434
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:11,167
(As soon as she starts, with incredible speed,)

435
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,398
- You can do it! - You can do it!

436
00:25:15,368 --> 00:25:17,968
(she enters the uphill road.)

437
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:19,039
This is crazy.

438
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:21,438
Yes, that's the way.

439
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:26,578
(She handles the uphill with no problem.)

440
00:25:26,878 --> 00:25:29,319
(Here comes Iron In Ah.)

441
00:25:30,949 --> 00:25:35,759
(She cycles more quickly at downhill.)

442
00:25:36,858 --> 00:25:38,857
(Her current speed: 46 km per hour)

443
00:25:38,858 --> 00:25:41,199
(In Ah)

444
00:25:44,428 --> 00:25:47,538
(While In Ah is cycling at full speed...)

445
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:48,568
(Finish line, Ju Hyun)

446
00:25:48,569 --> 00:25:50,309
(Ju Hyun is almost at the finish line.)

447
00:25:50,969 --> 00:25:54,709
(The last battle towards the finish line.)

448
00:25:55,949 --> 00:25:58,418
(Her swimming cap is about to fall off.)

449
00:25:59,378 --> 00:26:02,548
(It isn't easy to look forward as well.)

450
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:03,549
(Ju Hyun)

451
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:06,618
(But she struggles until the end.)

452
00:26:07,188 --> 00:26:11,357
(She is now almost done swimming.)

453
00:26:11,358 --> 00:26:13,427
(Ju Hyun)

454
00:26:13,428 --> 00:26:15,798
(Ju Hyun finishes the swimming course.)

455
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:17,468
Park Ju Hyun finishes swimming.

456
00:26:17,469 --> 00:26:18,538
- You can do it! - You can do it!

457
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:19,597
- Good job. - You can do it!

458
00:26:19,598 --> 00:26:20,638
(Ju Hyun's 1.5km swimming record: 35 minutes and 49 seconds)

459
00:26:21,598 --> 00:26:24,838
(Shortened by 2 minutes 19 seconds compared to the mock triathlon)

460
00:26:25,438 --> 00:26:31,508
(Ju Hyun sprints to the transition area.)

461
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:33,918
- You can do it! - You can do it!

462
00:26:34,118 --> 00:26:35,519
Change your outfits.

463
00:26:35,949 --> 00:26:38,388
(She hurriedly changes her outfit.)

464
00:26:39,088 --> 00:26:40,819
The physical fight was so intense.

465
00:26:41,888 --> 00:26:43,558
- My goodness! - It's 36 minutes!

466
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,357
It felt like a martial arts fight.

467
00:26:45,358 --> 00:26:46,459
(It felt more like martial arts than swimming.)

468
00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:48,768
(She quickly finishes preparing for cycling.)

469
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:50,127
- You can do it! - You can do it!

470
00:26:50,128 --> 00:26:51,327
- Good job. - You can do it!

471
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:52,768
Ju Hyun, you can do it!

472
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:53,867
Let's do this!

473
00:26:53,868 --> 00:26:55,368
(She goes for the cycling course.)

474
00:26:55,908 --> 00:26:57,308
(Time spent at the transition area: 2 minutes and 43 seconds)

475
00:26:57,309 --> 00:26:59,138
- Let's do this! - You can do it!

476
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:03,779
(The remaining time until the cutoff of 2 hours and 30 minutes)

477
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:05,847
- Move forward to ride. - Move forward to ride.

478
00:27:05,848 --> 00:27:07,177
Move forward.

479
00:27:07,178 --> 00:27:08,319
(1 hour and 50 minutes left)

480
00:27:09,749 --> 00:27:11,148
What's with this?

481
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,289
Look forward!

482
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:14,519
Be careful!

483
00:27:15,158 --> 00:27:16,388
The gear...

484
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:19,058
Why is the gear so smooth?

485
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:21,759
(She can't start cycling.)

486
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:24,529
The gear...

487
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,038
- Why? - The gear is strange.

488
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:28,509
The chain came off. Move to your right.

489
00:27:29,069 --> 00:27:30,708
- Move to your right. - Good job!

490
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:33,108
- Why did it come off? - The chain came off.

491
00:27:33,878 --> 00:27:35,147
What should I do?

492
00:27:35,148 --> 00:27:39,918
(Ju Hyun never experienced this kind of emergency.)

493
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:41,917
Let me help. You need to pull it from behind.

494
00:27:41,918 --> 00:27:43,518
(Rules: The athletes must solve any issues themselves.)

495
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:45,758
Lift the back wheel and rotate it.

496
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:47,618
- This way? - Watch your hand.

497
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:49,858
- Get your hands off. - Wait, it's not in yet.

498
00:27:50,489 --> 00:27:52,327
- It's done. Remove your hands. - No, but...

499
00:27:52,328 --> 00:27:54,498
- Put it back in. - I got it in.

500
00:27:54,499 --> 00:27:55,499
- Did you? - Yes.

501
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,167
- Lift and rotate it. - Lift?

502
00:27:57,168 --> 00:27:58,837
- Rotate it. - In this direction?

503
00:27:58,838 --> 00:28:00,068
Get it in.

504
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:01,437
- Yes, good. - Slowly.

505
00:28:01,438 --> 00:28:02,708
- It's done. - It's okay now.

506
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:03,808
- It's done. - Okay!

507
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:05,907
- It's done. Why did it come off? - I don't know.

508
00:28:05,908 --> 00:28:08,407
You shouldn't change the gear too quickly.

509
00:28:08,408 --> 00:28:09,448
- For your gear... - I...

510
00:28:09,449 --> 00:28:11,248
Take it slow. Don't rush.

511
00:28:11,249 --> 00:28:13,019
You're not falling behind so take it slow.

512
00:28:14,418 --> 00:28:15,418
Slowly.

513
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:16,748
Don't change the gear immediately.

514
00:28:16,749 --> 00:28:18,887
Okay? Stay close.

515
00:28:18,888 --> 00:28:20,819
- Let's do this. - You can do it!

516
00:28:20,989 --> 00:28:22,357
Good luck!

517
00:28:22,358 --> 00:28:26,657
(Ju Hyun starts cycling.)

518
00:28:26,658 --> 00:28:27,699
Slowly.

519
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:31,699
(She starts calmly even though the chain is making her anxious.)

520
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:33,667
Park Ju Hyun, you can do it!

521
00:28:33,668 --> 00:28:34,937
- You can do it! - Let's go!

522
00:28:34,938 --> 00:28:35,968
- Let's do this! - You can do it!

523
00:28:35,969 --> 00:28:38,979
(She recharges her energy with people's cheers.)

524
00:28:39,608 --> 00:28:41,738
(She pulls herself together...)

525
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:45,918
(and charges forward at full speed.)

526
00:28:46,918 --> 00:28:50,318
(She recharges her energy first.)

527
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,387
(She enters the uphill area fast.)

528
00:28:51,388 --> 00:28:52,458
You're doing well!

529
00:28:52,459 --> 00:28:53,658
(Ju Hyun)

530
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:55,588
It's okay. I can just do this.

531
00:28:55,828 --> 00:28:58,229
This area is hard.

532
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,999
I can take it easy.

533
00:29:01,398 --> 00:29:02,468
Take it easy.

534
00:29:02,469 --> 00:29:04,598
(It has been 45 minutes into the triathlon.)

535
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:08,868
(Starting point, 22km halfway point)

536
00:29:09,469 --> 00:29:13,338
(One person is still swimming.)

537
00:29:13,678 --> 00:29:21,948
(Finish line)

538
00:29:21,949 --> 00:29:22,949
(Seo Yeon)

539
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:26,489
(There's 5 minutes left until the cutoff.)

540
00:29:27,388 --> 00:29:29,289
(She has 200m left.)

541
00:29:30,358 --> 00:29:33,229
(There's no more time to waste.)

542
00:29:33,658 --> 00:29:36,098
(She needs to speed up.)

543
00:29:36,598 --> 00:29:40,638
(Even though she's out of breath, she swims faster.)

544
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:42,738
(She makes her final sprint.)

545
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,538
(It's almost the cutoff time.)

546
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:46,208
(Seo Yeon)

547
00:29:46,209 --> 00:29:48,778
(Will Seo Yeon...)

548
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:52,479
(manage to arrive within the cutoff?)

549
00:29:53,118 --> 00:29:55,648
(Remaining time: 3 minutes)

550
00:29:56,049 --> 00:29:57,219
She needs to arrive.

551
00:29:57,789 --> 00:29:59,058
She needs to arrive within 3 minutes.

552
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:00,518
Oh, my gosh.

553
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:02,229
There's not much time left.

554
00:30:02,459 --> 00:30:05,898
Jin Seo Yeon hasn't arrived yet.

555
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:09,769
She'll be the last one to finish swimming.

556
00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:13,269
(Seo Yeon can't be found anywhere.)

557
00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:18,539
I can see her!

558
00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:22,348
(Seo Yeon can be seen from afar.)

559
00:30:23,108 --> 00:30:25,778
(Until the cutoff of 50 minutes,)

560
00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:27,248
(Seo Yeon)

561
00:30:27,249 --> 00:30:30,289
(there's 2 minutes and 40 minutes left.)

562
00:30:31,449 --> 00:30:34,187
(A little bit faster)

563
00:30:34,188 --> 00:30:36,858
(A little bit more)

564
00:30:37,188 --> 00:30:38,188
Oh, no.

565
00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:40,398
She needs to arrive.

566
00:30:40,658 --> 00:30:42,768
She can do this!

567
00:30:42,769 --> 00:30:43,968
She's coming.

568
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:46,268
Jin Seo Yeon, you can do it! You're almost here!

569
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:47,298
You can do it!

570
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:51,638
(Seo Yeon)

571
00:30:52,908 --> 00:30:55,308
(Seo Yeon's 1.5km swimming record)

572
00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:58,917
Jin Seo Yeon, you can do it!

573
00:30:58,918 --> 00:31:02,049
(48 minutes and 7 seconds)

574
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:04,187
- You can do it! - Let's go!

575
00:31:04,188 --> 00:31:07,289
(She finishes the course with 1 minute and 53 seconds left.)

576
00:31:08,188 --> 00:31:12,158
(Shortened by 12 minutes 12 seconds compared to the mock triathlon)

577
00:31:13,598 --> 00:31:16,827
(After spending 48 minutes with her,)

578
00:31:16,828 --> 00:31:19,367
(the spectators give her enthusiastic cheers.)

579
00:31:19,368 --> 00:31:21,338
- You can do it! - Let's go!

580
00:31:21,438 --> 00:31:24,808
- You can do it! - Let's go!

581
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:26,479
(It's too early to be happy.)

582
00:31:26,838 --> 00:31:29,248
(She finished only 1.5km of the triathlon course.)

583
00:31:29,249 --> 00:31:30,407
- You can do it! - You're awesome!

584
00:31:30,408 --> 00:31:32,319
She's coming!

585
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:35,177
(She needs to reduce the time spent at the transition area.)

586
00:31:35,178 --> 00:31:36,848
Change your outfit and put on the helmet.

587
00:31:37,418 --> 00:31:39,289
(She doesn't put on socks and gloves to reduce time.)

588
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:41,018
You don't need all that.

589
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:42,458
(She puts on her goggles and helmet.)

590
00:31:42,459 --> 00:31:43,988
- You can do it! - You can do it!

591
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:45,459
(She departs immediately.)

592
00:31:46,328 --> 00:31:47,498
(Time spent at the transition area: 3 minutes and 4 seconds)

593
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:48,628
- You are doing well! - Let's go.

594
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:49,969
You did well!

595
00:31:50,328 --> 00:31:52,068
- You can do it! - You can do it!

596
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:53,198
You need to go over there.

597
00:31:53,199 --> 00:31:55,268
- Cross the mount line. - Come here.

598
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:56,538
- Start after the mount line. - Wait.

599
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,137
- You can do it! - You can do it!

600
00:31:58,138 --> 00:32:01,137
(Seo Yeon starts cycling.)

601
00:32:01,138 --> 00:32:02,748
- You can do it! - You can do it!

602
00:32:02,749 --> 00:32:03,979
- Jin Seo Yeon. You can do it! - You can do it!

603
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:05,031
- You can do it! - You can do it!

604
00:32:05,032 --> 00:32:07,871
(Until the cutoff of 2 hours and 30 minutes,)

605
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:10,521
(there's only 1 hour and 38 minutes left.)

606
00:32:11,021 --> 00:32:13,121
(There's not much time left for cycling too.)

607
00:32:13,321 --> 00:32:16,961
(She cycles at full speed from the start.)

608
00:32:16,962 --> 00:32:19,261
(Seo Yeon)

609
00:32:19,262 --> 00:32:20,361
Turn left.

610
00:32:20,662 --> 00:32:21,961
- You can do it! - You can do it!

611
00:32:22,531 --> 00:32:23,931
- Okay! - You can do it!

612
00:32:23,932 --> 00:32:25,001
Okay!

613
00:32:25,332 --> 00:32:26,641
(Now she realizes that she has completed the swim.)

614
00:32:26,642 --> 00:32:27,840
Swimming was crazy.

615
00:32:27,841 --> 00:32:29,711
(How did I complete it?)

616
00:32:30,171 --> 00:32:31,471
(Screaming out of joy)

617
00:32:31,472 --> 00:32:32,481
I can do it!

618
00:32:32,881 --> 00:32:34,711
Now that I completed swimming, I can do anything.

619
00:32:36,912 --> 00:32:38,051
I can do it.

620
00:32:38,921 --> 00:32:41,451
I can do it!

621
00:32:41,452 --> 00:32:42,891
(I can do cycling too!)

622
00:32:42,892 --> 00:32:44,051
You can do it!

623
00:32:44,452 --> 00:32:45,662
I've got only today!

624
00:32:46,892 --> 00:32:48,361
No chance after today!

625
00:32:54,731 --> 00:32:58,171
(Everyone including Seo Yeon entered the cycling course.)

626
00:32:58,472 --> 00:33:01,742
(Which area are the three members passing by?)

627
00:33:01,841 --> 00:33:03,211
(From here...)

628
00:33:05,071 --> 00:33:06,981
(until here, it's all uphill.)

629
00:33:07,711 --> 00:33:11,751
(They need to climb up for 1.5km.)

630
00:33:12,481 --> 00:33:16,151
(Horrific uphill area)

631
00:33:16,392 --> 00:33:17,951
(Uie is passing the 5km point.)

632
00:33:17,952 --> 00:33:18,991
You can do it!

633
00:33:18,992 --> 00:33:21,821
(Her current location)

634
00:33:22,631 --> 00:33:26,331
(She keeps climbing up.)

635
00:33:26,332 --> 00:33:28,361
You can do it! Uie, you can do it!

636
00:33:29,472 --> 00:33:31,101
Good job. You're doing a great job!

637
00:33:31,102 --> 00:33:33,441
(Using Coach Heo's encouragement as a stepping stone,)

638
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:39,881
(she's climbing steadily.)

639
00:33:40,682 --> 00:33:44,851
(In Ah is chasing her closely too.)

640
00:33:44,852 --> 00:33:45,952
Let's go.

641
00:33:46,421 --> 00:33:48,182
Gosh, this is killing me.

642
00:33:50,352 --> 00:33:52,050
- You can do it! - Let's do this.

643
00:33:52,051 --> 00:33:53,892
(Iron Stamina In Ah is being overtaken.)

644
00:33:55,091 --> 00:33:56,591
Everyone's so good at cycling.

645
00:33:59,531 --> 00:34:04,202
(She takes an energy gel and continues to ride.)

646
00:34:05,231 --> 00:34:08,841
(Ju Hyun is behind In Ah.)

647
00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:11,011
It took 30 minutes to ride 10km.

648
00:34:11,012 --> 00:34:12,781
My shins already hurt.

649
00:34:15,551 --> 00:34:16,681
What should I do?

650
00:34:16,682 --> 00:34:18,751
(Ju Hyun's leg got tired after cycling uphill continuously.)

651
00:34:19,481 --> 00:34:21,651
I'm bad at uphills.

652
00:34:23,051 --> 00:34:24,451
My goodness.

653
00:34:24,452 --> 00:34:27,762
(But the uphill road is never-ending.)

654
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:33,102
(The average speed should be faster than 25km per hour.)

655
00:34:34,131 --> 00:34:37,501
(Her current speed: 15km per hour)

656
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:39,372
No, I have to move faster.

657
00:34:41,202 --> 00:34:42,372
No!

658
00:34:43,111 --> 00:34:44,142
Please!

659
00:34:46,742 --> 00:34:49,051
I'll cry if I see my members.

660
00:34:52,981 --> 00:34:55,122
(Sobbing quietly)

661
00:34:56,452 --> 00:34:57,590
You're doing so well.

662
00:34:57,591 --> 00:34:59,561
(Captain Kim comforts her who's about to cry.)

663
00:34:59,562 --> 00:35:02,691
If you're cut off here, everyone behind you will be cut off.

664
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:05,261
Just don't get hurt.

665
00:35:05,262 --> 00:35:06,701
- Don't push yourself too hard. - Right.

666
00:35:06,702 --> 00:35:09,831
I just need to complete the race.

667
00:35:09,832 --> 00:35:10,832
Of course!

668
00:35:12,341 --> 00:35:16,012
(She pulls herself together with Captain's support.)

669
00:35:16,472 --> 00:35:18,411
The road will be flat.

670
00:35:18,412 --> 00:35:19,481
(It will be flat after some time.)

671
00:35:19,781 --> 00:35:21,012
I can't stop.

672
00:35:23,312 --> 00:35:28,551
(While Ju Hyun is struggling to climb up,)

673
00:35:28,992 --> 00:35:32,190
(Seo Yeon is cycling like crazy.)

674
00:35:32,191 --> 00:35:35,861
(Her current speed: 42.2km per hour)

675
00:35:36,332 --> 00:35:39,432
(She's speeding up while controlling her breathing.)

676
00:35:39,861 --> 00:35:43,772
(She sprints to make up for swimming.)

677
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:49,872
(She's so fast that the camera can't keep up to record her.)

678
00:35:50,571 --> 00:35:53,082
(From now on, it's a mental battle.)

679
00:35:53,481 --> 00:35:54,812
Let's just do it and die!

680
00:35:57,381 --> 00:35:58,581
Do it and die!

681
00:35:58,582 --> 00:35:59,750
(Iron Mentality of living for today)

682
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:00,851
(Seo Yeon)

683
00:36:00,852 --> 00:36:01,981
Do it and die!

684
00:36:03,292 --> 00:36:04,292
I can do it!

685
00:36:06,562 --> 00:36:09,631
(The intensity of the course makes her groan.)

686
00:36:10,392 --> 00:36:15,301
(She gasps for breath.)

687
00:36:16,031 --> 00:36:17,371
Dear legs,

688
00:36:17,372 --> 00:36:19,301
please help.

689
00:36:20,242 --> 00:36:21,242
Jin Seo Yeon, you can do it!

690
00:36:21,243 --> 00:36:22,372
- You can do it! - Let's do this!

691
00:36:23,142 --> 00:36:25,341
- Jin Seo Yeon, you can do it! - Let's do this!

692
00:36:25,682 --> 00:36:27,412
- Jin Seo Yeon, you can do it! - Let's do this!

693
00:36:27,642 --> 00:36:29,110
- You can do it! - Let's do this!

694
00:36:29,111 --> 00:36:30,111
(Every time it gets tough, the athletes' cheers pour in.)

695
00:36:31,251 --> 00:36:32,622
- You can do it! - I can do it!

696
00:36:34,122 --> 00:36:35,320
It took me 48 minutes to complete swimming.

697
00:36:35,321 --> 00:36:36,820
(She suddenly brags.)

698
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:38,321
- Okay. - It took me 48 minutes!

699
00:36:40,762 --> 00:36:44,091
(The more she thinks about it, the more impressed she is.)

700
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:47,932
(There's nothing I can't do if I completed swimming.)

701
00:36:48,432 --> 00:36:53,341
(Seo Yeon passes the 4km point.)

702
00:36:54,501 --> 00:36:59,481
(Will Seo Yeon complete the race within the cutoff?)

703
00:37:04,381 --> 00:37:07,281
(What's the next course that Uie and In Ah are facing?)

704
00:37:07,781 --> 00:37:10,091
(The fiery camelback course)

705
00:37:11,392 --> 00:37:13,460
Oh, my goodness!

706
00:37:13,461 --> 00:37:14,521
(Twisting, long stretches of steep inclines and sharp turns)

707
00:37:14,522 --> 00:37:15,622
My gosh.

708
00:37:17,131 --> 00:37:20,602
(Uie enters the nightmarish camelback course first.)

709
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:26,171
(Unlike the other members, she's not wearing cycling shoes.)

710
00:37:27,472 --> 00:37:32,012
(She doesn't have any fancy dancing techniques too.)

711
00:37:32,841 --> 00:37:36,481
(She's just climbing with her legs' strength.)

712
00:37:36,711 --> 00:37:37,851
Let's go!

713
00:37:37,852 --> 00:37:39,351
(She's getting tired.)

714
00:37:39,352 --> 00:37:41,352
Keep up the speed.

715
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:49,792
(Uie keeps getting overtaken.)

716
00:37:50,762 --> 00:37:53,062
- Oh, no. - Uie, you can do it!

717
00:37:53,832 --> 00:37:58,131
(The continuous uphill makes her legs feel weak.)

718
00:37:58,832 --> 00:38:02,742
(It seems like she has reached her limit.)

719
00:38:03,372 --> 00:38:07,341
(Another crisis for Uie)

720
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:09,182
For me, the biggest challenge was...

721
00:38:10,281 --> 00:38:13,082
the extreme thirst that was burning me up.

722
00:38:13,481 --> 00:38:15,650
I couldn't free my hands.

723
00:38:15,651 --> 00:38:17,091
I wanted to drink water so badly.

724
00:38:18,492 --> 00:38:23,762
(Others could free their hand from the handle to drink water.)

725
00:38:24,492 --> 00:38:28,001
(But Uie can't remove her hands from the handle.)

726
00:38:28,202 --> 00:38:31,401
My plan was to drink water at the halfway point.

727
00:38:32,031 --> 00:38:34,801
"I can only drink if I finish within the cutoff."

728
00:38:35,142 --> 00:38:36,711
I was thinking like that while cycling.

729
00:38:39,512 --> 00:38:41,710
(Uie is growing weary from the continuous harsh conditions.)

730
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:42,912
Seriously.

731
00:38:46,222 --> 00:38:47,551
Move to your right!

732
00:38:48,122 --> 00:38:49,452
I am already at my right.

733
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:54,021
- Move more to your right! - I moved already.

734
00:38:54,022 --> 00:38:55,022
(Uie gets criticized for safety reason.)

735
00:38:55,023 --> 00:38:56,292
Since people are passing by.

736
00:38:57,131 --> 00:38:59,131
I'm already at my right.

737
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:03,431
How much more can I go right?

738
00:39:03,432 --> 00:39:05,472
(She's doing her best.)

739
00:39:06,441 --> 00:39:07,472
Seriously.

740
00:39:08,071 --> 00:39:12,340
(Overcome with sorrow, she finally breaks down in tears.)

741
00:39:12,341 --> 00:39:16,182
While cycling, a little thing...

742
00:39:16,211 --> 00:39:17,651
can make me anxious.

743
00:39:18,082 --> 00:39:20,751
My throat is burning with thirst, my mind is foggy,

744
00:39:20,981 --> 00:39:22,452
and my whole body hurts.

745
00:39:23,022 --> 00:39:25,452
That's why I teared up.

746
00:39:26,591 --> 00:39:27,792
It's okay. You're doing great!

747
00:39:28,961 --> 00:39:31,761
Don’t be scared. You’re doing great. Just keep going like this!

748
00:39:31,762 --> 00:39:33,562
(Coach Heo comforts Uie who's tired.)

749
00:39:35,262 --> 00:39:39,542
(Actually, Uie...)

750
00:39:40,472 --> 00:39:44,071
(is maintaining a stable speed for her cycling today.)

751
00:39:46,941 --> 00:39:53,952
(From uphill to downhill)

752
00:39:54,452 --> 00:39:57,952
(She cycles fast.)

753
00:39:58,551 --> 00:39:59,821
Where's Uie?

754
00:40:00,961 --> 00:40:03,691
(It's about time to see her.)

755
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:05,131
I guess we're very far apart!

756
00:40:06,461 --> 00:40:07,631
Kim Uie is awesome!

757
00:40:10,432 --> 00:40:14,001
(Making sure not to be overtaken by others trailing behind her,)

758
00:40:14,441 --> 00:40:18,611
(she is maintaining a fast pace.)

759
00:40:19,171 --> 00:40:20,440
We're almost at the halfway point.

760
00:40:20,441 --> 00:40:22,881
(The halfway point is finally here.)

761
00:40:23,512 --> 00:40:25,051
We're here. Climb with strength!

762
00:40:28,352 --> 00:40:29,551
Do you think I can turn?

763
00:40:30,492 --> 00:40:31,492
You can do it!

764
00:40:31,493 --> 00:40:33,821
(Uie passes the halfway point at 1 hour 27 minutes 50 seconds.)

765
00:40:36,932 --> 00:40:40,131
(If she maintains the speed,)

766
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:43,471
(she'll finish cycling with her best record.)

767
00:40:43,472 --> 00:40:44,501
(Oh, no!)

768
00:40:48,602 --> 00:40:52,012
(She lost her balance and let go of the handlebars.)

769
00:40:52,472 --> 00:40:56,711
(She fell so hard that her outfit ripped.)

770
00:40:57,281 --> 00:41:00,921
I made a U-turn thinking of finishing within the cutoff.

771
00:41:01,051 --> 00:41:03,151
I think I was too excited.

772
00:41:04,492 --> 00:41:09,691
(She starts with the much-needed hydration.)

773
00:41:10,231 --> 00:41:12,131
(She's about to cycle again, but...)

774
00:41:14,361 --> 00:41:15,531
What should I do with this?

775
00:41:17,671 --> 00:41:21,001
(The chain came off when she fell down.)

776
00:41:21,702 --> 00:41:26,411
(She needs to get the chain back in herself.)

777
00:41:26,412 --> 00:41:31,352
(Cycling halfway point)

778
00:41:32,312 --> 00:41:38,022
(While Uie is struggling with the chain,)

779
00:41:38,992 --> 00:41:44,461
(Iron In Ah is climbing the camelback course.)

780
00:41:45,731 --> 00:41:51,171
(This crazy uphill road is like...)

781
00:41:53,301 --> 00:41:54,400
It's a fiery pit.

782
00:41:54,401 --> 00:41:56,512
(It is a fiery pit itself.)

783
00:41:58,412 --> 00:41:59,412
Let's do this.

784
00:41:59,582 --> 00:42:03,211
Let's do this.

785
00:42:03,412 --> 00:42:04,480
Pull yourself together.

786
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:07,682
(The grueling cycling course makes her mind go blank.)

787
00:42:08,582 --> 00:42:13,292
(But if you continue to climb up,)

788
00:42:14,622 --> 00:42:20,631
(a sweet downhill appears.)

789
00:42:22,531 --> 00:42:25,332
(Iron In Ah speeds up.)

790
00:42:25,801 --> 00:42:29,372
(She goes down the last curved path.)

791
00:42:29,941 --> 00:42:31,141
(She speeds up towards the halfway point.)

792
00:42:31,142 --> 00:42:32,881
Good job. You're doing so well.

793
00:42:35,941 --> 00:42:39,251
(In Ah enters the halfway point.)

794
00:42:39,312 --> 00:42:41,821
(But)

795
00:42:41,852 --> 00:42:44,492
Is she hurt?

796
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:50,392
(In An heads to the halfway point looking at Uie.)

797
00:42:50,731 --> 00:42:53,131
(In Ah passes the halfway point at 1 hour 29 minutes 30 seconds.)

798
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:56,472
Uie, you can do it!

799
00:42:57,501 --> 00:42:58,571
Uie, you can do it!

800
00:42:59,472 --> 00:43:01,141
Hang in there. You can do it. Be careful!

801
00:43:01,142 --> 00:43:02,702
(She is worried about Uie more than her race.)

802
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:07,111
(In Ah passes the halfway point.)

803
00:43:07,441 --> 00:43:09,412
(Uie is struggling to fix her bike.)

804
00:43:09,611 --> 00:43:10,650
Slow down.

805
00:43:10,651 --> 00:43:11,981
(Coach Heo looks at her with pity.)

806
00:43:12,711 --> 00:43:15,622
- Slow down. - Make a wide turn.

807
00:43:15,852 --> 00:43:16,920
- Is this done? - Make a wide turn.

808
00:43:16,921 --> 00:43:18,452
(It's done!)

809
00:43:19,421 --> 00:43:22,892
(She finishes fixing her bike, fortunately.)

810
00:43:23,932 --> 00:43:24,932
I can do this.

811
00:43:25,361 --> 00:43:27,730
- Make a slow turn. - You can do it.

812
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:28,731
(The cutoff time for cycling is 2 hours 30 minutes.)

813
00:43:29,531 --> 00:43:32,372
(She has 59 minutes left since she lost 4 minutes fixing the bike.)

814
00:43:33,972 --> 00:43:35,141
(Uie rather looks bright?)

815
00:43:35,142 --> 00:43:38,071
I fell once, so I won't fall again. Let's move on to the end.

816
00:43:40,841 --> 00:43:44,481
(Uie feels more relaxed.)

817
00:43:45,111 --> 00:43:49,082
(Meanwhile, Ju Hyun heads to the halfway point.)

818
00:43:49,852 --> 00:43:53,222
(She passes someone going ahead of her.)

819
00:43:54,222 --> 00:43:55,222
Let me pass.

820
00:43:55,223 --> 00:43:58,762
(She passes others in a row.)

821
00:43:59,501 --> 00:44:04,071
(Speeding up by dancing)

822
00:44:04,671 --> 00:44:10,372
(Overcoming the uphill road bravely)

823
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:11,841
How many of these?

824
00:44:12,742 --> 00:44:13,841
How many uphill roads are in there the course?

825
00:44:15,582 --> 00:44:17,380
(She doesn't get exhausted despite the long uphill road.)

826
00:44:17,381 --> 00:44:19,412
- This is unbelievable. - You can do it!

827
00:44:20,582 --> 00:44:21,651
I'm almost there. Keep the steam up.

828
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:24,750
I can do this.

829
00:44:24,751 --> 00:44:27,361
(She keeps encouraging herself.)

830
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:31,662
(The end of the camelback course)

831
00:44:32,392 --> 00:44:33,460
(Then she sees someone familiar!)

832
00:44:33,461 --> 00:44:34,461
- Seol In Ah, you can do it! - You can do it!

833
00:44:34,462 --> 00:44:35,961
(Then she sees someone familiar!)

834
00:44:36,801 --> 00:44:39,501
(In Ah comes on the other side of the road, from the halfway point.)

835
00:44:39,872 --> 00:44:42,800
Everyone is doing a good job!

836
00:44:42,801 --> 00:44:43,871
(The members are all doing a good job!)

837
00:44:43,872 --> 00:44:44,872
Good!

838
00:44:44,873 --> 00:44:46,242
(The members are all doing a good job!)

839
00:44:46,711 --> 00:44:48,711
(After meeting In Ah,)

840
00:44:49,012 --> 00:44:52,381
(Ju Hyun sees Uie.)

841
00:44:53,421 --> 00:44:54,452
See you later.

842
00:44:55,751 --> 00:44:57,320
(Broad smile)

843
00:44:57,321 --> 00:44:59,321
(She has no time to answer though.)

844
00:45:00,022 --> 00:45:02,691
It's the halfway point!

845
00:45:03,432 --> 00:45:06,301
(The halfway point is before her eyes, at last.)

846
00:45:06,861 --> 00:45:10,231
(Passing people ahead of her by putting on a spurt)

847
00:45:10,372 --> 00:45:11,432
Oh, my gosh.

848
00:45:12,202 --> 00:45:13,741
It's the halfway point!

849
00:45:13,742 --> 00:45:17,142
(It's the halfway point!)

850
00:45:17,542 --> 00:45:22,082
(At last, Ju Hyun arrives at the halfway point.)

851
00:45:22,742 --> 00:45:25,852
(Ju Hyun passes the halfway point at 1 hour 35 minutes 6 seconds.)

852
00:45:26,151 --> 00:45:27,151
(The cutoff time for cycling is 2 hours 30 minutes.)

853
00:45:27,152 --> 00:45:28,221
I can do it.

854
00:45:28,222 --> 00:45:29,452
(The cut-off time for cycling is 2 hours 30 minutes.)

855
00:45:30,392 --> 00:45:31,451
I have to go!

856
00:45:31,452 --> 00:45:32,550
(Ju Hyun has 55 minutes left.)

857
00:45:32,551 --> 00:45:33,561
It's fun to go back.

858
00:45:33,562 --> 00:45:34,691
(Ju Hyun has 55 minutes left.)

859
00:45:34,921 --> 00:45:35,991
(22km halfway point)

860
00:45:35,992 --> 00:45:37,162
(What's Seo Yeon's current location?)

861
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:39,861
(No one can avoid the terrible camelback course.)

862
00:45:40,401 --> 00:45:41,931
(Seo Yeon is the last to enter the section.)

863
00:45:41,932 --> 00:45:44,932
(Seo Yeon)

864
00:45:50,071 --> 00:45:53,211
(Her current speed: 9.2km per hour)

865
00:45:53,512 --> 00:45:54,512
(Seo Yeon)

866
00:45:54,513 --> 00:45:57,711
(With this speed, it's highly probable that she'll be cut off.)

867
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:03,892
(She looks exhausted due to the uphill road.)

868
00:46:04,151 --> 00:46:06,050
I'm doing all right.

869
00:46:06,051 --> 00:46:08,262
(I'm doing all right.)

870
00:46:09,162 --> 00:46:11,961
(While breathing heavily,)

871
00:46:13,162 --> 00:46:16,231
(she starts dancing.)

872
00:46:17,272 --> 00:46:22,001
(She needs to speed up on the uphill road too!)

873
00:46:22,941 --> 00:46:27,381
(She begins to gain speed.)

874
00:46:28,142 --> 00:46:30,912
(What comes next after the uphill road of adversity?)

875
00:46:31,952 --> 00:46:34,651
(She can go fast as much as she likes...)

876
00:46:35,022 --> 00:46:38,022
(in the downhill section.)

877
00:46:38,751 --> 00:46:42,062
(Spurting)

878
00:46:43,031 --> 00:46:47,332
(Her current speed: 41km per hour)

879
00:46:52,472 --> 00:46:53,501
Yes!

880
00:46:54,671 --> 00:46:55,702
I'm almost there!

881
00:46:57,341 --> 00:46:58,372
Seo Yeon, you're almost there.

882
00:46:59,941 --> 00:47:02,142
(As she goes at full speed,)

883
00:47:02,742 --> 00:47:04,411
(the halfway point is ahead, after all.)

884
00:47:04,412 --> 00:47:06,151
Okay. I'm almost there.

885
00:47:06,722 --> 00:47:07,722
I'm almost there.

886
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:09,722
- Jin Seo Yeon, you can do it! - Jin Seo Yeon, you can do it!

887
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:10,952
It's amazing, isn't it?

888
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,190
(Seo Yeon passes the halfway point at 1 hour 49 minutes 27 seconds.)

889
00:47:12,191 --> 00:47:13,222
It's great!

890
00:47:13,792 --> 00:47:17,432
(But it's too early to relax!)

891
00:47:18,062 --> 00:47:21,602
(She has 40 minutes 31 seconds until the cutoff time.)

892
00:47:22,602 --> 00:47:25,272
(She has 18km left.)

893
00:47:25,872 --> 00:47:27,771
(Can Seo Yeon finish the cycling course?)

894
00:47:27,772 --> 00:47:28,801
I can do it, of course.

895
00:47:29,042 --> 00:47:31,371
(22km halfway point)

896
00:47:31,372 --> 00:47:33,381
(Meanwhile)

897
00:47:34,012 --> 00:47:37,211
Tongyeong is sick. I think it's crazy here.

898
00:47:38,452 --> 00:47:41,550
The cycling course of Tongyeong is really insane.

899
00:47:41,551 --> 00:47:42,751
(Fed up with the endless uphill road)

900
00:47:43,051 --> 00:47:44,051
Gosh.

901
00:47:46,151 --> 00:47:49,161
How come everyone is so good? It's unbelievable.

902
00:47:49,162 --> 00:47:50,391
(So many people get ahead of her.)

903
00:47:50,392 --> 00:47:51,392
Seriously.

904
00:47:53,031 --> 00:47:54,102
You can do it.

905
00:47:56,001 --> 00:47:57,630
- You can do it. - You can do it.

906
00:47:57,631 --> 00:47:58,670
(She doesn't lose her positive energy.)

907
00:47:58,671 --> 00:47:59,772
We're almost there.

908
00:48:00,941 --> 00:48:04,211
(Iron In Ah goes with all her might.)

909
00:48:04,671 --> 00:48:07,142
(She has 40 minutes left.)

910
00:48:07,381 --> 00:48:09,440
(She has 8km to go.)

911
00:48:09,441 --> 00:48:11,012
- You can do it! - Seol In Ah, you can do it!

912
00:48:11,111 --> 00:48:12,710
(In Ah)

913
00:48:12,711 --> 00:48:16,351
(Behind In Ah,)

914
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:18,551
(Uie is chasing her close.)

915
00:48:19,191 --> 00:48:21,891
- It's over soon. Do your best. - Okay.

916
00:48:21,892 --> 00:48:22,961
We don't have much time.

917
00:48:24,091 --> 00:48:27,062
(She has 40 minutes left.)

918
00:48:27,301 --> 00:48:30,401
(She has 9km to go.)

919
00:48:31,972 --> 00:48:38,472
(Can Uie finish the course in time?)

920
00:48:39,211 --> 00:48:41,042
(Ju Hyun is following her.)

921
00:48:41,341 --> 00:48:44,151
(She has 40 minutes left.)

922
00:48:44,381 --> 00:48:46,682
(She has 11km to go.)

923
00:48:47,222 --> 00:48:48,722
Passing.

924
00:48:49,952 --> 00:48:50,992
(Passing 1 person)

925
00:48:52,251 --> 00:48:53,721
(Going fast by pedaling hard)

926
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:54,762
Passing.

927
00:48:55,722 --> 00:48:56,762
Oh, my.

928
00:48:59,932 --> 00:49:00,961
(Passing the 5th time)

929
00:49:02,562 --> 00:49:03,571
Here I go!

930
00:49:05,671 --> 00:49:07,800
(Going while burning herself out with clenched teeth)

931
00:49:07,801 --> 00:49:08,872
Let's go.

932
00:49:09,542 --> 00:49:13,582
(She can't miss 1 minute or 1 second.)

933
00:49:13,841 --> 00:49:15,211
Passing, please.

934
00:49:18,381 --> 00:49:20,751
This feels nice!

935
00:49:20,852 --> 00:49:22,722
You've worked hard for four months, and now...

936
00:49:23,852 --> 00:49:25,352
Don't say that. I'm tearing up.

937
00:49:30,461 --> 00:49:33,731
(She goes while suppressing her feelings.)

938
00:49:37,972 --> 00:49:42,801
(She's reminded of past times and efforts.)

939
00:49:43,312 --> 00:49:46,582
(She suddenly bursts into tears.)

940
00:49:55,981 --> 00:49:59,251
(Fighting back tears again)

941
00:49:59,821 --> 00:50:00,860
This is the last.

942
00:50:00,861 --> 00:50:05,492
(Going bravely to complete the race)

943
00:50:09,501 --> 00:50:10,571
Passing.

944
00:50:11,571 --> 00:50:12,602
You can do it.

945
00:50:13,242 --> 00:50:15,340
(In Ah has 3.5km left.)

946
00:50:15,341 --> 00:50:16,741
- Go for it. - I can do it.

947
00:50:16,742 --> 00:50:19,242
(Seol In Ah's spurt)

948
00:50:20,941 --> 00:50:25,852
(She goes up the last uphill section with clenched teeth.)

949
00:50:28,022 --> 00:50:29,081
Okay.

950
00:50:29,082 --> 00:50:33,091
(And the last downhill section)

951
00:50:36,361 --> 00:50:37,461
Here I go!

952
00:50:38,892 --> 00:50:39,961
Gosh!

953
00:50:41,731 --> 00:50:42,800
(In Ah)

954
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:48,272
(She has 500m left.)

955
00:50:48,772 --> 00:50:50,772
All right!

956
00:50:51,542 --> 00:50:52,610
Let's go, Seol In Ah!

957
00:50:52,611 --> 00:50:53,812
(In Ah)

958
00:50:54,441 --> 00:50:55,710
(She has 100m left.)

959
00:50:55,711 --> 00:50:57,181
Yes!

960
00:50:57,182 --> 00:50:58,751
(She has 100m left.)

961
00:50:59,781 --> 00:51:01,320
(Now she will conquer two events soon.)

962
00:51:01,321 --> 00:51:03,591
(Dismount line)

963
00:51:03,722 --> 00:51:04,791
(In Ah)

964
00:51:04,792 --> 00:51:07,022
(In Ah gets off the bike.)

965
00:51:08,591 --> 00:51:09,722
Okay. Nice.

966
00:51:12,031 --> 00:51:16,531
(In Ah's 40km cycling record: 2 hours 6 minutes 47 seconds)

967
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:21,972
(She achieves her best record!)

968
00:51:22,571 --> 00:51:26,111
(Iron In Ah arrives at the transition area.)

969
00:51:26,272 --> 00:51:27,440
(In Ah)

970
00:51:27,441 --> 00:51:31,012
(While In Ah prepares for the last event)

971
00:51:31,352 --> 00:51:34,221
(4km point before arrival)

972
00:51:34,222 --> 00:51:37,522
(Uie enters)

973
00:51:38,492 --> 00:51:42,762
(She fell and bled, and her uniform is torn.)

974
00:51:43,432 --> 00:51:46,961
(Her face is brighter than anyone else's.)

975
00:51:48,231 --> 00:51:52,801
(Uie overcomes the fear of cycling and speeds powerfully.)

976
00:51:54,142 --> 00:51:56,471
(She goes up the uphill road in a professional posture.)

977
00:51:56,472 --> 00:51:57,512
You're almost there!

978
00:51:59,671 --> 00:52:05,682
(She goes down the downhill road fast with a smile.)

979
00:52:08,452 --> 00:52:11,122
(500m left to go)

980
00:52:11,691 --> 00:52:15,191
(300m left)

981
00:52:16,162 --> 00:52:18,230
(100m left)

982
00:52:18,231 --> 00:52:19,891
- Go! - You're doing great!

983
00:52:19,892 --> 00:52:21,702
(100m left)

984
00:52:21,861 --> 00:52:27,171
(Uie)

985
00:52:28,272 --> 00:52:29,941
Get off.

986
00:52:34,142 --> 00:52:37,682
(Uie gets off the bike.)

987
00:52:38,481 --> 00:52:39,511
You can do it.

988
00:52:39,512 --> 00:52:41,650
(What's Uie's record?)

989
00:52:41,651 --> 00:52:43,591
You can do it, Uie!

990
00:52:44,821 --> 00:52:48,321
(Uie's 40km cycling record: 2 hours 8 minutes 58 seconds)

991
00:52:48,992 --> 00:52:52,792
(The best record of Uie's cycling in her life)

992
00:52:53,401 --> 00:52:54,630
You can do it!

993
00:52:54,631 --> 00:52:58,231
(With people cheering for her,)

994
00:52:59,372 --> 00:53:02,541
(she realizes that she completed the cycling course.)

995
00:53:02,542 --> 00:53:06,941
I've become someone who can do cycling.

996
00:53:08,082 --> 00:53:12,110
I got away from a big trauma in my life. I'm so proud.

997
00:53:12,111 --> 00:53:13,821
(She nicely overcame a big trauma in her life.)

998
00:53:14,182 --> 00:53:16,122
Good. Now you're competing against me!

999
00:53:16,222 --> 00:53:17,852
- All right! - Catch me!

1000
00:53:18,591 --> 00:53:20,091
I'll beat Kim Dong Hyun.

1001
00:53:21,921 --> 00:53:22,921
Go!

1002
00:53:22,922 --> 00:53:26,332
(Go!)

1003
00:53:28,062 --> 00:53:30,832
(She beats out Captain Kim at a quick speed.)

1004
00:53:32,272 --> 00:53:35,900
(Putting on a spurt at the end!)

1005
00:53:35,901 --> 00:53:36,941
I feel good!

1006
00:53:38,441 --> 00:53:40,511
- Okay! - You can do this!

1007
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:41,710
(Ju Hyun passes other participants.)

1008
00:53:41,711 --> 00:53:43,651
Go ahead and finish the course!

1009
00:53:44,151 --> 00:53:46,451
(100m left)

1010
00:53:46,452 --> 00:53:47,622
Go ahead and finish the course!

1011
00:53:48,952 --> 00:53:51,621
(What's Ju Hyun's cycling record?)

1012
00:53:51,622 --> 00:53:53,622
Prepare for the next event.

1013
00:53:54,062 --> 00:53:56,090
Don't cross the dismount line. Get off here.

1014
00:53:56,091 --> 00:53:57,361
Please get off.

1015
00:53:58,792 --> 00:54:02,901
(Ju Hyun's 40km cycling record: 2 hours 12 minutes 39 seconds)

1016
00:54:04,171 --> 00:54:08,642
(Ju Hyun hurries to the transition area.)

1017
00:54:09,142 --> 00:54:10,542
(In haste)

1018
00:54:10,912 --> 00:54:13,110
(She starts right away.)

1019
00:54:13,111 --> 00:54:15,381
- You can do it, Ju Hyun! - Get your bib number.

1020
00:54:15,881 --> 00:54:17,981
(Childish Park is a handful today as usual.)

1021
00:54:18,512 --> 00:54:20,081
- I might be late. - You can do it!

1022
00:54:20,082 --> 00:54:21,921
It's okay.

1023
00:54:22,881 --> 00:54:23,992
You can do it!

1024
00:54:24,191 --> 00:54:26,021
- You can do it! - You can do it.

1025
00:54:26,022 --> 00:54:27,062
(Time spent at the transition area: 2 minutes and 12 seconds)

1026
00:54:27,892 --> 00:54:30,761
- You can do it! - You can do it.

1027
00:54:30,762 --> 00:54:32,891
(Ju Hyun starts running.)

1028
00:54:32,892 --> 00:54:34,231
- You can do it! - You can do it!

1029
00:54:36,262 --> 00:54:39,731
(The last event of a triathlon, running starts.)

1030
00:54:41,071 --> 00:54:43,571
(Swimming 1.5km)

1031
00:54:44,772 --> 00:54:46,812
(Cycling 40km)

1032
00:54:48,481 --> 00:54:50,651
(What begins after finishing these courses...)

1033
00:54:51,412 --> 00:54:54,622
(is 10km running, an extremely tough event.)

1034
00:54:55,022 --> 00:54:57,550
(The running course)

1035
00:54:57,551 --> 00:55:00,891
(Starting point)

1036
00:55:00,892 --> 00:55:03,831
(5.5km halfway point)

1037
00:55:03,832 --> 00:55:06,492
(A course of a total of 10km)

1038
00:55:07,102 --> 00:55:11,501
(The final test of a triathlon, the running course)

1039
00:55:12,772 --> 00:55:17,071
(After going across downtown,)

1040
00:55:18,171 --> 00:55:22,281
(the course stretches along the beach.)

1041
00:55:23,042 --> 00:55:26,312
(It stretches endlessly.)

1042
00:55:27,881 --> 00:55:30,191
(About 5km each way)

1043
00:55:30,352 --> 00:55:34,361
(Going back to the starting point from the halfway point,)

1044
00:55:35,662 --> 00:55:39,562
(the course is 10km in total.)

1045
00:55:42,762 --> 00:55:45,130
(Starting point)

1046
00:55:45,131 --> 00:55:47,601
(In Ah, Uie, and Ju Hyun have entered the running course.)

1047
00:55:47,602 --> 00:55:49,872
(5.5km halfway point)

1048
00:55:50,642 --> 00:55:52,840
(In Ah is running at the head among the members.)

1049
00:55:52,841 --> 00:55:53,912
You can do it.

1050
00:55:56,981 --> 00:55:58,210
My pace is 6 minutes 15 seconds.

1051
00:55:58,211 --> 00:55:59,912
(In Ah's current pace: 6 minutes 15 seconds)

1052
00:56:00,321 --> 00:56:04,492
(She can finish 10km in an hour with that pace.)

1053
00:56:04,551 --> 00:56:05,650
My knees hurt.

1054
00:56:05,651 --> 00:56:08,162
(1 hour 15 minutes left)

1055
00:56:08,562 --> 00:56:12,191
(There won't be a problem if she can go on like this.)

1056
00:56:12,832 --> 00:56:17,231
(The event In Ah finds most tough)

1057
00:56:19,231 --> 00:56:20,542
These are not my legs.

1058
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:25,242
(Her knees are sending a warning signal too.)

1059
00:56:25,912 --> 00:56:29,012
(Worried)

1060
00:56:30,281 --> 00:56:34,751
(Can In Ah finish running without a problem?)

1061
00:56:35,022 --> 00:56:36,081
You can do it.

1062
00:56:36,082 --> 00:56:37,751
(Meanwhile)

1063
00:56:39,551 --> 00:56:43,761
(Uie starts running second among the members.)

1064
00:56:43,762 --> 00:56:44,792
You can do it, Uie!

1065
00:56:45,691 --> 00:56:48,062
(Surprisingly,)

1066
00:56:48,702 --> 00:56:50,972
(her current pace is 4 minutes 24 seconds.)

1067
00:56:51,731 --> 00:56:55,702
(It's unbelievable she's doing so after swimming and cycling.)

1068
00:56:56,912 --> 00:56:58,141
(Passing 1 participant)

1069
00:56:58,142 --> 00:56:59,371
You can do it, Uie!

1070
00:56:59,372 --> 00:57:00,641
(Passing 1 participant)

1071
00:57:00,642 --> 00:57:04,280
(Passing another participant)

1072
00:57:04,281 --> 00:57:07,681
(Passing a participant for the 3rd time)

1073
00:57:07,682 --> 00:57:09,920
(Passing a participant for the 4th time)

1074
00:57:09,921 --> 00:57:10,921
You can do it!

1075
00:57:11,492 --> 00:57:14,360
(The best athlete of Iron Girls is back.)

1076
00:57:14,361 --> 00:57:15,992
Go for it, Uie. You can make it.

1077
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:18,860
(As she's running so hard)

1078
00:57:18,861 --> 00:57:19,861
You can do it, Uie.
(Uie)

1079
00:57:20,862 --> 00:57:22,131
Why is In Ah here?

1080
00:57:22,501 --> 00:57:23,931
- What? - Why is In Ah here?

1081
00:57:23,932 --> 00:57:24,932
You can do it!

1082
00:57:25,932 --> 00:57:30,441
(In Ah is right in front of Uie?)

1083
00:57:31,841 --> 00:57:37,650
(Due to Uie's quick pace)

1084
00:57:37,651 --> 00:57:38,710
(In Ah, Uie)

1085
00:57:38,711 --> 00:57:44,121
(They're getting closer.)

1086
00:57:44,122 --> 00:57:45,251
You can do it, In Ah!

1087
00:57:46,151 --> 00:57:47,161
(At last)

1088
00:57:47,162 --> 00:57:48,162
You can do it, Uie.

1089
00:57:48,163 --> 00:57:49,392
- Uie, go for it. - Hang in there.

1090
00:57:51,031 --> 00:57:52,431
- Go ahead. - You can do it, In Ah.

1091
00:57:52,432 --> 00:57:55,431
(Uie gets ahead of In Ah.)

1092
00:57:55,432 --> 00:57:56,631
- You can do it, In Ah. - You can do it, Uie.

1093
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:58,130
- Uie, go for it. - Hang in there.

1094
00:57:58,131 --> 00:58:00,670
(Uie, In Ah)

1095
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:01,701
You can do it, In Ah.

1096
00:58:01,702 --> 00:58:05,042
(Uie, In Ah)

1097
00:58:06,071 --> 00:58:11,512
(Uie leads the way again.)

1098
00:58:11,781 --> 00:58:17,392
(The current location at 2 hours and 20 minutes)

1099
00:58:18,492 --> 00:58:19,550
This is insane.

1100
00:58:19,551 --> 00:58:22,961
(Seo Yeon is still cycling.)

1101
00:58:23,191 --> 00:58:25,492
I can do this!

1102
00:58:26,691 --> 00:58:28,401
Of course, I can!

1103
00:58:29,861 --> 00:58:32,170
(Only 9 minutes left)

1104
00:58:32,171 --> 00:58:35,000
(She has 5km to go.)

1105
00:58:35,001 --> 00:58:36,001
Passing!

1106
00:58:38,711 --> 00:58:41,280
(If she's cut off, she can't enter the running event.)

1107
00:58:41,281 --> 00:58:43,380
Passing!

1108
00:58:43,381 --> 00:58:45,281
(She needs to go faster before she gets cut off.)

1109
00:58:46,281 --> 00:58:50,751
(However, the last uphill section is waiting.)

1110
00:58:51,622 --> 00:58:55,221
(Due to being in the steep uphill section.)

1111
00:58:55,222 --> 00:58:59,792
(she cannot help but slow down.)

1112
00:59:00,131 --> 00:59:01,162
You...

1113
00:59:01,401 --> 00:59:02,401
(Panting)

1114
00:59:02,402 --> 00:59:03,731
You're over, cycling.

1115
00:59:05,131 --> 00:59:07,301
You know, I'm almost there.

1116
00:59:09,272 --> 00:59:10,272
(Shouting)

1117
00:59:10,273 --> 00:59:11,611
(She doesn't have much time.)

1118
00:59:12,642 --> 00:59:15,742
(Her secret weapon, dancing)

1119
00:59:16,341 --> 00:59:19,881
(I can't stop!)

1120
00:59:20,522 --> 00:59:22,582
(The time is running even at this moment.)

1121
00:59:28,821 --> 00:59:31,932
(Remaining time: 4 minutes and 28 seconds)

1122
00:59:32,062 --> 00:59:33,361
(Breathing heavily)

1123
00:59:34,102 --> 00:59:36,501
Park the bike, take off the helmet,

1124
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:38,230
and put on the shoes.

1125
00:59:38,231 --> 00:59:40,642
(Seo Yeon thinks of the transition area rules.)

1126
00:59:41,501 --> 00:59:44,742
(Remaining time: 2 minutes and 11 seconds)

1127
00:59:45,211 --> 00:59:46,940
(1km left)

1128
00:59:46,941 --> 00:59:48,012
You're doing great.

1129
00:59:52,012 --> 00:59:53,111
It's three minutes before.

1130
00:59:54,082 --> 00:59:55,381
You're doing great!

1131
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:57,292
You can do it.

1132
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:03,961
(Only 1 minute before the cutoff)

1133
01:00:04,531 --> 01:00:06,561
(The dismount line appears.)

1134
01:00:06,562 --> 01:00:07,762
You can do it.

1135
01:00:08,631 --> 01:00:10,300
(Can she finish the course in 2 hours and 30 minutes?)

1136
01:00:10,301 --> 01:00:12,831
Stop here.

1137
01:00:12,832 --> 01:00:14,571
(Can she finish the course in 2 hours and 30 minutes?)

1138
01:00:15,171 --> 01:00:17,311
(The record is recognized only when the participant steps on the line.)

1139
01:00:17,312 --> 01:00:19,872
Okay. Enter You need to enter!

1140
01:00:20,812 --> 01:00:22,582
(What's Seo Yeon's record?)

1141
01:00:25,082 --> 01:00:27,281
(Seo Yeon's 40km cycling record: 2 hours 29 minutes 20 seconds)

1142
01:00:27,952 --> 01:00:29,881
- You can do it, Jin Seo Yeon! - You can do it.

1143
01:00:30,051 --> 01:00:31,352
- You can do it, Jin Seo Yeon! - You can do it.

1144
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,762
(Without a moment to relax,)

1145
01:00:35,361 --> 01:00:38,832
(she heads to the last event, running!)

1146
01:00:39,691 --> 01:00:42,062
(Now the time left for Seo Yeon)

1147
01:00:42,262 --> 01:00:43,400
Let's go!

1148
01:00:43,401 --> 01:00:44,972
Park the bike and take off your helmet.

1149
01:00:46,332 --> 01:00:47,371
All right. Let's go.

1150
01:00:47,372 --> 01:00:48,941
You can do it.

1151
01:00:49,202 --> 01:00:53,211
(Seo Yeon quickly gets ready to run.)

1152
01:00:53,542 --> 01:00:54,780
Let's go.

1153
01:00:54,781 --> 01:00:56,110
(Time spent at the transition area: 2 minutes and 37 seconds)

1154
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:57,312
Go.

1155
01:00:58,211 --> 01:00:59,951
- You can do it! - Go for it, Seo Yeon!

1156
01:00:59,952 --> 01:01:01,721
(Seo Yeon runs towards the true ending.)

1157
01:01:01,722 --> 01:01:03,721
Let's go quickly.

1158
01:01:03,722 --> 01:01:04,920
You can do it.

1159
01:01:04,921 --> 01:01:07,050
- You can do it. - You can do it.

1160
01:01:07,051 --> 01:01:09,690
You can do it, Seo Yeon!

1161
01:01:09,691 --> 01:01:12,031
(Seo Yeon starts running.)

1162
01:01:15,501 --> 01:01:17,671
(The cutoff time is 3 hours and 30 minutes.)

1163
01:01:18,872 --> 01:01:19,872
You can do it.

1164
01:01:19,873 --> 01:01:21,170
(She needs to run 10km in 58 minutes.)

1165
01:01:21,171 --> 01:01:22,741
- You can do it. - You can do it.

1166
01:01:22,742 --> 01:01:26,142
(Now she needs to finish the race.)

1167
01:01:28,242 --> 01:01:29,880
- My breathing is stabilized. - Okay.

1168
01:01:29,881 --> 01:01:32,011
(My breathing is stabilized.)

1169
01:01:32,012 --> 01:01:33,311
(After getting her breathing stabilized soon,)

1170
01:01:33,312 --> 01:01:35,021
I can do it.

1171
01:01:35,022 --> 01:01:37,391
(she speeds up.)

1172
01:01:37,392 --> 01:01:38,392
(Seo Yeon)

1173
01:01:38,393 --> 01:01:40,722
(Seo Yeon's current pace: 5 minutes and 40 seconds)

1174
01:01:40,921 --> 01:01:42,860
(She needs to keep this pace to finish the race.)

1175
01:01:42,861 --> 01:01:43,892
I need to get her.

1176
01:01:44,832 --> 01:01:46,460
(Suddenly, her desire to win gets strong.)

1177
01:01:46,461 --> 01:01:50,872
When cycling, there was a woman participant I wanted to pass.

1178
01:01:51,301 --> 01:01:53,702
She was right in front of me when running too.

1179
01:01:54,501 --> 01:01:56,941
She had a bobbed hair, half of which was blond.

1180
01:01:58,071 --> 01:01:59,711
I decided not to lose her.

1181
01:01:59,812 --> 01:02:01,311
(After selecting a rival)

1182
01:02:01,312 --> 01:02:03,710
I kept following her looking at her back.

1183
01:02:03,711 --> 01:02:04,711
(Seo Yeon follows her close and speeds up.)

1184
01:02:04,712 --> 01:02:05,951
(Seo Yeon's current pace: 5 minutes and 33 seconds)

1185
01:02:05,952 --> 01:02:07,012
You're doing good.

1186
01:02:07,981 --> 01:02:10,022
(While Seo Yeon started running,)

1187
01:02:10,481 --> 01:02:13,321
(the members are getting close to the halfway point.)

1188
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:18,191
(Uie in the leading group)

1189
01:02:19,392 --> 01:02:23,301
(Her current pace: 4 minutes and 43 seconds)

1190
01:02:23,631 --> 01:02:26,702
(She maintains an amazing pace even after 2 hours and 30 minutes.)

1191
01:02:28,341 --> 01:02:30,571
(As she runs steadily)

1192
01:02:33,272 --> 01:02:36,182
(The 5.5km halfway front)

1193
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:42,881
(Uie passes the halfway point first among Iron Girls.)

1194
01:02:43,182 --> 01:02:44,921
(Running halfway point)

1195
01:02:46,992 --> 01:02:49,921
(Uie reaches the 5.5km point at 27 minutes.)

1196
01:02:51,231 --> 01:02:53,730
(In front of Uie who is running in the lead,)

1197
01:02:53,731 --> 01:02:55,300
(someone appears.)

1198
01:02:55,301 --> 01:02:56,332
Let's go!

1199
01:02:56,562 --> 01:02:57,670
Let's go!

1200
01:02:57,671 --> 01:02:58,831
(Glad to see each other)

1201
01:02:58,832 --> 01:03:00,771
(The 5.5km halfway point)

1202
01:03:00,772 --> 01:03:03,571
(Uie returns from the halfway point and meets In Ah!)

1203
01:03:03,642 --> 01:03:05,471
(Uie)

1204
01:03:05,472 --> 01:03:08,242
(While Uie is increasing her lead in front,)

1205
01:03:09,682 --> 01:03:13,412
(In Ah is working hard to chase her.)

1206
01:03:14,281 --> 01:03:16,622
(In Ah reaches the 5.5km point at 35 minutes.)

1207
01:03:20,762 --> 01:03:22,521
(There are 46 minutes and 3 seconds left.)

1208
01:03:22,522 --> 01:03:23,621
Let's go!

1209
01:03:23,622 --> 01:03:27,562
(In front of In Ah, who is working hard to run...)

1210
01:03:28,461 --> 01:03:30,300
- Let's go! - In Ah.

1211
01:03:30,301 --> 01:03:31,931
- Until the end and no getting hurt. - Let's go!

1212
01:03:31,932 --> 01:03:32,971
Let's go!

1213
01:03:32,972 --> 01:03:36,972
(In Ah and Ju Hyun cross each other too.)

1214
01:03:37,512 --> 01:03:40,412
(It's great to see each other when they are exhausted.)

1215
01:03:41,611 --> 01:03:42,911
Let's go!

1216
01:03:42,912 --> 01:03:45,851
(But actually...)

1217
01:03:45,852 --> 01:03:48,181
(5.5km halfway point)

1218
01:03:48,182 --> 01:03:51,421
(In Ah started running 5 minutes and 55 seconds earlier.)

1219
01:03:53,022 --> 01:03:54,992
(The distance between them has been shortened by a lot.)

1220
01:03:55,591 --> 01:03:56,690
(Average pace until the halfway point)

1221
01:03:56,691 --> 01:03:57,791
(In Ah: 6 minutes and 20 seconds)

1222
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:00,702
(Ju Hyun: 5 minutes and 37 seconds)

1223
01:04:02,162 --> 01:04:05,972
(They have around a 1-minute pace difference.)

1224
01:04:07,171 --> 01:04:08,601
- Nice job. - Let's go!

1225
01:04:08,602 --> 01:04:10,671
Nice job.

1226
01:04:12,272 --> 01:04:13,440
- Nice job. - Let's go!

1227
01:04:13,441 --> 01:04:15,512
- Nice job. - Come until the end.

1228
01:04:16,281 --> 01:04:20,211
(Ju Hyun is worried about In Ah who struggles with running.)

1229
01:04:21,182 --> 01:04:24,251
(With her warm support,)

1230
01:04:27,191 --> 01:04:29,291
(the emotions she has been holding back burst out.)

1231
01:04:29,292 --> 01:04:30,792
I had a bit of fear.

1232
01:04:31,591 --> 01:04:33,431
What if I fail to catch up with my running?

1233
01:04:33,432 --> 01:04:35,061
(She always struggled with running.)

1234
01:04:35,062 --> 01:04:36,530
What if I get cut off?

1235
01:04:36,531 --> 01:04:39,171
(She is afraid of not being able to finish the race.)

1236
01:04:39,702 --> 01:04:41,301
My knees are about to go.

1237
01:04:43,102 --> 01:04:44,772
I don't think I should say they are hurting.

1238
01:04:46,312 --> 01:04:47,911
(She failed to finish the mock triathlon due to her injury.)

1239
01:04:47,912 --> 01:04:48,981
I'll do it.

1240
01:04:54,722 --> 01:04:56,181
(That is why In Ah feels even more anxious.)

1241
01:04:56,182 --> 01:04:57,352
It's at 152.

1242
01:05:03,392 --> 01:05:05,761
We're almost there.

1243
01:05:05,762 --> 01:05:11,801
(The condition of her body is getting worse.)

1244
01:05:13,131 --> 01:05:17,642
(Will she able to complete the course this time?)

1245
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:20,670
(Ju Hyun is now ahead.)

1246
01:05:20,671 --> 01:05:23,142
You've trained for four months.

1247
01:05:24,582 --> 01:05:26,281
The training you went through...

1248
01:05:26,651 --> 01:05:27,781
was intense.

1249
01:05:28,481 --> 01:05:30,751
But I can see your efforts coming through.

1250
01:05:32,292 --> 01:05:34,121
You have a great record right now as well.

1251
01:05:34,122 --> 01:05:36,662
(Even her record is good right now.)

1252
01:05:37,262 --> 01:05:39,292
(Based on Captain Kim's record who is running with her)

1253
01:05:42,301 --> 01:05:45,570
(She had the pace of 7 minutes and 16 seconds 4 months ago.)

1254
01:05:45,571 --> 01:05:49,872
(Her current pace is 5 minutes and 15 seconds.)

1255
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:52,471
You're amazing. You worked so hard.

1256
01:05:52,472 --> 01:05:54,210
(Captain Kim is impressed by Ju Hyun's efforts.)

1257
01:05:54,211 --> 01:05:56,411
(Meanwhile, Seo Yeon...)

1258
01:05:56,412 --> 01:05:58,281
I can do it.

1259
01:05:59,111 --> 01:06:00,111
(She is keeping her pace by brainwashing herself.)

1260
01:06:00,112 --> 01:06:02,421
I can do it.

1261
01:06:03,622 --> 01:06:05,491
(Remaining time: 39 minutes)

1262
01:06:05,492 --> 01:06:07,722
(Remaining distance: 6.5km)

1263
01:06:08,861 --> 01:06:12,631
(She can't feel relieved even with a pace of 5 minutes and 30 seconds.)

1264
01:06:13,031 --> 01:06:15,801
(She needs a bit of momentum.)

1265
01:06:16,162 --> 01:06:18,571
- Let's go, guys! - Let's go, Jin Seo Yeon!

1266
01:06:18,972 --> 01:06:20,030
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1267
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:22,872
(A familiar voice of support can be heard around her.)

1268
01:06:23,102 --> 01:06:25,142
- Let's go, Jin Seo Yeon! - Let's go!

1269
01:06:25,912 --> 01:06:27,541
- She got here quickly. - Right.

1270
01:06:28,081 --> 01:06:29,081
She got here quickly.

1271
01:06:29,082 --> 01:06:31,580
(High-five of excitement)

1272
01:06:31,581 --> 01:06:33,512
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1273
01:06:33,612 --> 01:06:36,222
- Let's go, Jin Seo Yeon! - Let's go!

1274
01:06:36,751 --> 01:06:39,251
(Seo Yeon's confidence is boosted thanks to the members' support.)

1275
01:06:39,392 --> 01:06:42,192
(She gains momentum.)

1276
01:06:43,022 --> 01:06:45,261
(She even outruns one participant.)

1277
01:06:45,262 --> 01:06:47,801
(Her breathing and rhythm look a lot more stable.)

1278
01:06:48,301 --> 01:06:50,801
(Her current pace: 5 minutes and 29 seconds)

1279
01:06:51,501 --> 01:06:54,301
(Around 1km left to the halfway point)

1280
01:06:56,102 --> 01:06:57,102
(Gasping)

1281
01:06:57,241 --> 01:06:59,241
(Gasping)

1282
01:07:00,272 --> 01:07:02,210
(Is she suddenly struggling with her breathing?)

1283
01:07:02,211 --> 01:07:05,682
Around 1km before the halfway point,

1284
01:07:06,711 --> 01:07:09,421
I felt like I was out of stamina.

1285
01:07:09,822 --> 01:07:12,651
I didn't look far ahead and tried to look at...

1286
01:07:12,652 --> 01:07:14,091
the person in front of me.

1287
01:07:15,762 --> 01:07:18,991
I didn't think I could make it if I looked far ahead.

1288
01:07:20,091 --> 01:07:23,001
But I accidentally looked far ahead once.

1289
01:07:24,932 --> 01:07:27,841
(She gets flustered by the endless path.)

1290
01:07:28,671 --> 01:07:29,700
(Her previous pace: 5 minutes and 29 seconds)

1291
01:07:29,701 --> 01:07:31,442
(Her current pace: 6 minutes and 35 seconds)

1292
01:07:32,972 --> 01:07:35,381
(Her pace has dropped down by a lot.)

1293
01:07:36,142 --> 01:07:37,311
(If she carries on with this pace until the end,)

1294
01:07:37,312 --> 01:07:39,652
(she will not be able to make it in time.)

1295
01:07:40,482 --> 01:07:42,580
"You've trained for this for four months."

1296
01:07:42,581 --> 01:07:44,081
"You can't even do a 5km run?"

1297
01:07:45,291 --> 01:07:46,951
"Let's reach the halfway point."

1298
01:07:47,722 --> 01:07:50,091
"Let's get there first."

1299
01:07:50,262 --> 01:07:53,362
(Seo Yeon has reached her limit. Will she be able to make it?)

1300
01:07:53,791 --> 01:07:56,402
(As Seo Yeon is about to reach the halfway point,)

1301
01:07:56,631 --> 01:07:59,201
(Uie is...)

1302
01:07:59,272 --> 01:08:00,300
(Uie)

1303
01:08:00,301 --> 01:08:01,401
Let's go!

1304
01:08:01,402 --> 01:08:04,911
(She has 1.5km left until the end.)

1305
01:08:05,411 --> 01:08:07,442
This is the final part.

1306
01:08:09,682 --> 01:08:14,152
(The competition went on for almost 3 hours.)

1307
01:08:14,782 --> 01:08:19,251
(She's almost out of breath.)

1308
01:08:19,751 --> 01:08:20,751
Let's go.

1309
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:27,961
(Uie brings up her pace even more.)

1310
01:08:30,972 --> 01:08:38,671
(She calmly outruns people one by one.)

1311
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:43,581
(She runs to the end of this long journey.)

1312
01:08:44,282 --> 01:08:46,652
- Let's go, Uie! - Let's go!

1313
01:08:47,012 --> 01:08:49,250
- You've got this! Let's go! - Let's go!

1314
01:08:49,251 --> 01:08:50,782
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1315
01:08:50,951 --> 01:08:53,191
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1316
01:08:53,192 --> 01:08:55,160
(The efforts she has made for the past 120 days...)

1317
01:08:55,161 --> 01:08:56,392
Let's go!

1318
01:08:56,961 --> 01:08:58,531
(will bear fruit with a few more steps.)

1319
01:08:58,532 --> 01:09:00,691
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1320
01:09:00,692 --> 01:09:02,362
Let's go!

1321
01:09:02,831 --> 01:09:03,960
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1322
01:09:03,961 --> 01:09:05,472
(She enters the blue carpet that represents the end.)

1323
01:09:06,932 --> 01:09:09,971
(She can hear people cheering...)

1324
01:09:09,972 --> 01:09:13,972
(and see the finish line.)

1325
01:09:15,482 --> 01:09:18,550
(During the last 4 months,)

1326
01:09:18,551 --> 01:09:22,222
(she imagined this moment hundreds of times.)

1327
01:09:31,791 --> 01:09:37,432
(Uie's triathlon record: 3 hours 2 minutes 46 seconds)

1328
01:09:44,072 --> 01:09:45,471
(She bursts into tears as she completes the race.)

1329
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:46,942
Great job!

1330
01:09:47,472 --> 01:09:50,312
Uie has completed the race!

1331
01:09:50,482 --> 01:09:53,951
Congratulations, Uie!

1332
01:09:54,352 --> 01:09:56,352
Let's all move forward.

1333
01:09:59,551 --> 01:10:03,121
(She dreamed of getting...)

1334
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:08,862
(the medal of completion.)

1335
01:10:12,801 --> 01:10:17,272
(With just the goal of completion,)

1336
01:10:19,741 --> 01:10:25,911
(she fought against herself endlessly.)

1337
01:10:28,522 --> 01:10:29,851
(People clap for Uie and her efforts.)

1338
01:10:29,852 --> 01:10:32,290
- Uie! - Great job!

1339
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:33,491
Great job!

1340
01:10:34,822 --> 01:10:36,090
(Uie)

1341
01:10:36,091 --> 01:10:40,161
(A perfect ending with a completion)

1342
01:10:42,131 --> 01:10:45,631
(She gave it her all, so she can't even stay standing.)

1343
01:10:51,972 --> 01:10:58,251
(She keeps getting emotional.)

1344
01:10:58,312 --> 01:10:59,451
Great job.

1345
01:11:00,482 --> 01:11:01,551
You were amazing.

1346
01:11:03,251 --> 01:11:05,121
Do you know what your record is?

1347
01:11:05,251 --> 01:11:06,550
You don't know, do you?

1348
01:11:06,551 --> 01:11:08,022
You got 3 hours and 2 minutes.

1349
01:11:09,121 --> 01:11:11,460
You made it 28 minutes earlier than the cutoff time.

1350
01:11:11,461 --> 01:11:12,631
(She came in 41 minutes faster than the mock triathlon.)

1351
01:11:13,562 --> 01:11:14,660
I don't know.

1352
01:11:14,661 --> 01:11:18,572
(While Uie has completed her race...)

1353
01:11:19,501 --> 01:11:20,602
Awesome.

1354
01:11:21,171 --> 01:11:22,340
We only have 1.5km left.

1355
01:11:22,341 --> 01:11:23,740
(Ju Hyun has 1.5km left.)

1356
01:11:23,741 --> 01:11:26,411
Gosh, I have a cramp on my right. It's killing me.

1357
01:11:27,982 --> 01:11:29,141
This is bad.

1358
01:11:29,142 --> 01:11:31,410
(She feels a sudden leg pain before the end of the course.)

1359
01:11:31,411 --> 01:11:32,411
What do I do?

1360
01:11:32,512 --> 01:11:34,852
Please. Hang in there for 1km. Just 1km.

1361
01:11:34,982 --> 01:11:36,051
What's wrong?

1362
01:11:36,352 --> 01:11:38,751
- Hold on. I think it's coming. - Move to the side.

1363
01:11:38,822 --> 01:11:39,921
Move to the side.

1364
01:11:40,751 --> 01:11:41,891
I'm getting a cramp.

1365
01:11:41,892 --> 01:11:45,391
(She tries to relieve her leg after stopping.)

1366
01:11:45,392 --> 01:11:48,562
- What do I do? Hold on. - It can get worse.

1367
01:11:49,732 --> 01:11:52,271
- Keep them straight. - I don't think it'll get better.

1368
01:11:52,272 --> 01:11:53,331
(The pain won't go away.)

1369
01:11:53,472 --> 01:11:54,602
What do I do?

1370
01:11:55,942 --> 01:11:57,671
I think I should carry on.

1371
01:11:58,911 --> 01:12:01,381
It can get worse if you stop.

1372
01:12:01,982 --> 01:12:04,380
- Let's carry on. - Gosh, no!

1373
01:12:04,381 --> 01:12:06,112
(I can't stop after coming all the way here!)

1374
01:12:08,182 --> 01:12:10,120
- No. - Hang in there just a bit more.

1375
01:12:10,121 --> 01:12:11,951
- I can do this. - You can do this.

1376
01:12:12,491 --> 01:12:13,522
Use your mental strength!

1377
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,862
(Ju Hyun)

1378
01:12:17,091 --> 01:12:18,130
We're almost there.

1379
01:12:18,131 --> 01:12:19,160
(The last 1km will be done only with mental strength.)

1380
01:12:19,161 --> 01:12:20,232
We're almost there.

1381
01:12:21,161 --> 01:12:23,301
All right. We're almost there.

1382
01:12:24,262 --> 01:12:26,532
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1383
01:12:26,831 --> 01:12:29,000
(She equips herself with a dogged spirit until the end.)

1384
01:12:29,001 --> 01:12:30,272
Let's go!

1385
01:12:31,241 --> 01:12:32,341
Great job!

1386
01:12:32,572 --> 01:12:33,941
Let's go!

1387
01:12:33,942 --> 01:12:35,340
(The finish line can finally be seen.)

1388
01:12:35,341 --> 01:12:37,041
You're almost there!

1389
01:12:39,512 --> 01:12:44,791
(I have come this far for this moment!)

1390
01:12:47,751 --> 01:12:52,631
(She makes her last spurt with all that she has left.)

1391
01:13:13,881 --> 01:13:17,381
(Ju Hyun's triathlon record: 3 hours 11 minutes 21 seconds)

1392
01:13:19,192 --> 01:13:21,361
You did it!

1393
01:13:21,362 --> 01:13:26,932
(Her legs give in as she did her best in the race.)

1394
01:13:28,701 --> 01:13:30,701
- Gosh. - You made it!

1395
01:13:31,972 --> 01:13:33,032
Your medal.

1396
01:13:33,171 --> 01:13:34,171
I'll give you your medal.

1397
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:36,371
Here. Your medal.

1398
01:13:37,041 --> 01:13:38,670
Congratulations!

1399
01:13:38,671 --> 01:13:39,840
(She finally has the medal that she really wanted around her neck.)

1400
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:41,741
- Congratulations! - Thank you.

1401
01:13:42,341 --> 01:13:45,182
Let's go. We did it!

1402
01:13:45,812 --> 01:13:47,051
- Congratulations. - We did it!

1403
01:13:47,682 --> 01:13:49,920
- Thank you. - Let's go!

1404
01:13:49,921 --> 01:13:52,852
- Thank you. - Great job.

1405
01:13:52,991 --> 01:13:55,920
- Where's Uie? - She's over there.

1406
01:13:55,921 --> 01:13:57,461
Ju Hyun!

1407
01:13:58,032 --> 01:14:00,231
Ju Hyun!

1408
01:14:00,232 --> 01:14:01,261
(She sees her precious fellow member who has run with her.)

1409
01:14:01,262 --> 01:14:02,300
Gosh, this feels emotional.

1410
01:14:02,301 --> 01:14:04,032
(She sees her precious fellow member who has run with her.)

1411
01:14:06,902 --> 01:14:10,741
(Tears of joy burst out.)

1412
01:14:15,482 --> 01:14:16,880
(At that moment)

1413
01:14:16,881 --> 01:14:17,910
Gosh.

1414
01:14:17,911 --> 01:14:20,081
(At that moment)

1415
01:14:22,352 --> 01:14:28,121
(In Ah is still suffering from her knee pain.)

1416
01:14:29,022 --> 01:14:31,862
(Each step is painful for her.)

1417
01:14:33,961 --> 01:14:35,130
I can't run downhill.

1418
01:14:35,131 --> 01:14:37,831
(She starts walking in the end.)

1419
01:14:38,732 --> 01:14:39,800
(It feels like her legs are tearing apart for her.)

1420
01:14:39,801 --> 01:14:40,870
- I feel like I'm losing my legs. - We're almost there.

1421
01:14:40,871 --> 01:14:43,341
(It feels like her legs are tearing apart for her.)

1422
01:14:45,312 --> 01:14:48,581
(Is she running again?)

1423
01:14:49,942 --> 01:14:51,911
(Giggling)

1424
01:14:52,482 --> 01:14:53,512
I imagined myself...

1425
01:14:54,751 --> 01:14:57,022
going past the finish line.

1426
01:14:58,522 --> 01:14:59,750
(At the thought of seeing herself completing the race,)

1427
01:14:59,751 --> 01:15:02,262
- Let's go! - You're almost there! Let's go!

1428
01:15:02,591 --> 01:15:04,861
(she endures the pain and carries on with her run.)

1429
01:15:04,862 --> 01:15:05,892
You're almost there!

1430
01:15:06,591 --> 01:15:09,601
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1431
01:15:09,602 --> 01:15:11,631
(The finish line she imagined of appears right in front of her.)

1432
01:15:12,631 --> 01:15:16,902
(Her legs suddenly feel lighter than ever.)

1433
01:15:17,871 --> 01:15:22,411
(The last moment makes her forget every sort of pain.)

1434
01:15:24,442 --> 01:15:25,451
Run!

1435
01:15:26,512 --> 01:15:27,512
Let's go!

1436
01:15:29,051 --> 01:15:31,120
It felt like I was pacing through the past four months.

1437
01:15:31,121 --> 01:15:33,421
(It felt like I was pacing through the past four months.)

1438
01:15:35,121 --> 01:15:39,631
(She paces through the last 4 months.)

1439
01:15:47,201 --> 01:15:48,240
You did it!

1440
01:15:48,241 --> 01:15:52,272
(In Ah's triathlon record: 3 hours 14 minutes 30 seconds)

1441
01:15:54,072 --> 01:15:55,942
- Well done! - Let's go!

1442
01:15:56,211 --> 01:15:58,380
(After receiving the medal, which she always imagined of...)

1443
01:15:58,381 --> 01:15:59,651
Congratulations!

1444
01:15:59,652 --> 01:16:00,751
(After receiving the medal, which she always imagined of,)

1445
01:16:03,881 --> 01:16:07,951
(she starts feeling the pain again.)

1446
01:16:09,222 --> 01:16:13,491
(Her legs suffered during the past 4 months.)

1447
01:16:13,831 --> 01:16:14,960
Great job!

1448
01:16:14,961 --> 01:16:20,472
(All of her efforts made this moment possible.)

1449
01:16:21,402 --> 01:16:22,641
(Finish line)

1450
01:16:22,642 --> 01:16:26,411
(Meanwhile, Seo Yeon is left alone.)

1451
01:16:31,852 --> 01:16:34,312
(There are only 12 minutes left.)

1452
01:16:35,282 --> 01:16:38,822
(There are around 2km left.)

1453
01:16:38,921 --> 01:16:39,921
That will be better.

1454
01:16:39,922 --> 01:16:41,991
(She doesn't have much time left until the cutoff time.)

1455
01:16:43,862 --> 01:16:46,932
(She must pick up her pace!)

1456
01:16:48,262 --> 01:16:49,301
Let's outrun them.

1457
01:16:50,902 --> 01:16:52,902
- One. - Great.

1458
01:16:53,432 --> 01:16:54,801
- Two. - Good.

1459
01:16:58,772 --> 01:16:59,772
Four.

1460
01:17:01,211 --> 01:17:03,981
(Fanatic Mentality returns from the underworld again.)

1461
01:17:03,982 --> 01:17:06,652
(Seo Yeon)

1462
01:17:07,682 --> 01:17:09,722
(There's no time for water.)

1463
01:17:10,051 --> 01:17:12,050
I'm almost there.

1464
01:17:12,051 --> 01:17:14,151
(Seo Yeon)

1465
01:17:14,152 --> 01:17:16,591
Please help me.

1466
01:17:16,961 --> 01:17:17,739
I'm almost there.

1467
01:17:20,432 --> 01:17:22,461
(There's only one ending with completion.)

1468
01:17:25,701 --> 01:17:26,771
What happened to Seo Yeon?

1469
01:17:26,772 --> 01:17:29,841
I met her quite late into the race.

1470
01:17:30,272 --> 01:17:32,170
- I met her toward the end. - Is it tight for her?

1471
01:17:32,171 --> 01:17:33,471
- It's tight for her. - Gosh!

1472
01:17:33,472 --> 01:17:34,812
(It's tight for her.)

1473
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,711
I'm almost there.

1474
01:17:41,852 --> 01:17:43,421
I must complete the race.

1475
01:17:44,081 --> 01:17:46,852
- Will Seo Yeon get cut off? - It's tight for her.

1476
01:17:47,822 --> 01:17:48,861
We'll see her from here.

1477
01:17:48,862 --> 01:17:49,862
(Everyone is waiting desperately for her.)

1478
01:17:51,161 --> 01:17:52,432
Seo Yeon is great at running.

1479
01:17:54,392 --> 01:17:56,630
Great. We're almost there.

1480
01:17:56,631 --> 01:17:57,631
(There are 3 minutes left.)

1481
01:18:02,642 --> 01:18:03,670
(What's left...)

1482
01:18:03,671 --> 01:18:08,681
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1483
01:18:08,682 --> 01:18:09,682
(is the sprint to the ending.)

1484
01:18:13,381 --> 01:18:16,421
It's Jin Seo Yeon.

1485
01:18:16,581 --> 01:18:18,591
She's coming in.

1486
01:18:24,862 --> 01:18:31,571
(Seo Yeon's triathlon record:)

1487
01:18:31,572 --> 01:18:35,972
(3 hours 27 minutes 58 seconds)

1488
01:18:37,241 --> 01:18:41,911
(She did it.)

1489
01:18:48,982 --> 01:18:50,420
(After taking the medal of completion that she dreamed of,)

1490
01:18:50,421 --> 01:18:51,451
Well done.

1491
01:18:53,991 --> 01:18:58,932
(the emotions that she kept inside start bursting out.)

1492
01:19:00,232 --> 01:19:05,301
(The past 120 days flash through her mind.)

1493
01:19:08,841 --> 01:19:11,170
(She completed the swimming course 1 minute and 53 seconds...)

1494
01:19:11,171 --> 01:19:13,472
(before the cutoff time.)

1495
01:19:14,112 --> 01:19:17,512
(She completed the cycling course 40 seconds before the cutoff time.)

1496
01:19:18,652 --> 01:19:21,482
(And she also completed the running course.)

1497
01:19:23,751 --> 01:19:27,450
(She completed the triathlon 2 minutes and 2 seconds...)

1498
01:19:27,451 --> 01:19:29,722
(before the cutoff time.)

1499
01:19:32,591 --> 01:19:34,761
- I didn't get cut off? - You didn't.

1500
01:19:34,762 --> 01:19:38,001
(Seo Yeon's triathlon journey must have been challenging.)

1501
01:19:38,572 --> 01:19:40,031
We started at 8am.

1502
01:19:40,032 --> 01:19:41,501
- I think she'll make it. - She's here!

1503
01:19:41,602 --> 01:19:43,240
She's here! Awesome!

1504
01:19:43,241 --> 01:19:45,772
(The members were with her during this journey.)

1505
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:49,380
Awesome! I can't believe this!

1506
01:19:49,381 --> 01:19:51,240
(Everyone desperately wished to complete the race together.)

1507
01:19:51,241 --> 01:19:52,250
This is just awesome.

1508
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:53,551
(Everyone desperately wished to complete the race together.)

1509
01:19:58,352 --> 01:20:01,522
I remembered the times we spent together.

1510
01:20:02,921 --> 01:20:05,391
All four of us came in and I felt so moved.

1511
01:20:05,392 --> 01:20:08,501
(The most reliable eldest completes the race.)

1512
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:11,101
- She completed the race! - We did it.

1513
01:20:11,102 --> 01:20:13,401
(All members of the Iron Girls have completed the race.)

1514
01:20:13,402 --> 01:20:15,700
- All of them completed the race. - All of them did it.

1515
01:20:15,701 --> 01:20:16,871
(All members of the Iron Girls have completed the race.)

1516
01:20:17,472 --> 01:20:20,171
- Gosh, this is insane! - It's amazing.

1517
01:20:20,272 --> 01:20:22,241
- Gosh! - It's amazing.

1518
01:20:22,581 --> 01:20:25,580
We all know how hard they worked for this.

1519
01:20:25,581 --> 01:20:27,751
Gosh, this is amazing!

1520
01:20:34,652 --> 01:20:35,892
Gosh!

1521
01:20:37,062 --> 01:20:40,490
(Tears keep falling.)

1522
01:20:40,491 --> 01:20:42,102
Great job.

1523
01:20:42,661 --> 01:20:44,131
My gosh.

1524
01:20:46,331 --> 01:20:47,831
Great job, Seo Yeon.

1525
01:20:49,041 --> 01:20:51,771
I was really surprised.

1526
01:20:51,772 --> 01:20:53,942
It was so close.

1527
01:20:54,627 --> 01:20:56,127
I didn't get cut off.

1528
01:20:57,741 --> 01:21:00,351
- This is insane. - You were amazing.

1529
01:21:00,352 --> 01:21:01,611
(An unbelievable completion of all members)

1530
01:21:01,612 --> 01:21:03,051
This is just amazing.

1531
01:21:06,692 --> 01:21:07,751
Gosh!

1532
01:21:09,291 --> 01:21:12,192
- Well done. - I'm about to shed tears too.

1533
01:21:12,762 --> 01:21:15,500
- I'm about to shed tears. - You went through so much.

1534
01:21:15,501 --> 01:21:16,501
You did a great job.

1535
01:21:16,502 --> 01:21:17,561
(Choking up)

1536
01:21:17,562 --> 01:21:19,000
I'm about to cry.

1537
01:21:19,001 --> 01:21:20,472
(Choking up)

1538
01:21:20,572 --> 01:21:21,602
Gosh.

1539
01:21:22,102 --> 01:21:24,942
It must've been so hard for you to make it in time at the end.

1540
01:21:25,171 --> 01:21:27,670
- Gosh! - I ran my socks off at the end.

1541
01:21:27,671 --> 01:21:29,041
- Great job. - Exactly.

1542
01:21:29,411 --> 01:21:31,682
- You came in toward the end. - Great job.

1543
01:21:31,951 --> 01:21:33,182
We thought that it would be hard for you to make it.

1544
01:21:33,381 --> 01:21:35,951
We were amazed by your running.

1545
01:21:36,182 --> 01:21:37,250
I told you she was going to make it.

1546
01:21:37,251 --> 01:21:40,221
I'm sorry. I doubted you slightly. I'm terribly sorry.

1547
01:21:40,222 --> 01:21:42,321
- I doubted myself too. - I really did.

1548
01:21:42,322 --> 01:21:45,262
(I doubted myself too.)

1549
01:21:45,477 --> 01:21:48,276
I had no confidence...

1550
01:21:48,432 --> 01:21:50,102
with swimming at all.

1551
01:21:50,902 --> 01:21:53,932
My swimming didn't improve no matter how hard I tried.

1552
01:21:54,272 --> 01:21:55,572
It was scary no matter how hard I tried.

1553
01:21:55,942 --> 01:21:57,001
I'm scared!

1554
01:21:57,642 --> 01:21:59,371
I couldn't find my breath no matter how hard I tried.

1555
01:22:00,711 --> 01:22:03,841
"How can I do this? This is impossible for me."

1556
01:22:05,251 --> 01:22:08,181
I was torn as I doubted myself.

1557
01:22:08,182 --> 01:22:10,581
(She fell into endless thoughts of self-distrust.)

1558
01:22:12,921 --> 01:22:14,522
To me,

1559
01:22:15,022 --> 01:22:16,762
cycling was a great source of fear.

1560
01:22:17,921 --> 01:22:19,762
I was scared whenever I was on my bike.

1561
01:22:20,661 --> 01:22:22,161
I fell whenever I was on my bike.

1562
01:22:22,932 --> 01:22:29,241
(She kept cycling with the fear of falling down.)

1563
01:22:29,442 --> 01:22:33,072
My body wouldn't adjust to it no matter how much I trained myself.

1564
01:22:33,572 --> 01:22:37,141
(The more she got on her bike,)

1565
01:22:37,142 --> 01:22:40,881
(the more scars she got.)

1566
01:22:41,381 --> 01:22:43,750
To be honest, I really hated cycling.

1567
01:22:43,751 --> 01:22:46,051
(I really hated cycling.)

1568
01:22:46,251 --> 01:22:48,152
I told you that you could do it.

1569
01:22:48,322 --> 01:22:49,761
Seriously.

1570
01:22:49,762 --> 01:22:51,261
(Uie was afraid of cycling more than anything.)

1571
01:22:51,262 --> 01:22:53,692
I started as the weakest member.

1572
01:22:53,892 --> 01:22:56,762
I guess I did feel a bit pressured about that.

1573
01:22:57,331 --> 01:22:58,331
Go until the end.

1574
01:22:58,332 --> 01:23:00,330
I wasn't outstanding in anything,

1575
01:23:00,331 --> 01:23:02,370
- and I wasn't good at anything. - What's this?

1576
01:23:02,371 --> 01:23:03,601
I didn't like things that required tenacity,

1577
01:23:03,602 --> 01:23:05,541
- and I wasn't tenacious. - Let's go.

1578
01:23:05,871 --> 01:23:08,711
(Ju Hyun suffered every day trying something new.)

1579
01:23:09,642 --> 01:23:11,341
I thought I would be cut off.

1580
01:23:12,182 --> 01:23:13,512
I got injured too many times.

1581
01:23:14,881 --> 01:23:16,651
(In Ah had a hard time due to frequent injuries...)

1582
01:23:16,652 --> 01:23:18,451
(starting from the early days of training.)

1583
01:23:20,791 --> 01:23:23,160
(As her training progress slowed down,)

1584
01:23:23,161 --> 01:23:26,490
(she became impatient.)

1585
01:23:26,491 --> 01:23:27,862
I don't think I can complete the race.

1586
01:23:28,161 --> 01:23:29,361
I'll definitely be cut off.

1587
01:23:29,362 --> 01:23:30,762
(They all fought against their hardships...)

1588
01:23:31,932 --> 01:23:33,871
(and felt their limits.)

1589
01:23:34,072 --> 01:23:36,472
I might not be able to make it until the end at this point.

1590
01:23:37,942 --> 01:23:39,071
What should I do?

1591
01:23:39,072 --> 01:23:40,512
(What should I do?)

1592
01:23:41,411 --> 01:23:42,541
What else can I do?

1593
01:23:43,642 --> 01:23:45,281
- We can do it. - We can do it.

1594
01:23:45,282 --> 01:23:47,011
- I must overcome it. - We can do it.

1595
01:23:47,012 --> 01:23:48,182
- We can do it. - Let's go.

1596
01:23:48,312 --> 01:23:50,381
I thought about just one thing.

1597
01:23:50,621 --> 01:23:52,291
"You must do it. You can do it."

1598
01:23:52,621 --> 01:23:53,891
I just told myself this.

1599
01:23:53,892 --> 01:23:55,620
You can do it.

1600
01:23:55,621 --> 01:23:59,031
(In the end, she mustered up the courage to overcome her fears.)

1601
01:23:59,032 --> 01:24:02,800
"Seo Yeon, all you can do is just continue swimming."

1602
01:24:02,801 --> 01:24:04,160
"Prepare more. Train more."

1603
01:24:04,161 --> 01:24:06,371
- I did it. - Okay.

1604
01:24:07,232 --> 01:24:10,340
(The passion to overcome her own limits)

1605
01:24:10,341 --> 01:24:13,540
As if I was conquering one after another.

1606
01:24:13,541 --> 01:24:15,581
(Tenacity that made her endure the training)

1607
01:24:16,341 --> 01:24:17,681
I trained madly.

1608
01:24:17,682 --> 01:24:18,782
- You can do it. - Go.

1609
01:24:20,881 --> 01:24:24,322
(She grew the confidence to believe in herself.)

1610
01:24:26,051 --> 01:24:27,721
Kim Uie, you can do it.
Take it slow.

1611
01:24:27,722 --> 01:24:31,290
None of the three other members gave up.

1612
01:24:31,291 --> 01:24:35,061
They all overcame themselves and progressed.

1613
01:24:35,062 --> 01:24:37,231
I think that process motivated each other,

1614
01:24:37,232 --> 01:24:39,370
- so I really liked it. - Let's go.

1615
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:42,141
(Dong Hyun and Min Ho always stayed close to them...)

1616
01:24:42,142 --> 01:24:44,871
(and gave them the courage.)

1617
01:24:45,211 --> 01:24:46,211
(And...)

1618
01:24:46,212 --> 01:24:49,941
Throughout the competition, so many people supported us.

1619
01:24:49,942 --> 01:24:52,811
That was the day I had the most people supporting me...

1620
01:24:52,812 --> 01:24:55,580
ever since I became an actress.

1621
01:24:55,581 --> 01:24:57,451
(They could complete the race thanks to their sincere supports.)

1622
01:24:57,881 --> 01:25:01,451
After the four months of the process and completing the race,

1623
01:25:01,591 --> 01:25:03,491
I totally got the courage.

1624
01:25:04,692 --> 01:25:07,491
The courage to make the impossible possible.

1625
01:25:07,961 --> 01:25:11,862
That became a huge asset to me.

1626
01:25:13,001 --> 01:25:15,642
The courage that only the person who have done it can get.

1627
01:25:17,041 --> 01:25:18,371
Four months ago,

1628
01:25:18,841 --> 01:25:21,572
I was a person who asked, "Can I do that?"

1629
01:25:21,772 --> 01:25:24,182
Today, I've become the person who says,
"I can do it."

1630
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:27,411
I think I changed that way.

1631
01:25:27,652 --> 01:25:30,551
It feels like a very emotional dream.

1632
01:25:31,652 --> 01:25:34,420
Triathlon is more about the process than the result.

1633
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:36,291
I've never lost during that process.

1634
01:25:37,461 --> 01:25:38,631
It feels like I've won it all.

1635
01:25:39,692 --> 01:25:43,102
I think I became stronger from the fight against myself.

1636
01:25:43,862 --> 01:25:45,671
I never liked myself.

1637
01:25:46,102 --> 01:25:47,431
I always beat myself up...

1638
01:25:47,432 --> 01:25:50,000
and stressed myself out easily.

1639
01:25:50,001 --> 01:25:51,841
"You really suck."

1640
01:25:52,241 --> 01:25:54,711
"That's as far as you can go."

1641
01:25:54,871 --> 01:25:57,612
But now that I became someone who did something until the end,

1642
01:25:58,142 --> 01:26:00,482
my self-esteem improved naturally.

1643
01:26:00,881 --> 01:26:03,652
I felt that I could change myself.

1644
01:26:04,182 --> 01:26:05,251
I mean it.

1645
01:26:05,392 --> 01:26:07,251
I like myself too nowadays.

1646
01:26:09,192 --> 01:26:17,031
(The time they spent to become Iron Girls)

1647
01:26:17,032 --> 01:26:19,272
(The 2,880 hours they spent to become Iron Girls)

1648
01:26:19,572 --> 01:26:23,540
(Their minds have become strong too.)

1649
01:26:23,541 --> 01:26:24,771
- I love you. - We can do it.

1650
01:26:24,772 --> 01:26:26,411
- We can totally do it. - We can do it.

1651
01:26:30,142 --> 01:26:32,811
- Iron! - Iron!

1652
01:26:32,812 --> 01:26:38,420
- Girls! - Girls!

1653
01:26:38,421 --> 01:26:41,392
(Iron Girls)

1654
01:26:42,062 --> 01:26:44,961
(We root for your race.)

1655
01:27:53,879 --> 01:27:55,000
(Our ending is completing the race.)

1656
01:27:55,025 --> 01:27:58,383
(Iron Girls)
