The Story of the Phoenix

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The Story of the Phoenix

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What should I do if you have the evidence?

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So I must follow you.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Princess Liu Yun, why are you awake?

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I said...

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hurry up!

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Where are you going?

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Li Yan, are you annoyed?

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
When are you going to fight me?

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You're so annoying.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You have to stay here for a day.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'll follow you.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If you don't follow me for a lifetime, I'll follow you for a lifetime.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You're a dead man.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You want to follow me for a lifetime?

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'll follow you if I can.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Just say it.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You can't do that.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This way!

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This way!

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You can't get down!

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You're the one who's going to win.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Li Chen Jin!

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Li Yan, you're so fast!

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The Fourth Lord of the City, Li Yan,

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
is leaving the country.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Miss, Miss, hurry up and fight!

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Li Chen Jin!

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You...

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Wait a minute.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You said Miss Chen is a little bit slow.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You're so slow.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You're so slow.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You said Miss Chen is slow.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You're so slow.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Li Yan,

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll give you a hand.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Give me a hand.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This way.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I have something more important to do.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You can help me find a place to stay.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Li Chen Jin!

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Let me go!

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Let me go!

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's too sweet.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The entire report of the stay is in the room.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Dandan!

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I saw you.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
How dare you not to come in?

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This colleague,

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I've never seen you before.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And,

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
what's on your hat?

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm the Chief Special Officer,

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
the Chief Special Officer of the International Specialist Service.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I've never heard of this kind of official position.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm the Chief Special Officer,

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
the secret envoy.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm a person of the danger.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If you dare to speak out,

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'll kill you.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I won't.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Well,

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
the Chief Special Officer of the International Specialist Service

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
is a bit strange.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The Chief Special Officer sent me

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
to get his entire report and order.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So that I can

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
get rid of him.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Go get it for me.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What?

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You're the secret envoy of the Imperial Guards.

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You need the Chief's guard.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You don't know the rules.

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Who are you?

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I...

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I told you.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm the secret envoy.

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Of course, you can't reveal it.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm not a fan of you.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Since you're the Chief Special Officer,

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
tell me about the spices used by the Chief.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
How many?

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Roast?

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Gansong, Suhe, Anxi, Yujin,

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Dingxiang, Chenxiang, Tanxiang, Sheshuang, Wuchenxiang,

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Baizhi, Duhuo, Huoxiang,

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Gao Liangjiang, Huixiang, Mo Xiang,

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Wuding Xiang, Ba Huang, Lu Xiang,

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Jinmen Xiang, Meigui Bao, Bin Tian, Long Xian.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Besides,

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
there are 13 kinds of the same.

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
12 kinds of the same.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The other spices are

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
6 types, 11 kinds.

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
This officer,

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
what else do you have?

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm the Wu Tie Head of the Imperial Guards.

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You're a master of the world.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Then why don't you go and get it?

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Where are the 6?

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
No.

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Today, the Chief is in a bad mood.

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Please go and get some spices.

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're right.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This is the Chief Special Officer's top spice.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
My technique is just a trick in front of him.

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The spices he got are really amazing.

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Okay.

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You, follow me.

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Duhuo.

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I have something important to do today.

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm afraid...

118
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What is more important than

119
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
the Chief's health?

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Say it again.

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Take it out right now.

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You'll be beaten to death.

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The Chief, the doctor is here.

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'll treat you.

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You may leave.

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Good luck, Princess Chang'e.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What do you think of this pulse?

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I have it.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Look at the Chief.

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
He's a noble and long-living man.

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And you must be

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
the Chief Special Officer in the City.

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You're the most handsome and handsome man

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
in the whole city.

135
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Cuihua.

136
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You...

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You know the chief?

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I do.

139
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Who are you?

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Why don't you dare to interview me?

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm...

142
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The Chief Special Officer is ugly.

143
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be shocked.

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Please forgive me, Chief.

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You're so kind.

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You're so heartless

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
to make me happy.

148
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll make a perfect match

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
with the Chief Special Officer.

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'll repay you.

151
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You...

152
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You...

153
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You...

154
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You...

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You...

156
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You...

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You...

158
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You...

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You're the Chief Special Officer in the City.

160
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Chief Special Officer.

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll make a perfect match

162
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
with the Chief Special Officer.

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll make a perfect match

164
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
with the Chief Special Officer.

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It smells so good.

166
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It smells so good.

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Of course.

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm the Chief Special Officer

169
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
in the City.

170
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'll repay you.

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Hurry and smell it.

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yes.

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Lin Qianqin?

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I knew it was you.

175
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You're the Chief Special Officer in the City.

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're the Chief Special Officer in the City.

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What's the use of you?

178
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I just wanted to go to the hospital

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and see the report of Liu Yun.

180
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Who knows if he'll be brought to the City?

181
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This is the case.

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's very important.

183
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Liu Yun's drug list?

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes.

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I have it.

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You have it?

187
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I got it from the police station.

188
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I can't give you this drug list.

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You're the biggest suspect now.

190
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Li Yan.

191
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
If you really want to break the case,

192
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
please let me put it down first.

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
At least, from a legal point of view,

194
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
we're the same.

195
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I can give you the drug list.

196
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But you have to make sure

197
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
that all your actions

198
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
must be done under my supervision.

199
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Okay.

200
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I promise.

201
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Pull it.

202
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Come on.

203
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Pull it up and keep it for 100 years.

204
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Don't waste it.

205
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Hurry up.

206
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So, the ancient doctor

207
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
doesn't have a set of

208
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
his own blood type.

209
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's written on it

210
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
the symptoms of Liu Yun's poisoning.

211
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And...

212
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Wait.

213
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Why is my name on it?

214
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You don't need to know.

215
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
This is a poison antidote.

216
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It has nothing to do with you.

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I know.

218
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm just kidding.

219
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm just kidding.

220
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Keep going.

221
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The poison that Liu Yun's princess poisoned

222
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
was made by Ye Haitang.

223
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But this drug is rare.

224
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The pharmacy is not available.

225
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Only the lady in the south

226
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
can buy the medicine

227
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
that is available in the 18-centimeter shop.

228
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
18-centimeter shop?

229
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Let's go to the 18-centimeter shop

230
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
to find out who bought Ye Haitang.

231
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Let's find out who poisoned him.

232
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The Dragon Temple?

233
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's weird.

234
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The 18-centimeter shop

235
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
is located here.

236
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You are still the private officer of Hu Chengsi.

237
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Why are you so uneducated?

238
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Do you know how to read the map?

239
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This...

240
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
This...

241
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
This map

242
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
is not my own.

243
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Then it should be updated.

244
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Update?

245
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I mean, it's too old.

246
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Forget it.

247
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's white today.

248
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Let's go.

249
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Don't go.

250
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Since the map is here,

251
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
the Dragon Temple must be hidden.

252
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Let's go and see.

253
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What?

254
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Why is he always in a rush today?

255
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Is he sick?

256
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Let's go.

257
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Isn't it a incense place?

258
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's here.

259
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Let's worship it.

260
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's good to pray for the Divine Spirit to bless us.

261
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Let's pray for the morning sun.

262
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
We must worship it later.

263
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Let's catch the evil woman

264
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
who poisoned Lin Qianji.

265
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Right.

266
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Let's take Lin Cheng as a good girl.

267
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Right.

268
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
He didn't get caught.

269
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Didn't he say

270
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
he is not the murderer of the Princess Liuying?

271
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You don't know

272
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
how evil Lin Qianji is.

273
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
He doesn't care who poisoned him.

274
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I heard that

275
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
he was the one who

276
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
poisoned the Princess Liuying.

277
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
He was the one who

278
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
owed the money to the Princess Liuying.

279
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So,

280
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
the Princess Liuying

281
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
didn't do it.

282
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Who would believe it?

283
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
How did you hear these nonsense?

284
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Have you seen those corpses?

285
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I did poison Lin Qianji before.

286
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But it doesn't mean

287
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
he did all the evil things alone.

288
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Who are you to protect him?

289
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I advise you.

290
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
In this man's world,

291
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
if you don't hate Lin Qianji,

292
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
you are the enemy of all of us.

293
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Right.

294
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You should catch him.

295
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Catch him.

296
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Are you like them?

297
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I hope you can get rid of me soon.

298
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Because the evil poison

299
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
has been in my bones.

300
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I only care about the truth.
