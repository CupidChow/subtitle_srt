00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Story of Jin Jin

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,000
Jin Jin.

4
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,300
Li Yan.

5
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,500
Why are you here?

6
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,700
I'm here to see how your wound is.

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,500
I brought you some medicine.

8
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,300
You're playing the role of a mother?

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,700
Isn't this a medical pill?

10
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,800
What kind of medicine is this?

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,300
I only take medicine for the medicine that I make for Jin Jin every day.

12
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,300
What is this?

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,400
It's nothing.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,000
I can use this too.

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,100
Thank you.

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,200
You're welcome.

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,300
You're dressed like this.

18
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,000
Where are you going?

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,600
We're going to the Fairy Valley to give the fragrance to Liu Yun Zhi.

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,400
That's right.

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,000
The flowers of the Fairy Valley are much better.

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,600
We're going to the Fairy Valley together.

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,200
We're going to make the fragrance of the flowers.

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:17,500
Let's go.

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,600
I'll go with you.

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,200
I want you to be with us.

27
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,000
But you're allergic to pollen.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,800
That's right.

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,700
Li Si Jun.

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,000
Wait for us in the mansion.

31
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,500
Don't forget.

32
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,100
I have the fragrance that you made for me.

33
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,700
You're right.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,900
Let's go together.

35
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:36,800
Let's go.

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,100
Jin Jin.

37
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,100
When did you make the fragrance for her?

38
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,100
Why didn't I?

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,600
People have too much pollen.

40
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,900
It's for treatment.

41
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,600
You don't need it.

42
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,100
I'm not done.

43
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,600
I want it too.

44
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay.

45
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,900
When I'm free,

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,900
I'll make you the fragrance you want.

47
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,100
Let's go.

48
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,600
Okay.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,500
Let's go.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,500
It's so beautiful here.

51
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,800
Of course.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,300
As long as you like it,

53
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,800
I'll definitely satisfy you.

54
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,700
Thank you, Wen Wen.

55
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,200
Why are you thanking me?

56
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,400
Wen Wen.

57
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,100
Wen Wen.

58
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,220
I'll get you some?- Okay.

59
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,940
with a strong and strong taste.

60
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,580
He's the best for you.

61
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,980
I didn't expect Mr. Lu

62
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,420
to be so good at scented.

63
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,460
Of course.

64
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,940
Don't you know

65
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,140
that the thing Jingjing loves the most

66
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,340
is scented?

67
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,940
It seems you don't know Jingjing at all.

68
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,860
He didn't tell me that

69
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,180
because he knew

70
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,180
I had a allergic reaction.

71
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,060
Look.

72
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,260
I took a lot of flowers

73
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,460
and made a flower ring.

74
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,780
I'll try it on.

75
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,340
I think

76
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,060
this is suitable for Mr. Lu.

77
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,100
You can keep it yourself.

78
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,300
Jingjing, look at this.

79
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,220
What flower is this?

80
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,380
It's so special.

81
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,700
I don't know what it is.

82
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,060
Then

83
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,380
I'll give it a name.

84
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,420
It's called

85
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,420
Little Yellow Flower in the Story.

86
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,820
I'll also use it.

87
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,780
Help me pick it up.

88
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,180
No problem.

89
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,380
Jingjing.

90
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,940
Let's take a break.

91
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,820
Have some tea.

92
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,500
Okay.

93
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,540
Sorry, Mr. Li.

94
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,540
I only brought

95
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,140
two cups of tea for Jingjing.

96
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,340
It's okay.

97
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,940
We'll use one.

98
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,460
Jingjing.

99
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,860
You made him a fragrance bag again.

100
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,660
Now you're using the same cup as him.

101
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,980
What about me?

102
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,900
You...

103
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,660
I'll pour you some tea.

104
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,180
Here.

105
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:39,940
Here.

106
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,340
Here.

107
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,340
The City Leader has ordered

108
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,700
to order Lingqianjin to immediately enter the mansion

109
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,980
and adjust the antidote

110
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,380
for Princess Liuying.

111
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,540
Didn't you say that

112
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,700
the City Leader's mansion

113
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,380
will be ready in three days?

114
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,660
Why did you mention it earlier?

115
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,780
The City Leader knows that I'm the one who's in charge.

116
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,100
He's been urging me.

117
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,500
I have to leave today.

118
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,620
Can't you tell the City Leader

119
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,860
to postpone it for a day?

120
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,060
Of course.

121
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,300
Since you've promised the City Leader,

122
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,380
you have to do it.

123
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,180
Besides,

124
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,740
I'll be there in seven days.

125
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,260
If Liuying doesn't wake up,

126
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,900
I can't take the blame.

127
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,660
Then you take the medicine and leave.

128
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,180
No.

129
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:26,940
I can't make it.

130
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,700
I'll leave now.

131
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,380
Jingjing.

132
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,820
I can't rest assured.

133
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,780
How about I go with you?

134
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,540
No need.

135
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,540
Li Yan is in the car.

136
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,740
And Ling'er is with me.

137
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,460
Don't worry.

138
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,260
I'm leaving.

139
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,380
Okay.

140
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,700
I'll wait for you in the mansion.

141
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:38,980
Okay.

142
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,860
Go back early.

143
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,700
I see.

144
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,420
Go.

145
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,260
I'm not leaving.

146
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,580
Miss.

147
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,780
Why are you in the wrong direction again?

148
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,900
Miss.

149
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,340
Stop the car.

150
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,700
Mr. Du, you're not in the right direction.

151
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,580
Ling'er.

152
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,460
Why are you back?

153
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,620
Miss, you're in the wrong direction again.

154
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,460
You're in the wrong direction again.

155
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,540
No.

156
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,060
Jingjing, are you okay?

157
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,620
I know something will happen today.

158
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,540
Drink the medicine, Jingjing.

159
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,900
It seems that you're a very strict person.

160
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,740
Mr. Lu.

161
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,260
Where's Jingjing?

162
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,460
Where did you put her?

163
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,700
I thought that she's stronger than you started at stage breaks.

164
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,980
I'll reach out to you.

165
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:03,980
Uncle,

166
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,220
to find Princess Liu Yun's illness?

167
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,100
Although Princess Liu Yun was poisoned,

168
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,860
she didn't die.

169
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,660
I've come up with

170
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,220
a way

171
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,740
to use some incense

172
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,060
to open her eyes.

173
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,580
As for whether she can wake up,

174
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,100
we'll have to see if she's pregnant.

175
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,700
We'll do it all.

176
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,500
All right.

177
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,460
You two,

178
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,980
send this incense

179
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,500
to Princess Liu Yun right away.

180
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,820
Take it slow.

181
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,660
Take it slow.

182
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,660
Lin Qian Jin,

183
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,100
I didn't expect...

184
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,260
Your Highness,

185
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,020
I have a key report.

186
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,340
Jin Jin.

187
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:49,860
Wen Wen,

188
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,140
why are you here?

189
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:51,820
Are you all right?

190
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,420
Your Highness.

191
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:52,980
I'm fine.

192
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,260
Princess Liu Yun and

193
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,660
Lin Qian Jin's real brother

194
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,980
are Lu Yi Wen.

195
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,500
Before, Lin Qian Jin appeared

196
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,180
to be in a state of faintly faint.

197
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,380
I found that

198
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,860
Lu Yi Wen is very concerned about this matter.

199
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,620
The light is on.

200
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,180
Lu Yi Wen

201
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,180
is very concerned about Lin Qian Jin's health.

202
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,300
Fei Er,

203
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,740
go and get the medicine

204
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,660
I prepared for you.

205
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,340
Then, the light is on.

206
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,060
Qin Qian,

207
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,300
how do you feel?

208
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,820
Did you faint just now?

209
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,300
How do you know?

210
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,540
The medicine will be on me

211
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,540
in the future.

212
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,380
Lu Yi Wen

213
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,180
has made the decision.

214
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,660
This makes me suspicious.

215
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,420
So I started to follow Lu Yi Wen.

216
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,900
Put him in the back of the house.

217
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,380
This flower is very delicate.

218
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,900
It can't find the whole Nanling City

219
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,060
without a single drop.

220
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,180
You have to be careful

221
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,380
when you're in the East.

222
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,580
Yes, Your Highness.

223
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,420
I found it.

224
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,100
I found that he was

225
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,900
in the mansion

226
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,060
and planted Ye Hai Tang.

227
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,100
Then I went to the 18th-degree store

228
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,500
to get the medicine for him.

229
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,340
Remember to stand on my master's side.

230
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,020
Okay.

231
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,380
What medicine did that man

232
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,940
prepare just now?

233
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,700
He prepared the thousand-starred gold.

234
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,740
Thousand-starred gold?

235
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,780
The one that Princess Liu Yun and Lin Qian Jin planted

236
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,300
are all from Ye Hai Tang.

237
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,740
But you know that

238
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,140
you bought thousand-starred gold

239
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,700
to cure Lin Qian Jin.

240
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,180
So,

241
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,180
the murderer is Lu Yi Wen.

242
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:29,900
That's right.

243
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,220
Wen Wen.

244
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,020
Are you really poisoned?

245
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,500
So,

246
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,100
you asked Qian Jin to come here early

247
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,500
just to catch me?

248
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,740
You can ask this question.

249
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,700
It means you're smart.

250
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,220
Actually, Li An told me

251
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,300
his doubts about you.

252
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,780
From my order,

253
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,620
I started to make a move.

254
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,260
Lin Qian Jin's arrest

255
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,180
was also in my medical field.

256
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,860
Lin Qian Jin came here a day earlier

257
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,580
to cooperate with Li Yan

258
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,100
and make a move.

259
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,380
Wen Wen.

260
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,260
Is it really you?

261
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,460
I was right.

262
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,020
But I

263
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,420
never thought I would hurt you.

264
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,460
Lu Yi Wen.

265
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,980
You once poisoned Princess Liu Yun

266
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,860
and Lin Qian Jin.

267
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,220
They are both

268
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,740
the candidates for Princess Cheng's future.

269
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,940
You're so bold.

270
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,060
I can only give you...

271
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,700
Wait.

272
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,500
Qian Jin.

273
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,380
Gu Xie.

274
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,380
Princess Cheng.

275
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,100
Lu Yi Wen poisoned this thing.

276
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,740
She did something wrong.

277
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,940
But Princess Liu Yun and I

278
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,940
didn't die.

279
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,580
Princess Liu Yun is still in the wedding.

280
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,420
But there's still a chance of survival.

281
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,380
You can't just kill her.

282
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,620
You're a good man.

283
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,300
Is Princess Cheng

284
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,860
a good one who loves people?

285
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,420
I...

286
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,660
Who said I'd kill her?

287
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:20,820
Lu Yi Wen.

288
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,220
You tried to kill the girl

289
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,620
and made Princess Liu Yun

290
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,540
lose her mind.

291
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,940
You made Beiyue City

292
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,500
lose trust in me.

293
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,420
You deserve to be punished.

294
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,060
But you...

295
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:34,700
You...

296
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,780
You...

297
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,260
What are you?

298
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,620
It's all because of Lin Qian Jin's request.

299
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,140
I'll be angry with you.

300
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,540
Thank you, Your Highness.

301
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,300
I'll give you

302
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,580
a royal gift.

303
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,460
Get out of the city.

304
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:55,500
Guards.

305
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,500
Take her away.

306
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,260
Yes.

307
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,660
Qian Jin.

308
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:05,940
I'm sorry.

309
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,940
From now on,

310
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,500
if you kill Lin Qian Jin,

311
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,940
you'll be a murderer.

312
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,740
I won't spare you.

313
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,260
Don't be sad.

314
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,380
How are you feeling now?

315
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:29,860
By the way,

316
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,500
Lu Yi Wen said

317
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,660
he must take the last antidote.

318
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,820
Otherwise,

319
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,540
you'll be in danger.

320
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,020
Here.

321
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,580
Master Cheng.

322
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,500
I'll take your place.

323
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,500
I was wrong.

324
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,180
I'm sorry.

325
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,660
Cheng Dao.

326
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:50,980
I'll take it.

327
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,300
I'll take it.

328
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,620
I'll take it.

329
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:56,980
I'll take it.

330
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:58,860
I'll take it.

331
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,300
Are you crazy?

332
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,500
I'll take it.

333
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,100
I'll take it.

334
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:02,740
I'll take it.

335
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,380
Let go of me.

336
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,100
I'll take it.

337
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,620
I'll take it.
