1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The End

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If you really think Lin Qian Jin is innocent,

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
then get the evidence.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Tell everyone, understand?

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Please.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I will do my best to find out the truth.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I will give everyone an explanation.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And I will give Lin Qian Jin a light.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Come.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The criminal who killed Princess Liu Yun in the Golden Silk Forest,

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
is Lin Qian Jin.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The City Leader has ordered to kill Lin Qian Jin.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's not me!

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
No!

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You're fine.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What's wrong?

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm fine.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You...

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You should be well-well.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You shouldn't be late.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I have something urgent.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What is it?

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I really can't without you.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If you can't, then you can't continue to investigate.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So I need you.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm fine.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm fine.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm fine.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm fine.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm fine.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm fine.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm fine.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm fine.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm fine.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm fine.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm fine.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So I need you.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
All the evidence is pointing to Cheng Le.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
When she was in the 18th-degree pool,

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
she was suspicious.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Later, on the lamp,

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
her reaction was strange.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Especially when I asked her about the night pool,

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
she said she didn't want to talk.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And she was very reactionary.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Tell me.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Did she intentionally avoid our investigation?

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What's wrong?

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm fine.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I...

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Did you have any symptoms of faintness?

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No. Just two times.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Then...

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Did you use any other food recently?

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Or did you get a cold because of the weather?

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No. I didn't have any.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Look. It's not hot at all.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I...

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm fine.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What happened to you?

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I...

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I...

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You're wearing too thick爷 and thin.

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's sorta cold out there.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Here's a sweater.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,320
LIFE

68
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,900
You're occupied with me?

69
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,860
If you're occupied with me,

70
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,580
then do me a favor.

71
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,500
What?

72
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,360
I have to go to theầy

73
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,800
You're going to the place where you live?

74
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Chaiye Beach?

75
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,320
I have no other way.

76
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,280
Last time you were in the hospital.

77
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,920
But it's not like this every time.

78
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
I won't let you go.

79
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,720
You care about me?

80
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,240
No matter what,

81
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
I won't let you go.

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,840
If you care about me,

83
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,760
you should help me to clear my name.

84
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,080
I want to take away my power.

85
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,760
Ah Xiang,

86
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,400
I have to clear this matter up.

87
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,320
Otherwise,

88
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,080
the City Leader will misunderstand me.

89
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,360
I...

90
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,480
I'll help you to take care of half an hour.

91
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,960
That's great!

92
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,280
I knew you wouldn't be so stubborn today.

93
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,600
Good boy.

94
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,360
I'm leaving.

95
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,320
Wait.

96
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,680
You can go.

97
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,000
Ah Xiang,

98
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,840
help me to think about it.

99
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,200
How can I make up for you?

100
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,720
I think

101
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,360
why don't you let the City Leader make a request?

102
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,080
Can you still resist the order?

103
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
What do you know?

104
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,560
I want you to fall in love with me

105
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,400
instead of giving me orders.

106
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,080
To be honest,

107
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,320
it's all because of the lantern meeting

108
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,840
and Lin Qianjin's half-way corner.

109
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,160
If she didn't seduce me,

110
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,160
Brother Li Yan might have been

111
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,760
already mad at me.

112
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,960
Brother Li Yan,

113
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,280
I know you're kind to me.

114
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,480
Brother Li Yan.

115
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,440
Your Highness.

116
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,000
The fresh grape I just made

117
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
is very sweet and juicy.

118
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,480
It's very delicious.

119
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,640
Have a try.

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,400
Be careful.

121
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,840
Let me try.

122
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,480
Your Highness.

123
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,440
The City Leader entered the bus channel

124
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,120
and ordered me to drive the entrance door

125
00:07:39,120 --> 00:08:01,080
Let's make a

126
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,160
Christmas Eve present for the winner.

127
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,200
Let me prepare the others.

128
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,980
είναι kamicka is hiding there.

129
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,160
The End

130
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,160
Brother Li Yan, do you think it's nice?

131
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
Brother Li Yan

132
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Brother Li Yan

133
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,160
This is beautiful

134
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,160
It reminds me of many beautiful things

135
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
I bought a lot of fresh spices today

136
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,160
I want to go to see it with Brother Li Yan

137
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
Princess, this

138
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,160
This garden is more natural

139
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,160
I will accompany you

140
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,160
OK

141
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Then we will enjoy the natural scenery together

142
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,160
Who is inside?

143
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,160
Brother Li Yan, can you accompany me to enjoy the flowers often?

144
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Look at that lotus flower

145
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
Stop

146
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,160
Stop

147
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,160
Stop

148
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
Stop

149
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
Princess Linggao

150
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,160
Princess, this assassin is good at your bedroom

151
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Take the assassin with you

152
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
Yes

153
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
Brother Li Yan

154
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
Are you OK?

155
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,160
You are bleeding

156
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,160
I'm OK

157
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
The thief is bold

158
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
He dares to break into Princess' bedroom

159
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
Princess

160
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,160
I have to take him to the police station now

161
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
Xing'er, take care of Princess

162
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,160
Brother Li Yan, be careful

163
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,160
Princess

164
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,160
Come with me

165
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,160
Are you OK?

166
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,160
I'm OK

167
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,160
What about Yan'ai Tao?

168
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
It's important to protect her now

169
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
Go

170
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
Wait

171
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
Lin Qianjie

172
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Why are you here?

173
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
You are so bold

174
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
How dare you break into my bedroom

175
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
You are the master of the city

176
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
You are the master of the city

177
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,160
Little girl, don't be angry

178
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,160
Then it's my home

179
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,160
Now it's my home

180
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,160
Sister-in-law doesn't treat you as a family

181
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,160
You are so shameless

182
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,160
I have never seen you before

183
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
How dare you call yourself sister-in-law

184
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
Come, take her down

185
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,160
Master of the city is here

186
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,160
Greetings, Master

187
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,160
Master

188
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
What are you doing here?

189
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
Brother, Lin Qianjie

190
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
She didn't just break into the city's master's house

191
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
She even stole my bedroom

192
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,160
No one can tell

193
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,160
Lin Qianjie

194
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,160
It's you again

195
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
Master

196
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,160
Well

197
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,160
It's like this

198
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,160
I'm the most famous in the city

199
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,160
And I heard that

200
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
Princess Chang'e

201
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,160
has a very special sauce

202
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,160
I'm curious to see

203
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,160
I can prove it

204
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,160
Miss Lin is still very good at it

205
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,160
So I let you

206
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
to be honest

207
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,160
I should do it

208
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Brother

209
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,160
Don't you want to punish Lin Qianjie?

210
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,160
How can you blame Li Yan?

211
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Lin Qianjie

212
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
You can't do anything

213
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
You should do it yourself

214
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
You can't do anything

215
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,160
You can't do anything

216
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
100 times

217
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
You can't go home without doing anything

218
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
You can't do anything

219
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
You can't do anything

220
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
Why am I so unlucky?

221
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
I was so lucky

222
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,160
that I got into the trap

223
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
Now I'm here

224
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
to find some tricks

225
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,160
I'm so hungry

226
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
I want to go home

227
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,160
and eat the chicken leg made by my mom

228
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,160
Are you hungry?

229
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,160
It's delicious

230
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,160
You said that

231
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,160
two brothers and sisters in Murong family

232
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,160
are really over

233
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
They must know

234
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,160
I hate these

235
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,160
funny things

236
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,160
So they asked me

237
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
to make some tricks

238
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,160
and make so many jokes

239
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
Give me your hand

240
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
I...

241
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,160
I mean

242
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,160
give me your hand

243
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
You...

244
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,160
You want to eat my hand?

245
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
I'm so hungry

246
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
I want to go home

247
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,160
and eat the chicken leg made by my mom

248
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,160
Are you hungry?

249
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,160
I'm so hungry

250
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,160
I want to go home

251
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,160
and eat the chicken leg made by my mom

252
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
Are you hungry?

253
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
I'm so hungry

254
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,160
I want to go home

255
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
and eat the chicken leg made by my mom

256
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,160
Are you hungry?

257
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
I'm so hungry

258
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,160
I want to go home

259
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,160
and eat the chicken leg made by my mom

260
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,160
Are you hungry?

261
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
I'm so hungry

262
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,160
I want to go home

263
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,160
and eat the chicken leg made by my mom

264
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,160
Are you hungry?

265
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
I'm so hungry

266
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
I want to go home

267
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
and eat the chicken leg made by my mom

271
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,160

I want to go home
