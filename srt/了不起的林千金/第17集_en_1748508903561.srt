The Long Ballad

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 18

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Beat him!

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Why don't you have any vegetables today?

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Give me water!

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Give me water!

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Big Brother!

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Stop!

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll die and become a ghost!

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I won't spare you!

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You're all despicable!

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You're all despicable!

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Help!

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You're all despicable!

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You deserve to die!

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You deserve to die!

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You deserve to die!

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I didn't expect that Lin Qian Jin is so miserable.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I was thinking how to deal with him before he died.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I didn't expect him to die.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Princess, even God is helping you.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It seems that the position of City Leader's wife

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
is not yours anymore.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You can say that.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But what's wrong with Li Yan?

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He just had a fight with Lin Qian Jin.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
He just abandoned him.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I don't understand.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But this time, Lin Qian Jin was put in jail.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
He really lost a lot.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
No matter what,

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
he helped me this time.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Once I become City Leader's wife,

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I must thank him.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Thank him?

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yin Xue,

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
go and find the best tailor in the city.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay, Princess.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You must choose the best color

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
to match with Princess.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No, it's City Leader's wife.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You're so stubborn.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Go in.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I didn't expect

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I could meet the former

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and mighty Minister Lin here.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The city has changed.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yesterday, he was in the hall.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Today, he is in the prison.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Who knows?

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's go.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Qian Jin,

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
you're not going to be able to

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
get rid of him.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You're not going to be able to

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
get rid of him.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Don't be sad.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I've seen a lot of people

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
who have a knife in their back.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Father,

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
did you really poison Liu Yun?

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
My daughter,

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
you don't even believe your father?

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I did it.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I admit that I killed people and set fire.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It wasn't my father's doing.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He didn't even admit that he was killed by ants.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't believe you.

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I just can't understand

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
why Li Yan suddenly became like this.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why do you care so much about Li Yan?

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You should be thinking about City Leader.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What will you think?

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let's eat.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Let's eat.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Hurry up.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Hurry up.

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Is this food for people?

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's all lean meat.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's good to have something to eat.

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
In this prison,

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
you have to eat something lean.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You bastard.

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Don't think I don't know who's supporting you.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Qian Jin.

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Qian Jin,

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
don't be sad.

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Eat something.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Your health is important.

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Father!

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Father!

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Don't be afraid. It's a rat.

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Go away.

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Go away.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Why isn't he leaving?

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He left after eating.

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He has to go home.

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't be afraid.

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Did you hear that?

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Princess Liu Yun is going to be the City Leader's wife.

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Everyone knows that.

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I heard that the City Leader's wife is wearing the official uniform.

104
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Li Si Jun has been busy these days.

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm the City Leader's wife.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You...

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Don't come over.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't come over.

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't go.

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You haven't told me

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
why you did this.

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Are all the things you said in the village

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
all lies?

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I just want to find out the truth.

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Impossible. Impossible.

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I don't believe it.

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You were so sincere.

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's impossible that you lied to me.

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The City Leader wants to see you.

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Then tell me.

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Why did you still take the sachet I made for you?

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's just a decoration.

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The City Leader is here.

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
City Leader.

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
City Leader.

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I swear by my life

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
that I didn't do anything that would hurt my wife.

128
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Minister Lin,

129
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
you should confess as soon as possible.

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It will also end my heart.

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
City Leader,

132
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
no one will confess.

133
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You don't have to talk nonsense.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You should be beheaded.

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Give me justice.

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
City Leader, in my opinion,

137
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
since Minister Lin didn't confess,

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
we should leave the city as soon as possible

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
since the old and the new are all lost.

140
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Lin Qian Jin,

141
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
what else do you want to say?

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I just want to take a closer look

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and see the real face of some people.

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Lin Qian Jin,

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
a daughter of a criminal,

146
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
how can you say you can see my real face?

147
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
There are assassins.

148
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Follow me.

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Who are you?

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm the murderer.

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Who are you?

152
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
How dare you break into the building?

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We received news from Minister Lin

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and asked Jin Yan to come to the prison.

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Where did you come from?

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't know you at all.

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
City Leader,

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
the prison is heavily guarded.

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
How can I spread the news?

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The Yuzi can testify for me.

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Minister Lin,

162
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
it's a pity

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
that those Yuzi have died.

164
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
City Leader,

165
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
he didn't do this.

166
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You did?

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Maybe you arranged this.

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
City Leader,

169
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
please investigate it.

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm willing to die

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and follow Minister Lin.

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't know them at all.

173
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Who sent you to frame me?

174
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
City Leader,

175
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
you can't be kind anymore.

176
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Take these people down and watch them.

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Since they are so loyal,

178
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
let them

179
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
go to the hell together.

180
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Take them away.

181
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
City Leader.

182
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
City Leader.

183
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
City Leader.

184
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I wanted to keep him in the dark

185
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and let him confess.

186
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I wanted to keep him alive and let him go back to his hometown

187
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
to live a long life.

188
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I didn't expect him to be so cruel.

189
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He killed Liu Yun and didn't confess.

190
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He even wants to take the prison.

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
City Leader,

192
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
don't you think it's strange?

193
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
They didn't come here

194
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
until you showed up

195
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
this evening.

196
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Well...

197
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What do you mean?

198
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I dare not to guess.

199
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's obvious.

200
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What can you guess?

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
They must want to assassinate City Leader.

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Li Yan,

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I order you to

204
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
take people to investigate Lin Mansion.

205
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Find Tan Zhi and Hong Yan

206
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and let that old thief

207
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
confess.

208
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yes.

209
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And, pass the oral decree

210
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
to let the guards take Lin Qianjin and Lin Sizheng

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
to the execution ground.

212
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
After you get the evidence,

213
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
we will take them down.

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Princess,

215
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Nanling City is going to execute

216
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Lin Sizheng's daughter.

217
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
There are so many good things

218
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
recently.

219
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's not over yet.

220
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It seems that Lin Qianjin

221
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
is dead.

222
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Princess,

223
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
what about the evidence?

224
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Since he wants the evidence,

225
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
we should give it to him.

226
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes, Princess.

227
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Hurry up.

228
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Hurry up.

229
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Don't touch my daughter.

230
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Forget it.

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Let her be the one

232
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
who wants to die.

233
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Come on, you two.

234
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Stop.

235
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Go.

236
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Hurry up.

237
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Hurry up.

238
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Hurry up.

239
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Hurry up.

240
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Hurry up.

241
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Hurry up.

242
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

243
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Lin Sizheng

244
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's time.

245
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The criminal Lin Donghai and Lin Qianjin

246
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
are executed.

247
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The criminal Lin Donghai and Lin Qianjin

248
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
are executed.

249
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The criminal Lin Donghai and Lin Qianjin

250
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
are executed.

251
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The criminal Lin Donghai and Lin Qianjin

252
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
are executed.

253
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The criminal Lin Donghai and Lin Qianjin

254
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
are executed.

255
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The criminal Lin Donghai and Lin Qianjin

256
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
are executed.

257
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The criminal Lin Donghai and Lin Qianjin

258
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
are executed.

259
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The criminal Lin Donghai and Lin Qianjin

260
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
are executed.

261
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
ihan

262
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
eran

263
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The appeals from then

264
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,760
I know.

265
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,640
I don't understand what you're talking about.

266
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,320
That's right.

267
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,480
Princess Liuyin has done too many evil deeds.

268
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,520
It's possible that she can't remember them all at once.

269
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,160
How about I remind you of them?

270
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,840
First,

271
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,800
you poisoned Lin Qianjin.

272
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
When you were drinking with Lin Qianjin that day,

273
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,200
you secretly put red smoke

274
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,920
in Lin Qianjin's wine pot.

275
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,680
But you didn't expect that

276
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,000
you would drink with her that day.

277
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,520
You...

278
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,160
You took the wrong wine cup.

279
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,720
So you got poisoned by yourself.

280
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,560
Princess.

281
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,160
The next day, you woke up

282
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,760
and found that your appearance

283
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,360
had become unbearable.

284
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,360
You thought Lin Qianjin changed the wine cup.

285
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,920
However, the poison found in the wine cup

286
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,280
was the Yehai soup that Lu Yumin put in.

287
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,240
So you pretended to be poisoned by Yehai soup

288
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,720
and took a small yellow flower

289
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,080
to restore your appearance.

290
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,600
But it's a pity that

291
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,360
the symptoms of your Yangzhuang

292
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,600
and the symptoms of Yehai soup

293
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,120
are completely different.

294
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,720
Minister Li,

295
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,560
I didn't do it.

296
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,920
Besides,

297
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,680
you have no evidence.

298
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,840
It's all your plan.

299
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,360
If I'm not wrong,

300
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,920
if I'm not wrong,

301
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,560
the killer sent by

302
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,440
the Loveless Valley

303
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,360
was arranged by you, right?
