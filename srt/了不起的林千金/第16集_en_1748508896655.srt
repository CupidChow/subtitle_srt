00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,480
The X-Man�re

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I think you're a vicious crazy girl.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I even suspected

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that you were the murderer.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So...

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So you know

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm kind-hearted, right?

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Qianqian.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I want to tell you

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
that I don't know when

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I won't allow anyone to say you're bad

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
or you'll be hurt.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I want to protect you

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
from time to time.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
When I find you happy,

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'll be happy.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
When you're sad,

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'll be sad with you.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Qianqian.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I want to know everything about you.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Me too.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Although

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
you're usually

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
a stupid and stupid

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
woodcutter,

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
you're usually

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
a silly person.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
because of you,

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I feel warm in my heart.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I remember

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
when we watched the sunrise together,

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
you said

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
that you'd like to watch the sunrise

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
with two people

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
who like each other.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So...

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What if we watched the stars together?

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Can I understand

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
that you're confessing to me?

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Right?

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Right?

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Tell me, right?

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Are you confessing to me?

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Right?

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Right?

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Right?

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Are you Xia Niu?

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What are you doing?

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Right.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Let's go.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Go and have a look.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Something's wrong.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
There must be something wrong with him.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let's go.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Let's go.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Dali, what are you cooking?

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This stir-fried rice paper

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
is your favorite.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Put it in front of you.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Take this abalone.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You hate to waste it.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Wait.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yin Er,

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
go back to the stove first.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
When you're back,

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
bring it to me.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Your Highness,

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I've informed the City Leader.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He said he would come over

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
to have lunch with you.

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Then,

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
did he mention

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
the marriage?

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He said you've worked hard.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He'll come over

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
to discuss the wedding at noon.

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Hurry.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Tell them to light the incense.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Don't let the smoke

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
of the whole house

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
make the City Leader dizzy.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yin Er,

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
you're here.

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yin Er,

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
you're here.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yin Er,

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
you're here.

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yin Er,

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
where are you?

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I wasn't hiding.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yin Er,

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I wanted to say

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
how am Iх

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
you bastard!

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Your Highness,

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yin Er,

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,820
I'm happy that your marble

104
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
is still alive.

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Uncle,

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
you

107
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
didn't

108
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
know I've been together

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
all my life.

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
.

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I war against it

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,520
If you let her become the City Leader's wife,

113
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,480
I'll kill you.

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,680
Yes, yes, yes.

115
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

116
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,400
Go.

117
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:07,960
Father,

118
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,920
Princess Liuying is so strange.

119
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,920
She must have found the antidote.

120
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,280
She still hasn't woken up.

121
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,400
What's going on?

122
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,160
I was a doctor in North Moon.

123
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,920
But two years ago,

124
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,920
I was punished by the City Leader

125
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,000
for offending the nobility.

126
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,160
So I put a poison in it.

127
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,080
It can make you old.

128
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,840
It can make you old?

129
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,640
If you take this poison,

130
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,600
young girls

131
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,720
or young men

132
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,960
will get old quickly.

133
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,360
I think

134
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,040
this antidote is probably

135
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,080
a little flower.

136
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,120
Yes.

137
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,320
So you've been living here?

138
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:55,960
Yes.

139
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,600
Although this little flower

140
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,320
can cure the poison of red eyes and red cheeks,

141
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,520
it must be taken every day.

142
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,160
So I had to live here

143
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,400
to save my life.

144
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,520
That day,

145
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,400
you fell from the Valley of Lovers.

146
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,680
I was there.

147
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,480
At first, I thought

148
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,200
you were here to kill me.

149
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,320
But I didn't think so.

150
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,480
I think you two are fated to meet.

151
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,040
So I put down the antidote

152
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,000
and let you come here to heal.

153
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,720
I see.

154
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,920
Thank you, Doctor.

155
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,760
So

156
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,160
the poison that Princess Liu Yun was poisoned with

157
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,320
was the red eyes and red cheeks.

158
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,320
Now the truth is finally out.

159
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
But

160
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,200
why did Princess Liu Yun

161
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,920
poison herself?

162
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,800
I think

163
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,240
she wants to poison

164
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,760
another person.

165
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,480
Could it be

166
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,600
me?

167
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,600
Your Highness,

168
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
the City Leader said

169
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,520
the official affairs are busy.

170
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,320
He'll come another day.

171
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,160
Please calm down, Your Highness.

172
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,320
Unzip my clothes.

173
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,960
Listen up, people inside.

174
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,600
I'll give you a time

175
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,840
to release Lin Qianjin.

176
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,600
Otherwise,

177
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,800
I'll not only pacify your clinic,

178
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,640
but also pacify North Moon City.

179
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,240
Release Lin Qianjin!

180
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,600
Release Lin Qianjin!

181
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,000
Release Lin Qianjin!

182
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,320
Take Lin Si Zhen down!

183
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,840
All of you, back off!

184
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,360
Are you going to rebel?

185
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,400
City Leader.

186
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,320
Wait!

187
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,600
Come in!

188
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,400
Father!

189
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,320
Father!

190
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,920
Qianjin!

191
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,880
What's wrong?

192
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,840
Are you all right?

193
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,760
Are you hurt?

194
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,760
I'm fine.

195
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
You've suffered.

196
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,560
Why did you arrest my father?

197
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,440
You should be safe.

198
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
Because of your disappearance,

199
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,040
Minister Lin

200
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,960
has led troops to the clinic.

201
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,480
City Leader,

202
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,080
since I started this,

203
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,680
why don't you release my father?

204
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,920
I'll go back with you.

205
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,480
City Leader,

206
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,480
why don't I accompany Lin Si Zhen

207
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,200
and Lin Qianjin?

208
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,000
City Leader,

209
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
we've found out

210
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,600
the source of the incident.

211
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,760
I suspect

212
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,760
the person who poisoned the banquet

213
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,840
is not only Lu Yiwen,

214
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,920
but also someone else.

215
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,240
This person is Princess Liu Yun.

216
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,320
Actually,

217
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,480
it was her plan to kill herself.

218
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,240
She wanted to poison the North Court,

219
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
and make Hong Yan Lao

220
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,600
marry me.

221
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,040
But she didn't expect

222
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,520
even God couldn't bear it

223
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,960
and made her commit the crime.

224
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,720
She even wanted to

225
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,000
frame me for it.

226
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,400
She even wanted to kill me.

227
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,840
Actually,

228
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,160
she did all of this

229
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,200
to make you misunderstand me.

230
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,560
Then she could

231
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,680
become your wife.

232
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,800
Ooh.

233
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,240
While I thought

234
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,440
she could be my wife,

235
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,780
I thought

236
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
she could be my friend.

237
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,400
Liu Yin of first-born child

238
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,320
could not be your wife after all.

239
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,960
Why?

240
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,200
If you were not here,

241
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,640
why did you

242
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,240
fulfill your 읲plan this time?

243
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,420
If this product

244
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,320
failed to make humans aware of me,

245
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,000
even if Du Yun badge

246
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,280
to be the guiding Lockjaw there,

247
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,640
This little yellow flower

248
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,400
is the antidote for Tan Zhi and Hong Yan Lang.

249
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,120
I...

250
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,800
Lin Qian Jin.

251
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,240
Don't be so selfish.

252
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,880
Liu Yan.

253
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,800
What did you say?

254
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,520
Master.

255
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,880
According to my investigation,

256
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,800
the poison that Princess Liu Ying was poisoned with

257
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,240
is indeed the secret poison of North Moon,

258
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,040
Tan Zhi and Hong Yan Lang.

259
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
But this poison was made by Lin Si Zheng

260
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,920
to collude with North Moon people's purchases.

261
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,680
It was used to poison Princess Liu Ying.

262
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,320
Therefore,

263
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,720
Lin Qian Jin was promoted to the position of City Leader's wife.

264
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,560
Moreover,

265
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,520
she wouldn't be suspected by North Moon people.

266
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,800
Lin Yan.

267
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,040
I know what you're talking about.

268
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,440
Lin Qian Jin and Lin Si Zheng.

269
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,800
You two are in cahoots to poison Princess Liu Ying.

270
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,080
This is an unproven fact.

271
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,360
You'd better confess as soon as possible.

272
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,400
In this way,

273
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,480
City Leader might leave you some excuses.

274
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,360
If things get worse,

275
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,040
it will get worse.

276
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,280
Lin Yan.

277
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,840
Don't turn the tables.

278
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,120
You've already investigated the poison.

279
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,160
Now you've proved my daughter's innocence.

280
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,840
Why do you frame me up again?

281
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,720
Listen.

282
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,160
I never

283
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,520
do anything evil.

284
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,000
City Leader.

285
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,240
I'm loyal to the East Sea.

286
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,560
I can see it.

287
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,600
I won't collude with North Moon people.

288
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,400
Lin Si Zheng.

289
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,600
Don't make excuses.

290
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,880
Do you really think I can't prove it?

291
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,040
This is the evidence that you colluded with North Moon people.

292
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,360
City Leader.

293
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,800
Please have a look.

294
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,560
I didn't expect

295
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,760
those men who played the red-eyed man

296
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,000
would be Lin Si Zheng.

297
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,160
City Leader.

298
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,440
Our City Leader

299
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,400
has investigated the North Moon people who colluded with Lin Si Zheng.

300
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,880
Now it's up to you.

301
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,840
Let's also explain it to our City Leader.

302
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,880
Shut up.

303
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
City Leader.

304
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,840
You'll believe me sooner or later.

305
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,640
You can't do such a thing.

306
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,040
Lin Yan

307
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,160
is obviously framing me up.

308
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,200
And those

309
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,920
who are loyal to the North Moon people.

310
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,360
They are all colluding with each other.

311
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,840
What is Lin Donghai

312
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,840
still trying to do?

313
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,880
Show him.

314
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,080
Guards.

315
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,040
Take Lin Donghai and Lin Qianjin

316
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,480
to the prison

317
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,200
and be executed.

318
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,080
Yes.

319
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,080
Let me go.

320
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,360
Lin Yan.

321
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,720
Are you not going to keep your promise?

322
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,720
You lied to me.

323
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,040
Take her away.

324
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:24,880
Go.

325
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,680
Lin Yan.

326
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,760
Lin Yan.

327
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,200
Lin Yan.

328
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,880
City Leader.

329
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,560
Go.

330
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,720
Hurry up.

331
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,560
Isn't that Lin Qianjin?

332
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,320
Yes.

333
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,200
It's really her.

334
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,360
I heard that the North Moon people

335
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,360
were poisoned by her and Lin Si Zheng.

336
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,680
It's not us.

337
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,440
You thought she was a good student.

338
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,640
I didn't expect that they were all Chinese.

339
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,760
Luckily, she didn't become the City Leader's wife.

340
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,640
Otherwise, we would be the one who would suffer.

341
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,360
Yes.

342
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,680
We would be the one.

343
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,560
Qianjin.

344
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,800
Don't be afraid.

345
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,560
There's a father.

346
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,680
Your Majesty.

347
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,640
I'm sorry.

348
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
I'm sorry.

349
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
I'm sorry.

350
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,640
I'm sorry.

351
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
I'm sorry.

352
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,640
I'm sorry.

353
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,640
I'm sorry.

354
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
I'm sorry.

355
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,640
I'm sorry.

356
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
I'm sorry.

357
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
I'm sorry.

358
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
I'm sorry.

359
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
I'm sorry.

360
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
I'm sorry.

361
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
I'm sorry.

362
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
I'm sorry.

363
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,640
I'm sorry.

364
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
I'm sorry.

365
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
I'm sorry.

366
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
I'm sorry.

367
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
I'm sorry.

368
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
I'm sorry.

369
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
I'm sorry.

370
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
I'm sorry.

371
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,640
I'm sorry.

372
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
I'm sorry.

373
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
I'm sorry.

374
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
I'm sorry.

375
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
I'm sorry.
