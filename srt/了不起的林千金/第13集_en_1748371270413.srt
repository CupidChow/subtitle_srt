1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,440
Hey, J

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The Long Ballad

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's her.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes, it's her.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Wen Wen.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Wen Wen.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Wen Wen.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Lu Yi Wen.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Lu Yi Wen, stop!

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You're not recovered yet.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Go back.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I can't let you go.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm the one who hurt you.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I don't deserve to see you.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I don't believe you're the one who put the poison.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Go.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Brother, please help me.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Thank you.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Please help me.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Tell me.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What happened?

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I wanted to poison Princess Liu Yun.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I don't know why you put the poison.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Jing Jing.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Don't believe anyone.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The symptoms of Princess Liu Yun's poison are not the Ye Hai Drug.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
all the symptoms on her medical report

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
prove that she put the Ye Hai Drug.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's Ye Hai Drug.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Ye Hai Drug is good for the liver.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's colorless.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
People who took the poison

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
are no different from normal people.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But gradually,

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
there will be signs of weakness.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
For example, they'll faint.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If there's no antidote,

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
they'll die within a few days.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The most powerful point of this drug is

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
that the victim

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
can't find out the cause of the poison.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I only put the poison in Princess Liu Yun's old house.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is also the reason why the medical report

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
confirms that Princess Liu Yun was poisoned by Ye Hai Drug.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Princess Liu Yun has been unconscious

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
since she was poisoned.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's me

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
who seems to have taken the symptoms of Ye Hai Drug's poison.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What do you mean?

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I suspect someone changed the cup.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Changed the cup?

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Then who poisoned Princess Liu Yun?

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What poison did she put in?

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Are you done?

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Hurry up. Let's go.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Wen Wen.

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Jingjing.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Actually,

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
you've always known my feelings.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Since I was a child,

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I was willing to be with you

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
in everything you wanted to do.

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But you only wanted to be the City Leader's wife.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You're happy.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm happy with her.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Wen Wen.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Wen Wen.

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Protect yourself.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Wen Wen, don't go.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Wen Wen.

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:15,260
On ear of the

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Are you okay?

77
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,720
But you have to be responsible for what you do.

78
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,640
I really can't bear to leave him.

79
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
It's not like you.

80
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,240
I want to tell you.

81
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,560
Since it's over,

82
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,360
you have to move on.

83
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,360
No.

84
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,160
It's not over yet.

85
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,560
There's one more thing about Liuying's poisoning.

86
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,560
I have to figure it out.

87
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,920
How did Liuying get poisoned?

88
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,120
First of all,

89
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,960
I have to stay in the City Leader's Mansion

90
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
and find a chance to continue to investigate the clues of Liuying's poisoning.

91
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,720
Let's talk while we walk.

92
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,240
Let's go.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,600
City Leader,

94
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,040
now we can finally prove that I'm not the real murderer.

95
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,680
You've been misunderstanding me.

96
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,720
You know you're wrong, right?

97
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,640
Since you know you're wrong,

98
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,880
shouldn't you show me some respect?

99
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,640
I'm wrong?

100
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,160
I have to reward you?

101
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,000
Yes, yes, yes.

102
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,400
I should reward you well.

103
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,520
Make us some tea.

104
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,480
It's a great honor.

105
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,200
Me?

106
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,400
Make tea?

107
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,200
Shouldn't you take me to the City Leader's Mansion?

108
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,800
You shouldn't let me stay for a few days.

109
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,880
Why do you still want me to make tea?

110
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,520
No.

111
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,640
Didn't you want to be the City Leader's wife

112
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,440
when you were arguing?

113
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,520
You have to do these things to be the City Leader's wife.

114
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,800
Why does Murong Chengfeng

115
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,000
look so strange?

116
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,440
Okay.

117
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,040
Where is he?

118
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,840
Where is he?

119
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,920
It's too hot.

120
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,240
Let's see what excuse you have.

121
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,720
Let's make another pot.

122
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,760
It's too cold.

123
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,680
You're so busy.

124
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,040
Good tea.

125
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,480
I want to eat fruit.

126
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,000
Feed me.

127
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,440
Feed Lu Siqi.

128
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,760
Okay.

129
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,640
Okay.

130
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,760
I...

131
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,680
City Leader,

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,200
I remember that you like to eat wine.

133
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,480
Massage.

134
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,160
City Leader,

135
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,960
I think

136
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,560
we should go and paint.

137
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,400
But I heard that

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,560
Lin Qianjin can't play the piano and play the painting.

139
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,680
Who says I can't?

140
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,760
I... I can...

141
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,600
I can play the water ink monad of the second-class Liu.

142
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,600
The water ink monad of the second-class Liu?

143
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,720
Show me.

144
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,720
How is it?

145
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
Interesting, right?

146
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,320
Interesting.

147
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,320
I think...

148
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,760
It's not quite right.

149
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,080
City Leader,

150
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,600
I think

151
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
we should play chess.

152
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,320
Okay.

153
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,760
Can you play it, Qianjin?

154
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,440
I can.

155
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,080
I can play

156
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,680
the five-leaf chess.

157
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,920
Five-leaf chess?

158
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,080
Five-leaf chess?

159
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,160
Lian'er,

160
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,520
did you send a letter to my father?

161
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,680
Don't worry, My Lady.

162
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,840
Master has already known.

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,400
I finally know it now.

164
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,280
It's not easy to be the City Leader's wife.

165
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,920
You need to know how to play the piano and speak.

166
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,240
You need to take good care of the City Leader.

167
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,000
It's like being called by the Master of the House.

168
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,720
Isn't this Yingxue?

169
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,080
Why is she so sneaky?

170
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,160
Lian'er, go back to the villa first.

171
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,400
I have something important to do.

172
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,480
Yes, My Lady.

173
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,000
I'll go now.

174
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,000
Lin Qianjin is interesting.

175
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,080
He made us

176
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,400
have new fun.

177
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,520
It's interesting,

178
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,600
but

179
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
she's a crazy girl.

180
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,360
Judging from your smile,

181
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,200
you're not interested in her, are you?

182
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,960
I'm interested in her.

183
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,080
You're interested in her?

184
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,480
You need to be honest.

185
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,960
The woman I like

186
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,880
won't give in to others.

187
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,200
You

188
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,960
like her?

189
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,240
Her?

190
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,920
How is that possible?

191
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,560
She's vicious and has a reputation.

192
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,640
She doesn't learn anything.

193
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
She's not interesting.

194
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,920
She's not interesting,

195
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,960
but she's interesting.

196
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,520
Yes, that's for sure.

197
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,800
It seems like she's

198
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,160
kernel of

199
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,920
Her Ladyship's dream.

200
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,800
However,

201
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,920
she's been performing pretty well lately.

202
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,000
Her Ladyship's position

203
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,240
could be the Heb fini's one.

204
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,840
I'll plate it very carefully.

205
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,680
She'll College it very carefully.

206
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,360
You should teach Lin Qianqian a lesson.

207
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,680
You should learn from her.

208
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,440
When did you die?

209
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,720
What are you doing?

210
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,320
You scared me.

211
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,760
Look at Yingxue.

212
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,880
She poured the medicine and it's all over the place.

213
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,320
You suspect me?

214
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,360
Yes, I suspect her.

215
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,320
Let's go.

216
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,840
As expected,

217
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,120
this is not the antidote for Ye Begonia.

218
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,120
Qianqian, Qianqian, Qianqian.

219
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:44,960
Come here.

220
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,720
The Wu Ziqi you gave me

221
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,200
is so interesting.

222
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,160
What else do you have to show me?

223
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,640
If I'm happy,

224
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,280
I'll reward you.

225
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,640
The most useful thing for me is to make incense.

226
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,080
Make incense?

227
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,840
Master,

228
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,200
recently,

229
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,960
I need to make a special spice

230
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,640
in the incense bag.

231
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,080
But this spice

232
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,480
can only be bought

233
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,960
in the 18-mile shop.

234
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,080
So I want to go out.

235
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,680
Master, don't worry.

236
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,760
The incense bag I made

237
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,800
will not let you down.

238
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,360
It's more interesting than the water ink single-pick of the Liu Sect of the Second Earth.

239
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,160
That's so interesting.

240
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,760
Good.

241
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,560
But I'm still a little worried.

242
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,360
I guess Minister Lin

243
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,800
is also worried about you going out alone.

244
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,360
After all, the relationship between us

245
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,760
is still a little tense.

246
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:46,880
Well,

247
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,680
I'll send some guards to go with you

248
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,560
to protect you.

249
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,600
Why bother?

250
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,120
I think

251
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,520
Li Yan should go with me.

252
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,520
Why does Li Yan have to go with you?

253
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,000
Who can be safer than the private army

254
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,800
around the City Leader?

255
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,640
Right?

256
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,800
And the City Leader

257
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,560
has been arranging him to protect me from the investigation.

258
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,960
I think

259
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,000
he's pretty good at protecting me.

260
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,040
Good.

261
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,280
Then I'll arrange Li Yan to go with you.

262
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,880
Yes, City Leader.

263
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,560
It's strange.

264
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,160
I'm afraid I've seen

265
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,520
more medicine

266
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,520
than the doctors in the City.

267
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,000
But why can't I smell

268
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,120
the medicine?

269
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,800
May I ask what the medicine

270
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
was originally for?

271
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,040
Well...

272
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,960
Well,

273
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,800
I have a big brother who is not pregnant.

274
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,280
I don't know where to find such a big brother.

275
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,480
I'm afraid he's not pregnant.

276
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,440
I'm afraid he's not pregnant.

277
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,440
I'm afraid he's not pregnant.

278
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
I'm afraid he's not pregnant.

279
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,400
I don't know where to find such a big brother.

280
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,920
I'm afraid he'll eat too much.

281
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,640
So I want to find someone who knows the medicine.

282
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,720
So...

283
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,440
Look.

284
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,080
Last time,

285
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,440
your husband came here

286
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,000
and gave you a mother's breast.

287
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,680
It means that

288
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,880
the more you don't know, the more you'll get hurt.

289
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,840
It must be troublesome.

290
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,720
I know

291
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,040
that you must be shy.

292
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,440
You've been

293
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,840
ashamed of this for a long time.

294
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,120
But let me tell you.

295
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,760
This is good for you.

296
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,240
I...

297
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,440
It's for your brother.

298
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,880
It's good for your brother.

299
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,920
It's good for your brother.

300
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,400
In that case,

301
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,120
let's ask for another one.

302
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,560
Let's go.

303
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,880
What?

304
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,520
Let's ask for...

305
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,120
Please wait.

306
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,920
Please wait.

307
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,160
Please wait.

308
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,400
Please wait.

309
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,680
Last time,

310
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,520
I didn't give you the pregnant medicine.

311
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,400
You didn't take it.

312
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,280
I think you two are very kind.

313
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,880
This time,

314
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,480
I'll give you a free

315
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,680
couple's kiss.

316
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,720
Here.

317
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,440
Take it.

318
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,600
Take it.

319
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,440
At night,

320
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,600
you can kiss each other in the tent.

321
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,880
The effect

322
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,840
is very good.

323
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,760
You'll be happy immediately.

324
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,440
Who said I was going to win?
