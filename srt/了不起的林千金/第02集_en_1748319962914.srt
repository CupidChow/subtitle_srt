1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,380
Remember toということ

2
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,460
for transition.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,460
My dress,

4
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,000
escalate the dissipation.

5
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:44,860
Lian,

6
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,240
I want the skate.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,320
Don't move!

8
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,640
I'm asking you,

9
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,220
You.

10
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,480
You.

11
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,500
I'll be with you.

12
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,460
I'm not your boss.

13
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,460
I'm Feng Ming.

14
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,860
I'm here to visit you.

15
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,460
Stop it.

16
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,460
Continue.

17
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,460
You won't say later

18
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,460
that I'm here to see you, right?

19
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,460
Not bad.

20
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,460
I'm here to see you.

21
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,460
I'm here to see you.

22
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,460
You're so stupid.

23
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,460
I'm here to see you.

24
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,460
I'm here to see you.

25
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,460
When did I ask you to come?

26
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,460
I'm quite bold.

27
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,460
You're right.

28
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,460
I'm here to see you.

29
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,460
You can't take it, right?

30
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,460
You'll say later

31
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,460
that I asked you to burn your letter.

32
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,460
That's right.

33
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,460
You said it.

34
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,460
The more, the more.

35
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,460
I'm here to see you.

36
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,460
I don't know about this secret.

37
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,460
I'm afraid I'll be killed.

38
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,460
I'm here to see you.

39
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,460
I'm here to see you.

40
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,460
What a nice idea.

41
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,460
You're still a student.

42
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,460
I'm so stupid.

43
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,460
I'm here to see you.

44
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,460
What?

45
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,460
What's wrong?

46
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,460
What's wrong with us?

47
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,460
Why did you

48
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,460
save me?

49
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,460
I won't let you go.

50
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,460
You're so vicious.

51
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,460
You're still pretending to be a fool.

52
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,460
I'm so vicious.

53
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,460
Excuse me.

54
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,460
I'm playing with your feelings.

55
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,460
Or am I not your heart?

56
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,460
Nonsense.

57
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,460
Li Yan,

58
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,460
you're not allowed to hurt Qian Jin.

59
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,460
This person is

60
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,460
Lin Qian Jin's father.

61
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,460
Yun Si Zhen.

62
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,460
Father.

63
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,460
Father.

64
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,460
What's your name?

65
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,460
Father.

66
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,460
My daughter.

67
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,460
Father.

68
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,460
My daughter.

69
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,460
Are you a fool or...

70
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,460
What's wrong with me?

71
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,460
Or how did she find you?

72
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,460
I'm so scared.

73
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,460
Father.

74
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,460
Father.

75
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,460
How dare you

76
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,460
hurt Qian Jin?

77
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,460
You don't know,

78
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,460
Qian Jin is pretending to be a fool.

79
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,460
You're so stupid.

80
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,460
My daughter.

81
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,460
Don't you know that?

82
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,460
She used to call me

83
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,460
old man.

84
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,460
Now she's a big change.

85
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,460
She calls me

86
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,460
brother and sister.

87
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,460
But it's you.

88
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,460
You scared her.

89
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,460
My Qian Jin.

90
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,460
Lin Si Zhen,

91
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,460
please listen to me.

92
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,460
I,

93
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,460
Qian Jin,

94
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,460
I'm still a little girl.

95
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,460
I've taught her a lesson.

96
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,460
If I touch her finger,

97
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,460
I'm afraid she'll pretend to be a fool.

98
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,460
I hope Lin Si Zhen will be fine.

99
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,460
You want to touch my finger?

100
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,460
I want to touch her finger?

101
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,460
You touch my finger.

102
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,460
Try it.

103
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,460
You touch my finger.

104
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,460
Try it.

105
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,460
You touch my finger.

106
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,460
You...

107
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,460
Master.

108
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,460
Master.

109
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,460
This Li Si Jun

110
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,460
sneaked into my house

111
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,460
and forced my daughter to do the exam.

112
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,460
I'm not a fool.

113
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,460
Today,

114
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,460
I have to give my father

115
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,460
a way to explain.

116
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,460
How can I tell him?

117
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,460
I didn't expect this.

118
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,460
What should I do now?

119
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,460
I think Lin Si Zhen misunderstood.

120
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,460
Yesterday, Princess Liu Yun was poisoned.

121
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,460
You were innocent and had a fever.

122
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,460
I was just concerned about going to visit her.

123
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,460
Master.

124
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,460
I'm not good at handling things.

125
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,460
Please punish me.

126
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,460
If Li Si Jun

127
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,460
really went to investigate

128
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,460
Princess Lin,

129
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,460
he shouldn't have been punished.

130
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,460
Princess Liu Yun

131
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,460
was poisoned

132
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,460
under the influence of the public.

133
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,460
Are you going to let this drunk

134
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,460
or not?

135
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,460
There were many people that day.

136
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,460
What evidence do you have

137
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,460
to prove my daughter is the culprit?

138
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,460
But this Beiyue City

139
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,460
has been doing a lot of things.

140
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,460
Master.

141
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,460
I just received a secret report from the border army.

142
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,460
Beiyue City

143
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,460
is in a hurry to

144
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,460
attack the army in the border.

145
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,460
I'm afraid

146
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,460
it's a fake news

147
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,460
that Li Si Jun

148
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,460
is going to be punished.

149
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,460
Princess Liu Yun

150
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,460
is the bloodline in the people's hearts.

151
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,460
If you don't give me an answer,

152
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,460
I will not return.

153
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,460
How dare you!

154
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,460
Master.

155
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,460
Please accept my blessing.

156
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,460
Let me lead the army to the border.

157
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,460
The border army is in chaos.

158
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,460
Give me an answer.

159
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,460
Li Yan.

160
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,460
Think of a way to do it.

161
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,460
What should we do?

162
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,460
Well...

163
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,460
All right.

164
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,460
The first side

165
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,460
is a friend of mine.

166
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,460
The second side

167
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,460
is a member of my family.

168
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,460
I really don't want to see you two

169
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,460
hurt each other.

170
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,460
As for Princess Liu Yun's case,

171
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,460
I...

172
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,460
Master.

173
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,460
Li Yan wants to investigate the truth.

174
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,460
Find out the truth.

175
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,460
Return the evidence.

176
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,460
Brother Li.

177
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,460
The evidence is given to Li Si Zheng

178
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,460
and the person who has the evidence.

179
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,460
Master.

180
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,460
Li Yan.

181
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,060
Li Yan is my

182
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,460
Deputy Minister of the City.

183
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,460
As a person who is not qualified to be the head of the army,

184
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,460
I will give Li Yan the case.

185
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,460
I will take full responsibility.

186
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,460
Yes.

187
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,460
Sister.

188
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,460
Sister.

189
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,460
I have never seen you

190
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,460
in the past.

191
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,460
You have been so cruel.

192
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,460
I hate you.

193
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,460
I hate myself for leaving you.

194
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,460
Sister.

195
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,460
You are a bastard.

196
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,460
Who are you?

197
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,460
Go away.

198
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,460
I don't know you.

199
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,460
I am Wen Wen.

200
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,460
Lu Yiwen.

201
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,460
Lu Yiwen?

202
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,460
I don't know you.

203
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,460
Do you want to kill me?

204
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,460
I will kill you.

205
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,460
Come on.

206
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,460
Li Yan.

207
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,460
You are so cruel.

208
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,460
How dare you

209
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,460
to punish me like this?

210
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,460
Qianqin.

211
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,460
I am here to say goodbye to you.

212
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,460
Even if I die,

213
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,460
I will avenge you.

214
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,460
Wait.

215
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,460
You have chosen to leave?

216
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,460
No.

217
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,460
I just want to say

218
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,460
you kill me.

219
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,460
Don't take me with you.

220
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,460
I have chosen to leave.

221
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,460
Just leave.

222
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,460
I am not your brother.

223
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,460
I will fight it out with you.

224
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,460
Let's go.

225
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,460
I will kill you.

226
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,460
I will kill you.

227
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,460
I have chosen to leave.

228
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,460
You can't kill me.

229
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,460
I will kill you.

230
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,460
You can't kill me.

231
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,460
I will kill you.

232
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,460
You can't kill me.

233
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,460
But I know you.

234
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,460
That's the only person

235
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,460
who can defeat the world.

236
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,460
But now,

237
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,460
I can't talk about the past.

238
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,460
Li Yan,

239
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,460
it's been more than a year.

240
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,460
Wait, wait, wait.

241
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,460
Kill him,

242
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,460
not the police.

243
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,460
It seems that this person is really good to me.

244
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,460
I need to help the gate now.

245
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,460
You have so many equipment.

246
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,460
I must be good to you.

247
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,460
Just him.

248
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,460
Run,

249
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,460
the little girl is coming.

250
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,460
Go, come over.

251
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,460
You used to be in the city of Liangling,

252
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,460
but the criminal is Jingyang.

253
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,460
No one knows that you are the future chief wife.

254
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,460
So,

255
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,460
everyone sees you,

256
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,460
you will be proud and proud.

257
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,460
The place where you belong,

258
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,460
people can't take it.

259
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,460
They are all on the line of the good and bad.

260
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,460
The wine is wine.

261
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,460
There is a rule that does not call the wine.

262
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,460
Thank you.

263
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,460
As long as the world is full of

264
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,460
the best grapes in the whole city,

265
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,460
the business is great.

266
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,460
I was in Nanling City.

267
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,460
You are so welcome.

268
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,460
Yes.

269
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,460
Yes, you are a thief.

270
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,460
I saw you giving them a silver.

271
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,460
I know

272
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,460
you just don't want me to be sad.

273
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,460
But think about it carefully.

274
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,460
Being a good person,

275
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,460
it's interesting.

276
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,460
If you don't have enough money,

277
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,460
I will take you to another city.

278
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,460
What?

279
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,460
Still playing?

280
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,460
How much money do you want?

281
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,460
This kind of thing is enough to experience it once.

282
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,460
Don't harm the people.

283
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,460
Yes.

284
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,460
Besides,

285
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,460
it's not like that.

286
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,460
Yes.

287
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,460
You first hit me.

288
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,460
Why are you still making fun of me?

289
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,460
Hit me.

290
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,460
Hit me.

291
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,460
Miss, are you okay?

292
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,460
Don't kill me.

293
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,460
Don't kill me.

294
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,460
Don't kill me.

295
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,460
I...

296
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,460
Who is going to kill you?

297
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,460
I just saw you fall.

298
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,460
So...

299
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,460
Help!

300
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,460
Why are you here again?

301
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,460
You are a dead man.

302
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,460
You don't see me every time.

303
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,460
I am Miss Feng Quanlin.

304
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,460
I want to say something

305
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,460
to make you feel better.

306
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,460
Brother,

307
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,460
look.

308
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,460
You are so talented.

309
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,460
You are so...

310
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,460
so positive.

311
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,460
Look at me.

312
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,460
You are so cute.

313
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,460
You are so innocent.

314
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,460
You must be the one who got the wrong person.

315
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,460
I never got the wrong person.

316
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,460
You are so rude.

317
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,460
How dare you ask for money?

318
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,460
I didn't ask for your ID.

319
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,460
You brought it yourself, right?

320
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,460
You are so mean to Hu Chengsi.

321
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,460
Do you know the consequence?

322
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,460
I don't know.

323
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,460
But Qianjin is...

324
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,460
so innocent.

325
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,460
If you are a suspect,

326
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,460
you will be punished.

327
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,460
What suspect?

328
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,460
I don't like this word.

329
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,460
You should take it back.

330
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,460
I am Miss Feng Quanlin.

331
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,460
I want to say something to make you feel better.

332
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,460
What do you mean?

333
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,460
I don't understand what she is saying.

334
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,460
I will say it again.

335
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,460
You should listen to me.

336
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,460
I will find out the evidence

337
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,460
of your poison poisoning Princess Liuyun.

338
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,460
I will let you pay for it.

339
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,460
I will take my leave.

340
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,460
She...

341
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,460
She just said who was poisoned?

342
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,460
Princess Liuyun.

343
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,460
What happened to her?

344
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,460
She was poisoned by a drink.

345
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,460
What about me?

346
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,460
You are a suspect.

347
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,460
I...

348
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,460
I am a suspect.

349
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,460
I am a suspect poisoned by Liuyun.

350
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,460
No.

351
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,460
I...

352
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,460
I am not a suspect.

353
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,460
Don't talk nonsense.

354
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,460
Don't worry, Jingjing.

355
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,460
I will believe you.

356
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,460
I...

357
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,460
But actually,

358
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,460
I am not sure

359
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,460
about the cause.

360
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,460
Who knows

361
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,460
if the poison

362
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,460
was poisoned

363
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,460
before I came here?

364
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,460
What is the cause

365
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,460
of the poison poisoning Princess Liuyun?

366
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,460
If you are going to be drunk,

367
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,460
except for the one who is not drunk,

368
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,460
you will be dead.

369
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,460
What?

370
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,460
I will die.

371
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,460
You will be drunk.
