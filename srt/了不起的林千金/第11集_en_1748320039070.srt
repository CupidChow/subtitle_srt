00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Episode 17

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Your Highness, I have kept the treasure

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
for Miss Lin in the past 70 days.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I won't stay here.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Your Highness.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm so angry.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Why am I dizzy again?

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let me down.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Don't talk. I'll send you back.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Actually, the clue is broken.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I really can't find the real murderer.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I have no time to take the blame for three days.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But you can tell the City Leader

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
that I will obey the agreement.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Even if I take the blame, I'll still be dead.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Actually, after these days' investigation,

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I don't think you're a murderer.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I know.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But I can't take the blame.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Besides, the City Leader hates me so much.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He won't let me go.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
How do you know that City Leader hates you?

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Why did he let you watch me all day?

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He must not want me to be the City Leader's wife.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Maybe I'm the one who's guilty of the punishment.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's what he's looking forward to.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Don't think too much.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Take care of yourself.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Don't worry.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'll help you find a way.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's okay. You can't help me.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's a pity.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I haven't seen this thing well.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Li Si Jun.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What's the matter?

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
City Leader, please.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Li Si Jun.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Thank you for helping me.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm not dizzy anymore.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Put it down.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Are you all right?

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm fine.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll go to see City Leader now.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Miss Lin is unwell.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Send her back.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes, Li Si Jun.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Wait.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I can't keep watch on you.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm quite worried about you.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This token is for you.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's as good as a sword token.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
If you want to bully me,

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
show her this token.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If anything really happens to you,

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll turn the whole city around

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and find you.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Thank you.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You said that.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Although Lin Qian Jin didn't take the risk,

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
her performance was not bad.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
If Lin Qian Jin

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
is really a murderer,

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
she won't be so cruel.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Besides,

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
she won't say

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
that even if she can't find a murderer,

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
she'll still obey the promise.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If she's really a murderer,

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
it's not her.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's not her.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's not her.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's not her.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Who is it again?

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The clue is broken.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I can't be sure.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Li,

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I don't want to make you feel bad.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's been too long

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
since the incident.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Princess Liu Yun hasn't woken up yet.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Every day,

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
every hour in the city,

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
she's putting pressure on me.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Their 100,000 soldiers

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
are on the border.

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If Princess Liu Yun

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
has any three-way Liang Duan,

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm afraid that

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
they'll be in the military.

92
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Li San,

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
you should share the burden for me.

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I know

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
you're under a lot of pressure.

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So,

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I've made a plan for you.

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This method

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
might have made Princess Liu Yun wake up,

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
but it can still catch the real murderer.

101
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
By then,

102
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
you can have an answer to it.

103
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Good brother,

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I knew you'd think of me.

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But,

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I hope you and I

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
can cooperate on this method.

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Of course.

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Let's do it again.

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Come on.

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let's do it again.

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Come on.

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Li Si Jun,

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
your clothes are ready.

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What are you doing?

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I think you look happy

117
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
when you wear this.

118
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So, we want to try it.

119
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Stop laughing.

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You can't be so considerate

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
in the City Leader's Mansion.

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This standard

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
can only be brought by myself.

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You can all take it.

125
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's go.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I've seen this sign.

127
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's like a sign.

128
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's like a sign.

129
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If anyone dares to bully you,

130
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
just show him this sign.

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If something really happens,

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll turn the whole Nanling City

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and find you.

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
In fact, after these days of investigation,

135
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I don't think you're a murderer anymore.

136
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You said you believed me.

137
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Of course, I'm very happy.

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But

139
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
the suspect in Chang Le's case

140
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
was fired.

141
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The suspect's head

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
pointed at me without hesitation.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He found the real murderer's clue

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and was interrupted.

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm afraid

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
he'll find the real murderer.

147
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm afraid

148
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
he'll find the real murderer.

149
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm afraid

150
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
he'll find the real murderer.

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
How can I prove

152
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
my innocence?

153
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I still have three days to go.

154
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Unless God helps me.

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Otherwise, I'll be in danger

156
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
at any time.

157
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Who's that?

158
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Qian Jin.

159
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's me.

160
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Why did you come to my house

161
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
so late?

162
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What for?

163
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Put on your clothes.

164
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll take you to a place.

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So beautiful.

166
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Didn't you say

167
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
you haven't seen the world

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
before yesterday?

169
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Then you

170
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
brought me here

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
to get the soul of the night.

172
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Don't you like it?

173
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I do.

174
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I didn't expect

175
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
you to be so beautiful.

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I didn't expect

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
you to be so good at killing the birds.

178
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You did such a romantic thing.

179
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I...

180
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You two

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
are in love

182
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
to trust each other.

183
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Moreover,

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
you'll do

185
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
many romantic things together.

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Look.

187
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The food is all out.

188
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Situ,

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
do you know

190
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
that

191
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
you'll be with someone

192
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
who likes each other.

193
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So,

194
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
is this Simutong

195
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
confessing to me?

196
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Simutong,

197
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
where are you going?

198
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Why are you still smiling?

199
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You...

200
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Why are you back?

201
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm afraid you can't smile.

202
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Xie, take me to see the sunrise.

203
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm much better now.

204
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I think you're so good at changing.

205
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You're just

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
loving the position of the City Leader.

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
If you let the position of the City Leader

208
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
go,

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
it won't affect you.

210
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You won't be

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
so nervous.

212
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You're right.

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I didn't mean to

214
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
be the City Leader.

215
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I did all this

216
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
to get something.

217
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So,

218
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I mean,

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
my father is a great politician.

220
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
If

221
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
the real brother is me,

222
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I won't be punished.

223
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
After all,

224
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Princess Liuying is not dead.

225
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Right?

226
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So,

227
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
if you don't want

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
the position of the lady,

229
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
what do you want to do?

230
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
If I'm lucky,

231
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'll be with the person

232
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
who likes me.

233
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But,

234
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
if this Mo Rong is a man,

235
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
she'll bite me

236
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and I'll be the murderer.

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
She'll have to kill me.

238
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What else can I do?

239
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Have you thought of

240
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
another way?

241
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
For example,

242
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
cure Princess Liuying.

243
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
After she wakes up,

244
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
we'll ask her

245
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
about the situation.

246
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Maybe we'll know

247
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
who the real brother is.

248
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
This is a good way.

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Move.

250
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Move.

251
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What's going on?

252
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What's going on?

253
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Come here.

254
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What's going on?

255
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's a yellow horse.

256
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Come.

257
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,120
Princess Liuying has become

258
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,500
kg-matured for a month.

259
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,720
Older people searched

260
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,000
for the best doctor to cure her.

261
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,080
Old lady Liuying

262
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,000
found the best doctor

263
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
who can cure her.

264
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,380
Young lady Liuying took her

265
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,500
in because of shiny face.

266
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,800
So großes

267
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,100
many people have been rewarded.

268
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You're responsible for the rest of the city.

269
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Can you do it?

270
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I can.

271
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm a fire-fighter.

272
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I have no other choice.

273
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Right.

274
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Are you okay?

275
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm fine.

276
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm excited.

277
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
This is not fair.

278
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
This is not fair.

279
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Boss.

280
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You're back.

281
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Didn't Lin Zheng come?

282
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
He's sick.

283
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You're here to catch him, right?

284
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What's wrong with him?

285
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He's been very strange lately.

286
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
He's in a bad mood.

287
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He's in a bad mood.

288
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
He's always talking to himself.

289
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
He's always jealous.

290
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I know.

291
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
He's been like this every month.

292
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Every month?

293
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Is he a bad guy?

294
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
No, no.

295
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's a small problem.

296
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But

297
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
he's in a bad mood.

298
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He's sensitive.

299
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You should take good care of him.

300
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I understand.

301
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Let me see.

302
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Here.

303
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Take it.

304
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's a cure.

305
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's a cure.

306
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's a cure?

307
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's a good medicine.

308
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Boss.

309
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Have you prepared the medicine for Mr. Lu?

310
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yes.

311
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Here.

312
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Take it.

313
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Take it on my son.

314
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Okay.

315
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Thank you, boss.

316
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
No need.

317
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Right, boss.

318
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What medicine did the man just now?

319
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
He's got a thousand gold coins.

320
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
A thousand gold coins?

321
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Why does it have my name on it?

322
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You're not a good student.

323
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's a poison cure.

324
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It has nothing to do with you.

325
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Mr. Lu.

326
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Mr. Lu, here's your medicine.

327
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Let me ask you.

328
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Thank you for this.

329
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I didn't expect

330
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
you have a taste.

331
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's because you like it.

332
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
That's why I'm studying it.

333
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm not good at it.

334
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I have a bag on me.

335
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Okay.

336
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Here.

337
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
We should go.

338
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Qianqin.

339
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Li Yan.

340
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Why are you here?

341
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm here to see how your injury is.

342
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I brought you some medicine.

343
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The wind blows through the mountains and the leaves.

344
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The mountains and the trees are bitter.

345
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Who still misses him?

346
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Who has ever loved him?
