00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Story of Xiao Chuo

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Are you like them?

4
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm afraid that you'll disappear sooner.

5
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,000
Because the evil poison has already been in my bones.

6
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,400
I only care about the truth.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm afraid that you'll disappear sooner.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that you'll disappear sooner.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,040
Instructor General!

10
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,360
This miao is really well-เพed.

11
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,120
It was inundated last time.

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,240
Now the money is here.

13
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,720
I also hear that

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,840
the 18 ilij Давайте

15
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,520
franchise specially xichiguku

16
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,720
should be revamped.

17
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,080
I went and bought

18
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,200
it but, I didn't expect that it was too money-che wus.

19
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:35,880
Really?

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,840
Yes.

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,040
I'll take you there.

22
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,960
My Lord.

23
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,120
If I can't have a child this time,

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,720
will you humiliate me

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,920
and sell me to the world?

26
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,320
My Lord, you're right.

27
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,920
My Lord.

28
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,120
Then...

29
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,200
Take the word.

30
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,600
My Lord.

31
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,640
If I can have a child this time,

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,720
I'll risk my life for half of my life.

33
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,760
You're so shameless.

34
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,680
You can't bear this child. You're a bad girl.

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,720
Why don't you think about it?

36
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,680
Is it your own problem?

37
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,240
You're still going to humiliate her?

38
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,560
You're really...

39
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
You're not as good as you were.

40
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,680
You're not as good as you were.

41
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,680
You're not as good as you were.

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,760
Stop beating me.

43
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,960
Actually,

44
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,280
my husband and I used to be very close.

45
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,320
If we had our own child,

46
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,120
he would treat me

47
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,960
just like he did before.

48
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,200
You're such a good girl.

49
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,640
He treats you like this.

50
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,920
You're still trying to protect him.

51
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,600
But it's not a bad thing for him.

52
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,960
As long as you go to the 18th Ministry of Rites,

53
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,520
you can ask for a patrol unit.

54
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,480
Where's the 18th Ministry of Rites?

55
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,760
18th Ministry of Rites.

56
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
It's over there.

57
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,240
Go.

58
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,400
Go.

59
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:05,920
Go.

60
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,680
Go.

61
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,280
Go.

62
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,440
Go.

63
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,320
Go.

64
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:09,760
Go.

65
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,040
Go.

66
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,920
Hurry up.

67
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,760
Hurry up.

68
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,640
What's wrong?

69
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,240
What's wrong?

70
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,840
What's wrong?

71
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
What's wrong?

72
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,680
Hurry up.

73
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,440
Come with me.

74
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,400
There's a enemy here.

75
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,280
Is there any enemy in the enemy?

76
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,160
Enemy.

77
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,440
Father.

78
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,040
I didn't expect the dead wood to be so heavy.

79
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,480
I should have given it to you.

80
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,880
What... What are you doing?

81
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,320
Please forgive me.

82
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,240
What the hell?

83
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,240
I've been here all night

84
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,120
and I've been taking care of you.

85
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,120
I'm tired. I didn't even drink water.

86
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,680
I'm just a water bottle.

87
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,160
Did you...

88
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,480
think...

89
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,360
No.

90
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,280
No.

91
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,720
But I should thank you.

92
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,200
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,360
I hurt you.

94
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,960
You've been taking care of me for so long.

95
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,240
We're clear now.

96
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
What's this?

97
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,080
This?

98
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,280
By the way,

99
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,560
this is the vanilla bean paste I made for you.

100
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,120
You'll be afraid of the bean paste if you wear it.

101
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,600
You can make this?

102
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,320
Of course.

103
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,080
This is my boss's shop.

104
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,200
Boss's shop?

105
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,600
No.

106
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,000
I mean...

107
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,920
You should be thirsty now.

108
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,480
I'll pour you some water.

109
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
Fly away.

110
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,560
Attorney Xiaoxiao.

111
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,040
Hey, my little guest.

112
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,480
Sister,

113
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,680
are they in your home?

114
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,360
I heard they are looking for you.

115
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,120
Why are you looking for them?

116
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,960
Miss,

117
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,800
please excuse me.

118
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,640
Come with me.

119
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,760
I... I'll take the medicine.

120
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
I'll do it myself.

121
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
What?

122
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
You don't like me taking care of you?

123
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,240
The doctor said that you must take the medicine to get a hot drink.

124
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,240
Can't you just let it cool?

125
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,240
What's wrong with that?

126
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
It's a little bitter.

127
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,240
When it's hot, you can't feel it when you close your mouth.

128
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
I love you.

129
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,240
Give it to me.

130
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Thank you.

131
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,240
Li Si Jun will still say thank you to me.

132
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
What a surprise.

133
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,240
If you really want to thank me,

134
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,240
just let me know that you owe me a favor.

135
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
You are really...

136
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,240
Fine. I'm just kidding.

137
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
You should take it seriously every time.

138
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,240
How about this?

139
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,240
You should rest here today.

140
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,240
If you need anything, I'll go out.

141
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
Where are you going?

142
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,240
I have to go to the 18th-century storehouse.

143
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
I've found a good place. I'll go there.

144
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,240
I'll go with you.

145
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,240
But your body...

146
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
Wu Ai, the owner of the storehouse also said

147
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
that I should protect you.

148
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
If something happens to you...

149
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,240
You have to take good care of yourself.

150
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,240
If anything happens to you, I can't take responsibility for it.

151
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
Please take care of them later.

152
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,240
You must be careful.

153
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
Okay.

154
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,240
No problem.

155
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
Come on.

156
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,240
What...

157
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,240
What's going on?

158
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
Miss, we're sorry.

159
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Miss, we're sorry.

160
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,240
They both said that

161
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
they were here to pay you a visit.

162
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
You two, hurry up.

163
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Hurry up.

164
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
It's okay.

165
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
Let's go.

166
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
Listen to me.

167
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,240
Qianqin is so generous to you.

168
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,240
I'm a snake.

169
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,240
Don't be so nice to me.

170
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,240
We don't dare to do what Mr. Lu said.

171
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
Let's go.

172
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
Wenwen, I told you

173
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
I'm not like before.

174
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,240
I won't be cruel to you

175
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
anymore.

176
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Don't be angry.

177
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Okay?

178
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Okay.

179
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,240
I won't be angry.

180
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,240
I won't be angry.

181
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
By the way, we have something important to do.

182
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
We're leaving.

183
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Take me with you.

184
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
You can't take me with you.

185
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,240
It's not convenient for you to take me with you.

186
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
We're leaving.

187
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,240
Bye.

188
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
Let's go.

189
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,240
Let's go.

190
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
Look at this.

191
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,240
It's so pretty.

192
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
It's a tiger.

193
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
It's so pretty.

194
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Don't you have a lover?

195
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
How about buying me a hairpin?

196
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
You two...

197
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
No, we're not.

198
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
That's right.

199
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
It's you.

200
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
You forgot me.

201
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
You're the little girl

202
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,240
who was a ballerina that day.

203
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,240
It's my sister.

204
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,240
I almost forgot.

205
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
You're so nice.

206
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,240
How are you and your husband?

207
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Of course.

208
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
My husband

209
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
is planning to buy me a hairpin.

210
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
Right?

211
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Right?

212
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,240
My husband...

213
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
That's great.

214
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
You two are so nice.

215
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
I believe you'll be lucky soon.

216
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Hurry up.

217
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,240
I'll show you my wife.

218
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Hurry up.

219
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,240
Then you can choose one, my husband.

220
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
Okay.

221
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,240
But I've never worn this.

222
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Then you can wear it.

223
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
Hurry up.

224
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,240
I'll wear it.

225
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,240
Are you going to dress me up

226
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
or give me a hairpin?

227
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
I can't stand your stubbornness.

228
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
I said I wouldn't.

229
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
But I think it's interesting.

230
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Interesting?

231
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
Interesting?

232
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,240
You're so cruel.

233
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
Are you bullying my wife again?

234
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
You said I'm cruel?

235
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,240
Who are you?

236
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,240
Get away.

237
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,240
Get away.

238
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
My wife.

239
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
I'm telling you.

240
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,240
How can you

241
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,240
have to be so mean to this man?

242
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,240
You're so kind.

243
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
I'll introduce you

244
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,240
to the handsome guy next door.

245
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,240
He's more handsome than this man.

246
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
Wait.

247
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,240
I don't need it.

248
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Well,

249
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,240
I'm not mean to him.

250
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,240
Thank you.

251
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
Go and do business.

252
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,240
Thank you.

253
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,240
I suddenly got a good inspiration.

254
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
What inspiration?

255
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,240
Let's go.

256
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
Get out of the way.

257
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,240
Get out of the way.

258
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,240
I'll be back later.

259
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,240
That's the original.

260
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,240
If you make a mistake,

261
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,240
you'll be paid.

262
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
Do you hear me?

263
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,240
Every time, you're being rude.

264
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
Young Madam Zhao,

265
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,240
come and see what you want.

266
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,240
You can have anything.

267
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Yes.

268
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,240
Madam,

269
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,240
we've come out of the south.

270
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,240
What do you like?

271
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
Do you like to buy it?

272
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,240
Okay.

273
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,240
I'll just

274
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,240
stop talking.

275
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,240
We'll buy some Yehaitang.

276
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
Yehaitang?

277
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
Well,

278
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,240
this is not for fun.

279
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,240
With our current conditions,

280
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,240
we can still play.

281
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
Right, Young Master?

282
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,240
Do you mean Madam An?

283
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
No, I mean...

284
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,240
No, you didn't say that.

285
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
If you didn't,

286
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,240
we'd have changed the place.

287
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,240
I heard

288
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
there's a place called 80-Li Poo.

289
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
Yehaitang is also sold.

290
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,240
You don't have to say.

291
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,240
No,

292
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,240
I mean

293
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,240
the whole south city of Fangnian

294
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
has Yehaitang

295
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,240
except for 18-Li Poo.

296
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,240
There's no place else.

297
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,240
Is there anything special?

298
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,240
Why is there only your family

299
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
who can sell it?

300
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
You don't get it, do you?

301
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,240
Yehaitang's flower petals

302
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
are black and purple.

303
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,240
It's called Black Gold in the industry.

304
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
It can be scattered

305
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,240
in a small box.

306
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
Miss Guan

307
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,240
often uses it as a spice.

308
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
It's so wonderful.

309
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,240
Once it's in the corner,

310
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,240
it becomes so delicious.

311
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,240
It can produce a huge amount of poison.

312
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
I'm sure

313
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
it'll kill

314
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,240
the person who drank it.

315
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,240
Boss,

316
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,240
how do I know

317
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
if it's true?

318
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,240
If it's really poisonous,

319
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
why would someone buy it?

320
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,240
I see.

321
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,240
Someone really bought it.

322
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,240
And it's not low price.

323
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,240
Of course.

324
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
I always buy one.

325
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
I'll keep an eye on it.

326
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,240
When they buy it,

327
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,240
they just

328
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,240
put it in the box.

329
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
I don't believe it.

330
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
I haven't seen it in a long time.

331
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,240
How do we know

332
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,240
if it's true or not?

333
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
Right?

334
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
I don't believe it.

335
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,240
I'll show you.

336
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
I'll massage it.

337
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,240
Boss,

338
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,240
what's this?

339
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
It's a large-scale tea.

340
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
What about this?

341
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
It's a lotus root.

342
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
It's a flower.

343
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
You do it.

344
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Yes.

345
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,240
I'm done.

346
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,240
I'm done.
