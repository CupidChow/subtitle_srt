1
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,820
Sword Master

2
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,100
Episode 7

3
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,280
So lousy.

4
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,280
A family layer of clams.

5
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,640
I'll cut out half the Yuri,

6
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,400
and the other half cut theたkas.

7
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
Why is there no Cutlet?

8
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,480
I'll eat it later.

9
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:17,700
Be ilas with

10
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,900
It's expensive.

11
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:19,820
Boss Bai,

12
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,420
how do we know that you are a real family?

13
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,420
What if you are like other movies

14
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,980
and you are deceiving us?

15
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,420
I have evidence here.

16
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,220
Wait.

17
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,420
This is the money from Chen family.

18
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,220
This is from the Zhang family.

19
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,540
теперь nàoல explores the world by myself.

20
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,260
I did much more

21
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,260
than the Ninth Fe palm which Princess Chang Le

22
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,420
published.

23
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,860
I was not afraid of what her brother said.

24
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,980
I kill so many liang confusing and ridiculous things

25
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,460
in connection with her natural killed insane people.

26
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,700
What's all this?

27
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,580
We need to dig here.

28
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:07,860
You can drink it.

29
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:08,780
All right.

30
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,500
Don't worry.

31
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,500
Of course.

32
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
What if he just wants you to buy the perfume

33
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,500
and find a person who has changed his identity?

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,500
No way.

35
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Boss said it so secretly.

36
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500
If he really changed his identity,

37
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,500
then we all know that

38
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Chang Le's and Xiang Er's identities are real, right?

39
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,500
If I say, why do you always treat me like that?

40
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,500
You don't want me to be innocent.

41
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
What do you want?

42
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Say something.

43
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,500
It's a matter of opinion.

44
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Don't think too much.

45
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,500
It's a matter of opinion, right?

46
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
Then I'll tell you.

47
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,500
First of all,

48
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Boss doesn't know me at all.

49
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
There's no name for Lin Er on the account.

50
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Secondly,

51
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
that is what I just said.

52
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,500
Chang Le and Lin Er's identities are the main thing.

53
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I don't have any secret motive.

54
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Chang Le likes you.

55
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
You like Liu Yun.

56
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
So Chang Le wants to kill Liu Yun.

57
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
It's a good idea to make a deal.

58
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
The bottom of the line is the worst.

59
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
You're a big fool.

60
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
How is it?

61
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
I said it, right?

62
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,500
If you don't believe me,

63
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,500
you can ask Chang Le.

64
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
Anyway, he likes you.

65
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
So magical.

66
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
I didn't die.

67
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
It seems that I didn't pay attention to the poison of the sea.

68
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
Why are you laughing?

69
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Don't you hate me a lot?

70
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
I never said I hate you.

71
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
You always wanted me to hate you.

72
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
But you hate me

73
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,500
because you're the one who performed.

74
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,500
I'm not going to marry you.

75
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,500
Come down.

76
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,500
No, no, no.

77
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
I hate you.

78
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
I hate you.

79
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
I hate you.

80
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Why are you still not back?

81
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Where have they gone?

82
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Why do you want Brother Li Yan to come with you?

83
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
There are so many people in the house.

84
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Are you going to waste me?

85
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Be quiet.

86
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
It's not good for Li Si Zheng to hear it.

87
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Sorry.

88
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Lin Qian Ji.

89
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Come down with me.

90
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
I won't come down.

91
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Why are you taking me in?

92
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,300
No, no, no, don't!

93
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
Beثink me.

94
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Don't hurt me!

95
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Earlier, Brother Li Yan pointed at it!

96
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
It was difficult.

97
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Let go of my hands!

98
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
I scared…

99
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
You scared me.

100
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
Are you really okay?

101
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
I'm fine.

102
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,340
I don't think so.

103
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,220
Okay, okay.

104
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,380
Li Yan likes to watch the show the most.

105
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,420
Right, Li Yan?

106
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,380
Look at her expression.

107
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,260
She agreed to watch the show with you.

108
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,540
The real case.

109
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,940
Miss Lin is right.

110
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,700
My lady,

111
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,220
let's go to the show together.

112
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,340
Li Yan,

113
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,540
we agreed to watch the show.

114
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,940
We don't want to be late.

115
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,060
Jin Jin.

116
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,660
It's the show tonight.

117
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,980
Let's go to the show together.

118
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,340
Okay.

119
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,700
I like to have fun the most.

120
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,540
Let's go.

121
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,540
It's so beautiful.

122
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,940
Don't play around.

123
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,260
You need to hurry up.

124
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,380
You're so quick-witted.

125
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,740
Wen Wen,

126
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,140
let's go to the front.

127
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,100
Let's go.

128
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,260
Let's go.

129
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,780
I've never seen a girl like Lin Qian Jin.

130
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,700
She's so funny.

131
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,060
It's cotton candy.

132
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:25,980
Li Yan,

133
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,180
let's go there and have a look.

134
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,260
There's cotton candy too.

135
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,220
Li Yan,

136
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,660
which one is better?

137
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,620
Both.

138
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,340
What a stupid head.

139
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,700
They're all questions.

140
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,980
Come on.

141
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,860
Come here.

142
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,260
Are you still not fed?

143
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,860
Not yet.

144
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,140
I'm so jealous.

145
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,220
Here,

146
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,220
give this to her.

147
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,820
Give this to Chang Le.

148
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,260
I'm leaving.

149
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,780
Li Yan,

150
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,500
did you buy this for me?

151
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:21,940
Yes.

152
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,100
Thank you, Li Yan.

153
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,820
Chang Le,

154
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,780
you smell so good today.

155
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,620
Li Yan,

156
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,940
you smell this?

157
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,100
Is it special?

158
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,700
I bought it from Shiba Li Po

159
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,580
on the second floor.

160
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,860
Shiba Li Po?

161
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,460
Yes.

162
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,860
There are many strange drugs in it.

163
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,820
Li Yan,

164
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,820
do you need anything?

165
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,340
I can ask you.

166
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,540
Why is it so special?

167
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,700
What's inside?

168
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,180
Nothing special.

169
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,620
It's just some ordinary spices.

170
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,140
Chang Le.

171
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,540
Ask her.

172
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:11,700
Let's go.

173
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,500
Li Yan.

174
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,180
I'm Wen Wen.

175
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,180
Why are you

176
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,620
hiding Li Yan's head?

177
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,860
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,020
I've been

179
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,020
investigating with this model.

180
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,020
I've been so confused.

181
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,220
How's your investigation?

182
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,580
No problem.

183
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,900
I have nothing to do with Lin Qian Jin.

184
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,620
I'll share it tomorrow.

185
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,100
So,

186
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,300
who did you find?

187
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,020
Not yet.

188
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,940
But I'll find out soon.

189
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,540
You didn't hide anything from me.

190
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,540
Since I met Li Yan,

191
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,260
we've been hiding things.

192
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,260
I'll tell you

193
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,900

But it's too serious.

195
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,100
I don't want to drag you in.

196
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,900

197
00:08:59,420 --> 00:08:59,980

Good.

219
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,620
Let you accompany me to the silence of the five-second silence

220
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,620
Look at you, where are you hiding?

221
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,620
Come out and see me, I'm angry

222
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,620
You know, don't be happy

223
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,620
Tell me in your heart, what are you thinking?

224
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,620
By the way, how is Cheng Liao's situation?

225
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,620
It's a little bad

226
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,620
Du Qing told you to buy cotton candy, why is it still a little bad?

227
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,620
Really

228
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,620

00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,620
Let's go

233
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,620

237
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,820
I can't control myself

238
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,020
I'm afraid I can't control myself

239
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,020
I'm afraid I can't control myself

240
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,420
I'm afraid I can't control myself

241
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,020
I'm afraid I can't control myself

242
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,420
What kind of new Qi Wanyang is this?

243
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,820
Don't touch it

244
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,620
Be careful

245
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,820

246
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,820

247
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,620
This is not new Qi Wanyang

248
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,220
What's wrong with the belly?

249
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,220

We have that.

268
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,880
Learning tiredness and playing with the art is something

00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,420
of more important than 4000 years.

270

Parody's health is the richest thing in long wait.

273
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,960

It's time to say goodbye

291
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,640
