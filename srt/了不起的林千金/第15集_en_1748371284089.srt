00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Legend of Chusen

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Give it to me.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What are you doing?

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Your wound must be treated.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The herbs are not enough. Don't waste it.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Don't move.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The herbs are not enough.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I can pick them up.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If your wound is infected,

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
who will take care of it?

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll take care of it.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Don't move.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Does it hurt?

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I...

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm fine.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Don't move.

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Your Highness,

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
everything is not right.

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Here comes the City Leader.

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Welcome, City Leader.

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You just recovered.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You don't look better.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You don't need to be so polite.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Thank you for your concern.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
After the doctor's careful care,

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
my body is already fine.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't be so careless.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You still need to recuperate.

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Thank you for your concern.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I heard that you woke up recently

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and brought some milk tea from your hometown

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
from the north.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Please have a taste.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Thank you for your concern.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Please, City Leader.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I came from the north.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm the first child of the 36th tribe of the north.

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But I didn't know

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
that I was infected with a bad body.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I've recovered now.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The 36th tribe of the north

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
hopes that the north and the south

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
can be treated with care and care.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Even Father said

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
that he hopes that

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I can be a good son to you.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I hope

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
you can hear the good news

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
that I'm back home soon.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's so delicious.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Chief Steward Hong, try it.

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Your Highness,

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
you just recovered.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The doctor told me

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
that you need to recuperate.

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
At this time,

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I really don't want you to suffer

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
from the fatigue

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
after all the hard work.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I hope

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
you can recover after your recovery.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
How about it?

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Of course,

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
the City Leader's arrangement is the best.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But you just got promoted.

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You're busy with work.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I feel sorry for you.

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I hope

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I can take care of you in person.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I hope you can do it.

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's my honor

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
that you care about me.

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Li Yan.

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Li Yan.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Where did he go?

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Li Yan.

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Where did you go?

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Li Yan.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Don't come over.

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Don't come over.

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't come over.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Don't come over.

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't come over.

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Don't come over.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's me.

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I've driven away the snake.

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Where did you go?

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I went to pick up the medicine.

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Look.

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You're injured.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You're running around.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't make me worry.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I...

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm back.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Don't ever leave me again.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay?

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
God bless me.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I swear

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'll never leave Lin Qianjin again.

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'll protect her forever.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Then...

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You'll be the City Leader's wife.

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Thank you.

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Young people nowadays

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
are so good at making things up.

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
They're still sleeping

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
in such a big cave like mine.

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I guess you're running away

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
from the Valley of Lovers.

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Senior.

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We were hunted down by our enemies.

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We fell to this place.

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We're in trouble.

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But when we're recovered,

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
we'll leave on our own.

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You can call me Dali.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The cave is really simple.

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I happen to have a grassland house.

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If you don't mind,

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
you can stay there for the time being.

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
stay here for the next two days.

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'll get you some clothes.

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay.

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Only one bed?

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You can go to sleep.

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'll clean up.

131
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You can continue.

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You can continue.

133
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll go to the large cave.

134
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Are you a girl or should I go?

135
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
No.

136
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You're hurt.

137
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'll go instead.

138
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The Palace of Eternal Love

139
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Episode 10

140
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
These days,

141
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Princess Liu Yun comes here every day.

142
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You seem to be in a better mood.

143
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes.

144
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Princess Liu Yun

145
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
makes you food

146
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
in different ways every day.

147
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The servants said

148
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
you're beautiful.

149
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It seems that

150
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
you'll be the City Master's wife

151
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
soon.

152
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Soldiers from the borders of the two cities

153
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
heard that I was going to be the City Master's wife

154
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
when I woke up.

155
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
They said that

156
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
the two cities are one family.

157
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
They're willing to serve you.

158
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Princess Liu Yun,

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
you may have entered Nanling City

160
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
without knowing the rules of Nanling City.

161
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You can't forget the politics

162
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
if you're afraid of the future.

163
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes, City Master.

164
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm sorry for my rudeness.

165
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Come on, have a try.

166
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I only care about you

167
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and want to share your burden.

168
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I chose the best sedan in the city.

169
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
After several trials,

170
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I chose the best one.

171
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I want to be the perfect wife

172
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
for you.

173
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Good.

174
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Leave the wedding dress

175
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
to Princess Liu Yun.

176
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yes.

177
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
City Master.

178
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
City Master.

179
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
City Master.

180
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
City Master.

181
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Here.

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Greetings, Princess Liu Yun.

183
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Did you find her?

184
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yes.

185
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Go on.

186
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Have some.

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Why are you looking at me?

188
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm enjoying your beautiful sleeping pose.

189
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Is that so?

190
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Did you make all these?

191
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Did you make these?

192
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
These are

193
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
my life-saving gifts for you.

194
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Are you sure

195
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
that you're doing this

196
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
to please your lover?

197
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Here.

198
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Not bad.

199
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Try this.

200
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Put it here.

201
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Good.

202
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The light is shining on the phoenix.

203
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It covers your face.

204
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
May the sound of the flute be heard like the sound of the sand.

205
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The sound of the flute is like the sound of the phoenix.

206
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The sound of the flute is like the sound of the phoenix.

207
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Lin Qian Jin.

208
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I used to think that you were

209
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
a vicious crazy girl.

210
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I even suspected that

211
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
you were the murderer.

212
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The light is shining on the phoenix.

213
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It covers your face.

214
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
May the sound of the flute be heard like the sound of the sand.

215
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The sound of the flute is like the sound of the phoenix.

216
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The sky is dark and the moon is bright.

217
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The deep blue candlelight is bright.

218
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Who is still thinking of her as the flowers bloom?

219
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Who has ever made love for her?

220
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The End
