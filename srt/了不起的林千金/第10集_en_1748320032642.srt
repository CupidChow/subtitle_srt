00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The End

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Didn't you say that you'll give me your hand?

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You...

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You want to eat my hand?

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I...

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The wound is not that bad.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's very sensitive.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's nothing.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's just a little bit of skin injury.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's nothing.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm still holding on to the old flower.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The heart is full of pain and the heart is full of sand.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm still thinking of the past.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You're still talking about me?

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You're still bleeding from your own wounds.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm fine.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Come here.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll do it myself.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Don't move. I'll do it for you.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'll do it gently.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's fine.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The world is like a flower, who still misses it?

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Who has ever taken the flower for it?

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What's this?

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's my hometown.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If I put my painting on the bandage,

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
it would represent a beautiful and comfortable home.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Your hometown?

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I mean my mother's hometown.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So, that's different from Nanling?

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Of course.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
People are different.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
They are in love.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
They want to attract each other.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
They will do a lot of romantic things.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Romantic?

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Romantic is

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
to go to the beach with your lover.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We will dance together in the summer.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We will swim in the city.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's autumn.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We will go to the top of the mountain to see the sunrise.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
By the way,

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
the most important thing is winter.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
On that day of snow,

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
we must drink some water.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We will go to the beach together.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We will drink some water.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We are going to sleep now.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The mountain is full of flowers.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The mountain is full of leaves.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The mountain is full of flowers.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Who will still miss it?

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Who will ever

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
take the flowers?

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yes.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Hold on.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The bell is ringing.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What?

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You made this.

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What?

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So stubborn.

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I don't like it.

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You...

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You are so stupid.

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You...

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What are you doing?

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I just want to know

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
what you usually do.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You are so unreasonable.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
How can I be unreasonable?

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You don't care about me?

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You don't care about me?

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You said

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
you are not unreasonable.

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You dare to talk to me like that.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You are the first one.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Fine.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I am here.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Listen to what you said.

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
See how you understand this woman.

85
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I understand this woman.

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The woman you know

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
is so miserable.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Unlucky?

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes.

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Didn't the chief say anything?

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The woman

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
should be humble.

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
She should be humble and kind.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
At least,

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
she should be more diligent

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and can work hard all day long.

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No matter what,

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
she should take care of herself.

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
She should be less

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
when she is busy.

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
She should be

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
more diligent

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
when she is busy.

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You know

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
this is so despicable.

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If you say

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
the woman is humble

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and kind,

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
how can she be humble?

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I think

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
men and women

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
should be equal.

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We all have the right

114
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
to pursue our dreams.

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Everyone should have

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
their own hobby.

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Why do you have to

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
be a man every day?

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You are so despicable.

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You are so despicable.

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You should do what you want.

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Li Yan is right.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You are indeed

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
a good man.

125
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So, you are pursuing

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
the woman

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
who is my chief.

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's not for the honor.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I am also

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
doing this

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
to prove

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
that I am a good man

133
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and I am a good man.

134
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Do you think

135
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I am that kind?

136
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Lin Qianjian

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
is quite interesting.

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I will take you back.

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Just take it as

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
a gift for you

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and a painting of Tu An.

142
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's a small matter.

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I will go back myself.

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Miss Lin.

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Miss Lin.

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Please come in.

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The End

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's so bitter.

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I will buy you

150
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
soup after this.

151
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Come on.

152
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I will take a sip.

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Qianjian.

154
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Are you all right?

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No.

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I am fine.

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I am not worried about Li Sijun.

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I will take care of

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
your health.

160
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Jingjing, how are you?

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Did you faint?

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
How do you know?

163
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What are you doing?

164
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Don't move.

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The pulse is not stable.

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Wenwen.

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
How do you know everything?

168
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I know everything.

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I know everything.

170
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You know everything?

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Wenwen, if you don't know Jingjing,

172
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
how can you help her

173
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
become the owner?

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Do you think so?

175
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I will take care of

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
the cooking in the future.

177
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I will go to the kitchen

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and have a look at the familiar environment.

179
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Thank you, Wenwen.

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
How is the medicine?

181
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Much better.

182
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Then you should

183
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
have a good rest today.

184
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
No.

185
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What are you doing?

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I have to get up quickly.

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
From yesterday to today,

188
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I have wasted a day.

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I have to take a long time.

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Lin Qianjian, come out with me.

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Li Yan.

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Why do you take care of this woman?

193
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You are so full of yourself.

194
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You even learned

195
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
how to behave yourself.

196
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Then you should go to my place

197
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and thank me for your help.

198
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Did you say hello to me?

199
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You are a coward.

200
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Me?

201
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You are the coward.

202
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Changle, come.

203
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Changle, tell me the truth.

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Do you have a secret secret?

205
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I...

206
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Changle,

207
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
you must tell the truth.

208
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You must tell the truth.

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This is the life of Princess Liuyun.

210
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Li Yan.

211
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I have Yehaitang.

212
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But I am here to

213
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
make the honey of the sea.

214
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I am here to protect you.

215
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't want you to go back to my mansion.

216
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I heard that Yehaitang

217
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
can be a good protective product.

218
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It can be used to make honey.

219
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Princess, you asked me to buy

220
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
a couple of Yehaitang.

221
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
They are all here.

222
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Didn't you say

223
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
you want to be the honey of the sea?

224
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The honey of the sea is complicated.

225
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I haven't learned it yet.

226
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I am afraid that it will be a mess.

227
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I haven't used it yet.

228
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
How can I be sure?

229
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Is this the place?

230
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Xiang'er, wait here.

231
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Seven thousand?

232
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Three thousand is not enough.

233
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Three thousand is not enough?

234
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Didn't you say that you didn't make the honey of the sea?

235
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It seems that

236
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
it's the honey of the sea.

237
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Princess, is that so?

238
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I didn't.

239
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Li Yan,

240
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
you don't believe me.

241
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Tell me.

242
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What did you take

243
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
for three thousand?

244
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I...

245
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Look.

246
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Can't you tell?

247
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You are a princess.

248
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You are a princess.

249
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Since you are a poison-dead dragon,

250
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
you still want to give me the letter of love?

251
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Let's go.

252
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Go see the princess.

253
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I want to see what she says.

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I didn't think of it.

255
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Princess, Miss Lin,

256
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Li Si Jun, I remember it.

257
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What are you doing, Xiang'er?

258
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Wait a minute.

259
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Look.

260
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Just a second.

261
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What's going on?

262
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Princess, I'm sorry.

263
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I almost forgot

264
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
that I forgot

265
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
the three thousand is the honey of the sea

266
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
in the princess's chamber.

267
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
All right, Xiang'er.

268
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Lin Qian Jin,

269
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I suspect that

270
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
you are the murderer

271
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
who poisoned Princess Liu Yun.

272
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You just got drunk

273
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
so quickly.

274
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I think you are

275
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
trying to find a scapegoat

276
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
to help you get rid of the sin.

277
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yes.

278
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I...

279
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm not.

280
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You didn't even wash your clothes.

281
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You still want to pull me down?

282
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
No.

283
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Brother Li Yan,

284
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
did you see that?

285
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The woman who poisoned her

286
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
was so fast to get away.

287
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I don't want to stay with her for a moment.

288
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Xiang'er, let go of me.

289
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Miss Lin, please.

290
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Brother Li Yan,

291
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I've ordered

292
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
to prepare some good food for you.

293
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Just eat with me.

294
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Miss Lin, what's wrong?

295
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Wait.

296
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Don't fall here.

297
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Brother Li Yan.

298
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Miss Lin.

299
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Miss Lin.

300
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The master ordered me

301
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
to protect Miss Lin.

302
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I won't stay, princess.

303
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm done.

304
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm so angry.

305
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I miss her.

306
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Who has ever

307
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
taken away the love for her?

308
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
