00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
My Girlfriend is an Alien

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Long Ballad

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If I'm not wrong,

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
the killer sent by the Love Valley and the Dragon Temple that day,

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
was arranged by you, right?

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This is even more ungrateful.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I didn't harm Lin Qian Jin,

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
let alone send someone to kill you.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I was in a coma for a while,

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
the doctors could prove it.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Moreover,

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
when I woke up,

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I heard Lin Qian Jin suffered so much,

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I was also very sad.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Really?

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Princess Liu Yun,

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
you're lying.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This tears can't stop you,

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
you're not blushing.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay, I admire you.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Guards,

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
bring her here.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yes.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Ying Xue,

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
you...

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Li Si Jun,

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
what crime did Ying Xue commit?

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You have to treat her like this.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Princess Liu Yun,

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm afraid you know better than me

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
what crime Ying Xue committed.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Li Si Jun.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Li Yan,

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
you're usually very cold.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I didn't expect you to be so well-dressed.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes,

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
you're right.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Poisoning the Love Valley,

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
assassinating the Dragon Temple,

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
this is already a crime.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm afraid you can't be punished.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm afraid you can't be punished.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm afraid you can't be punished.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm afraid you can't be punished.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm afraid you can't be punished.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I arranged all of this.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But what can I do?

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The gold has been cut off.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
As long as you die,

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
no one will know that I did all of this.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Princess Liu Yun,

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
what is this?

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Princess Liu Yun,

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
do you think your tricks are very smart?

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Li Yan

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
has already told me the truth.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm not lying.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
When I was in the Love Valley,

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I already sent a letter to the City Leader.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You are the mastermind behind this whole thing.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We did this

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
to let you relax your mind.

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We let you think that Lin Qian Jin will die without a doubt.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We let you go to hide the poison.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
In the end, you revealed your tricks.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
City Leader,

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
City Leader,

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm just a ghost star.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I saw you being so nice to Lin Qian Jin.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm afraid,

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm afraid that he really took you away.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That's why I did this, City Leader.

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is not an excuse for you to hide the poison and kill people.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
City Leader of North Moon,

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
don't you want us to have an explanation?

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Go back

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and give her an explanation.

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Come on,

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
take Liu Yun back to North Moon.

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes.

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Lin Qian Jin will die with me anyway.

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm going to die too.

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Aren't you dead?

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Oh,

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I forgot to tell you.

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The evidence of Lin Si Zheng and North Moon's collusion

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
and the prison's prison cell's prison

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
were actually arranged by City Leader.

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Lin Qian Jin and Lin Si Zheng

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
have been acquitted for a long time.

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Good.

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're scheming.

94
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You think you can beat me like this?

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Just wait and see.

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Who is it?

128
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Qian Jin,

129
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
it's me.

130
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Leave.

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't want to see you.

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Are you annoying?

133
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I said I don't want to see you.

134
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I won't see you even if you knock on the door.

135
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,840
Li Yan,

136
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,240
you really left?

137
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,280
Who told you to leave?

138
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,720
Qian Jin, I didn't leave.

139
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,720
I was afraid that you would get angry and get sick.

140
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,480
I will stay here with you.

141
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,640
Qian Jin,

142
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,160
you saw it in the hall.

143
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,080
If Liu Ying hadn't turned herself in,

144
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,160
I wouldn't have been able to see you.

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,920
We really can't do anything about it.

146
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,120
We set up this trap

147
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,920
so that you and your father

148
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,840
would suffer for Liu Ying.

149
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,440
But I can't tell you.

150
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,600
You know that every time I see you suffer,

151
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,760
my heart

152
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,720
is like a knife.

153
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,360
Get up!

154
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,480
Beat him!

155
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,320
Beat him!

156
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,040
Beat him!

157
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,640
Beat him!

158
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,360
Beat him!

159
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,080
Li Si Jun,

160
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
according to your instructions,

161
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,160
we have bought

162
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,440
all the eggs and vegetables

163
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,400
in the street.

164
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,360
But what about these eggs and vegetables?

165
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,040
Give them back!

166
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,720
Don't be angry.

167
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,520
Don't be angry.

168
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,640
Don't be angry.

169
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
If anything happens to you,

170
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,320
I will take you to the police.

171
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,320
Yes.

172
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,120
You are here.

173
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,320
Why didn't you save me?

174
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,360
You locked me up

175
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,880
in the house full of rats.

176
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,400
I...

177
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,440
Do you know how scared I was?

178
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,800
I couldn't even eat enough.

179
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,200
I was already hungry.

180
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,840
I said...

181
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,000
What I hate the most is

182
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
that you even came to the prison

183
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,840
and told me those hurtful words.

184
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,360
Do you know how sad I was crying?

185
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,000
Tell me clearly.

186
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,720
Did you see me being beaten by others?

187
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,800
You don't feel sorry for me at all.

188
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,000
Those eggs and vegetables...

189
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Don't say that.

190
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,480
It's okay if you don't say that.

191
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,040
I'm more angry when you say that.

192
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,120
Look at yourself.

193
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,360
Those boys

194
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,440
do something romantic

195
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,560
to the people they like.

196
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
But you

197
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,280
bought eggs and vegetables.

198
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,320
They threw them away.

199
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,880
You threw them away with your shoes.

200
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,880
Do you know how painful I was?

201
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,680
I know.

202
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,720
You didn't beat me.

203
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,920
Of course you don't know.

204
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,360
Don't be angry.

205
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,680
I'm not sad, right?

206
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,360
You are so naive.

207
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,160
Let me tell you.

208
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,520
Don't think that you can make up for

209
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,840
your mistakes by helping me clear my name.

210
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,320
I remember everything

211
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,080
you said.

212
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,960
I didn't.

213
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,720
You didn't.

214
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,680
Let me tell you.

215
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
We're over.

216
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,920
I don't want to see you anymore.

217
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,080
From now on,

218
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,520
we'll be cut off

219
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
and...

220
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,960
Episode 15

221
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
Since Liu Yun was taken back to Beiyue,

222
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,760
the Beiyue army has gathered

223
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,520
and invaded our border.

224
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,600
What do you think?

225
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,440
Those bandits from Beiyue.

226
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,960
I planned to send a general

227
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,240
to send 200,000 elite soldiers

228
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
to fight them.

229
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,920
Please think twice.

230
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,440
The army hasn't been moved yet.

231
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,520
The food and grass are still fresh.

232
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,720
But the plague in the city this year.

233
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,520
The treasury is good.

234
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,320
If we want to ensure

235
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,200
the supply of food and grass

236
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,240
will increase the supply of water.

237
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,160
But the plague this year

238
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,800
can't let the people

239
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,840
take over the water.

240
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,000
What you said

241
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,120
is a problem that I'm confused about.

242
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,800
Actually, I have an idea.

243
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,000
In the Valley of the Lovers,

244
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,200
the Great God of Wealth once mentioned

245
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,560
that the little yellow flowers in the story

246
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,760
can dissipate the heat

247
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,320
and detoxify the poison.

248
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,760
Combine it with other drugs

249
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,120
and put it in the well.

250
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,080
Then you can cure the plague quickly.

251
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,440
Have you heard about it?

252
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,760
This time, the plague was solved by Hu Qianjun.

253
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,840
I didn't expect that the little yellow flower

254
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,560
has already done this test.

255
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,320
We have to thank him.

256
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,560
The plague is over.

257
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,040
It's over.

258
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,280
Miss, you are really amazing.

259
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,480
The plague in the city

260
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,480
has been cured by you.

261
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,680
Xiao Yan.

262
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,360
Today is really the most

263
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:06,960
exciting day in Nanming City

264
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,960
since the plague.

265
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,800
I heard that the City Master

266
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,480
has done this

267
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,800
to the young lady.

268
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,760
I can't even speak.

269
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,400
Fresh juice.

270
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,800
Come and have a taste.

271
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,280
It's been a long time

272
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,360
since I've seen such a lively scene.

273
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,680
It's getting dark.

274
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,080
But the people in the city

275
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,960
are still coming out to sell goods

276
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,160
and look at the military supply in Nanming.

277
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,280
Miss, you are really amazing.

278
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,720
I'm going to be a gold digger.

279
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,480
I'll definitely win.

280
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,200
But Miss,

281
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,760
we are now

282
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,240
at the bottom of the store.

283
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,280
What?

284
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,440
Hurry up and sell them.

285
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,040
The gold digger is going to sell.

286
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,880
Everyone, come and have a look.

287
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,640
This is the sachet I made myself

288
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,840
and the powder of the incense.

289
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,000
If you buy it,

290
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,400
you will smell the charm.

291
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,520
The most important thing is

292
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,400
that every penny you spend

293
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,680
will support the soldiers

294
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,120
who are fighting in the front line.

295
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,840
Let's take action.

296
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,040
Yeah.

297
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,200
The sachet must have been poisoned.

298
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,320
I think we should stop buying it.

299
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,360
Boss,

300
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,120
I want to buy a fragrant perfume.

301
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,280
Why are you here?

302
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,640
I want to buy a gift

303
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,800
for my lover.

304
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,360
Which one do you think is suitable for her?

305
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,960
Then may I ask

306
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,480
what color does your lover

307
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,120
like?

308
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,120
Sir,

309
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,280
I think

310
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,840
it should be red.

311
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,880
Red?

312
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
There are three types of red here.

313
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,800
They are

314
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
the peach red, the rose red,

315
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,200
and the dead Barbie pink.

316
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,880
May I ask

317
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,720
which red color

318
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,000
does your lover like?

319
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,160
If you say it wrong,

320
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,720
you will be dead.

321
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,000
Dead.

322
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,480
What's the difference

323
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,880
between these two?

324
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,960
This is the red one.

325
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,200
This is the rose red.

326
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,000
No,

327
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I mean this one.

328
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,200
This is the dead Barbie pink.

329
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,600
Then it must be the last one.

330
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,000
Dead red.

331
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm dead.

332
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,680
Isn't this Li Si Jun?

333
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,520
Why are you here

334
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,520
to buy things for girls?

335
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
Let me see.

336
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,520
Li Si Jun is so gentle and considerate.

337
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,520
Everyone,

338
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,760
the ingredients and bags sold by Qian Jin Shop

339
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,680
are all fragrant.

340
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,080
Everyone, come and have a look.

341
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,960
They are suitable.

342
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,960
It must be good

343
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,960
if it's recommended by Li Si Jun.

344
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
Come on.

345
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
Give me some.

346
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
I have some.

347
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Get up.

348
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Don't worry.

349
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
I have some.

350
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
I have some.

351
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
I have some.

352
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
I have some.

353
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
Give me some.

354
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
Give me some.

355
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,240
Give me some.

356
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,240
Thank you.

357
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
This is yours.

358
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
I want to buy it.

359
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,240
Thank you.

360
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,240
I want to buy it.

361
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,240
Okay.

362
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
Thank you.

363
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
There used to be

364
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,240
a red-tongued doctor in ancient times.

365
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
Li Si Jun.

366
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Li Si Jun.

367
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
What did you say, Miss?

368
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
I mean

369
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
maybe

370
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,240
we should change to another marketing strategy.

371
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Oh my god.

372
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,240
The fragrance is so charming.

373
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
The magical purple and blue

374
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,240
with the elegant smile of the concubine

375
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,240
makes people feel like

376
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,240
they are in the white drop of the West Lake.

377
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,240
They are in the middle of a romantic

378
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,240
and mysterious love.

379
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
All girls,

380
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,240
you are all so beautiful.

381
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,240
You are all so beautiful.

382
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,240
You are all so beautiful.

383
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,240
You are all so beautiful.

384
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,240
You are all so beautiful.

385
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,520
I want to buy this one.

386
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
I want to buy this one.

387
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
Miss.

388
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,520
I have a question.

389
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
Do you know

390
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
if you are a woman

391
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
or a man

392
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,520
is it necessary to wear this hat?

393
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,520
I don't know.

394
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
What are you going to do?

395
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
I have an idea.

396
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,520
I have an idea.

397
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,520
I have an idea.

398
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,520
I have an idea.

399
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
I have an idea.

400
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,520
I have an idea.

401
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,520
I have an idea.

402
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,520
I have an idea.

403
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,480
You must wear it.

404
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,800
It's a three-way dream.

405
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,040
Raise your hand and raise your hand.

406
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,400
Come on, are you ready?

407
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,520
Three, two, one.
