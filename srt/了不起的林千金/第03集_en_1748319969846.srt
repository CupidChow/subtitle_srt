00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Story of the Phoenix

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
On your side,

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
what's the effect of the Princess of the Poison City?

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If you are destined to be drunk,

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
unless you are not special,

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
you will be dead.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Dead?

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Where are you going?

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
To save my life!

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This young man is so good at face-to-face,

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
he is so good at hiding,

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
he is so good at giving out energy.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I think he is not like a sick person.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Is he sick?

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Is he sick?

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Is he sick?

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What?

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He has a heart disease,

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and he is thinking about it.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He has a dark white brain disease.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Isn't this the pre-life's money?

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Do you need any medicine?

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I will give you all the medicine.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Do you think

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I am the kind of person who can get money from others?

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes, yes.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I am not that kind of person.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I would like to give this young man a diagnosis.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
He is sick.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I am not sick.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I am here to investigate.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I am a small business.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I know all the neighbors around me.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But I have never seen anyone buy medicine.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I am not here to investigate you.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I want to ask you.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This young lady

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
came to buy medicine yesterday.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What medicine did she buy?

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Please do it without any trouble.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Otherwise,

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
you will be punished for your crime.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Well, well...

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I know.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This way

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
is the way to the capital of the city.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You want to check it out?

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What poison did I buy

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
to scare Liu Yun to eat?

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Look, look.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I have told you.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He is just a kind-hearted person.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It is not a loss to be a kind-hearted person.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You are so anxious and come here to stir up trouble.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It makes me a kind-hearted person.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Boss,

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
answer me.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I...

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Tell me.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You have to give me a good mouse today.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Well.

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Boss Ding said

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
he didn't see me yesterday.

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
he doesn't have my name on the account.

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Are you confident?

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I think he said that

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
under your threat.

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And this is a family matter.

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Wait.

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What is the proof

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
that you have any evidence?

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I was the one who can prove it.

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Well,

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
someone saw it.

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Someone pointed out your evidence.

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I do not have any evidence.

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
my intuition tells me

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
that you did it.

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Then I am still intuition.

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Then let's see

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
if you have the ability to prove it.

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes.

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What are you talking about?

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What are you talking about?

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's a game.

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What are you talking about?

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I am not a player.

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Come here.

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Come here.

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Come here.

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Come here.

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What are you talking about?

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's so funny.

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So funny.

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's so funny.

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's bad.

101
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You tell others to kill her.

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I will kill this person to revive.

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Go to hell.

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Come here.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I will kill him.

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,100
Brother,

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,600
Boss, check it for me.

108
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,480
Is there a lady named Lin

109
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,720
who bought the medicine here?

110
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,040
It seems

111
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,280
there is a lady

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,760
who bought the medicine here.

113
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,760
I knew it.

114
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,400
Boss, help me check it.

115
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,240
Which lady is this lady?

116
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,720
Okay.

117
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,560
Someone called Lin X involving a lady

118
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,840
Lin Tian Jin

119
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,880
bought the結果.

120
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,680
Never mind, you're yet to accept it.

121
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,880
Buy boxes like those?

122
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,440
Come with me.

123
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,400
It's not me.

124
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,960
Let go of me.

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,760
This...

126
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,720
This...

127
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,120
Brother,

128
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,280
this is a human's gold.

129
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,560
This...

130
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,680
This isn't mine.

131
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,520
See?

132
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,240
This isn't the poison I bought.

133
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,200
I think you're a good person.

134
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,760
You've been biting me since the first time you saw me.

135
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,980
Perhaps you have lots of reasons

136
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,240
to console me now since we're finally hurt.

137
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,080
Not everyone is like you.

138
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,820
We will not take action for Dama settings.

139
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,840
Then, I'll take my leave.

140
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,880
Glimmer.

141
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,020
Glimmer.

142
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,400
Don't run.

143
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,120
She hasn't changed much lately.

144
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,040
Miss.

145
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,560
My lady is engage in pourquoi fun.

146
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,240
You want to go back to home now.

147
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,640
If you don't want it, we'll leave immediately.

148
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,440
What can I buy for 500,000?

149
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,840
How can you have nothing at all?

150
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,440
Is your lady a big brother?

151
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,840
You...

152
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,040
This private witness, Qianqin and the groom are both your strongholds.

153
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,040
You think that you're the daughter of the groom?

154
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,240
This private witness, Qianqin poisoned Princess Liu Yun.

155
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,440
She's a vicious and ungrateful person.

156
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,040
It turns out that you're a vicious and ungrateful person.

157
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,640
How can you be so qualified to say that?

158
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,640
You all said that I'm just a vicious and ungrateful person.

159
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,240
If it really was me, I would still be able to stand here and talk to you all.

160
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,640
Since I'm free to buy, you can find out that I can buy people.

161
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,640
I can also buy.

162
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,240
Xiaoqi, I'll pay 50 taels.

163
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,440
Come with me.

164
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,040
This Lin Qianqin is very cruel and vicious.

165
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,040
She's looking at Xiaoqi today and wants to take her back.

166
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,040
Tomorrow, I don't know how to torture her.

167
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,440
Don't worry. I'll take care of her for you and your brother.

168
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,840
I heard that her family made a mistake.

169
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,840
They were poisoned and became a mute.

170
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,040
No need.

171
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,640
Xiaoqi, you're still not telling me?

172
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,840
It's not a good thing.

173
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,040
If you dare to say anything,

174
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,240
be careful that I'll tear your mouth open.

175
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,640
You're so mean.

176
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,640
You're so mean.

177
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,040
50 taels.

178
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,640
If you don't pay the price,

179
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,440
I won't let you guys go.

180
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
Yue'er, we can't lose.

181
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,240
60 taels.

182
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
100 taels.

183
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,240
Xiaoqi, 100 taels is too expensive.

184
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,040
If you don't pay the price,

185
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,040
you'll have to pay the price with your money.

186
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,840
100 taels.

187
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,640
If you pay the price,

188
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,240
I'll pay...

189
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,640
10 taels.

190
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,040
10 taels.

191
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,640
You're not good at math, are you?

192
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,640
You're good at math.

193
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,840
I'm sorry.

194
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,640
What I said is indeed 10 taels.

195
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,440
Golden gold.

196
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,640
Do you understand?

197
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,240
Yue'er, let's go.

198
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,840
10 taels of gold.

199
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,840
If you can make your father proud,

200
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,440
you can give us the rest of the money.

201
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,240
It's good to go to study and buy some small things.

202
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,440
Anyway, it's all up to you.

203
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,040
Xiaoqi, let me go.

204
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,440
10 taels of gold. I don't want it.

205
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,240
I don't want it.

206
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,840
Don't be like this.

207
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,440
Oh, right. I forgot something.

208
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,040
It's torn.

209
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,440
It's torn.

210
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,440
Don't be angry at me.

211
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,640
Of course, after this torn,

212
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,040
you'll be free.

213
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,840
No one can buy you or sell you.

214
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,040
I don't need you to go to the Lin's Manor with me.

215
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,640
Go to the house.

216
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,040
You can rest assured.

217
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,240
Oh, my God.

218
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,440
What's going on?

219
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,040
Good morning, 4th Lord.

220
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,640
Thank you for your lesson.

221
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,040
Here.

222
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,040
Let me tell you.

223
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,440
I hate the behavior of these people.

224
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,040
Everyone is equal.

225
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,640
Why do you do this?

226
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,040
Sister, they say you're very vicious.

227
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,640
Did you lie to them?

228
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,040
What do you think?

229
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,040
I think they should know you again.

230
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,640
Exactly.

231
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,040
Here.

232
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,040
Here.

233
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,840
4th Lord Li, don't send us.

234
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
We'll go back on our own.

235
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,840
You're a good person.

236
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,040
I'll send you back.

237
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,040
Okay.

238
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,440
Let's go.

239
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,240
This Lin Qianjin

240
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,240
doesn't seem to be so good at talking.

241
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,840
Here.

242
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Okay. We're here.

243
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,240
Goodbye, Lin Yan.

244
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,940
Bye.

245
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,040
What do you mean?

246
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,640
You mean, goodbye.

247
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,640
You can go now.

248
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,640
Goodbye.

249
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,960
My dear daughter.

250
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,680
You're back.

251
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,200
Are you feeling better?

252
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,760
I'm fine.

253
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,200
Why did you bring another one?

254
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,480
Here.

255
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,120
Father.

256
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,200
I bought them.

257
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,160
They're not enough.

258
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,960
How much?

259
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,560
I'll give you.

260
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,200
I've spent

261
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,080
ten taels.

262
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,000
The gold.

263
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,800
I'll give you.

264
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,240
Isn't it just ten taels of gold?

265
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,640
As long as my daughter is happy,

266
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,000
what is ten taels of gold?

267
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,320
I think it's the same.

268
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,480
What's the money in front of people?

269
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,200
Right?

270
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,200
Xiao Hai, take her away.

271
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,160
Get familiar with her.

272
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,160
You can arrange for her to work in the kitchen.

273
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,600
Yes.

274
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,360
No.

275
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,320
I'll kill her

276
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,920
with her pulse.

277
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,040
It's a small matter.

278
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,520
My daughter is back.

279
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,040
You're important.

280
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,600
I didn't expect that

281
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,880
I can have such a good father.

282
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,120
I must be a good father.

283
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,240
Here you are.

284
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,080
See how Li Yan can save her.

285
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,640
Father is the best for me.

286
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,800
Of course.

287
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,160
Father.

288
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,520
Since you love me so much,

289
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,680
why don't you help me?

290
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,560
How?

291
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,760
My Lord,

292
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,280
I've mentioned

293
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,160
the plan to conquer the southwest city.

294
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,880
I have a plan

295
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,400
to have you and Li Si Jun together.

296
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,640
I'm here to ask Li Si Jun to discuss it with me.

297
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,440
I don't know

298
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,080
if you have any idea

299
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,880
where Li Si Jun is.

300
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,240
I'm just reminding you.

301
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
I'm a citizen.

302
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,640
I'll do my best.

303
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,640
My Lord.

304
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,840
I'm here.

305
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,000
You're here.

306
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,320
Let's start.

307
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,760
What do you mean?

308
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,360
What nonsense is he talking about?

309
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,280
I don't know.

310
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,280
I heard everything.

311
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,240
I'll make a plan.

312
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,360
No.

313
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,880
I'd like to hear

314
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,080
what you think.

315
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,040
You mean

316
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,080
you want to conquer the southwest city.

317
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,400
The most important thing is

318
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,400
to conquer the southwest city.

319
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,040
The southwest city is a dangerous place.

320
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,080
It's hard to conquer.

321
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,920
Well...

322
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,720
If you want to get rid of the crime,

323
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,640
you have to get rid of the root root.

324
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,840
I have to go back to the capital.

325
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,400
I'm here to ask Li Si Jun to discuss it with me.

326
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,960
I'm here to ask Li Si Jun to discuss it with me.

327
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,440
I'm here to ask Li Si Jun to discuss it with me.

328
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,960
I'm here to ask Li Si Jun to discuss it with me.

329
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,560
I'm here to ask Li Si Jun to discuss it with me.

330
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,360
I'm here to ask Li Si Jun to discuss it with me.

331
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,400
I'm here to ask Li Si Jun to discuss it with me.

332
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,600
I'm here to ask Li Si Jun to discuss it with me.

333
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,400
I'm here to ask Li Si Jun to discuss it with me.

334
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,480
I'm here to ask Li Si Jun to discuss it with me.

335
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm here to ask Li Si Jun to discuss it with me.
