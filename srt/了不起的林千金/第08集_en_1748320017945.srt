Don't be afraid

Heartbreak

Episode 1

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
When put for the past two years,

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,660
you'll know how true your love is.

00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,080
2020

00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,560
The peace and prosperity of Miao's family

has Presented to you

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,360

11
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,200
of the two world.

12
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,560
["Love Comedy", theizi» playing in the background.]

13
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,440
Little girl,

14
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,720
what aness

15
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,240
What do I draw for you?

16
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,960
Okay

17
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,200
Girl,

18
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,640
What do you want to draw?

19
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,880
Okay

20
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,240
Pinching

21
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,800
Or

22
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,160
Po Panda Scholar's face could wear out

23
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,280
는데요,

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,840
but that would be

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,120
вед for this show

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,160
all my crying.

27
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,160
I've seen the country before.

28
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,160
How should I describe the sand island?

29
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,160
It's so hard to live.

30
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
Let me do it.

31
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,160
Okay.

32
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
What's this?

33
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,160
It's not blood or pen.

34
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,160
This is the comic of Second Yuan.

35
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,160
The comic of Second Yuan?

36
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,160
I've never heard of it.

37
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,160
I've never heard of such a single-minded girl.

38
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
You know it's too much.

39
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,160
You should learn from me.

40
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
Brother Li Yan.

41
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,160
Brother Li Yan.

42
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,160
Where have you been?

43
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,160
I've been looking for you for a long time.

44
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
Princess.

45
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,160
I've been looking for you.

46
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,160
But I ran into Lin Qian Jin on the way.

47
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,160
He just took me to draw a sugar doll.

48
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,160
A sugar doll?

49
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
He's so big-eyed.

50
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Who's the one who drew this?

51
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
He's so ugly.

52
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
Princess.

53
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,160
You don't know what this is.

54
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
This is called...

55
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
The comic of Second Yuan?

56
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,160
The comic of Second Yuan?

57
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
It's a...

58
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160
The man who killed the man.

59
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,160
The man who killed the man?

60
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,160
I think it's a good drawing.

61
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,160
Here.

62
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,160
Brother Li Yan.

63
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,160
Why did you draw for Lin Qian Jin?

64
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,160
You didn't look like this before.

65
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
Princess, I...

66
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,160
It's like this.

67
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,160
Lin Qian Jin's craft is still good.

68
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,160
Look at this.

69
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,160
My candy is also made by him.

70
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Brother Li Yan.

71
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
How can you give this woman the fragrant candy?

72
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,160
How about you take this with me?

73
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,160
Didn't you say that I have a unique fragrance?

74
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,160
Princess Chang Le.

75
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,160
Although you have a unique fragrance,

76
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,160
I have something more powerful.

77
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,160
What is it?

78
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,160
This name is called Yeh-Hai-Tang.

79
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,160
But because of its raw material,

80
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,160
it's less known and less known to people who have smelled it.

81
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,160
The fragrance of Princess is unique.

82
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
Compared with her,

83
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
it's just average.

84
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,160
What kind of Yeh-Hai-Tang was I?

85
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
How do you know that I don't have it?

86
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,160
You have it?

87
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
I...

88
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
Lin Qian Jin.

89
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,160
You are obviously jealous of me.

90
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
Believe it or not, I'm just following orders.

91
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,160
You said you didn't respect Princess.

92
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
I'll catch you.

93
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
Princess.

94
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,160
Why do you have to follow this crazy girl?

95
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
I'll take you back first.

96
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,160
Okay.

97
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
Let's go, Brother Li Yan.

98
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,160
Lin Qian Jin.

99
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,160
Is Brother Li Yan back?

100
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,160
Qian Jin.

101
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,160
Brother Li Yan.

102
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
Qian Jin.

103
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
Lin Qian Jin.

104
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
What's wrong with you?

105
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
Qian Jin.

106
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
Qian Jin.

107
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,160
Qian Jin.

108
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,160
Get up.

109
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,160
Qian Jin.

110
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
Brother Li Yan.

111
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,160
Are you here to investigate or to kill her?

112
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Qian Jin, let's go.

113
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
Let's go.

114
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
Hurry up.

115
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
Let's go.

116
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
Mr. Lu.

117
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
What's wrong with you?

118
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
Lin Er.

119
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Go and get the medicine I prepared for you

120
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,160
for Qian Jin.

121
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
Yes.

122
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
Oh, right.

123
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
And today,

124
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
Qian Jin is just getting married to Xia Er.

125
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,160
Don't tell Lin Si Zheng.

126
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
I can't let anything happen to Qian Jin today.

127
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,160
Or I'll be in trouble.

128
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,160
Are you here to investigate or to kill her?

129
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
Qian Jin.

130
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,160
Qian Jin.

131
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Qian Jin.

132
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
Qian Jin.

133
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
Qian Jin.

134
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
Qian Jin.

135
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,160
Qian Jin.

136
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
Get up.

137
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,160
Let's take the medicine.

138
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,160
Jin Jin, how do you feel?

139
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
Are you dizzy?

140
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,160
I feel better.

141
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
Thank you for playing with me.

142
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
But what's wrong with me?

143
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,160
It's nothing.

144
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
You just got a little cold.

145
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
After taking the medicine,

146
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
you can sleep for a while.

147
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
I told you.

148
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
It's not your opponent

149
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,160
who's always training.

150
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,160
Chang Fang.

151
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,160
You've been working out all day.

152
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,160
Of course, you have more important things

153
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,160
than practicing dance.

154
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
Little Lv.

155
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,160
Come on.

156
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
Come on.

157
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,160
Come on.

158
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,160
Come on.

159
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
Come on.

160
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Come on.

161
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
I'm the most excited

162
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
every day at this time.

163
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,160
Those officials in the city

164
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
always know

165
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
the rules of the fox and the snake.

166
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,160
You must be positive and positive.

167
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,160
You even have to drink a lot.

168
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
Otherwise,

169
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,160
don't say that I'm a drinker.

170
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,160
I'm not a big deal.

171
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
Think about it.

172
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
The ordinary people are good.

173
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
You can drink a little wine

174
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
if you're fine.

175
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
Just drink a little wind.

176
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,160
The day is coming.

177
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,160
My city leader.

178
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
You're the leader of the city.

179
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,160
You have a heavy burden on you.

180
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,160
How can you compare with those people?

181
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
To be honest,

182
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
I still take care of myself.

183
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
These wines

184
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
are not good for drinking.

185
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
Don't come here.

186
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
You taught me all these.

187
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,160
When I was 13 years old,

188
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Zhang Gang was named

189
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
the leader of the city.

190
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160
He was always locked up

191
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,160
and learned the etiquette rules.

192
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,160
You're here to help me

193
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
hide some small wine and chicken

194
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,160
and play the flute with me.

195
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
If it wasn't for you,

196
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
I would have been bored.

197
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
Do we

198
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
need to talk about these?

199
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,160
Drink less.

200
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,160
Fine.

201
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
I'm serious.

202
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
Look.

203
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,160
The deadline is coming.

204
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,160
How's the investigation?

205
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,160
Did you find

206
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
the evidence of Lin Qianjin's poisoning?

207
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,160
After the investigation,

208
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
I think

209
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
the murderer is not Lin Qianjin.

210
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
There's another person.

211
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
You found a new evidence?

212
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,160
Not yet.

213
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,160
Not yet.

214
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
But

215
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,160
I've been with

216
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Lin Qianjin.

217
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,160
I found

218
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
he's just a good man.

219
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
He's always smart.

220
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
But

221
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,160
he didn't spread the rumors.

222
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
On the contrary,

223
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,160
he's a good man.

224
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
He's not like Zhuang.

225
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
So I think

226
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,160
the one who poisoned Princess Liuyun

227
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,160
is not Lin Qianjin.

228
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,160
You might

229
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
have spread the rumors.

230
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
If you really think

231
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,160
Lin Qianjin is innocent,

232
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
you should get the evidence.

233
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
Give us an explanation.

234
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
Understand?

235
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
Here.

236
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
Please.

237
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
I'll do my best

238
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,160
to find out the murderer.

239
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
I'll give you an explanation

240
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,160
and exchange Lin Qianjin for a innocent one.

241
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,160
The wind blows

242
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,160
and you get a fake one.

243
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,160
The world is open and memories are like sand.

244
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,160
The life is full of flowers

245
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,160
after washing them.

246
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
The red dust is everywhere.

247
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
The mountain is full of tears.

248
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
The mountain is like a flower.

249
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,160
Who still remembers him?

250
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,160
Who has ever

251
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,160
made a promise to him?
