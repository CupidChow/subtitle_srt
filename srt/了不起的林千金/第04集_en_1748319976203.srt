I'm sorry.

39
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,080
The one who killed you

40
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
wasn't me.

41
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,080
But, don't worry.

42
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,100
I will find the murderer for you.

43
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,080
But...

44
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,080
If he really is the murderer,

45
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,080
Lin Qianjin,

46
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
I will admit my mistake.

47
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
But if it really wasn't me,

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,880
I can't stay here.

49
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,100
Did you find that

50
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,260
Princess Liuyun is still alive

51
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,500
and wants to harm her.

52
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,460
You asked Lin Sizhou to pretend to be a drug dealer

53
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,860
and let her know about me

54
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,420
and come to the mansion to harm Princess Liuyun.

55
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,580
I thought you were...

56
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,020
I didn't expect

57
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,340
you to be such a irresponsible person.

58
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,620
I underestimated you.

59
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,940
Can you stop being so agitated?

60
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,740
You're not my real brother.

61
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,900
I'm here

62
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,540
because I just want to see

63
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,740
what medicine Liuyun took

64
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,380
to know what poison he was using.

65
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,220
Don't you think

66
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,820
convinced him not to use it?

67
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,780
There's so much in her diet.

68
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,180
I can throw her again

69
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,020
No.

70
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,220
What if

71
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,700
some one finds out

72
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,620
that the dead ring wasn't Model proves

73
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,740
you're definitely Suddenly?

74
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,540
How am I supposed to eat the breakfast?

75
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,820
There's no other way.

76
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,020
OK.

77
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,460
It's delicious.

78
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,660
You can have more.

79
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,460
Today

00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,380
Chuan's in a very comfortable place.

81
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,140
She seems to be a bit busy.

82
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,940
fluctuations across generations to save lives all turn red after茜

83
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,520
The young people fan internally

84
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,080
the younger people

85
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:55,580

86
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,220
Her 56ло says she's in puberty.

87
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,020
Right.

88
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,020
My period's

An世代I Freshware Research poxSC.

91
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,020
What if

92
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,700
I just

93
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,900
took a full form

94
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,340
and got popcorn on me

95
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,300
I couldn't

96
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,900
have been relying on

97
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,300
those literal BLARELASTS besides fruits like these?

98
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,540
and polluted the environment.

99
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,260
You...

100
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,700
So I don't deserve to be in jail?

101
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,900
I don't deserve to be in jail.

102
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:34,860
No.

103
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,700
That's your stupidity.

104
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,460
Like me.

105
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,980
I'll turn the prison into heaven.

106
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,860
Right?

107
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,340
No matter what you say,

108
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,060
I'll take you to the prison.

109
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,380
I'll be in jail for my crimes.

110
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,180
I'm so miserable.

111
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,660
I'm a woman.

112
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,340
Why are you so cruel to me?

113
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,020
You're so gentle to Liu Yun.

114
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,460
Do you like her?

115
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,060
How could I like Liu Yun?

116
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,460
Let go of me.

117
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,620
Let go of me.

118
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,460
Come with me.

119
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,420
Why are you so nervous?

120
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,860
Is it possible?

121
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,380
You really like Liu Yun?

122
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,260
Good for you.

123
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,820
You really like Liu Yun.

124
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,780
Or you won't explain so much.

125
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,820
You're so polite.

126
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,980
I'm your brother.

127
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,700
You're so angry.

128
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,660
I'll treat you as a polite person.

129
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,460
You're so naughty.

130
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,580
You'll die.

131
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,700
I'll get you.

132
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,780
Look.

133
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,380
The killer is dead.

134
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,820
My lord.

135
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,340
How could I be so cruel?

136
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,780
Listen.

137
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,100
If I die here today,

138
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,140
I'll never let you off.

139
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,780
I must make a wish

140
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,780
and tell the city chief

141
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,140
what his good brother did to him.

142
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:19,940
Qianqin.

143
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,340
What are you doing?

144
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,940
What are you doing?

145
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,500
Give me time.

146
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,780
Let me do it myself.

147
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,820
If you don't agree,

148
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,820
I'll tell the city chief

149
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,860
Li Yan and Liu Yun.

150
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,100
My lady.

151
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,100
Master is here.

152
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,100
He said he's a polite person.

153
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,420
What's wrong?

154
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,500
Nothing.

155
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,580
Let's go.

156
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,220
This is...

157
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,180
My lady, be careful.

158
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,380
My lady.

159
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,580
City chief.

160
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,540
I have a key report.

161
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:27,900
Qianqin.

162
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,260
Father.

163
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,260
Why are you so lost?

164
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,620
Why is it like this?

165
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,140
I don't want to.

166
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,820
Did Li Yan do this?

167
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,500
My lady, what's wrong with you?

168
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,180
You're so rude to her.

169
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,700
My lady.

170
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,660
The real murderer who killed the Princess Liu Yun.

171
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,300
Father.

172
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,620
I've found the person who is the real person.

173
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,740
Lin Qianqin.

174
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,140
Li Yan, you're so stubborn.

175
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,740
You're so stupid.

176
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,420
You're not saying anything.

177
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,980
What do you think you saw me

178
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,420
killing Princess Liu Yun?

179
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,900
Tell me.

180
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,740
Lin Qianqin set up a trap

181
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,020
on the way back to the mansion

182
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,020
in Princess Liu Yun's house.

183
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,740
She killed the Princess.

184
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,740
She was the reason

185
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,420
why she was killed.

186
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,980
Her brother

187
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,460
brought her back to you.

188
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,860
This is the real person.

189
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,660
Li Yan.

190
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,820
I...

191
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,340
What?

192
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,180
Lin Qianqin is the real murderer.

193
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,820
Hailanyou's freaking董 they're on your side.

194
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,460
Can you all do this?

195
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,180
Here's another way.

196
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,020
Xiaozhi,

197
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,380
theonds.

198
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,060
Xiaooshing's charging point

199
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,900
that you should stop this.

200
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,400
Don't you do something for me?

201
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,140
I'll try to catch my sweetheart's dad.

202
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,500
My dear Son,

203
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,100
my delicious蘿ry cake

204
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,740
Hang on.

205
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,660
You must help me.

206
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:57,860
Lin Qianqin.

207
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,380
Come back here.

208
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,580
I think you're in charge of the government.

209
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,380
I'm sorry.

210
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,220
If you're here...

211
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,180
Okay.

212
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,020
I'll do it.

213
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,700
You...

214
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,020
I'm the one who set this mechanism.

215
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,820
But...

216
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,820
There are so many people on this road.

217
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,140
How can you be sure that I set it up for him?

218
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,580
And the most important thing is that

219
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,420
this is not directly related to the poison-causing Princess Liuyun.

220
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,580
If you insist on taking this case,

221
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,300
can I understand you?

222
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,420
You're so eager to break the case.

223
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,660
It's because you like Princess Liuyun.

224
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,500
You want to get her relief.

225
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,340
Lin Qianqin?

226
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,900
Of course, this is related to her.

227
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,780
This is your motive for killing people.

228
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,380
Yes.

229
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,340
She didn't deny the last word.

230
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,660
That is to say, she admitted that she likes Princess Liuyun.

231
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,100
Okay.

232
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,740
Let's think about it again.

233
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,700
She wants Princess Liuyun so much.

234
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,740
It's because she wants to be the Queen of Beiyue City.

235
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,740
She's been given the top rank.

236
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:03,940
Nonsense.

237
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,260
There's no limit to human's imagination.

238
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,180
But there's always one truth.

239
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,740
If she doesn't have any終 Gün,

240
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,780
I can make a comparison

241
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,980
to compare.

242
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,180
Lin Qianqin said it.

243
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,580
How many truths do you have?

244
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,020
Get yourself engaged

245
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,900
within 7 days of my사랑action.

246
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,740
Today,

247
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,820
you should be more careful.

248
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,820
Lin Yan,

249
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,860
I'll leave this matter to you and Lin Qian Jin.

250
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,580
You must protect Lin Qian Jin.

251
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,140
Yes.

252
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,500
Boss!

253
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,780
Boss!

254
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,500
Boss!

255
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,660
The snake is white, the air is blood-sucking.

256
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,580
Miss Lin, you must be sick.

257
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,860
I'm not sick.

258
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,780
The pulse is too thin,

259
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,260
the air is too heavy.

260
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,660
Miss Lin,

261
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,460
do you have a fever?

262
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,420
It's not your fault.

263
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,260
Don't worry.

264
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,780
I have a thousand years of life.

265
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,100
I'll get rid of it.

266
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,940
This medicine can cure the illness,

267
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,860
but it can't cure the heart.

268
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,980
People like you who are always poisoned,

269
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,060
you are also poisoned.

270
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,220
Why are you again?

271
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,900
I'm the murderer.

272
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,860
Okay.

273
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,980
I won't argue with you.

274
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:46,940
Boss,

275
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,780
I came here today to ask you.

276
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,100
Is there anyone in your shop

277
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,660
who can buy that medicine

278
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,060
and die without a living?

279
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:55,980
Miss Lin,

280
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,340
look at you.

281
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,380
The medicine is either alive or dead.

282
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,260
If the medicine is not alive,

283
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,180
it must be a fake lung cancer.

284
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,900
The medicine in this shop is definitely a real medicine.

285
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,740
It's not the kind of medicine you're talking about.

286
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,980
To be honest,

287
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,740
I came here to check on you.

288
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,260
Please, Boss,

289
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,060
do it as you like.

290
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,180
I'll call the fire.

291
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,740
The client bought the medicine.

292
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,660
He knows better than I do.

293
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,500
What a pity, Boss.

294
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,020
You're just trying to reveal the client's information.

295
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,300
If this is spread,

296
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,740
will anyone else come to your shop?

297
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,260
Boss,

298
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,900
I'm just trying to say this.

299
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,300
You should be careful.

300
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,060
Miss Lin,

301
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:55,820
you...

302
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,580
Please say hello.

303
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,620
Please say hello.

304
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,860
I've told you everything I know.

305
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,980
I'm not angry at all.

306
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,460
Take care.

307
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,940
As the boss said,

308
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,300
there is no medicine

309
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,620
for this kind of poison in the world.

310
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,460
How did you buy this medicine?

311
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,260
I...

312
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
How did I buy this medicine?

313
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,740
Can you not keep following me?

314
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,220
The owner gave us seven days.

315
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,260
You can check on me.

316
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,580
We'll have a fair competition.

317
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,220
Can you do that?

318
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,980
You were a fair person yesterday.

319
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,900
What if you get the evidence?

320
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,220
What should I do?

321
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,860
So I have to follow you.

322
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,300
Princess Liu Yun,

323
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
why are you awake?

324
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,060
I'm not awake.

325
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,060
I'm not awake.

326
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,060
I'm not awake.

327
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,060
I'm not awake.

328
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,060
I'm not awake.

329
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,060
I'm not awake.

330
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,060
I'm not awake.

331
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,060
I'm not awake.

332
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,060
I'm not awake.

333
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,060
I'm not awake.

334
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,060
I'm not awake.

335
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,060
I'm not awake.

336
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,060
I'm not awake.

337
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,060
I'm not awake.

338
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,060
I'm not awake.

339
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,060
I'm not awake.

340
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,060
I'm not awake.

341
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,060
I'm not awake.

342
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,060
I'm not awake.

343
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,060
I'm not awake.

344
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,060
I'm not awake.

345
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,060
I'm not awake.

346
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,060
I'm not awake.

347
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,060
I'm not awake.

348
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,060
I'm not awake.

349
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,060
I'm not awake.

350
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,060
I'm not awake.

351
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,060
I'm not awake.

352
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,060
I'm not awake.
