I don't think so.

35
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,980
Don't forget our city.

36
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,500
Don't you have a little girl?

37
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,380
The city gate is closing.

00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,260
She lives in my house.

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,260
The moon is full of fragrance.

00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,660
It's mine.

41
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,100
Brother Jiu.

42
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,100
Follow me.

43
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:42,940
Yes.

44
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,700
I'm so worried about her.

45
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,980
How dare she break into my house?

46
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,900
What's wrong with her?

47
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,780
What's wrong with her?

48
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,780

00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:50,860
Stop.

51
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,900
My father is a great private witness.

52
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,580
I'm Lin Qianjin.

53
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,140
I think today,

54
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,140
who dares to touch me?

55
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,820
Yeah.

56
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,660
Wait.

57
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,820
What are you doing at Liuyun Village?

58
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,020
An old man ofушка.

59
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,300
You're so polite.

60
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,700
You dare to ruin my good deed.

61
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,580
Lin Qianjin,

62
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,860
you were late for the election.

63
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,780
You missed the election.

64
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,380
How dare you intrude?

65
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,220
Come on.

66
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,260
Take him down.

67
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,180
Who dares to touch me today?

68
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,500
What election?

69
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,580
I only need to participate in the TV show.

70
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,980
My father is a great private witness.

71
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,900
I'm the future's assistant madam.

72
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,660
What's that?

73
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,860
Is that the real thing?

74
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,620
That's right.

75
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,340
That's too big.

76
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,460
Why is the key card

77
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,020
',

78
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,140
howrien me.

79
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,580
The next card

80
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,540
is folding back theódromeda cover of the�agus'

81
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,140
The password is so thick.

82
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,980
My surname is also Lin Qianjin.

83
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,140
I hope you could tell me.

84
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,220
My name is just aesteem.

85
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,160
Soon, I will be

86
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,140
a permanent relations officer

87
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,140
along with the traditional town!

88
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,220
And recently I found a long-standing legend

89
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,700
that said that the treasure chest in the middle of the night

90
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,700
was found by a fairy.

91
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,700
If you add it to the next chapter,

92
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,300
you can see the formula.

93
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,660
What's going on?

94
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,580
Why haven't you added it yet?

95
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,500
The net is too small.

96
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,580
Help!

97
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,660
He's dead.

98
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,420
Look.

99
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,380
Is he alive?

100
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,020
Really?

101
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,620
Yeah.

102
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,380
Is he alive?

103
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,700
Lord Liuyun will be in charge for her team.

104
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,780
The one for the rest

105
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,660
will serve Lord Liuyun as a prisoner.

106
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,260
F п laord Wuhan preparatory for her group is to lead L an o,

Yes!

109
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,700
Oh my...

110
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,660
What kind of stinky sounds will it make?

111
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,740
Get out!

112
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,040
Producer Dai!

113
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,760
You're making a fuss around this area.

114
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,800
Oh, I appropriately locked her in.

115
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,420
од

116
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,240
It was not a dream

117
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,120
I wanted to let go

118
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,160
I only have dreams

119
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,860
Are you sure that you're important here

120
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,620
I can't get the transition

121
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,620
I have to try.

122
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,620
Let me go!

123
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,620
Let me go!

124
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,620
Let me go!

125
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,620
Here it is.

126
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,620
Lin Qianjin,

127
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,620
you're so bold.

128
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,620
What do you want?

129
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,620
This is my dream.

130
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,620
In my dream,

131
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,620
what do I want?

132
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,620
What do I want?

133
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,620
Let me go!

134
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,620
What a good idea!

135
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,620
What a good idea!

136
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,620
Lin Qianjin is crazy.

137
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,620
She won't sing.

138
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,620
Lin Qianjin!

139
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,620
You're a fool.

140
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,620
You can't catch me.

141
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,620
Lin Qianjin,

142
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,620
you're a fool.

143
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,620
You can't catch me.

144
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,620
So I'm a fool?

145
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,620
Lin Qianjin.

146
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,620
Lin Qianjin.

147
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,620
You can't catch me.

148
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,620
You can't catch me.

149
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,620
Lin Qianjin,

150
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,620
what's going on?

151
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,620
How dare you!

152
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,460
You...

153
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,940
Shameless!

154
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,300
Go.

155
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,620
Go to the check-up.

156
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,900
That's right.

157
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,620
What's going on?

158
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,620
You're just like a dead wood.

159
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:07,980
Alright.

160
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,380
Anyway,

161
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,300
I'm here.

162
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,660
I should have played.

163
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,740
I should have eaten.

164
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,580
I'll go back to the real world.

165
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,620
Come on.

166
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,580
Kill me.

167
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,020
Let me die quickly.

168
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,140
You...

169
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,740
What's going on?

170
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:28,940
Miss!

171
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,420
Miss.

172
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,860
Miss, you're finally awake.

173
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:47,940
You...

174
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,660
What did you call me?

175
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,340
Miss.

176
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,340
Xie...

177
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,500
Where...

178
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,100
Where is this?

179
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,940
Miss, what's wrong?

180
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,540
You're at your own home.

181
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,500
I...

182
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,500
This...

183
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,340
I can't believe I'm in the ancient times.

184
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,980
Miss.

185
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,780
Impossible.

186
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,900
Impossible.

187
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,460
No.

188
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,060
Impossible.

189
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,940
Miss.

190
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,820
Miss.

191
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,420
Miss.

192
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,060
Don't run.

193
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,820
Miss.

194
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,380
Miss.

195
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,300
Miss.

196
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:22,980
Miss.

197
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,420
Miss, be careful.

198
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,260
Come on.

199
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:25,860
Come on.

200
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,540
Come on.

201
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,740
Miss, be careful.

202
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,540
Miss.

203
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,540
Miss.

204
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,300
Come on.

205
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,420
Miss.

206
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,740
Miss, don't run.

207
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,380
Hey.

208
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,420
What are you doing?

209
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,820
Don't blame me.

210
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,020
Get up.

211
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,820
I'm asking you.

212
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,820
What's your name?

213
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,580
Miss.

214
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,780
I'm Lian'er.

215
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,500
Is this Nanling City?

216
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,300
The current owner is...

217
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,900
Murong Chengfeng.

218
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,060
I'm...

219
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,100
Lin Si Zheng's only daughter.

220
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,140
Lin Qian Jin.

221
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,460
A few days ago,

222
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,980
the Princess Liu Yun from Beiyue City came here.

223
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,580
It's true.

224
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,260
Wait.

225
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,300
Nanling's first beauty?

226
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,500
That dream is true.

227
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,860
Why are you so selfish?

228
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,620
Wait.

229
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,780
The book said that Lin Qian Jin

230
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,340
will be the owner of the house.

231
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,220
Can I see the formula of the moon

232
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,140
with my own eyes?

233
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,300
God bless me.

234
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,940
Lian'er.

235
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,820
The best food in the house

236
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,340
is all in my hands.

237
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,060
Yes.

238
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,300
Lian'er.

239
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,180
Princess Liu Yun is poisoned.

240
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,460
She's very selfish.

241
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,380
If you don't investigate it,

242
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,300
I'll give Beiyue City an explanation.

243
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,900
The control will be opened in two cities.

244
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,780
I need you to secretly go to Lin's Mansion

245
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,860
and investigate the poison.

246
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,460
So many cases.

247
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,620
The��로 language of raid weapons

248
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,620
is to convince Lin Si Zheng

249
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,900
of my crime.

250
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,940
Let's go.

251
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,940
Yes.

252
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,940
It's a vase.

253
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,940
It's mine.

254
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,940
It's so good.

255
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,940
Here!

256
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,940
Lin Qianqin

257
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,940
does know how to make it.

258
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,940
Take it away!

259
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,940
What's that smell?

260
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,940
It smells so good.

261
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,940
It's so good.

262
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,940
Brother,

263
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,940
it smells so good.

264
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,860
Swordsmanship!

265
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,860
I see.

266
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,380
That's you!

267
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,700
After bl sovereignty

268
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,000
當然

269
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,000
I've proven to the people

270
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,360
Who believed that

271
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,400
With a fruit

272
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,100
I'll become aower

273
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,980
An important person

274
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:49,860
Let's棄

275
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,060
Go!

276
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,340
They're mad at me!

277
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,540
Li Er!
