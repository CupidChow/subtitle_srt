1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
We're finally going to the show!

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,560
episode 2

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
See you.

4
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,800
Why are you so excited?

5
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,360
You almost made a scene.

6
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,400
You're quite good at acting.

7
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,840
But the boss is so enthusiastic.

8
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,880
I'll take it.

9
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,520
I'm not doing this for my son.

10
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,000
I just think

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,240
it's quite interesting.

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,760
I'll study it after I go back.

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,960
Have some tea.

14
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:22,840
Okay.

15
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,200
Here.

16
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,080
Thanks.

17
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,920
You're welcome.

18
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,800
What are you doing?

19
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,560
Don't move.

20
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,120
Is there

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,360
a smell on your body?

22
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,200
Oh, my God.

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,080
Have you been

24
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,680
anesthetized?

25
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,720
Be more clear.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,720
What?

27
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,560
I'm clearly conscious!

28
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
What tea?

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,560
You...

30
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
It's him.

31
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
I knew it.

32
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,560
Why does it smell so familiar?

33
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
And it's very special.

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,560
What is this smell?

35
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
I remember it now.

36
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,560
This is the smell of the little yellow flower.

37
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
Do you remember?

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,560
The little yellow flower

39
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,560
in Qinren Valley?

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,560
What kind of flower is this?

41
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
It's so special.

42
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
Let's go to Qinren Valley.

43
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
When I came here before,

44
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,560
there were flowers.

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,560
Why can't I see them?

46
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Li Yan, go over there and look for them.

47
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,560
Okay.

48
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
Are you looking for this?

49
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
Give it to me.

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
Okay.

51
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
You don't cherish

52
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
what I gave you?

53
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
If I hadn't picked it up,

54
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
you wouldn't have taken it.

55
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,560
I cherish everything you gave me.

56
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
This...

57
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,560
This is really an accident.

58
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,560
Then tell me a joke.

59
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
Make me happy

60
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,560
and I'll return it to you.

61
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,560
Tell me a joke?

62
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
Tell me a joke?

63
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
Sorry.

64
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
I won't touch you.

65
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,560
I'll return it to you.

66
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
You're lying to me.

67
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
I won't give it to you.

68
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
I won't give it to you.

69
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
I won't give it to you.

70
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,560
I won't give it to you.

71
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
I won't give it to you.

72
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,560
The wind blows gently,

73
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,560
the time flies by.

74
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
You're the one who loves me.

75
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,560
Don't say so much.

76
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
Let the sun fall,

77
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
let the time slip away.

78
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
Let you accompany me

79
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,560
in my empty and vague promises.

80
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,560
I...

81
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
I fell in love with a person

82
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
I shouldn't have.

83
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,560
Is this a joke?

84
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
I...

85
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,560
What are you thinking?

86
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,560
Is it a fake girl's eyes?

87
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,560
Occasionally, I leave.

88
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Occasionally, I'm heartbroken.

89
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,560
You don't say a word.

90
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,560
Although sometimes you leave me behind.

91
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,560
You make me feel better.

92
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,560
I can't help but be angry.

93
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
Qianqian, look.

94
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
Little yellow flower?

95
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
Isn't this the little yellow flower

96
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,560
in the story you mentioned?

97
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,560
Yes.

98
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
That's right.

99
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
It's the same smell.

100
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,560
It's the same smell as the medicine.

101
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,560
Let's take it to the supermarket and ask.

102
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
Okay, let's go.

103
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
Go.

104
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
Go.

105
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,560
Stop.

106
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
Stop, don't run.

107
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
What should we do?

108
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
Go.

109
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,560
Qianqian.

110
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,560
Go.

111
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
Retreat.

112
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
Go.

113
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Li Yan.

114
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Li Yan.

115
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
Wake up.

116
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,560
Li Yan.

117
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,560
The long street lights are long gone.

118
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:37,560
Like fireworks, I gaze at your smile.

119
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,560
I don't know how to say it.

120
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,560
It's hard to see your face.

121
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,560
Your tender face is hard to write.

122
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,560
The long street lights are long gone.

123
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,560
I wish to spend the rest of my life with you.

124
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,560
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

125
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,560
The long street lights are long gone.

126
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,560
I'm afraid I'm not good enough for you.

127
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,560
You're drunk and you're in love.

128
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,560
I'm drunk and you're in love.

129
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:54,560
I don't understand why you're so stubborn.

130
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,560
I don't understand why you're so stubborn.

131
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:09,560
I don't understand why you're so stubborn.

132
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:16,560
I don't understand why you're so stubborn.

133
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,560
I don't understand why you're so stubborn.

134
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:30,560
I don't understand why you're so stubborn.

135
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,560
I don't understand why you're so stubborn.

136
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:46,560
I don't understand why you're so stubborn.

137
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,560
I don't understand why you're so stubborn.

138
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,560
I don't understand why you're so stubborn.

139
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,560

the wind on my hand also has to go the hua

Because no matter how long you're away or if you don't speak

143
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
Because no matter how long you're away or if you don't speak

144
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,760
Don't die.

145
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,760
Don't leave me.

146
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,120
Master.

147
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,120
My Lady.

148
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,640
What's wrong with her?

149
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,040
My Lady, she...

150
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,880
Tell me!

151
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,960
She didn't come back last night.

152
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,480
Did you find the House of Deer?

153
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,800
Yes, but I didn't.

154
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,760
Why didn't you tell me until now?

155
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,040
Guards!

156
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,920
Yes, Your Highness.

157
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Send 500 soldiers to search the whole city,

158
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,280
especially those

159
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,240
who built the restaurant,

160
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,440
the jewelry store,

161
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,320
and the people who stayed there last night.

162
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,800
Search them all.

163
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,760
Send 100 more people out of the city.

164
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,760
Search all the villages within ten miles.

165
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,440
Even if you turn the whole city upside down,

166
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,920
you have to find Lin Qianjin.

167
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,800
Yes, Your Highness.

168
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,840
Go!

169
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,640
Guards!

170
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,680
Prepare the sedan chair!

171
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,400
I want to see the City Leader!

172
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,960
Your Highness,

173
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,320
Li Yan and Lin Qianjin have fallen off the valley,

174
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,360
and are still in danger.

175
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,000
The task is well done.

176
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,040
I will do my best to help you.

177
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,840
Now,

178
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,920
the position of Lady of the City

179
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,120
must be mine.

180
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,040
Your Highness,

181
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,840
Your Highness,

183
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,160
Minister Lin just met the City Leader

184
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,640
and asked him to find out where Lin Qianjin is.

185
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
No hurry.

186
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,560
The obstacles

187
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,040
have to be solved one by one.

188
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,480
Your Highness,

189
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,920
it's your twisted ego

190
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,520
that's attached to your future husband.

191
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,520
So?

192
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,560
If this aussie learns this,

193
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,360
it's the one who is pining for her.

194
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,840
We're at cloud four.

195
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,040
couplets,

196
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,040
although it has nothing to do with anything,

197
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,600
at least it's you.

198
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,480
Theasha,

199
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,940
I'm afraid...

200
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,400
You can go home.

201
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,520
Linyan.

202
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,120
Linyan.

203
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,360
Linyan.

204
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,600
Linyan.

205
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,320
You're finally awake.

206
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,240
You scared me to death.

207
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,400
I hurt your wound.

208
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,760
It's okay.

209
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,440
Linyan.

210
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,600
It's good that you're fine now.

211
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,560
Does it still hurt?

212
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,040
The condition is not good here.

213
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,000
But we still have to

214
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,240
take care of the wound.

215
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,520
It'll be hard if it's inflamed.

216
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,560
Don't move.

217
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,280
Give it to me.

218
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,840
What are you doing?

219
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,120
You have to take the medicine.

220
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,640
The herbs are not enough.

221
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,440
Don't waste it.

222
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,080
Don't move.

223
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,760
The herbs are not enough.

224
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,560
I can pick them up.

225
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,080
If your wound is inflamed,

226
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,840
who will take care of it?

227
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,480
The wind blows through the flowers,

228
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
saving your face.

229
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,800
May the sound of the flute be heard,

230
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
and may the memory be as deep as sand.

231
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,600
Who will play the flute,

232
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,880
when the sound of the flute is like a painting?

233
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,800
The world is so vast,

234
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,840
but it's so hard to find.

235
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,640
Who will be the one to hold on to

236
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:10,720
the love and hate,

237
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,160
when the world is so vast?

238
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,440
Who will play the zither,

239
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,760
for the love and hate,

240
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,400
that she once had?
