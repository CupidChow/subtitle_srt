00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,940
(Hong Kong Professional Journalism Awards Ceremony)

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,300
I'm very happy and lucky to receive this award.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,100
Hong Kong News, Finance & Sports Every Day

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,540
There are one or two hundred news items

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,700
Each one looks

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,020
They don't seem to have any connection.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,380
But the butterfly effect

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,020
It could trigger a storm on the other side of the world.

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,700
US interest rate hike

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,660
This will affect Hong Kong's tourism industry.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,980
Even the crime rate

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,420
Every seemingly unrelated news item

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,340
Connected into a large network

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,620
Interpretation for the audience

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,540
Becoming a meaningful truth

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,220
This is it.

The responsibilities of journalists

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,780
Finally, thank you, Sister Wen.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,380
It wasn't Sister Wen who let the race happen.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,100
I will not receive this award

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,460
Without Sister Wen

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,900
There would be no Liang Jingren today.

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,140
(In eternal remembrance of Mr. Liang Jingren)

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,540
This summer

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,220
Hong Kong, China, experiences a once-in-500-year rainstorm.

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,100
Facing nature

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,500
George adhered to his journalism profession

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,860
Rise to the challenge

29
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,580
This gives us the opportunity to see a

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,340
The closest thing to the real world

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,620
But facing the unexpected

32
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,620
He threw down the microphone

33
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,740
He abandoned his professional identity as a journalist.

34
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,540
Jump into the water to save people

35
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,860
And so StarNet lost one

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,180
Respectable news anchor

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,780
And I

38
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,380
Also lost one

39
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,820
A good colleague who taught me what journalistic spirit is.

40
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,100
My good comrade taught me what humanistic care is.

41
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,340
(In eternal remembrance of Mr. Liang Jingren)

42
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,020
This was truly a grand funeral for Gu Zhaohua.

43
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,060
It was George's grand funeral.

44
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,860
By the way, why did George win the award in the video?

45
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,180
Brexit in 2016

46
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,980
It's a bit old, but it's full of memorable quotes.

47
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,900
I also understand Liang Jingren's situation over the past ten years or so.

48
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,660
There really weren't any other highlights.

49
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,420
The materials are relatively difficult to find.

50
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,740
But I really don't mind this.

51
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,860
You're in the directing department, so you're the one who edits the films.

52
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,980
Yes, yes

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,980
Do you even have any basic directing knowledge?

54
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,380
Who was he thanking in the end?

55
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,860
Is that person on the Star Network?

56
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,700
Why thank her?

57
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,700
Should we try to glorify her?

58
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,900
I'm sorry, I cut it out.

59
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,660
Do you agree with the deputy director?

60
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,220
I'm only responsible for overseeing the news.

61
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,940
As long as it's true, it can be broadcast.

62
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,820
As for the scope of marketing and promotion

63
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,380
It's better if you, the director, manage things yourself.

64
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,820
very good

65
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,980
You're still standing here wanting me to curse you again?

66
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,660
I'll go right away, right away!

67
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,100
Everyone come here for a moment.

68
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,780
I'm going out to show my face in a little while.

69
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,100
Keep it up, everyone!

70
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,780
Give us some morale!

71
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,300
Know

72
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,460
I know, I know

73
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,580
Remember me, I want (China) Hong Kong today

74
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,420
Only this news

75
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,260
Performance a success

76
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,780
Walk

77
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,260
Are you sick?

78
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,060
He treated today as a performance.

79
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,620
Show your face

80
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,180
This is a memorial service.

81
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,020
Can't you show some respect for George?

82
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,500
If everyone wants to be friends

83
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,620
Attend the memorial service

84
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,060
You can ask the HR department for leave and sit outside.

85
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,540
If you're here to work

86
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,420
Please do your job well.

87
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,540
Help the company organize this event

88
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,100
This performance

89
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,300
Wear this

90
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,740
I remember

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,940
You won't be allergic to pure silver.

92
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,860
We will always remember

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,220
The heroic deeds of Mr. Liang Jingren

94
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,980
Deputy Director of this station, Zhang Jiayan

95
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,420
We will continue to report from the memorial service.

96
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,100
Thank you, Lai Chia-Yung

97
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,180
We are now outside the venue.

98
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,940
The memorial service will begin in about thirty minutes.

99
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,260
We can still see a large number of citizens.

100
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,580
Queuing to enter

101
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,700
Besides journalists and media colleagues

102
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,300
Many well-known figures from all walks of life also attended.

103
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,740
Say goodbye to our colleague who died in the line of duty.

104
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,500
Mr. Leung is truly a model journalist in Hong Kong.

105
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,020
He sacrificed himself to save people.

106
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,420
I was really touched.

107
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,460
I came here today specifically to bid him farewell.

108
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,460
This sentiment is very meaningful to journalists.

109
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,940
Undoubtedly the highest affirmation

110
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,980
See here for the situation on site.

111
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,700
Return it to the colleagues in the studio

112
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,020
Stop, thank you.

113
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,540
Can I take a picture with you?

114
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,740
You are more beautiful in person than on camera.

115
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,460
I watch your show every night at 6:30.

116
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,780
I watched the news reports featuring you and Mr. Liang.

117
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,220
Wen Huixin, right?

118
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,620
Yes, yes

119
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,100
Hello, my name is Zhang Jiayan

120
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,020
I don't know which of Mr. Liang's reports you mentioned.

121
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,300
Most impressive

122
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,980
I can refer to this when I make a special feature later.

123
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,300
Actually, every news item is pretty much the same.

124
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,260
Right? Right?

125
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,020
How could I possibly remember so many?

126
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,580
Each has its own merits

127
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,020
This memorial service is good.

128
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,540
It was done with feigned sincerity.

129
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,380
Everyone is doing this to check in.

130
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,580
Go talk to the director.

131
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,700
Back to the repair shop

132
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,420
Should I give you a ride so you can show your face?

133
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,140
I will definitely attend a proper farewell ceremony.

134
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,940
Knowing full well that they were being pushed out to put on a show, they still went.

135
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,220
This memorial service is simply exploiting Liang Jingren.

136
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,180
It's obvious the new director wants to use this opportunity to announce it to the world.

137
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,100
He himself took office

138
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,060
This can help StarNet achieve high viewership ratings.

139

That being said

After all, George Jr.

Once in front of the entire Hong Kong audience

142
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,460
I shed a tear for you

143
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,500
Has this been verified?

144
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,580
Was that tear a genuine one?

145
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,300
They talk about whitewashing after just a few words.

146
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,500
They say it's a bad ending if they don't pull the hair out of the box.

147
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,500
Everything was just wishful thinking on the part of the audience.

148
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,940
I don't think I need to explain myself to them.

Do you need to take responsibility for George's death?

Who exactly ordered him to go to the front lines?

Is someone hiding some truth?

169
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,820
Every sentence is classic enough to complete your homework.

170
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,820
However, I bet Gu Zhaohua wouldn't dare to broadcast it.

171
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,260
Therefore, this visit can be considered as if it never happened.

172
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,860
Shut down and finish work

173
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,980
There is progress and the questions are sharp enough.

174
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,100
Let's film a car chase scene so we can report back later.

175
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,860
yes

176
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,260
Since we're already here, let's just go.

177
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,460
(StarNet News)

178
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,580
He is Pan Zhiao

179
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,100
Don't pretend you don't know.

180
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,500
The StarNetwork made some great arrangements today.

181
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,660
Of course, they changed the director.

182
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,780
People in high positions don't need to understand the news.

183
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,100
Understanding social etiquette is enough.

184
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,740
The car is here, the section chief is here.

185
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,420
Section Chief

186
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,060
Director of the Information Office

187
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,980
Can you say a few words at the memorial service?

188
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,580
Does this mean

189
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,580
The government endorses Mr. Liang Jingren's interview activities.

190
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,340
Is it because StarNet is a major network that they came here?

191
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,500
When will the investigation results be released?

192
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,300
Say a few words, Director.

193
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,820
We will have a briefing soon. Thank you for your concern.

194
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,820
Why did the press release avoid the main issues?

195
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,100
The issue of responsibility for casualties was not mentioned at all.

196
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,460
The article repeatedly mentioned natural disasters.

197
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,700
Is this an attempt to downplay man-made disasters?

198
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,580
I believe that people in the media should know this.

199
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,460
The department head won't necessarily answer if you just ask him loudly.

200
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,660
Director, please respond.

201
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,620
Today is a memorial service, not a press conference.

202
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,740
Is the lack of response due to something being concealed by the section chief?

203
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,700
I emphasize again

204
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,860
Today is Mr. Liang Jingren's memorial service.

205
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,540
He was also a journalist.

206
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,420
Moreover, he sacrificed himself to save others.

207
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,940
I hope everyone can...

208
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,460
The principle of respecting the deceased is paramount.

209
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,980
Respect Mr. Liang

210
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,220
Today's memorial service is a public event.

211
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,780
The conference also invited media to conduct interviews.

212
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,260
As a public figure

213
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,660
The public has an obligation to exercise their right to know.

214
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,260
Am I right, News Director?

215
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,700
Mr. Liang Jingren is a very senior journalist.

216
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,980
His every interview and decision

217
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,540
All were carefully considered

218
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,860
Today's memorial service

219
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,860
As the deputy director of StarNet

220
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,580
I hope everyone can respect the deceased.

221
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,740
Give everyone some space

222
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,340
Sending him on his final journey

223
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,380
As for other matters

224
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,420
I believe the director will arrange a better time.

225
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,580
Let everyone ask questions

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,860
In short, as soon as there is a new investigation progress...

227
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,220
We will definitely let everyone know as soon as possible, thank you.

228
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,020
Your master used minimal force to achieve maximum effect.

229
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,980
Pack your things quickly

230
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,620
Are you angry at me or at her?

231
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,220
We have no one to protect us here.

232
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,100
Hurry up and get a good spot!

233
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,500
Is tonight's text-only episode?

234
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,140
Uncle and Aunt

235
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,180
Do you think this venue setup is okay?

236
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,820
If you have any complaints, please let me know at any time.

237
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,100
Mr. Gu, thank you for your hard work.

238
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,660
You've arranged everything so thoughtfully.

239
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,980
Let our son leave in glory.

240
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,300
You are truly his good boss.

241
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,500
Don't be so polite, Uncle.

242
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,780
Our StarNetwork is running smoothly.

243
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,460
Everyone wanted to do something for George.

244
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,420
After the memorial service began in a little while

245
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,140
Please come up on stage and say a few words.

246
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,700
I'd like to explain the process to you.

247
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,660
I'll arrange for you to sit in the first row in a bit.

248
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,020
The first two positions

249
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,020
Wait a moment

250
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,820
I want to ask that woman

251
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,260
Was it the one who caused George's divorce?

252
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,660
You...you don't need to say anything, Mr. Gu.

253
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,100
We have only one request.

254
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,540
We don't want to see her here.

255
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,980
I'll handle it, don't get angry.

256
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,980
Zhang Jiayan's actions are clear.

257
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,860
Most importantly, the memorial service will go smoothly.

258
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,740
I went to the control room

259
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,020
(In eternal remembrance of Mr. Liang Jingren)

260
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,540
Please welcome Mr. Leung King-yan's family and friends.

261
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,300
They took turns stepping forward to greet each other.

(In eternal remembrance of Mr. Liang Jingren)

264
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,260
I didn't tell you to drive.

265
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,140
This is for your reference.

266
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,260
Don't bring in wines of this caliber next time.

267
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,100
At least this level of wine

268
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,380
Only then can it be brought into your office

269
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,500
I bought it according to your request.

270
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,460
You can't say anything to me this time.

271
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,620

(Boiling TV)

273
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,140
What's the matter, sir?

274
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,740
Excuse me

275
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,940
The order stated that I wanted a host, and I want to ask...

276
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,020
On stage, sign for your florist. Which flower shop are you from?

277
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,580
(Mr. Liang Jingren died with his eyes wide open, his injustice still awaiting redress)

278
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,140
(Respectfully offered by a former comrade-in-arms)

279
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,940
Hello

280
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,500
Hello, may I ask which flower shop it is?

281
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,460

(Respectfully offered by a former comrade-in-arms)

288
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,500
Why am I not that low-level?

289
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,780
In the past, I would have guessed that it was Liang Jingren who did it.

290
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,100
Now

291
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,220
Let's guess for a while longer.

292
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,020
Miss Wen, are you the one who sent the floral tribute?

293
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,220
Old comrade, what are you doing? You're not allowed to take pictures.

294
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,420
Say a few words and go out

295
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,500
Do you see this line?

296
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,620
Beyond this line lies private property.

297
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,540
I can call the police and have you arrested.

298
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,340
This is where the loss comes from a lack of experience.

299
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,900
The outside is a public place.

300
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,500
There are no portrait rights in Hong Kong, China.

301
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,980
Take photos however you want

302
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,740
Pan Zhiao's memorial service is almost over.

303
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,020
Jiayan asked her to go back

304
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,620
It takes time to tidy up.

305
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,580
Arsen slowly collected

306
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,620
Let the deputy director wait a bit.

(Card Shield)

308

Sister Wen

309
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,340
It really wasn't you.

310
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,060
Come in and say

311
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,740
Now that their wings have hardened, they dare to disobey orders.

312
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,940
Or is that deputy director just a figurehead?

313
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,220
I can't get you

314
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,580
Everyone knows Zhang Jiayan

315
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,180
How did we get our current location?

316
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,740
Nobody respected her at all.

317
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,340
All the capable third forces have left.

318
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,620
The head of the Georgia Party just left again.

319
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,700
They can't possibly accept her so quickly.

320
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,180
How can a general fight a war without soldiers?

321
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,340
To be honest, I really miss it.

322

Wen Jie's days at Star Network

323
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,700
What about Gu Zhaohua?

324
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,140
He has no reason not to see it.

325
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,660
He rarely goes back to the company.

326
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,300
He doesn't care what we do.

327
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,860
He only cares about one thing: the result.

328
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,420
Traffic analysis for each news item every day, down to the second.

329
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,940
We have been trained to

330
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,100
When writing the script, you need to know at what second the audience will leave.

331
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,420
Which frame will be captured?

332
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,660
Look at likes and clicks only

333
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,260
Attracting people to buy ads to help my sister improve her sales performance

334
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,660
What kind of news station is this?

335
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,420
Why not call it a data company?

336
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,140
Judging from this, that flower card

337
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,220
Both the director and deputy director are highly suspicious.

338
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,100
One is for traffic, the other is for winning people's hearts.

339
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,340
Opportunity in the company

340
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,420
Pay attention to any unusual behavior they may exhibit.

341
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,180
Who was on duty that day during the rainstorm?

342
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,780
Actually, among our colleagues

343
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,860
This matter is rarely discussed.

344
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,940
It will always take some time to process this tragedy.

345
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,500
You too.

346
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,660
It's someone else's company's internal business.

347
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,220
Why should I explain to an outsider like you?

348
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,980
Just asking.

349
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,100
However, the less they say, the more suspicious they become.

350
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,780
News is leaving early as prime time approaches.

351
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,260
Heroes are not affected by rumors and gossip.

352
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,220
Regardless of who sent it, thank you for providing the data.

(Rongji Flower Shop)

354
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,260
Hello hello

355
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,460
Is there anything I can help you with?

356
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,620
I would like to ask a question

357
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,620
Did you make this flower arrangement?

358
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,260
Yes

359
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,500
However, our store has an online shop.

360
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,980
Anonymous ordering is possible.

361
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,660
You can't see the guests' names at all

362
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,740
Whom do you suspect?

363
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,300
I'll doubt everyone.

364
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,940
(In eternal remembrance of Mr. Liang Jingren)

365
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,820
What should be done with this flower card?

366
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,500
(Mr. Liang Jingren died with his eyes wide open, his injustice still awaiting redress)

367
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,540
Cooling down is the best solution.

368
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,100
Leave it as trash and throw it away

369
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,940
No need to find someone to follow up

370
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,740
Taking any more time will only allow the murderer to succeed.

371
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,900
Okay, then I'll be going since it's none of my business.

372
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,700
Should I come with you when I go back to the company?

373
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,820
I still have some things to do

374
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,340
Now I finally have time to talk to you.

375
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,860
I am sorry for your loss

376
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,380
Gone

377
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,220
Even the head of the press office came to bow.

378
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,900
Your last report card

379
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,700
Pretty good

380
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,700
You are smart

381
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,580
He patted his butt and left.

382
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,660
No need to deal with this mess anymore

383
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,180
I was left alone.

384
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,020
Just because of a rain

385
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,700
Liang Jingren, you usually

386
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,620
The laziest at work

387
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,700
How could he be so brave this time?

388
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,140
Thankfully, my aunt and uncle wouldn't let me come out.

389
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,740
Otherwise I

390
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,700
Otherwise, I don't know how I would have lasted the entire live stream.

391
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,580
I didn't argue with you.

392
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,540
Why are you working so hard?

393
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,900
If I had admitted defeat sooner...

394
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,780
You won't die

395
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,500
sorry

396
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,380
sorry

397
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,860
I taught you

398
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,820
Even the biggest news

399
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,780
Nothing should be placed above life.

400
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,020
Has something happened?

401
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,940
Everyone outside calls you a hero

402
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,540
Honestly

403
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,460
This is very unhealthy.

404
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,740
This would lead to a loss of objective analysis.

405
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,380
Loss of judgment

406
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,140
You died under mysterious circumstances.

407
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,580
A clear-headed person is needed

408
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,780
Help you find the answer

409
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,900
(Zhang Jiayan, employee of StarNet)

410
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,780
Work permits are not required.

411
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,700
What's so great about this kind of class?

412
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,220
Refusing to repent

413
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,260
I dare not feel guilty

414
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,460
It's not like I'm the one who's handling funerals like weddings.

415
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,460
Thank you, Ms. Wen, for your valuable feedback.

416
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,380
Our Star Network has independent editing and publishing capabilities.

417
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,460
You don't need to worry about the reporting guidelines.

418
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,900
Those in positions of power should fulfill their responsibilities.

419
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,100
Then I'll trouble you, Deputy Director.

420
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,580
Do things better

421
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,900
Have you expressed your dissatisfaction to the supervisor?

422
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,780
Just sit tight in your seat.

423
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,340
They pretend they can't see the mistakes.

424
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,060
What a coincidence!

425
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,500
Just now, a grand show

426
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,500
Now it's another big show.

427
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,340
George is really lucky to have such a good eye.

428
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,500
Why is everyone silent?

429
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,380
Continue to ignore me

430
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,860
I arranged to meet with George to discuss something.

431
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,180
I've always drunk red wine.

432
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,620
Whether in life or after death

433
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,580
You've already left work, right?

434
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,740
You're even less concerned, since you have nothing else to do.

435
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,900
Are there any more?

436
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,300
Count me in

437
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,140
I'm here to check the flower cards.

438
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,780
Everyone is here

439
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,300
You don't mind, do you?

440
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,460
Thanks

441
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,300
cheers

442
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,180
If you can't drink, don't force yourself to.

443
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,060
Actually

444
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,780
Which of you is this old comrade-in-arms?

445
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,700
Everyone wanted to get justice for George.

446
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,940
No need for such underhanded tactics

447
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,500
How about we cooperate?

448
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,060
The name "Idiot" is definitely a good choice.

449
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,620
As expected, he is your disciple.

450
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,660
You've mastered the art of ruining the atmosphere!

451
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,700
Please stop embarrassing me.

452
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,140
First

453
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,220
How do you determine this?

454
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,340
We all want to help George get justice.

455
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,740
Even if that's true...

456
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,380
Each of us has different purposes.

457
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,940
Some people want to get a promotion

458
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,020
Some people erect signs to make a name for themselves.

459
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,020
How can we cooperate with so many hidden motives?

460
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,380
There is a third

461
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,180
Former comrades-in-arms remained anonymous from the beginning.

462
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,020
It would be so embarrassing to confess after just a couple of questions from you.

463
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,060
After all, we shared the same bottle of water.

464
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,980
Now sharing the same bottle of red wine

465
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,220
Can everyone speak their true feelings?

466
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,180
Please wait a moment.

467
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,660
When have we ever shared a bottle of water?

468
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,380
That hostage situation, Tomato Girl, right?

469
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,860
Don't get it wrong

470
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,100
That day

471
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,060
After I took a sip of water

472
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,540
You took the water and drank it.

473
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,500
Not a division

474
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,820
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

475
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,340
We're not in the desert.

476
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,780
It's clearly one bottle per person.

477
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,740
I went back to the company as soon as I finished my work that day.

478
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,500
I don't have time to share water with you guys.

479
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,660
No, I clearly remember it is.

480
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,020
We share a bottle of water.

481
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,780
We were laughing very happily.

482
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,460
The weather was beautiful that day, with plenty of sunshine.

483
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,820
Definitely not

484
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,500
How journalists

485
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,340
How to report a Rashomon-like situation?

486
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,460
Verification

487
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,820
Find video footage and eyewitnesses.

488
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,220
What if no one took a picture?

489
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,500
What if there were a fifth, sixth, seventh, or eighth version?

490
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,420
Even if it really gets photographed

491
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,900
It might not even be a genuine laugh.

492
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,540
This time we can cooperate for mutual benefit.

493
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,660
Next time, they might turn against each other for the sake of profit.

494
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,220
Your story is completely unfounded.

495
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,140
remember

496
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,860
What you see is just your perspective, not the facts.

497
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,420
Others only see the viewpoint

498
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,700
This does not represent the truth.

499
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,260
With your intelligence, don't delve too deeply.

500

Bye-Bye

501
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,140
I need to go back to the company too.

502
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,380
I will figure it out slowly.

503
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,260
You just left like that? I haven't even...

504
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,060
I'm just a layman spectator

505
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,820
Whether it's true or not, you tell me.

506
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,180
However, some viewpoints are still worth considering.

507
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,460
Xu Shiqing felt

508
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,100
There were plenty of bottles of water back then, so there was no need to fight over them.

509
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,060
It's because she now has a lot of resources.

510
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,980
Forgot the days when you had to act according to circumstances

511
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,980
Zhang Jiayan felt she wasn't present.

512
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,860
It's because she felt guilty.

513
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,660
I don't dare to face everyone

514
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,740
And your distilled water ad

515

516
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,020
And what about you, Sister Wen?

517
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,940
You think we stole your things?

518
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,900
To be a king, you must defend your territory.

519
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,500
Not an inch of land will be yielded

520
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,260
No wonder I was destined to be a nobody in journalism.

521
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,580
Bye Sister Wen

522

What will happen on that day of remembrance?

It's such a pity you missed seeing a great show.

532
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,420
What a pity

533
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,460
Wouldn't I look cool interviewing Sister Wen?

534

But then again

535
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,820
Who exactly is that old comrade-in-arms?

536
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,220
I thought about it all night but couldn't come up with anything.

537
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,460
I'm sure no one in my industry could have guessed that.

What are you doing, Lai Jiayong?

539
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,460
I'm doing my homework during the topic selection meeting later.

540
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,780
Both sides agreed not to do anything.

541
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,540
I'm sorry, I didn't know that much.

542
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,460
If one person dominates, there's no competition, so why bother with progress?

543
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,300
It doesn't matter how much you do or how little you do.

544
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,260
Even if I don't have to deal with Sister Jiayan

545
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,780
But there is also Gu Zhaohua.

546
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,580
It turns out that this was someone's first time working the early shift.

547
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,060
No wonder

548
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,340
I tell you

549
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,180
Gu Zhaohua has always kept his three points hidden.

550
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,900
Every day I have to go out and solicit sponsorships and negotiate advertising.

551
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,940
So I won't be back until after the lunch party.

552
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,660
The morning meeting is none of his business.

553
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,540
Relax a little, Sister Jia Yong

554
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,100
So fierce

555
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,420
Pan Zhiao was right, so what?

556
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,700
It seems the US really will raise interest rates this time.

557
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,140
How about we focus on this topic recently?

558
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,500
You guessed all the right things on this topic.

559
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,780
Good, let's give this a shout-out!

560

In short, this dynasty is the most peaceful.

561

If you don't speak

567

The deputy director will at most scold you a couple of times.

568
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,020
But what if you have ideas and she's willing to go crazy with you?

569
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,300
That would mean everyone has to work overtime with you.

570
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,660
If she wants to do it, let her do it alone.

Give a brief report

766
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,140
Because of the number of drones on site

767
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,300
It has exceeded the limit.

768
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,420
To avoid hindering the rescue

769
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,500
We have decided to designate the area as a no-fly zone.

770
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,500
Effective immediately

771

Are you kidding me? Acting first and reporting later.

772
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,500
You turned on the jammer without notifying me.

773
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,940
Don't you need to give us an explanation?

774
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,980
What is the upper limit?

775
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,020
We can only fly again after we've agreed on the number.

776
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,260
When will the ban be lifted?

777
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,900
This has already caused disturbance.

778
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,180
Not to be lifted in the short term

779
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,580
That is depriving everyone of their right to know.

780
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,860
The Chief Executive has given instructions.

781

The most important thing now is to do everything possible to rescue them.

Is it government compensation?

All I know is that you'll keep bothering me.

You'll miss out on many golden moments outside.

791
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,660
Then you'll have an even harder time explaining yourself.

792
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,100
In short, I will notify everyone immediately if there is any new information.

Xu Shiqing, how could you do this?

799

This way of preventing interference

800
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,380
We will definitely be the subject of complaints from the entire city.

801
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,580
I only did this because you said it needed to be dealt with immediately.

802
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,220
It's your decision not to install a jammer.

803
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,740
You're the one who's wrong.

804
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,100
Write me a self-criticism report after this is over.

806
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,860
I also need to write about the memorial service that day.

807

What was my problem that day?

808
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,300
Everyone sends flowers, but you send red wine? What kind of etiquette is that?

809
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,540
Do you know that this will cause a lot of questions?

810

Does buying alcohol cost taxpayers' money?

811
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,220
What special relationship did the government have with the deceased?

812
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,460
These will all be material for media misrepresentation.

813
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,060
You used to be a reporter too.

814
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,260
How can you be so insensitive?

815
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,780
I bought the wine myself.

You represent the government.

Not attending in a personal capacity

821
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,260
I don't care what your relationship is with the deceased.

822
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,540
But don't forget

823
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,180
Your reputation was already bad.

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,420
Let's stop fueling the imagination.

The section chief praised you for being smart.

826
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,220
But you still have a lot to learn.

Be careful about what happens today.

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,660
I don't want any mistakes.

829
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,380
I understand there won't be a next time.

830
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,060
Do basic work without aerial photography

831
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,940
Conducting individual interviews by canvassing streets and buildings

832
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,220
I need to know who reported the incident.

833
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,300
What did the workers do?

834
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,540
I won't accept answers that go straight to the point and are based on conventional methods.

835
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,940
Commander Xiao is the commander of the fire department.

836
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,620
A famous commentator's tough stance is useless.

837
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,900
Sin Man-chi, you have a chance with him

838
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,380
receive

839
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,460
Ah Liang, you talk to the police.

840
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,620
The public relations department has a good impression of you.

841
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,020
They might soften their stance and say a few more words.

842
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:30,700
no problem

843
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,460
Others should not assume

844
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,940
You can get away with it even if I don't assign you any tasks.

845
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,220
They all did street interviews for me.

846
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,860
I need to have emotions and vivid imagery.

847
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,060
If it doesn't meet my requirements, go back and wait for a letter.

848
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,820
Use your salaries to buy new drones

849
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,740
More valuable

850
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,140
Waiting for your good news

851
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,820
Received

852
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,580
Received

853
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,340
The live stream will be taken over soon.

854
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,340
Too late to get up

855
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,140
Find someone to keep the live stream going for another two minutes.

856
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,900
Come and walk

857
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,220
Can you do it?

858
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,140
It's okay, it's alright.

859
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,980
For this position

860
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,740
Give me

861
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,020
Preparing to start a live stream

862
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,540
The program name is followed directly by

863
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,180
May Fourth

864
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,940
Welcome to StarNet.

865
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,700
I am Zhang Jiayan

866
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,580
Hello everyone, I'm Wen Huixin

867
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,420
I am currently in

868
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,100
The sky above the collapsed building site in Lung Tin Wai, Yuen Long

869
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,740
Police issued an appeal

870
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,100
Avoid going to the Yuen Long area unless absolutely necessary.

871
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,780
The Queen is back

872
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,580
Sister Wen

873
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,660
It would be big news if it fell.
