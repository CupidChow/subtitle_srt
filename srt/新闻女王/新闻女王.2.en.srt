00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,500
Ms. Wen, the press office has regulations.

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,820
I've already made it very clear to you.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,420
I'm asking you this now.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,180
Why did my colleague...

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,340
I'll take over.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,940
It doesn't matter who takes over.

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,940
I received this email.

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,180
How to print it?

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,020
I want to get rid of these social obligations.

13

Goodbye, Miss Wen

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,340
I asked

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,740

However, questions asked in a personal capacity are not accepted.

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,060
Ms. Wen, which media outlet do you represent?

22
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,660
What era are we living in?

23
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,620
Please respect unofficial journalists.

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,780
As far as I know

25
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,540
When Ms. Wen worked at a large organization

26
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,180
There are very strict requirements for the professionalism of journalists.

27
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,140
You don't agree with independent journalists.

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,100
Now they're using it as a shield.

29
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,580
good

30
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,660
I'm not asking the press officer right now.

31
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,140
I'm asking journalist Xu Shiqing now.

32
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,620
Okay, I'll answer you as Xu Shiqing.

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,860
The answer to your question is already there.

34
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,180
You used to be a powerful figure in both the business and political worlds.

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,660
It's not because you're a journalist, Wen Huixin

36
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,060
It's because you are the chief anchor of Star Network.

37
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,740
Everyone gave the big stage face

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,180
You've heard the story of the fox borrowing the tiger's power, haven't you?

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,260
I think you've confused who's the tiger and who's the fox.

40
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,020
StarNetwork is a company that I used to work for.

41
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,940
Only then do you deserve to be given face by others.

42
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,100
You need to understand.

43
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,140
All I know is the name Wen Huixin.

Regarding your question

46
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,820
I don't need to issue a separate document to answer this.

47
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,180
One email is enough

48
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,260
The truth is hard to hear

49
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,380
But you should have sensed it.

50

You are now scheduling an interview with an expert.

51
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,740
Does anyone care about you?

52
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,620

73
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,380
What is the extent of the internal damage?

74
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,780
Only then can I make a judgment.

75

We have other questions.

Collapse can cause a domino effect

82
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,420
Could you analyze this from your professional perspective?

83
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,820
Will it affect the nearby tenement buildings?

What are the warning signs before a building collapses?

92
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,500
This can raise the audience's awareness.

93
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,060
I've answered this many times already.

Every household in the building

101

They will share the huge compensation of millions.

102
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,180
They will also bear criminal responsibility.

103

Miss Wen

175
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,660
The police radio station ordered us to leave immediately.

00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,500
Please wait until I finish this sentence.

177
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,220
But seeing this accident

178
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,500
We will doubt

179
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,540
Is home truly the safest place?

The structure of the building below seems to be in danger.

183

In the exclusive footage captured

195

The water tank in the next building is tilted and cracked.

196

It is suspected that the building was affected by the collapse.

197
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,940
The loss of original support caused the entire building to tilt.

Sister Wen, you're right.

202
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,780
I discovered the natural gas pipeline inside.

203
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,660
There is a break and leakage.

204
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,300
There is a risk of explosion at any time.

Obvious cracks also appeared.

There is a risk of tilting and collapse.

The natural gas pipelines inside the tenement building

210
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,780
There were also signs of breakage and leakage.

In the event of collapse or explosion

212

The biggest concern is that it might trigger a domino effect.

The surrounding densely packed old buildings collapsed in a chain reaction.

Let's see when we start rescuing people.

243
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,300
However, the audience's patience is limited.

244

246
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,340
This could cause a serious public relations disaster.

247
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,020
Xu Shiqing: We are just coordinating media activities.

248
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,820
We do not need to be involved in the rescue arrangements.

249
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,940
You're right.

250
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,740
But firefighting is a profession.

251
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,220
We can also capitalize on this to do live streaming.

Let them know that we are not inactive.

We have an emergency response system that can be used in conjunction with this.

Go immediately to rescue all residents.

The residents of the building should be safe now.

Does it really need to be this elaborate?

Make an offer to buy it out

The price is not determined by me, but by the market.

Although your star network is a big platform

353

But you still have to play by the rules.

However, I'd like to remind you

News is different from red wine

356

It will depreciate if left for a long time.

357

I'll talk to Wen Huixin myself later.

358

I won't bother you while you're working as a switchboard operator.

We have adopted a unified stance and condemned Wen Huixin.

Let me say a few words to Sister Wen.

What charges do the police intend to bring against Wen Huixin?

No comment at the moment.

370
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,140
Should Sister Wen bear criminal responsibility?

Did the police respect the journalists' right to interview?

372

Thank you all for your hard work, media friends.

On what grounds?

Sincerity

455
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,660
She did a countdown on her channel.

456
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,740
It's a blatant invitation to heroes.

457
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,820
The entire martial arts world is vying for this unique martial arts manual.

458
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,060
It's none of our small fry's business.

459
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,820
How do you know it won't work if you don't try?

460
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,580
Have you ever thought about what would happen if Sister Wen...

461
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,700
What if I can't sell them before prime time tonight?

462
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,260
She posted on social media that she wasn't making any money.

463
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,260
Total loss

464
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,180
You might be able to find it on a public platform then.

465
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,100
This is cheap

466
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,100
so

467

475
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,220
How many do you guess?

476
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,740
How many people or how much money?

477
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,540
More than 3,000 messages and more than 200 missed calls

478
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,740
Only 5% battery remaining

479
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,260
So, who do you plan to reply to first, Ms. Wen?

480
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,780
I'll think about it first, I haven't thought of anything yet.

481
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,100
I was the only one who captured this historic moment.

482

To be worthy of the audience, shouldn't we choose one?

483

The most suitable platform for playback

484
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,020
Amazing!

485
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,860
Please, you're in your forties!

486
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,100
Can't you just find a regular job?

487
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,020
You must fight with all your might

488
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,980
Can't you praise me? You always have to dampen my spirits!

489
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,380
I just know I can't win many more times.

490
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,940
Therefore, revealing all cards at once

491
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,060
Isn't that amazing?

492
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,260
Don't get in my way while I'm driving, I'm telling you.

493
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,340
I will never praise someone.

494
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,420
You've been praised too much!

495
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,180
I'm telling you, you won't win every time.

496
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,020
So many messages aren't necessarily a good thing.

497
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,340
Think back to when you asked to resign but wanted a promotion.

498
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,700
Mrs. Fang has blocked your way out.

499
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,020
But this time she didn't explain why.

500
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,380
Do I really want to go back to StarNet now?

501
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,660
Being managed by someone who doesn't understand journalism

502
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,380
They are not on the same frequency at all

503
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,380
Would others compromise, or would you?

504
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,860
I'll work on other channels if I don't work on the main channel.

505
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,100
With talent, anywhere can be a stage.

506
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,500
Really? How about online media?

507
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,140
I'm not ready yet, and you want me to be a pioneer?

508
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,460
You see public platforms

509
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,340
What should Liu Yan and Ma Jiaming do?

510
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,780
You look down on those new media outlets.

511
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,380
Self-media and the like

512
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,220
It's not about looking down on you, it's just stating the facts.

513
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,820
Insufficient manpower and resources

514
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,220
Most of the time it's reposted

515
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,820
Only very occasionally will a story that is worthy of being seen be published.

516
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,780
Even with high click-through rates, advertising fees are still charged per user.

517
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,020
How many readers are willing to spend money?

518
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,140
You don't want me to work for free, do you?

519
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,620
You keep finding fault with this and that.

520
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,540
No amount of information will help.

521
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,620
After much deliberation, there weren't many left.

522
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,860
I guessed it was Mrs. Fang

523
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,900
They didn't want me to come and report on the finances.

524
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,220
You don't play mahjong, do you?

525
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,780
I can't play at all

526
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,740
Do you know how painful it is to be one player short for a game of mahjong?

527
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,260
Do you want me to play chess with you? I'm quite good at it.

528
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,580
Two people can play.

529
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,540
This is your solution.

530
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,380
Hello Chemours, I'm here

531
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,260
Turn the air conditioner down a bit

532
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,180
The living room air conditioner has been set down by 3 degrees.

533
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,060
Do you need help arranging mahjong friends for Mrs. Fang?

534
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,700
Good mahjong partners aren't easy to find.

535
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,260
You need good sportsmanship and something to talk about.

536
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,300
You also need to know each other's temperaments.

537
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,100
What you know, what you can say, and what you can't say.

538
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,780
What cards can be won and what cards cannot?

539
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,460
Ideally, it should be acquaintances who know each other well.

540
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,980
I'll call her back for you.

541
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,660
But you need to think carefully before buying the video.

542
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,780
At most, it will only increase viewership by a few points.

543
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,900
Advertisers get 15% more

544
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,380
This has a very low cost-performance ratio.

545
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,500
Is your watch a limited edition?

546
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,700
Why do you want to buy?

547
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,100
It's worth it if it's unique and irreplaceable.

548
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,860
Mahjong is a long game, isn't it?

549
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,340
What does it matter if I lose one or two games?

550
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,140
Look further ahead

551
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,380
I see

552
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,100
But I also hope Mrs. Fang understands.

553
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,300
This time it's not because you're addicted to mahjong.

554
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,020
Therefore, impulsive consumption

555
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,260
Okay, I'll sound out the situation for you.

556
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,820
Mrs. Fang

557
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,580
Do you want to play this mahjong game?

558
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,060
What if Wen Huixin doesn't hit her?

559
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,180
Then everyone stop fighting.

560
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,620
What do you think?

561
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:07,940
(Wen Huixin's personal channel countdown)

562
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,100
(Three hours remaining until prime time)

563
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,620
I've already said it.

564
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,700
Give me a straight answer as to why we disbanded.

565
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,540
Independent Investigation Committee on the Cause of Death of Liang Jingren

566
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,980
If this hadn't happened, none of this would have occurred.

567
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,780
You'll regret saying this.

568
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,060
You didn't regret getting arrested, so why would I?

569
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,740
I only need to be responsible for myself.

570
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,060
But you need to be with your boss.

571
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,740
Responsible to all (Chinese) citizens of Hong Kong

572
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,980
Don't I have to take the blame and write a self-criticism?

573
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,380
These are all

574
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,860
Compensation notice for media drones

575
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,780
Each one is public funds.

576
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,540
The audit team was very dissatisfied.

577
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,700
The government should act in the interest of the public.

578
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,020
Choose the best option

579
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,380
Advise first, then warn.

580
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,380
Execute after

581
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,420
At that time, there was chaos and war.

582
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,300
Dozens of machines above the rescue team

583
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,140
There is danger if we do not act immediately.

584
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,500
Moreover, the media has never been obedient.

585
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,220
If advice and warnings are useful, then please let me tell you.

586
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,620
You still talk back

587
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:15,820
Thanks

588
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,540
You say you're under so much pressure

589
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,220
Why don't you go see so many media outlets?

590
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,060
My first interview for a government job

591
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,220
Is this an interview?

592
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,300
Officially not recognized

593
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,740
If there's nothing else, I'll go to work now.

594
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,860
I haven't finished speaking yet.

595
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,580
How well do you know Wen Huixin?

596
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,540
Do you think she wants to work for the government?

597
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,700
They wanted to suppress me under the Five Finger Mountain.

598
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,700
It makes me unable to be fierce.

599
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,460
Don't overestimate yourself.

600
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,300
Even the Buddha himself didn't intervene.

601
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,540
They just sent me.

602
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,540
You can tell how much sincerity they have.

603
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,500
Rejected so quickly

604
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,740
I'm afraid that if I were to suddenly appear here, there wouldn't be a place for you.

605
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,500
Would you accept this opportunity?

606
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,860
You wild horse

607
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,020
Even Mrs. Fang, a skilled jockey, might not be able to handle it.

608
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,740
How did you end up here as a terracotta warrior?

609
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,740
You need to ask Wen Huixin

610
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,500
Inviting her here is tantamount to telling everyone...

611
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,580
The government tacitly approved the deployment of helicopters.

612
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,620
It's about encouraging others to do the same.

613
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,300
They all play in the gray area.

614
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,420
How should we govern in the future?

615
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,780
Xu Shiqing, you really lack experience.

616
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,100
We didn't really invite her.

617
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,420
Even if I'm willing to do it, you still won't take it.

618
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,060
Seeing the report

619
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,460
Criticism of the government for failing to attract industry talent

620
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,340
Enter the governance team's hot kitchen

621
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,780
If I'm not mistaken

622
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,460
You're just using me to put on a show.

623
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,620
This shows you're also vying for talent.

624
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,820
Then why did you come?

625
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,740
how

626
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,180
They want to use the fact that the government is robbing you to inflate their own value.

627
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,620
Each gets what they need.

628
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,940
That way everyone can submit their homework.

629
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,860
Are you used to your way of doing things there?

630
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,140
It doesn't matter where you work.

631
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,860
The only difference is between entering through the gate and entering the cage.

632
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,020
You should know better than I do

633
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,780
Compared to Zhang Jiayan

634
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,740
It seems you're the one who knows how to compromise best.

635
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,620
(Gu Zhaohua)

636
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,260
(StarNet News)

637
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,980
How long has it been since I've been in this office?

638
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,340
You heard my voice.

639
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,380
Why is Sister Wen back?

640
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:09,980
I'm back

641
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,060
Sister Wen is treating you to a meal.

642
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,380
Thank you, Sister Wen.

643
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,980
Thank you, Sister Wen. Thank you, Sister Wen.

644
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,340
How are you?

645
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,740
Sister Wen, you're back just in time!

646
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,540
Do you know how miserable we are right now?

647
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,820
As for Jia Yan, ever since she became...

648
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,100
Knowing full well that I hate listening to gossip

649
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,620
We'll talk about it after get off work.

650

Come and eat with us, I bought some too.

651
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,380
I am currently non-partisan and non-affiliated.

652
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,420
Thank you, Sister Wen.

Come on

656
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,620
Why are you all gathered there?

657
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,940
Take back your seat and eat while you cook.

658
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,900
Thank you, Sister Wen.

659
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,660
Why are you here?

660
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,140
He wouldn't come back wanting to take George's place, would he?

661
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,140
Do you know?

662
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,100
What is the next line after "A good general has no weak soldiers"?

663
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,340
I don't know from reading foreign books

664
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,900
Shouldn't you be transferred back to manage the English channel?

665
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,180
A strong general has many mediocre subordinates.

666
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,140
It means not needing to use high-pressure control for everything.

667
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,180
A slap followed by a date is all it takes to win people's hearts.

668
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,740
I told you you're a kindergarten of office politics.

669
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,060
Hong Kong (China) is not only

670
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,140
You, a journalist

671
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,340
The report also has more than one perspective.

672
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,700
Exclusive, and you're not the only one with it.

673
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,540
What I found is no worse than your video.

674
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,860
Is that so?

675
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,980
He wouldn't be so eager to buy my videos.

676
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,300
Sister Wen, this way please

677
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,500
Well then, goodbye and good luck.

678
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,220
Sister Wen

679
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,540
And if I come back

680
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,140
The position will definitely not be deputy or head.

681
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,020
Let's talk about it when he comes back.

682
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,540
Even Fei Ye's office was demolished and rebuilt.

683
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,780
It's not a good omen to flee in defeat.

684
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,140
I'm not only good at accounting, but I'm also a bit superstitious.

685
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,060
With such bad feng shui, of course it should be demolished.

686
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,300
We journalists don't believe anything.

687
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,300
Just believe the facts.

688
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,860
Are there any sample photos?

689
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,140
Paid unlock

690
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,140
If I were to say besides buying videos

691
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,980
What else do I want from you?

692
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,420
My sister is interested in me

693
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,780
Although it might sound unappealing

694
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,620
There's an empty office.

695
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,220
On equal footing with Zhang Jiayan

696
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,380
I assigned the position.

697
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,900
Is being a content director comfortable?

698
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,900
Those pretexts can't fool me.

699
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,020
If anything happens, who will make the decisions for me and you?

700
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,380
Here's another special suggestion for you.

701
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,780
Reform power

702
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,340
You already planned to do it before you left.

703
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,660
Come in and complete it.

704
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,420
I don't really like it.

705
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,140
There's someone who's not very good at journalism managing this place.

706
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,140
A knife on his head

707
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,500
Even if we don't cut it down, we'll still be hampered.

708
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,660
My knife is more than just a star network; they underestimate me.

709
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,300
First, let's talk about your video.

710
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,900
Besides TV stations, your videos

711
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,020
I can't afford online media.

712
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,900
Helicopters are so expensive

713
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,060
But if you don't sell to StarNet

714
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,780
I will perish together with jade and stone

715
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,380
I'll make sure the entire bank stops buying your videos.

716
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,100
That's past the prime time.

717
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,300
Your video is ruined.

718
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,180
Perhaps a seasoned expert of Fei Ye's caliber could...

719
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,300
You're an outsider.

720
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,260
Which journalist can you call upon?

721
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,700
Journalism is indeed not my major.

722
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,420
I'm in business.

723
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,900
I don't have those journalistic principles.

724
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,300
I have no bottom line when it comes to doing things.

725
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,260
Your former opponents

726
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,780
They were George Fei's elementary school students.

727
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,700
You can compete with him for power during the news broadcast.

728
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,060
StarNet is a publicly listed company.

729
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,340
I play with stock prices

730
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,580
You wouldn't think broadcasting good news is a good idea.

731
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,740
That can affect the stock price, right?

732
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,620
Do you really think this seat is so comfortable?

733
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,300
Then think about how you're going to explain this to your sister.

734
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,060
How did you miss me?

735
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:19,860
good

736
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,980
I'm waiting to see where your video will be broadcast today.

737
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,700
I bet Sister Wen won't talk to you.

738
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,020
If you lose, you have to do the dishes tonight.

739
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,420
Brother Jie

740
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,580
Brother Jie's Egg Tart

741
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,620
Thanks

742
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,340
Sister Wen

743
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,020
Let's issue tickets!

744
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,260
Sister Wen

745
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,220
Hello

746
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,860
Hello, what's wrong?

747
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,660
Then I'll just say it directly.

748
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,580
I would like to invite you to join our public platform.

749
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,460
good

750
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,540
The helicopter was rented for two hours for 96,000 yuan.

751
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,060
My salary hasn't been calculated yet.

752
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,820
You six egg tarts

753
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,140
Our public platform is still in its early stages.

754
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,660
Income and expenditure are not yet balanced

755
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,740
So in terms of funding, I

756
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,700
I just don't have money.

757
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,900
No money, no connections, no resources, no means

758
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,180
Even the doghouse office above

759
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,860
These are all things that A-Jie shared with you.

760
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,780
You want to invite me

761
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,100
Sister Wen, we won't bother you anymore, we're leaving.

762
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,500
Sister Wen, I've collaborated with you several times.

763
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,980
I truly feel I've learned a lot from you.

764
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,980
It's good for you to learn this.

765
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,180
I have to pay out of my own pocket to work in cooperation with you.

766
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,220
What benefits do I have?

767
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,140
I know you have a strong passion for journalism.

768
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,020
Me too

769
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,740
So which company can provide me with a good stage?

770
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,660
I'll go there

771
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,660
How about it, Aben?

772
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,700
I haven't sold it yet, I'm waiting for you to make an offer.

773
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,060
You wash the dishes tonight

774
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,180
Didn't you hear what Sister Wen said?

775
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,100
The best stage

776
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,140
A good stage doesn't necessarily require money to build.

777
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,620
As long as we answer the questions correctly

778
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,540
It can also attract Sister Wen

779
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,740
As long as the news doesn't end

780
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,900
I haven't lost yet.

781
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,020
(StarNet News)

782
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,660
Come in

783
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,620
Zhang Jiayan

784
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,940
Why don't you hand over the videos taken with your camera?

785
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,060
This is the agreement I made with the interviewee.

786
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,540
The video is not your personal property.

787
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,580
It belongs to the company

788
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,900
Whether to broadcast or not is the company's decision.

789
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,860
It's not up to you to decide.

790
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,220
This video shouldn't have been played if it were for the company's good.

791
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,780
Violating the respondents' wishes

792
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,260
It can easily backfire and cause a public relations disaster.

793
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,340
Whether it's a public relations disaster or not is also up to me.

794
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,620
It's not up to you to decide.

795
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,580
If anything happens, I will naturally find a solution.

796
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,460
Is it to alarm the legal department?

797
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,340
This alarmed Mrs. Fang again.

798
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:29,900
Thanks

799
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,900
But can you promise me?

800
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,700
It absolutely must not be broadcast.

801
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,580
Because I don't want my son

802
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,260
Do you think I'm a bad person?

803
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,740
I

804
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,420
I know

805
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,580
That's a load-bearing wall.

806
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,180
But I still took it apart.

807
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,060
It's my fault.

808
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,660
Then what happened?

809
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,980
Then the ceiling started to collapse.

810
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,280
Then the floor...

811
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,500
The floor began to tilt.

812
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,900
Lastly, very lastly

813
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,780
Finally, the entire building collapsed.

814
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,500
So you think demolishing load-bearing walls is appropriate?

815
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,180
Is this the cause of the collapse?

816
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,700
Why don't you help me check on you?

817
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,420
Everyone come over here.

818
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,300
Let's talk about the direction during prime time.

819
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,260
One person take one

820
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,660
collapse

821
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,980
The visuals are truly stunning.

822
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,900
Explosion and rescue

823
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,740
But that's not actually the point.

824
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,020
We're not making a Hollywood disaster movie.

825
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,020
what happened

826
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,460
Just one of the elements

827
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,660
What we're looking for is why.

828
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,580

829
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,180
I compared the building plans with those of the nearby buildings.

830
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,180
Many engineers and construction workers were visited.

831
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,140
It was discovered that the load-bearing walls were connected.

832
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,500
This location is actually...

833
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,300
Okay, please reply to me, thank you.

834
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,460
I just finished talking to Wen Huixin on the phone and am waiting for her to reply.

835
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,340
It was agreed before

836
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,980
I am fully responsible for the editing and publishing during prime time.

837
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,340
No conflict

838
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,660
I also want the other wife to take responsibility.

839
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,860
My colleagues and I spent the whole day out and about.

840
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,100
How tired and hard

841
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,620
You are sitting in an air-conditioned room

842
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,020
I really can't understand it.

843
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,500
But a simple thank you was all it took to buy the video and play it.

844
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,340
All efforts were wiped out

845
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,940
Who will be willing to risk their life for you in the future?

846
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,020
In short, we can't lose tonight.

847
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,140
StarNet doesn't have the resources to take risks for you.

848
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,340
From the perspective of completeness and depth of the issue

849
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,220
I have confidence

850
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,420
More videos than Wen Huixin

851
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,100
(Wen Huixin)

852
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,660
Hello

853
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,260
Did you see that?

854
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,380
Gu Zhaohua publicly humiliated the deputy director.

855
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,340
Will Sister Wen come back?

856
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,980
Let's test the waters tonight.

857
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,260
If the ratings really sweep the competition

858
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,740
Even if I don't come back tomorrow night, I will come back the day after tomorrow.

859
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,900
First, make the banner.

860
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,540
Congratulations to my news queen on her return to reorganize the workplace!

861
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,660
Very good

862
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,180
I'll send you the check as soon as possible.

863
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,420
But I don't want an electronic copy.

864
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,380
I need the original memory card.

865
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,220
I will send someone to pick it up.

866
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,340
Let's start preparing in half an hour!

867
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,980
Jia Yan will be broadcasting tonight.

868
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,300
However, leave a seat next to it.

869
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:23,980
Michael Rong

870
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,260
Let the best driver

871
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,700
Go to Wen Huixin's place to get something

872
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,140
(Wen Huixin's personal channel countdown)

873
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,780
(Half an hour remaining until prime time)
