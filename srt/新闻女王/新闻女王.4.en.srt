1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,660
Why are you bringing up such garbage behind my back?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,100
Your reporting will incite the emotions of those inside.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,100
It will endanger the safety of the hostages and could result in deaths.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,700
I have already used suspected

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,500
It seems to be not a shield.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,900
News needs to be accurate.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,060
Don't think that using some ambiguous words is a good idea.

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,220
Say whatever you want

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,340
You are facing the public.

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,780
We must shoulder social responsibility

11

Gu Zhaohua told me to say this.

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,900
I didn't say that.

13

Don't wrong me.

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,900
My original words were:

16
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,740
That would be interesting if it were true.

17
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,340
I just wanted to remind you

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,780
Add the word "suspected" before something that is uncertain.

19
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,260
Otherwise, you will be held legally responsible.

20

Tell you

23
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,100
If you're sick, then don't do it.

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,580
I went to the scene to clean up the mess.

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,140
Pan Zhiao, please report this for me.

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,940
Wait, I want to ask some questions.

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,140
Should the deputy director write that draft or should I?

28
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,900
What's wrong with me writing this?

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,940
Your manuscript is notoriously difficult to read.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,340
Everyone here knows

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,900
If you don't prepare beforehand, you'll definitely get tongue-tied.

32
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,020
It means using precise words and a lot of professional terminology.

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,580
You won't report it.

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,740
I'm sorry, I don't have confidence in your draft.

If it's none of your business, go out and do the interview.

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,660
You're so well-mannered, you just let it go like that.

An unprecedented joint broadcast by two channels

51
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,460
StarNet's highest average viewership was 1.2 million.

52
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,020
Compared to online media broadcasts with only 20,000 clicks

53
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,940
It's like others getting a bargain while we suffer a loss.

What a coincidence!

55
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,380
I, Wen Huixin, finally...

56

The situation became so bad because it angered Sister Fen.

Either they are deliberately profiting from human suffering.

Both should be condemned.

The corporation's representative had a private deal with the contractor.

00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,460
It doesn't matter how much I get promoted, I won't report it anyway.

170
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,020
So as not to be talked about

171
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,340
Thanks to public platforms or Wen Huixin

172
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,860
So you also support the news broadcast.

173
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,460
Data is the most valuable thing.

174
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,100
Have you ever thought about this?

175
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,900
How come there are more than 19,000 people in the same frame?

176
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,460
They're all watching on public platforms, not on the internet.

177
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:53,900
don't know

178
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,980
That means more than 19,000 people

179
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,260
They are their die-hard fans

180
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,300
Even if more than 19,000 are expanded

181
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,660
It is also limited.

182
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,380
Even if ten more Wen Huixins came

183
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,140
It will not pose a threat to us.

184
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,300
The following are images obtained from our investigation.

185
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,180
The person in the film is the person in charge of the Prism Project.

186
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,420
In this situation

187
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,100
We asked Wen Huixin to explain the details to us.

188
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,380
According to our station's investigation

189
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,180
Zhuang Yongchang has never shied away from suspicion

190
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,580
Private contact with the person in charge of the ridgeline project

191
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,140
This inevitably raises concerns about the possibility of unfair situations.

explain

193
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,340
Did you take money from the contractor?

194
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,180
I am wholeheartedly for the good of the building.

195
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,460
answer the questions

196
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,540
Does it exist or not?

197
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,220
You should finish reading first.

198

We have been following this matter closely.

199
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,020
After each meeting

200
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,660
Zhuang Yongchang would immediately go to the ATM to deposit money.

201
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,140
According to the deposit slip

202
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,860
The amount and the annual report of the ridgeline project

203
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,940
The monthly fixed consultant fee is consistent.

204
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,100
Therefore, there is reason to believe

205
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,020
The briefcase contained the cash for the consulting fees.

206
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,820
Did you embezzle our money?

207
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,940
No no no no no

208
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,460
You said no no no

209
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,100
No, no

210
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,860

The corporation's accounts were in disarray.

214
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,740
Experts assessed the bid price as being three times higher than the estimated price.

215

Corporate representatives made private deals with project contractors

216

Homeowners also have complaints

217
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,140
Some people used both soft and hard tactics to acquire it.

218
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,140
This proves

219

All four charges are valid.

This is the key to tonight's prime time.

249
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,540
The owner of this company

250
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,260
He shares the same name as the owner of the developer, Qiaotai.

Same declaration address

252
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,140
I believe it's the same person.

253
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,900
Our public platform has also reached similar conclusions.

254
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,860
Please ask the engineer first.

255
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,060
Come with us to inspect Yaoshan Tower.

256
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,540
Examine the building's structural features.

257
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,780
It is usually a leak or seepage

258
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,620
But such a large area

259
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,460
This likely involves multiple sources of seepage.

260
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,500
Even in older buildings, this situation is very rare.

261
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,900
I think it was caused by human sabotage.

262
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,260
vandalism

263
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,180
Could you elaborate?

264
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,300
Taking the above example

265
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,860
You see the inside of the wall is affected

266
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,860
signs of damage

267
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,220
Based on its degree of fragmentation

268
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,540
It is believed to have been made with a blunt instrument.

269
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,060
For example, caused by repeated hammering.

270
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,060
Look here, the cut is even.

271
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,300
It was probably caused by a knife or saw.

272
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,100
Therefore, it was not caused by natural damage.

273
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,140
Before the collapse of the old building in Yuen Long

274
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,820
About two months

275
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,100
I visited the site.

276
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,140
I also observed similar damage at the time.

277
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,580
At the time, I thought it might be because there were too many subdivided flats.

278
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,660
Or perhaps

279
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,580
The renovation workers were not skilled.

280
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,420
Caused large-scale water leakage

281
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,940
At the time, I didn't realize it might involve criminal elements.

282
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,580
I'm looking up the information there.

283
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,780
Like Yaoshan Tower

284
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,660
All are located in the acquisition and reconstruction area

285
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,300
It's another place for major repair bidding.

286
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,220
Therefore, I think the two may be related.

287
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,580
We take engineers

288
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,180
Submitted photo records

289
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,780
Inquire with the Buildings Department, which is investigating the cause of the collapse.

290
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,060
They agree

291
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,220
The collapsed building had been vandalized by a third party.

292
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,620
Affecting the building structure

293
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,700
The case has been handed over to the police.

294
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,300
The investigation will shift from accident to criminal damage.

295
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,740
Qiao Tai responded to this station

296
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,300
Admitted to having acquired through a third party

297
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,300
But take radical measures against the other side

298
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,900
And the dangerous means of acquisition

299
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,780
Unaware

300
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,540
The cooperation has been terminated.

301
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,260

302
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,740
We apologize to the public for any shortcomings in our oversight.

303
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,220
After reviewing land records

304
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,900
We discovered the so-called third party

305
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,980
It has many connections with Qiaotai.

306
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,060
Let's take a look at the following timeline.

307
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,580
After the developer, Kwok Tai, took a liking to the target building

308
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,220
The acquisition was outsourced to a so-called third party.

309
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,660
Damaging the building

310
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,420
Attempting to force homeowners to sell their properties by creating a hostile environment

311
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,180
If it still hasn't reached the threshold for mandatory bidding...

312
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,140
This would allow the appointed homeowner representatives to push for major repairs.

313
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,340
For various reasons

314
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,620
Select the most expensive ridgeline project tender.

315
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,460
Exorbitant repair fees are used to force homeowners to sell their properties.

316
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,540
However, according to what was just passed

317
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,460
Business registration and company annual reports, etc.

318
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,020
Looking at the listed network of relationships

319
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,620
These companies have cross-shareholdings.

320
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,900
They have the same boss.

321
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,660
If true

322
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,260
That means it's a series

323
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,660
Premeditated and planned forced eviction actions

324
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,260
The destructive acts

325
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,940
This led to the collapse.

326
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,740
We hope the police and relevant departments will take action as soon as possible.

327
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,900
Bring the lawbreakers to justice

328
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,460
Prove that I didn't wrong him.

329
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,500
I'm not causing trouble; I'm being reasonable.

330
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,140
As I just said

331
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,740
If you're wrong

332
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,980
what to do

411
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,580
Why are everyone's images the same?

412
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,340
The audience size will differ by that much.

413
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,500
A doubling is already very good.

Besides high click-through rates, our goal is...

416
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,740
It is about being a media outlet with a conscience.

00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,180
Reporting the truth without distorting the facts

418

Seeing you and Jia Yan join forces

424
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,580
Cooperation is one plus one equals three.

425

Or will internal strife lead to a situation where one plus one equals zero? Who knows?

But what made me happiest today was...

427
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,140
It's not because of who I can cooperate with.

428
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,260
Instead, it can help Sister Fen and the disadvantaged.

The coffee machine you chose is really good.

445

448

No, you still have things to take care of.

456

If you won't handle it, then I will.

What did I do wrong?

462

You have many excuses for not letting me sit at the anchor desk.

It turned out that they later discovered the truth.

It was the sound of steel bars breaking.

499
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,460
Will it work?

500
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,580
Okay then, so many dear homeowners

501
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,340
We have a legal advisor

502
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,460
Why don't you talk to him?

503
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,780
Can Qiaotai be sued in civil court?

504
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,140
We got some compensation back.

505
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,740
It's good to have some protection, right?

506
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,660
It would be best if it were possible, right?

507
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,180
That would give us a chance.

508
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,300
The old building was rebuilt but nothing was achieved.

509
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,820
The old building was rebuilt but nothing was achieved.

510
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,420
Cutting off people's livelihood is unethical

511
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,940
Cutting off people's livelihood is unethical

(StarNet News)

513
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,180
I was brought here just to see this useless stuff.

514
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,260
Why is it not working?

515
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,940
The theme of the next episode of "The Truth at a Glance"

516
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,580
What can compare?

517
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,100
The problem solver who uncovers the truth personally helps the homeowners.

518
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,060
Fulfilling the dream of selling a house is wonderful.

519
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,020
What angle

520
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,660
You decide from the angle.

521
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,060
With our connections and resources at TVB

522
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,820
How difficult is it to find them a new buyer?

523
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,900
You'd help an elderly person cross the street if there were no benefit to it.

524
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,900
Reconstruction is what every developer wants to do

525
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,900
Look how desperate they are.

526
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,340
Reconstruction of old buildings often results in empty promises and price gouging.

527
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,660
There are plenty of business opportunities.

528
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,340
Cutting off people's livelihood is heartless.

529
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,020
I received a favor from the developer.

530
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,900
You have won the hearts of the homeowners

531
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,700
We can still make the next episode.

532
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,860
More than just win-win and five-win

533
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,300
You've thought of everything, how could I possibly refuse?

534
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,980
Try communicating with them.

535
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,940
Good news for everyone

536
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,900
The Chief Executive just called.

537
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,580
We commend them for doing a great job with this joint broadcast between the two stations.

538
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,900
Give yourself a round of applause

539
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,780
The person who successfully persuaded them to cooperate this time

540
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,300
He truly deserves credit.

541
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,140
Let's give him more applause.

Thank you everyone, thank you so much!

546
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,540
I'm going to meet with the media now to talk about this operation.

Chen Qifeng went together

548
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,540
Have you thought about how to answer the reporter?

549
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,620
Unsung heroes

550

Thank you, Director.

Hello Attorney Shao

562
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,180
Excuse me, I need to take this call.

563
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,300
Hello

564
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,620
Mrs. Li, where are you? Why haven't you come yet?

565
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,020
The lawyer arrived long ago.

So I need to get there now.

576

The halo is gone

577
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,940
Sorry, Attorney Shao

578
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,020
You might have made a wasted trip today.

579

It's alright, just consider it a visit to Sister Wen.

580
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,940
Public platforms should not do this.

581
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,940
This is not how you should work in the media.

582
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,780
It's not that laymen look down on us.

583
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,940
They can't see us

584

It's just a few of us piling up stones here.

I am Sin Man-chi

589
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,500
I received an urgent message

590
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,580
A four-vehicle pileup occurred on Tuen Mun Highway.

591
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,300
The two drivers were taken to the hospital for treatment.

592
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,620
Traffic was extremely congested at the scene.

593
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,580
It is still unknown whether there are any other injured people at the scene.

594
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,260
There is a video.

595
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,100
Are you kidding me? Why did you change lanes like that?

596
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,620
This is too scary, I'd rather take the subway.

597
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,340
Look

598
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,580
Before the broadcast on the big channel

599
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,500
Everyone knows what happened.

600
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,540
It's no use saying all this.

601
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,500
I ask you

602
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,060
Why are prime-time news ratings so high?

603
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,020
Still so good

604
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,820
Wouldn't it be better to have a convenient package help you organize everything?

605
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,540
Therefore, the opponent in the first round of the open platform is speed.

606
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,380
The second is depth.

607
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,740
Speed ​​Depth

608
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,620
What you need are funds, resources, and manpower.

609
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,380
Do you have it?

610
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,580
Here we go again, I don't know if it's real or fake.

(Please enter the correct answer)

613
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,660
It first appeared online in 2008.

614
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,020
The mystery created by the mysterious organization Cicada

615
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,260
The statement at the time said

616
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,740
Using puzzle-solving methods

617
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,460
To find the world's top and smartest people

618
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,700
Unfortunately, no one solved it by the deadline.

619
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,740
It remains an unsolved case to this day.

620
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,620
The second question appeared in 2012.

621
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,260
This time it was supposedly by a

622
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,860
Biology students solved it.

623
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,860
Successfully met the cicada

624
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,740
There was only one issue discussed.

625
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,860
If you get one million US dollars

626
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,100
What can you do?

627
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,460
I remember this.

628
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,580
I was in middle school at that time.

629
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,620
Everyone is talking about this.

630
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,740
2015

631
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,940
I knew there were so many bonuses before.

632
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,700
The whole city was in an uproar and many people participated.

633
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,500
But that doesn't mean it's quick and easy to solve.

634
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,980
I know the result this time.

635
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,740
Someone actually solved it in the last two hours.

636
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,380
But what's strange this time is...

637
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,100
Nobody knows who this person is.

638
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,580
What exactly was discussed in the end?

639
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,700
What did they do with the money?

640
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,380
After that, no one mentioned it again.

641
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,700
No wonder there are rumors that it's a fake.

642
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,260
Ten years have passed

643
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,700
Question 4 this year

644
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,420
What are your thoughts?

645
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,620
You mentioned the news angle

646
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,260
From our company's perspective

647
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,060
Let's start with the news angle.

648
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,900
From a news perspective

649
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,740
As long as no one can solve this problem

650
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,580
These are just online topics.

651
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,940
Not much news

652
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,860
At most, it will trend on social media to ride the wave of popularity.

653
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,500
Or, to talk about the history of those three questions...

654
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,420
What about from the company's perspective?

655
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,300
You want us to solve it?

656
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,740
Use that one million US dollars to help the public platform

657
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,340
Why not have both?

658
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,940
Our computers are inferior to humans, and we have fewer human brains.

659
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,740
How to solve it?

660
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,380
Solving it would certainly be news.

661
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,820
But it can't be solved.

662
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,780
Finding out who the cicada is is one direction for reporting.

663
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,860
Finding college students is the second thing.

664
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,180
Or else

665
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,980
Finding a third mysterious person to solve the puzzle would also work.

666
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,060
Is there a problem?

667
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,860
What is Cicada?

668
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,940
Cicada Cicada

669
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,660
I thought it was a moth.

670
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,180
Excuse me

671
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,060
I'm counting on you.

672
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,540
Is anyone free?

673
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,700
We're busy helping Jiayan with a quick, clear-eyed assessment.

674
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,740
Okay, you're busy

675
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,500
intern

676
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,340
Gu Zhaohua Gu Zhaohua

677
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,740
Here's a mobile phone

678
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,820
I'll send you a link.

679
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,380
This is a winner-takes-all game.

680
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,020
Solve it as soon as possible, no matter what.

681
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,900
Received

682
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,540
I want to be the first to report this news.

683
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,380
Our Star Network

684
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,300
No problem, I know.

685
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,300
Go for a limited time!

686
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,460
(search)

687
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,220
(Please enter the correct answer)

688
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,100
(Public Platform)

689
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,180
(Public Platform)

690
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,220
I guessed you would come.

691
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,340
I miss you so much

692
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,700
I really miss you.

693
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,940
This is us.

694
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,020
Reasons for not being able to work in the same company

695
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,860
I know you were fired by StarNet.

696
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,860
You're looking for a job.

697
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,260
And that is my answer.

698
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,620
Am I not worthy of your chance?

699
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,980
I invited you.

700
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,340
We'll just keep going like this for the rest of our lives.

701
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,540
It won't do you any good.

702
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,420
I originally thought you were on StarNet.

703
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,620
Standing alone at the anchor desk

704
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,020
I am truly proud of you.

705
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,820
Why don't you cherish it?

706
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,660
I think it's time for you to let go of the rest.

707
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,460
Think carefully about your future

708
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,780
I've thought about it.

709
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,740
I feel that this is where my future lies.

710
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,340
Pan Zhiao, this place is not suitable for you

711
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,180
You should go to a bigger stage

712
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,700
This is just an excuse.

713
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,620
Hello

714
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,180
Whether it's the truth or a lie

715
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,860
One excuse or a thousand excuses

716
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,060
I won't invite you.

717
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,860
Go back.

718
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,860
Is he alright?

719
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,900
He was fired by StarNet and came looking for a job.

720
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,620
We don't have the money to pay him a salary.

721
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,380
(Cryptocrypt)

722
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,740
What are you doing, looking up books and decoding?

723
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,420
Everyone outside uses supercomputers

724
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,260
No solution was found even after calculating all possibilities.

725
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,460
The method we use on our public platform is to search for books.

726
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,740
I think trying at least offers a glimmer of hope.

727
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,620
If you don't try, you really have no chance at all.

728
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,980
Miss, look

729
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,060
IQ 150

730
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,700
A math professor who often plays with decoding

731
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,620
The challenge has failed.

732
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,020
Maybe they weren't as lucky as us.

733
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,700
(Achieve more with you)

734
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,660
It's good that you're here; he's drunk.

735
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,700
Take him with you.

736
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,740
stand up

737
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,980
Come and drink together

738
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,260
Someone saw me at the bar

739
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,020
Someone saw me come to the bar with you.

740
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,540
Both things will affect my future.

741
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,220
Wang Wei

742
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,740
You didn't drink anything all night.

743
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,260
He is not in Hong Kong (China).

744
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,940
Come this way, where are you taking me?

745
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,020
Haven't drunk it yet

746
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,300
Wang Wei, your wife is so annoying.

747
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,420
Have you gone crazy enough?

748
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,300
If you love drinking with him so much, go to America to find him.

749
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,300
You're not the only one who's unhappy.

750
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,900
I'm also very unhappy.

751
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,500
I also want to get drunk like you.

752
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,780
Let it all out.

753
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,300
But my job doesn't allow it.

754
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,900
You think I don't want to see him?

755
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,020
I also hope he stays by my side.

756
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,060
But I'm halfway around the world from him.

757
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,340
We every morning

758
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,380
There wasn't even time to say good morning.

759
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,460
I've gotten used to him not being around.

760
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,380
Habit of solving problems on my own

761
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,620
I beg you to wake up!

762
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,500
Clean up your own mess.

763
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,660
Don't tell me you can't.

764
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,180
People in this world are forced into their ways.

765
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,820
No one is indispensable.

766
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,700
You go first, I'll handle this.

767
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,340
Why can't I find a job?

768
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,660
Didn't Sister Wen take you in?

769
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,140
Did Ah Ben from the mistress's station contact you?

770
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,500
Huixing Network

771
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,060
Ignore Gu Zhaohua, I'll treat you.

772
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,620
Did I hear that right?

773
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,020
Why

774
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,220
Those in the TV department who can sit at the anchor desk

775
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,540
There are only a few left.

776
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,460
If I abandon you because of personal grudges

777
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,860
That's no different from those who engage in power struggles.

778
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,540
I don't want to become the person I hate the most.

779
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,660
Right?

780
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:10,940
Come

781
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,900
(Finish)

782
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,500
Sister Jiayan, do you mind if I sit here?

783
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,020
Thanks

784
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,660
Eat with Sister Jiayan

785
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,300
Sister Jiayan, would you like me to get you some more coffee?

786
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,620
That's fine.

787
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,060
Thank you for coming.

788
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,580
Should we add Sister Nai Jiayan?

789
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,300
That's fine.

790
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,220
That's enough, thank you.

791
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,380
I've come up with a way to deal with Pan Zhiao.

792
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,380
How to deal with firing him

793
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,620
It's not that simple.

794
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,220
Please ask him to come back.

795
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,780
Kill the chicken to scare the monkey, then win people over with virtue.

796
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,220
You be the bad guy, I'll be the good guy.

797
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,980
You cook, I pay.

798
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,740
I knew it

799
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,180
I'm getting better and better at this game.

800
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,380
I just started playing

801
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,740
Do not know how to control the heat

802
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,060
That's a bit too much.

803
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,220
Now they've learned their lesson.

804
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,300
I just sent you an email.

805
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,220
Forward this to yourself later.

806
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,220
Okay?

807
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,700
(mistake)

808
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,220
This topic

809
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,180
Which elements have news value?

810
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,060
The puzzle will be removed after seven days.

811
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,340
The whole city wants to be the first to solve it.

812
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,900
Significance once sparked a craze ten years ago

813
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,620
Its reappearance will attract a lot of attention.

814
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,340
Proximity-based social media is bound to be seen

815
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,020
Special investment

816
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,460
The fun factor itself already contains suspense.

817
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,660
There are also bonuses!

818
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,740
Sister Jiayan

819
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,500
So, in fact, besides its importance...

820
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,860
All other elements are included.

821
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,620
If not reported

822
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,420
It has no impact on Hong Kong's economy and people's livelihood.

823
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,540
Only fun

824
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,940
Who told you to sign up?

825
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,420
It's me

826
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,660
Gu Zhaohua Gu Zhaohua

827
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,420
Still standing here

828
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,060
Limited-time continued play received

829
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,300
Let's chat for a bit.

830
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,700
I'm tired of saying it.

831
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,020
He also said I have the right to decide on news editing.

832
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,580
Forgetful

833
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,220
It's your decision, not all of it.

834
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,940
So you like playing with language arts.

835
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,260
Star News

836
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,140
Not Zhang Jiayan news

837
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,500
We serve a broad audience.

838
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,020
Of course, their feelings must be taken into consideration.

839
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,460
Moreover, there are reports on public platforms.

840
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,460
If Wen Huixin has received a report, then she meets the criteria.

841
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,780
(mistake)

842
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,740
(Opening the mosquito net - nursery rhyme)

843
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,020
(Cryptographic terminology: Encryption algorithm)

844
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,940
Someone has passed the first level.

845
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,500
How many levels are there in total?

846
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,780
Could it be that they don't want to give away the money?

847
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,060
It has hundreds of levels to keep you entertained.

848
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:02,940
What's wrong

849
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,140
What's going on?

850
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,380
Have I made it to the second stage?

851
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,460
(Please enter the correct answer)

852
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,140
What did you do?

853
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,500
So amazing

854
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,620
It turns out to be the Caesar encryption.

855
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,580
(Caesar's Cryptography)

856
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,300
All letters are moved by the same amount.

857
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:18,820
right

858
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,860
It's amazing that no one discovered such a simple method.

859
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,660
No way!

860
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,780
The examples in this book are

861
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,100
Open the mosquito net

862
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,820
Open the mosquito net

863
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,700
Just move according to these numbers

864
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,740
You will get

865
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,740
The first group of words before Hypertext Transfer Protocol

866
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,420
The URL for the second level

867
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,780
Children's books

868
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,140
It turns out that solving puzzles requires not cleverness, but foolishness.

869
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,340
Released in 1998

870
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,260
People who can read this book and understand it

871
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,020
I guess he

872
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,980
The person who sets the questions should be over thirty years old.

873
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,620
High intelligence goes without saying

874
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,380
But you must have a sense of humor and nostalgia.

875
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,780
As long as we find out what's special about this book

876
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,140
That might lead to the discovery of this person.

877
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,020
You continue with the second level, I'll investigate.
