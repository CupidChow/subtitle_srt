(Liu Yan, employee of StarNet)

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,460
Liu Yan, Liu Yan, I'm so sorry.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,420
Your master won't let him go.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,900
I need to eat quickly, there are only fifteen minutes left!

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,540
They were all sweating.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,060
Drink a little

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:28,940
Thanks

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,260
This is how to make fried rice

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,620
Why don't you resign?

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,820
StarNet is not what it used to be.

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,540
There are so many problems with illegal racing.

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,300
They didn't investigate or clarify.

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,740
Just broadcast it like this

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,300
I really can't accept it

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,060
StarNetwork remains unchanged

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,380
What has changed is Jia Yan.

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,820
No matter what

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,580
I think here

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,860
There's nothing left for me to keep.

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,340
Okay then.

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,420
All roads lead to Rome, let's take them together.

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,220
I worked at two companies before, and both went bankrupt.

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,020
Next, we went to StarNet.

24
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,780
I know everyone laughs at me behind my back, calling me a traitor.

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,420
I don't want to be a slave to four masters.

26
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,940
not to mention

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,500
Perhaps every company has its own George.

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,860

Zhang Jiayan

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,420
Perhaps this is how the world is.

31
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,180
I'm unhappy no matter where I go.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,180
You can be disappointed in people

33
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,740
But you can't be disappointed by the news.

34
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,500
Okay, that's fine.

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,940
Let's create a platform and do it ourselves.

36
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,220
Are you a rich kid who just opens fires like that?

37
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,420
The barrier to entry for online media is very low now.

38
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,340
All you need are hands, feet, and a mobile phone.

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,700
Didn't you say before...?

40
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,340
Do only third-rate people work in online media?

41
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,260

Plus your tendency to overthink things

45

I don't believe it.

49

Online media can actually do this

50
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,620
It's not just about grabbing attention and traffic.

51
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,300
We don't need to go through any procedures.

52

55
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,620
From now on, the reporters will be us, and the editors will be us.

Most importantly, we must be true to our conscience.

We will strive to be the most credible

62

Netizens will immediately verify the news upon seeing it.

Or you can tell me a reason.

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,900
Why I don't buy Wen Huixin's videos

103

Who says I don't want you to buy?

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,620
I'm trying to persuade you to buy.

106
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,620
Wen Huixin coming back will not do you any good.

Who would be so stupid?

108
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,420
Hire a boss to manage you

109
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,380
You would be even less willing to have your power divided.

110
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,580
But at the same time, you also need to explain to Mrs. Fang.

111
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,220
We must attract talent, and we absolutely must attract them.

112
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,300
We can't let her and Xing Network lose face.

113
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,740
So you're in a dilemma.

114
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,940
I'll do the math.

115
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,060
But you didn't get to the point.

116
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,940
I have a way to have the best of both worlds.

117

Are you interested in listening?

118

Buy the video

119

But it won't be broadcast.

120
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,380
StarNet broadcasting is equivalent to announcing to the outside world

121
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,260
Our people are incompetent.

122
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,700
We must rely on Wen Huixin to save the nation.

123

Not broadcasting means losing some money.

124
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,820
But it can't be broadcast on other channels either.

There are signs of tilting and leaking.

This younger sister has really taken me to heart.

In order not to compete with StarNet

343
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,780
To condescend to become an online media outlet

344
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,380
Specially changed the track

Online news and traditional news are two different worlds.

I need to readjust the rhythm and angle completely.

Reduced exposure

349
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,980
Public credibility has also been compromised.

The entire personal brand needs to be rebuilt.

351
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,700
She also made a great sacrifice.

Let her experience setbacks and learn that things aren't easy.

355

I'll figure it out by then.

It's a huge disadvantage if others have something we don't.

I think the owners' meeting is more important.

This can be considered as a follow-up to the collapse incident.

393

It is an indicator of future community development.

In Sister Wen's eyes, we are also at this level.

Don't say that.

506

507
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,780

How about we do a survey before we begin?

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,340
Is it okay to do an interview?

520

522
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,780
It's a bit difficult to get them to do an interview.

What is the purpose of today's meeting, Mr. Zhuang?

531
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,700
Actually, our Yaoshan Tower

532
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,780
Compared to the old buildings that just collapsed in Yuen Long

533
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,900
The building is even older

534
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,340
The situation is even more serious due to years of disrepair.

535
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,780
Concrete often falls down.

536
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,740

I'm not kidding.

541
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,060
We are also very worried that something unexpected might happen.

542
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,660
So we hope to speed things up.

544

Therefore, the bidding deadline was brought forward.

Calm down, ignore her, and start the bidding immediately.

Don't believe him; he's trying to harm everyone.

Listen to what he has to say first, then sit down.

553

Sit down, Sister Fen, please listen to what Mr. Zhuang has to say.

You can't be the only one who opposes it.

There was no surveillance system and no security guards.

And accidents happen frequently.

777

My name is Li Jiajun

837
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,420
You can call me Jiajun

838
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,940
You can tell me if you need anything.

839
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,340
Actually, it's like this.

840
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,060
All the other homeowners are no longer young.

841
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,860
Why don't you let them go first?

842
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,940
Can I sit here and talk to you slowly?

843
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,140
Good good good good

844
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,380
There's no going back now.

845
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,500
Sister Fen, please think it over carefully.

846
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,620
If anything happens

847
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,860
This live broadcast is evidence presented in court.

848
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,420
You've made such a big fuss now.

849
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,380
It's all because of the tension at Yaoshanlou that you're here.

850
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,140
If you really do end up in jail in the future

851
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,220
I won't be able to go home.

852
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,180
To Sister Fen

853
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,700
I'm old and have a weak heart, I can't be scared.

854
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,020
Let us go first.

855
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,580
Sister Fen, it's time for me to take my medicine. The medicine is at home.

856
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,140
I also need to rush home to take care of my grandson.

857
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,900
Actually, I also have a bit of diabetes.

858
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,460
You can't leave.

859
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,420
Good good good good

860
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,900
And me too.

861
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,540
I haven't passed my probation period yet.

862
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,860
Sister Fen, she's just an intern.

863
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,380
Our public platforms are different.

864
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,900
We already have an audience; we have experience.

865
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,740
I'll stay and continue the live stream for you.

866
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,740
You tell them I'm not mentally ill.

867
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,620
I will definitely help you.

868
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,140
Please let us go.

869
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,060
Let us go.

870
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,580
Please help me, Sister Fen.

871
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,580
Please let us go.

872
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,940
Let them go

873
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,180
Thank you, Sister Fen. Thank you, Sister Fen.

874
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,540
This way, this way, this way

875
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,980
Okay, come here, come here.

876
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,740
Thanks

Okay, let me know if you need anything.

I can definitely help you.

You can't help me.

I Want to See Star Network Wen Huixin

884
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,460
She's the only one who can help me so much.

885
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,300
Okay, okay, calm down, Sister Fen.

886
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,820
You want to see Wen Huixin, right?

887
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,140
No problem, give me some time.

888
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,900
I'll make the arrangements now.

889
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,540
Please bring her to see you soon, calm down.

890
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,020
We found the suspect.

891
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,060
Engaged in suspected prostitution activities in the building

892
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,380
Moreover, there are gambling debt issues.

893
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,980
I owe the bank approximately 800,000

894
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,740
This is sufficient to prove that this hostage incident

895
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,020
It's not as simple as the suspect claims, that it's for justice.

896
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,460
Rather, it involves economic difficulties.

897
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,340
Debt disputes

898
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,900
You leave

899
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,340
You're still hiding something.

900
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,260
I won't go, I won't go, I won't go.

901
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,460

They lied.

905
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,900
You said they would help me, you lied to me.

906
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,260
Now they have found the bank's debt collection letter.

907
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,300
This evidence is against you.

908
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,420
We have no way to control public opinion.

909
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,140
But calm down and don't do anything rash.

910
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,220
I just want to live here until I die.

911
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,140
Why are you forcing me like this?

912
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,900
The repair cost is now over 300,000 yuan.

913
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,900
That's his fault.

914
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,900
It's unreasonable of him.

915
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,900
Come here

916
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,260
Why don't you come any closer?

917
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,100
Sister Fen, what are you doing?

918
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,620
Don't come over, save my life!

919
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,020
Don't come any closer! Help! Help!

920
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,860
Help! Don't come any closer!

921
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,780
There is no way out.

922
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,380
We will perish together.

Sister Fen Sister Fen Sister Fen

924
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,620
There's no need to make such a big fuss. Let's talk things out calmly.

925
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,660
Is the repair cost to be shared by everyone?

926
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,900
It's not about the money now.

927
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,620
It's a matter of principle.

928
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,500
You're such a bastard!

929
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,940
They're taking advantage of us long-time homeowners because we're afraid of trouble.

930
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,260
I dare not say anything

931
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,620
Interfering with and manipulating the group to steal all our money

932
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,500
You're the one who deserves to die.

933

Excuse me, may I pass?

Miss Wen, please...

The situation inside is very critical, and they need your help.

How is Sister Wen?

940
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,580
Sister Fen took Mr. Zhuang to the rooftop.

941
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,140
Her emotions are very unstable.

942
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,860
The rooftop is over there, follow me.

943
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,140
Sister Fen, don't do anything foolish.

944
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,700
While there is still room for maneuver.

945
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,260
Can you come here first?

946
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,460
You wanted to see Wen Huixin, so I brought her.

947
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,140
Hello Sister Fen, I am Wen Huixin

948
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,900
Actually, I've been following up on the Yaoshan Tower matter.

949
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,020
Many problems were discovered.

950
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,180
I have already found the information.

951
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,980
It was handed over to the police and the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC).

952
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,820
Later on the public platform

953
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,500
We will share what we find with everyone.

954
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,820
The truth will come out in time.

955
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,020
I don't want any public platform.

956
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,220
I contacted Wen Huixin because I wanted to broadcast on Xingwang.

957
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,060
I have left StarNet.

958
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,940
I want Wen Huixin from Star Network

959
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,660
I don't want Wen Huixin from other channels.

960
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,460
I want the highest-rated news in Hong Kong (China).

961
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,660
Help me get justice and give me an answer.
