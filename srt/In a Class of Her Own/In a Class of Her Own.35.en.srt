-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

6
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,060
-Go now.
-Let's go.

7
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,420
Go after them.

8

Let's go.

Xiao Man.

10
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,860
Mr. Wen, you go first.

11
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,300
Their target isn't me,

12
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,380
I can handle them.

13
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,380
-Go now.
-How can I leave you here?

14
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,620
I am their target.

15
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,300
So you go now, I can't implicate you.

16
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,120
Then we shall live and die together.

17
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,340
I'm not worth it. Go now.

18
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,820
I said...

19
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,780
that we shall live and die together.

20
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,100
Actually, I have deceived you.

21
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,340
I don't deserve your love,

22

let alone your life.

23
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,420
You deceived me?

24
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,300
About what?

25
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,700
Actually...

26
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,380
Actually, I am a woman.

27
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,540
No wonder...

28
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,380
No wonder...

29
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,180
I'm so stupid.

30
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,420
Are you all right?

31
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,780
What are you doing?

32
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,880
-Little Brother.
-Who are you?

33
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,500
Come. Get on my back.

34
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,220
Careful.

35
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,740
Let's go.

36
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,060
What's going on?

37
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,540
I heard that the prisoner wagon
was hijacked.

38
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,860
How is Wen Bin?

39
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,060
I managed to hold them back for a while.

40
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,420
Another flyer distributor
ran this way with Wen Bin,

41
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,380
but I couldn't find them.

42
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,140
Another flyer distributor?

43
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,300
But...

44
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,780
But I only saw...

45
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,580
Han Sheng Zhi and Mu Xiao Man...

46
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,700
going that way on a horse.

47
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,820
It was Mu Xiao Man.

48
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,620
No wonder she looked familiar.

Why are you here?

President,

53
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,620
I see you're hiding a mistress here.

54
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,659
Today isn't a good time
for me to receive visitors.

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,680
If there is anything, let's talk
about it back at the academy.

Have you seen Wen Bin?

57
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,580
Feng Cheng Jun took him away.

58
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,860
Can I talk to Mr. Lei in private?

59
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,820
-No way, Xiao Man...
-Of course you can.

60
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,020

Wen Bin was severely injured.

73

He might not survive.

74
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,340
And it was young master

About what?

83

Don't worry, Little Brother.

My father has found a safe place for them.

Our top priority now...

125

is to let Wen Bin meet with Master Wang.

126
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,420
So that he can prove his innocence.

127

What?

128
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,220
You said Wen Bin...

130

I've confirmed it.

131
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,740
I have made various investigations,

132

and met with Wen Bin's mother.

133
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,300
No wonder I found him familiar
when I first met him.

134

That explains it.

We need to find Wen Bin out...

before Han Zheng Liang learns
about Wen Bin's identity,

and clear his name.

If Han Zheng Liang finds out
about Wen Bin's identity,

The suspect will be handed over
to the special envoy.

But...

157
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,300
Are you going to disobey
Lord Wang's command?

158
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,460
The special envoy will
interrogate Wen Bin personally.

159
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,660
Go back and report the truth.

160
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,980

Save the formality.

Thanks to Master Wang's
impartiality and strictness.

00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,900
If Wen Bin can't clear
himself of the suspicion,

173
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,740
his life is still in a precarious state.

174
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,460
How do we get Wen Bin out of the
suspicion of distributing banned books?

175
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,580
I was the one who distributed the books.

176
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,700
I'll take full responsibility.

177
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,380
-If you want to punish me, do as...
-Ze Xin, shut up.

178
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,620
My son spoke without thinking.

179
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,260
Please forgive him, Master Wang.

180
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,300
Commander Lei,

181
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,660
you have a loyal and honest son.

182
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,220
You should be proud of him.

183
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,940
Thank you, Master Wang.

184
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,740
I knew the content of the banned book.

185
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,620
I never thought there was anything
improper with those statements.

186
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,380
Instead, I think some of the
measures are far-reaching.

187
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,620
It's worth to be applied widely.

188
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,660
But Governor Feng,
Attendant Officer Han...

189
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,260
and other noblemen in Yun back then...

190
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,140
submitted a request to the
imperial court to ban the book.

191
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,540
When I came back from Gui,

192
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,460
the matter had already been set.

193
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:38,980
Master Wang,

194
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,500
since you're His Majesty's teacher,

195
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,380
why can't you ask His Majesty
to lift the ban?

196
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,340
That's right, Master Wang.

197
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,340
From what I know,

198
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,940
my father is not against
what's said in the banned book.

199
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,760
He must have his reasons
for doing what he did back then.

200
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,020
Orders are to be taken
seriously in the imperial court.

201
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,700
It's not that easy to get that ban lifted.

202
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,160
Your father and Attendant Officer Han
were the initiators.

203
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,860
The banning of the book has been...

204
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,140
placed under the jurisdiction of
nobles of Yun and the Commander's Office.

205
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,220
The state government and special envoy
have no rights to inquire into the matter.

206
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,580
It's called a banned book...

207
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,660
because it's forbidden to be read.

208
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,300
Which also means the possession
of it is forbidden, right?

209
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,080
Of course.

210
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,580
Let's say...

211
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,300
if Attendant Officer Han has...

212
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,220
banned books in his residence,

213
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,780
is he considered to be guilty as well?

214
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,900
You are saying that Attendant Officer Han
possesses the banned book?

215
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,380
Wen Bin,

216
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,900
do you remember before
the second-round examination,

217
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,980
I asked you to take a banned book
to him at San Shen Temple？

218
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,900
That banned book...

219
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,620
was taken from Han residence by President.

220
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,020
There are banned books in Han residence?

221
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,300
Is that true?

222
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,380
Yes.

223
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,500
But Han family...

224
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,620
is a prominent family in Yun.

225
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,340
Han Zheng Liang is an
attendant officer of the governor.

226
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,580
Even though Master Wang
is the special envoy,

227
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,380
he still doesn't have the authority
to order a search at Han residence.

228
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,260
We are the president's classmates.

229
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,620
Classmates paying a
visit to the president...

230
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,860
Doesn't this sound normal?

231
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,620
Le Xuan, you're smart indeed.

232
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,980
In that case,

233
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,180
you may act according
to Yu Le Xuan's idea.

234
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,900
Gentlemen, how may I help you?

235
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,700
I suppose you can recognize me.

236
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,900
We're here to pay President a visit.

237
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,820
Please inform him.

238
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,460
Please wait here, gentlemen.

239
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,940
Take it easy.

240
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,780
It's Mr. Le Xuan.

241
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,740
Mrs. Han, long time no see.

242
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,540
You still look so young.

243
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,580
Such a playful lad.

244
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,700
Are you here to see Sheng Zhi?

245
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,500
Yes, the president showed us
warm hospitality last time,

246
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,300
we're here to thank him.

247
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,320
You see, we even brought you gifts.

248
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,300
You didn't have to do that.

249
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,680
But it's a bad timing,

250
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,540
Sheng Zhi is not home.

251
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,120
That's fine.

252
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,020
We've informed the president in advance.

253
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,460
He is coming back.

254
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,370
I see.

255
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,250
Please come inside then.

256
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,260
This way, please.

257
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,460
Hold on, Mrs. Han.

258
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,640
-What's wrong?
-This is Feng Cheng Jun.

259
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,820
Mrs. Han.

260
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,460
The reason I'm here today,

261
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,440
other than visiting the president,

262
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,140
I'm also here to apologize to you.

263
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,780
Regarding Lady Han,

264
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,820
I'm really sorry.

265
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,420
Never mind.

266
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,500
Thank you for your understanding.

267
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,580
An attendant officer's residence, indeed.

268
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,820
It's really eye-opening.

269
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,240
Knock it off, Brother Zi Feng.

270
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,780
I'll show you my residence next time.

271
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,660
It's a bigger eye-opener.

272
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,560
Look at this courtyard,

273
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,680
mine's better.

274
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,940
We have to remain calm later,

275
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,860
don't make any mistakes.

276
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,740
Especially you.

277
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,700
How do I look?

278
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,740
Don't let your guard down.

279
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,860
Don't worry.

280
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,580
Lady Han.

281
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,620
Brother Cheng Jun.

282
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,340
Maybe we should leave you two alone.

283
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,300
That's right.

284
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,020
A bunch of shameless men.

285
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,040
Let's go.

286
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,180
Let's go.

287
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,140
-Lady Han.
-Mr. Feng.

288
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,020
It's good to see you.

289
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,540
I'm glad to see
you're doing well, Lady Han.

290
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,900
About what happened before,

291
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,460
I would like to apologize to you again.

292
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,060
Some things can't be forced.

293
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,620
Thank you...

294
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,579
for being honest with me.

295
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,420
Are you and the scholars here...

296
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,940
to see my brother?

297
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:12,940
To be honest,

298
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,460
we're here to find a way to save Wen Bin.

299
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,460
How is Mr. Wen Bin now?

300
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,940
He's safe for now.

301
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,859
But...

302
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,020
we have to find the evidence now...

303
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,140
to clear his name.

304
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,020
Is there anything I can do to help?

305
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,660
You've already done me a
big favour by meeting me.

306
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,420
Don't flatter me.

307
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,740
Mr. Feng,

308
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,340
do you have...

309
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,900
someone you like now?

310
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,340
I wonder who the lucky girl is.

311
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,820
I give you my best wishes.

312
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,250
You are a fine lady,

313
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,580
you'll find your special someone.

314
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,460
Who knows what the future holds.

315
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,160
But I believe...

316
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,740
that everyone has their own fate.

317
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,580
Greetings, Master Wang.

318
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,300
Greetings, Lord Mo.

319
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,420
The man in black suit,

320
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,460
I've been trying to hunt him
down for quite some time.

321
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,100
I've fought him a couple of times.

322
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,820
I'm certain...

323
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,940
that he isn't as tiny as Mr. Wen Bin.

324
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,220
Also,

325
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,180
after the man in black suit injured me,

326
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,900
I noticed he has an obvious old scar...

327
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,300
on the back of his right hand.

328
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,540
Master Wang,

329
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,060
even though Wen Bin is not the murderer,

330
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,940
he is still under the suspicion
of banned book distribution,

331
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,020
as he is perfectly capable of...

332
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,620
copying the handwriting
on the banned book.

333
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,580
The leaked content...

334
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,260
must've come from him.

335
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,780
Possessing or distributing banned books...

336
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,540
are equally serious offences.

337
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,220
He should be punished severely.

338
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,820
Well said.

339
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,940
Since the possession of banned
book is a serious offence,

340
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:37,940
shouldn't you reflect on yourself first,
Attendant Officer Han?

341
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,900
Feng Yan Wu,

342
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,820
what do mean by that?

343
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,540
Master Wang.

344
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,860
Lord Mo.

345
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,300
Our scholars paid a visit
to the president today.

346
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,740
The president happened to be out.

347
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,620
So they took a tour in...

348
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,380
Attendant Officer Han's residence.

349
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,350
Those kids...

350
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,760
somehow entered
Attendant Officer Han's study...

351
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,660
and found these banned books.

352
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,820
Attendant Officer Han,

353
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,420
what's this?

354
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,620
I...

355
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,060
Attendant Officer Han seems surprised.

356
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,620
Looks like what Principal Feng
said is true.

357
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,820
Master Wang,

358
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,820
I... I just want to...

359
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,460
preserve some evidence in my residence.

360
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,060
I have no other intention.

361
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,940
Please see the truth, Master Wang.

362
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,060
Attendant Officer Han, what exactly
are you trying to prove...

363
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,940
by keeping these banned book?

364
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,920
I...

365
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,160
According to what you said,

366
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,460
if Wen Bin is guilty of distributing
the content of banned book,

367
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,300
aren't you guilty as well...

368
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,660
for possessing these many banned books,
Attendant Officer Han?

369
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,260
Maybe Wen Bin did that...

370
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,500
under the instruction of
Attendant Officer Han.

371
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,180
Think about it, these books have been
banned for such long time.

372
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,780
Why were they found in
Attendant Officer Han's study?

373
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,900
-Right?
-That's right.

374
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,540
Master Wang, Lord Mo,

375
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,340
don't listen to them!

376
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,420
They're talking nonsense!

377
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,180
I am being set up by you...

378
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,340
and students of Yun Shang Academy!

379
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,500
You need to have proof for saying that.

380
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,580
Han Zheng Liang,

381
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,980
you're an attendant officer of
the Commander's Office.

382
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,100
I didn't know you could be
so unreasonable!

383
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:27,050
This matter involves the
reputation of nobles of Yun.

384
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,220
I will have the commander
teach you a lesson.

385
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,100
Back in the day, Governor Feng
and Attendant Officer Han...

386
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,580
had demanded persistently
to ban these books.

387
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,740
Well, of course,

388
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,300
that was a long time ago.

389
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,080
Lord Mo,

390
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,020
please take a look at it.

391
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,620
The content in these books...

392
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,220
doesn't seem all wicked nowadays.

393
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,380
Some of it actually got a good point.

394
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:53,980
Of course.

395
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,780
I'm merely suggesting it.

396
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,460
But about what we should do,

397
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,860
the decision lies in
Attendant Officer Han's hands.

398
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,820
Whether these are banned books,

399
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,420
Han Zheng Liang, you'll make the call.

400
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,300
Since...

401
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,340
Since Lord Wang has said so,

402
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,060
then...

403
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,780
then I'll do as you wished, Lord Wang.

404
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,130
And I would like to ask
Attendant Officer Han...

405
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,980
to gather the nobles...

406
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,500
and discuss whether
we should lift the ban.

407
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:27,980
Yes, sir.

408
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,020
Since Attendant Officer Han
has made up his mind,

409
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,220
then those who distributed the content...

410
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,900
should no longer be held liable.

411
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,860
Will Wen Bin be all right now?

412
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,740
Yes.

413
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,900
That's good, that's good.

414
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,860
Maybe...

415
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,460
You're back.

416
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,300
Act natural. They might see through it.

417
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,580
Fine.

418
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,860
Brother, Le Xuan,
I miss you guys so much.

419
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,780
Wen Bin, I miss you very much too.

420
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,900
Move, it's not your turn.

421
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,060
-Greetings, Master Wang.
-Greetings, Master Wang.

422
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,940
Skip the formalities.

423
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,020
I received an official notice today.

424
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,140
The aristocratic families of Yun...

425
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,980
have lifted the ban on those books,

426
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,860
therefore,

427
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:46,220
the imperial court will let the
matter of Xue Ding Kun rest.

428
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,740
Is one of you...

429
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,540
Xue Ding Kun's son?

430
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,780
I, Wen Bin, am the son of Xue Ding Kun.

431
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,220
You look like him.

432
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,580
Xue Ding Kun's son indeed.

433
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,860
Thank you, Master Wang.

434
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,780
Master Wang,

435
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,660
may I know what was my father like?

436
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,820
In my eyes, Xue Ding Kun...

437
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,560
was an ambitious and upright man...

438
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,340
who cared about the
country and the people,

439
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,580
and was willing to take
on responsibilities.

440
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,940
If my father was that kind of person,

441
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,940
why did the imperial court order
to execute him?

442
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,060
Back then,

443
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,100
Xue Ding Kun's approach
on education reform...

444
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,260
not only gained supports
from the commoners,

445
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,340
but some of the
aristocratic families as well.

446
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,660
By right, his approach was practical.

447
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,980
And it had brought significant
and positive changes...

448
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,780
to the educational initiative
in those days.

449
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,620
However,

450
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,980
the memorial he submitted
to the late emperor...

451
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,940
was inconsistent with his notion.

452
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,340
The goal and stance that were
completely different sound treasonous.

453
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,740
That's how he was led to his death.

454
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,360
Master Wang,

455
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,660
my father was wrongly accused.

456
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,180
When will the truth be revealed
to the world?

457
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,260
His followers who died
with him back then...

458
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,420
should receive a fair judgement.

459
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,540
Please clear their names.

460
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,980
-Please clear their names, Master Wang.
-Please clear their names, Master Wang.

461
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,860
I have reported the matter to His Majesty.

462
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,420
This is an unsolved case.

463
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,340
His Majesty has ordered that...

464
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,740
the task for the Four Gentlemen of
Yun Shang in the imperial examination...

465
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,620
is finding out the truth of this case.

466
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,020
I hope that you can submit...

467
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,100
a satisfactory answer to His Majesty.

468
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,700
Thank you, Master Wang.

469
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,660
His Majesty is wise.

470
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,540
Are you willing to find
out the truth with Wen Bin?

471
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,880
I think that this is the best task ever...

472
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,300
in the imperial examination.

473
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,620
All your studies...

474
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,420
will be put into practice and tested.

475
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,020
The answer you submit in the end...

476
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,780
concerns Yun's education...

477
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,060
in the past, the present and the future.

478
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,140
I hope you all will get excellent results.

479
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,380
We won't let you down.

480
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,180
You may go.

481
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,660
Master Wang,

482
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,740
it's such a big case,

483
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,600
and it has been misjudged for so long.

484
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,940
If you leave it in their hands completely,

485
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,460
I'm afraid it's beyond their capabilities.

486
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,180
You need to have more
confidence in yourself...

487
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,460
and have faith in your best students.

488
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,380
I've worked very hard
for this opportunity...

489
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,460
to clear the names of
Xue Ding Kun and his followers.

490
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,020
If you think...

491
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,020
that it's beyond their capabilities,

492
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,140
then please find another
four candidates...

493
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,540
that are better than the four of them.

494
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,820
I can't really think of...

495
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,740
anyone that's better than them.

496
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,220
It's just that this is
such a difficult task.

497
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,820
I believe that they will...

498
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,700
present to us a perfect answer.

499
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,940
Since my father is the
prime suspect of the case,

500
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,780
I'll get the answer from him.

501
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,480
Are you sure your father
will be honest with you?

502
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,340
Wen Bin,

503
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,140
since Feng Cheng Jun has volunteered,

504
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,180
that means he has made up his mind.

505
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,540
We should have faith
in his true character,

506
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,660
even more on his morality and wisdom.

507
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,580
Family is the hardest part.

508
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,860
It isn't easy for him to go through this.

509
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,380
But since he has already
convinced himself to do it,

510
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,180
it proves that he has taken a step.

511
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,800
Seeing that he has
already taken this step,

512
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,500
he'll be able to resolve it...

513
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,760
no matter what comes next.

514
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,620
Not to mention we're here for him.

515
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,540
I'll gather those who were
involved in this case back then.

516
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,100
Maybe certain details
have been overlooked.

517
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,620
Ke Shi Jun seems highly suspicious to me.

518
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,460
I feel that...

519
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,780
he's hiding something from us.

520
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,060
Father,

521
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,000
you have suffered a lot.

522
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,080
Forgive me for being an unfilial son.

523
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,260
Son,

524
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,940
you have something to tell me.

525
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,420
Go ahead.

526
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,340
Father,

527
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,380
His Majesty has appointed me...

528
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,860
to re-investigate the
case of Xue Ding Kun.

529
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,340
I hope you can be honest with me.

530
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,820
Let the truth come to light.

531
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,420
If the truth...

532
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,660
of Xue Ding Kun's case...

533
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,340
will cost my life,

534
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,460
what are you going to do?

535
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,100
Son,

536
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,980
answer me.

537
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,620
Father,

538
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,700
I've made up my mind.

539
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,820
Father, if you have committed a sin,

540
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,140
I will take full responsibility for it.

541
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,820
This is a task...

542
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,220
Master Wang asked from His Majesty.

543
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,580
I hope you can help me...

544
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,700
to complete the task.

545
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,140
Looks like Master Wang
is determined to do this.

546
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,580
Xue Ding Kun's case...

547
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,020
can finally be redressed.

548
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,780
Father,

549
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,140
what happened exactly back then?

550
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,540
It has been 20 years.

551
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,780
It's been troubling me...

552
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,020
for so long.

553
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,500
Now I can finally lift the
weight off my shoulders.

554
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:16,950
Father,

555
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,190
you should've told me sooner.

556
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,880
I'm willing to share your burden.

557
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,460
There wasn't a right time.

558
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,180
It would only put
more people into trouble.

559
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,300
You are my son.

560
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,100
I didn't want to get you involved.

561
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,460
But now it seems that...

562
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,960
you are unable to withdraw
yourself from the case.

563
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,500
All I can do to help you is...

564
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,500
telling you everything.

565
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,220
Please tell me, Father.

566
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,940
Xue Ding Kun had written a
ten thousand words petition.

567
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,700
He advocated...

568
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,020
education equality...

569
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,540
for the nobles, commoners, and women.

570
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,780
His petition had received
many responses and supports.

571
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,500
There were 20 students
from rich families...

572
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,380
who also signed the petition.

573
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,740
They wanted to submit it to His Majesty.

574
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,500
But someone slandered them
for committing treason.

575
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,500
Han Zheng Liang and I
intercepted them halfway.

576
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,100
I took the petition from him and read it.

577
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,620
But I found that everything that was
written on it was treasonous.

578
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,300
Han Zheng Liang took the petition away.

579
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,140
He submitted it to the imperial court.

580
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,660
Father,

581
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,820
was the petition switched?

582
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,860
If it was switched,

583
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,260
it could only be done
before I read the petition.

584
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,980
Were you the one who ordered...

585
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,910
to execute Xue Ding Kun?

586
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,380
No.

587
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,420
No? Then who ordered it?

588
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,860
Back then,

589
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,300
the late emperor appointed the Commander's
Office to investigate the case.

590
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,540
But Han Zheng Liang...

591
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,900
strongly recommended me to
investigate the case myself.

592
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,940
I strongly rejected it.

593
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,660
I didn't expect that...

594
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,500
he would forge a document
with my signature.

595
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,780
Hence, the tragedy.

596
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,820
I had just arrived in Yun back then.

597
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,100
My political power was weak.

598
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,300
Han Zheng Liang joined forces
with the nobles of Yun...

599
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,310
to pressure me.

600
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,440
I hesitated...

601
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,060
and I didn't fight them hard.

602
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,740
So...

603
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,780
it was Han Zheng Liang?

604
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,060
Yes.

605
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,460
He controls the military.

606
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,980
If I didn't obey him,

607
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,100
more people could get into trouble,

608
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,660
especially...

609
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,270
scholars of Yun Shang.

610
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,340
Rest assured, Father.

611
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,060
I'll find out the truth.

612
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,060
Good. Good.

613
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,500
Have you seen this man before?

614
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,380
No.

615
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,980
-Have you seen this man before?
-No.

616
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,620
No.

617
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,340
Have you seen this man before?

618
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,420
No, never.

619
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,780
-Have you seen this man before?
-Well...

620
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,020
-No.
-Have you?

621
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,180
Look closely.

622
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,620
-I've never seen him before.
-No.

623
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,740
Let's go.

624
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,340
Mr. Lei.

625
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,740
Thank you for saving my life last time.

626
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,100
I'm indebted to you.

627
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,660
This is the address of the
man you're looking for.

628
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,480
[West District, an old house in Zi Alley]

629
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,420
It's you. What...

630
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,100
What do you want from me?

631
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,440
Ke Shi Jun,

632
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,100
you'd better come clean now.

633
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,500
My lord,

634
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,100
it was...

635
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,940
Attendant Officer Han...

636
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,100
who instructed me to switch the petition.

637
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,139
Teacher had locked the
petition into a box...

638
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,980
after he finished writing it.

639
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,139
How did you switch it?

640
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:27,219
I created a box and a seal
that looked exactly the same,

641
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,420
and hid it in my bag when we departed.

642
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,940
When Governor Feng and
Attendant Officer Han intercepted us,

643
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:34,860
I switched it.

644
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,020
So that was what happened.

645
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,340
You rascal,

646
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,659
why did you do that?

647
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:39,540
My lord,

648
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,860
Attendant Officer Han...

649
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,060
threatened to kill my family.

650
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,860
I had no choice, my lord.

651
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,659
How dare you?

652
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,900
You rascal.

653
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,380
If you make false accusation again,

654
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,139
you will lose your life.

655
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,340
Master Wang,

656
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,180
what Ke Shi Jun said was a pack of lies.

657
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,220
You can't take his words for it,

658
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,180
Master Wang.

659
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,060
I was forced to do so, my lord.

660
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,380
Please spare my life, my lord.

661
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,740
Thank you, my lord.

662
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,540
Lord Wang,

663
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,300
the two assassins have confessed...

664
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,400
that the one who ordered them to kill...

665
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,220
was Han Zheng Liang,
Attendant Officer Han.

666
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,700
That's not all.

667
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,060
Greetings, Master Wang.

668
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,180
Attendant Officer Han instructed
Commander Xu...

669
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,580
to murder my uncle, Gu Da Chao,

670
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,300
as well as the manager and
doctor at the medical hall,

671
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,680
and pinned it on the person
who distributed the flyers.

672
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,740
Lord Wang,

673
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,260
I saw it with my own eyes.

674
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,020
After that man came out
from Lord Han's study,

675
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,740
he changed into a black suit and
carried out the assassination.

676
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,660
Attendant Officer Han
wanted to kill me too.

677
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,060
You are lying.

678
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,300
Tell me why would I want to kill you?

679
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,940
What can I get from killing you?

680
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,820
Because like those who have died,

681
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,100
I know the secret of your ledger.

682
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,380
Everyone,

683
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,540
this is the confession of
Han Zheng Liang's subordinate,

684
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,660
which states that Han Zheng Liang
accepted bribes and broke laws.

685
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,200
[Confession]

686
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,390
[Cao Yu Jiang]
[Zhao Shun Ping]

687
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,780
Attendant Officer Han,

688
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,980
is there anything else you'd like to say?

689
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,300
Han Zheng Liang,

690
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,220
you're unpardonable!

691
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,620
I admit it.

692
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:11,940
Father.

693
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,340
Thank you, Lord Wang.

694
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,500
Skip the formalities, Lord Feng.

695
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,500
Lord Feng,

696
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,380
Xue Ding Kun's case has been cleared up.

697
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,740
Han Zheng Liang has been dismissed from
his post and is under investigation.

698
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,580
The case can be closed,

699
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,580
Feng Cheng Jun has made
a great contribution.

700
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,340
Father,

701
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,460
I'm here to take you home.

702
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,420
Cheng Jun.

703
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,300
You did very well.

704
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,460
Lord Feng,

705
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,040
I have reported this
matter to His Majesty.

706
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,200
Lord Feng, please return to
your residence...

707
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,730
and wait for His Majesty's reply.

708
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:49,700
Lord Wang,

709
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,860
Xue Ding Kun's case has been
misjudged for so many years ...

710
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,820
because of my inaction.

711
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,460
I should be held responsible for it.

712
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,260
Lord Wang, please plea to His Majesty...

713
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,140
to demote me to commoner.

714
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,570
Let my punishment serve
as a deterrent to others.

715
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,740
