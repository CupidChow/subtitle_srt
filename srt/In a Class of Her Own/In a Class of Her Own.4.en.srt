[Episode 4]

4
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,240
Stop!

5
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,120
After him!

6
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,200
After him!

7
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,240
My fellow men,

8
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,759
you're standing on Yun Shang's grounds.

9
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,640
what reason do you have?

10
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,080
We're pursuing an assassin
who'd invaded the Han Manor.

11
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,840
I just saw him...

12
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,800
entering the academy.

13
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,759
Why would our academy harbour an assassin?

14
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,600
I advise you to leave at once.

15
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,230
We'll be gone...

16
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,750
right after our search.

17
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:04,680
Stop!

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,800
Lord Gu,

19
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,840
surely you're aware...

20
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,680
that our academy is
out of bounds to the army.

21
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,600
That's an order by His Majesty Himself.

22
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,680
Do you dare...

23
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,200
to defy His Majesty's will?

24
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,829
Let's go.

25
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,400
Stop!

26
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,640
How can I sleep if I don't change?

27
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,079
Well, you see...

28
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,310
Never have I spent a night
outside my home,

29
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,760
nor have I lived with an outsider.

30
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:39,030
I... I'm not used to it.

31
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,510
So keep your clothes on.

32
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,079
Can I remove my outerwear at least?

33
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,680
Sure.

34
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,720
Wait...

35
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,760
I'm afraid of the dark.

36
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,320
Wen Bin, let's hit the hay.

37
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,440
What are you doing?

38
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,920
My blanket smells bad.

39
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,390
So I have to share your blanket.

40
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,800
Why didn't you bring your own blanket?

41
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,920
The school provides one.

42
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,240
I'll get it in due time.

43
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,000
Look.

44
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,960
Come here.

45
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,320
Come.

46
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,760
Let me beat you to death.

47
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,110
[Take that.]

48
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
What's that noise?

49
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,240
It's coming from next door.

50
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,080
Is Lei Ao back?

51
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,840
No... I don't think so.

52
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,360
-Are you trying to scratch my back?
-Brother Feng,

53
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,360
have at him.

54
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,440
I'm out of breath.

55
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,680
Why you...

56
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,000
[Thank you, Big Brother.]

57
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,350
Big Brother?

58
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,800
It's you!

59
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,170
He's the one who saved me
from the bandits.

60
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,160
So it's you.

61
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,000
You're the one who disturbed my slumber?

62
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,110
Yeah.

63
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,960
Your kindness remains in my heart.

64
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,000
At last, I can thank you in person.

65
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,210
You're too kind.

66
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,000
Brother, it's getting late.

67
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,159
Outsiders aren't allowed in our dorm.

68
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,600
Please leave.

69
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,720
Brother Feng, what's the harm
in letting him stay for a drink?

70
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,720
Wen Bin,

71
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,240
it's been a long day
at the admission ceremony.

72
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,000
You should get some rest.

73
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,760
How ridiculous.

74
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,200
What's wrong with here?

75
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,080
Whose dirty thing is this?

76
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,159
That's my headdress.

77
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,040
What are these doing in my room?

78
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,240
These are my clothes.

79
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,520
Do you have a death wish
or are you tired of living?

80
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,080
Who let you leave your things
in my room?

81
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,350
Hold on.

82
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,190
You are...

83
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,230
-Lei Ao?
-Lei Ao.

84
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,200
We didn't know you're coming back.

85
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,000
What's that supposed to mean?

86
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,880
-We stay here too.
-What?

87
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,400
How dare you!

88
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120
He's back...

89
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,060
He's back.

90
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,120
-What's this about?
-Who's back? Make it clear.

91
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,070
It's Lei Ao.

92
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,800
Lei Ao's back.

93
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Do you have a death wish
or are you tired of living?

94
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,960
This is going to be interesting.

95
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,760
What's your name?

96
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,600
I'm Wen Bin.

97
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,190
Spare me your pedantic ways.

98
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,560
What about you?

99
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,670
I'm Feng Cheng Jun.

100
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,950
From the Feng family?

101
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,640
Don't you belong in the superior rooms?

102
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,320
A freshman should live in a common room.

103
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,720
Hereafter, the three of us
will be living together.

104
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,550
Let's be tolerant.

105
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,080
Did I allow you to stay here?

106
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,400
I don't need your consent.

107
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,520
Wen Bin, let's go to bed.

108
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,880
What do you want?

109
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,680
Forgoing your fancy room...

110
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,400
to mingle with us commoners.

111
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,360
You think it's funny?

112
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,200
No, you misunderstand.

113
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,600
Stay away from people like him.

114
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,080
Who says the noble
can't stay in common rooms?

115
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,560
Since it's not a rule,

116
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,440
you have no right to evict me.

117
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,360
Of course I have no rights.

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,520
I'm powerless.

119
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,320
Only people like you have rights.

120
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,240
In other words,

121
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,560
our accommodation...

122
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,960
and even our lives...

123
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,920
are in the hands of people like you.

124
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,120
Big Brother, please be understanding.

125
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,200
I think you're under his spell.

126
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,720
Why are you so unreasonable?

127
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,600
Say that again.

128
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,960
You're unreasonable.

129
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,440
Let go of him.

130
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,440
Wen Bin, you insolent rascal.

131
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,960
I kicked you. very lightly.

132
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,830
Why are you in such agony?

133
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,110
Wen Bin offended you in my defence.

134
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,440
If you wish to retaliate, do it on me.

135
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,030
A man must bear the
consequences of his own acts.

136
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,240
I don't believe that a Yun Shang scholar
would lay a hand on the weak.

137
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,920
I'm a bully.

138
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,160
What can you do?

139
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,840
Either Little Brother
stays here with me...

140
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,120
whereas you leave,

141
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,440
or both of you leave.

142
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,680
Who's your Little Brother?

143
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,000
You called me Big Brother.
So you're my Little Brother.

144
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,120
You want me to sleep with you?

145
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,400
No... That won't do.

146
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,000
Why? Is it beneath you?

147
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,160
Let him sleep here.

148
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,400
I can't sleep anyway. I'll take a walk.

149
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,640
Five, four, three...

150
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,400
-There's one.
-Two, one. Come on.

151
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,440
Told you they'd be ousted.

152
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,760
-Cough it up.
-A bet is a bet.

153
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,230
Pay up. Come on.

154
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,720
Lei Ao lives up to his reputation.

155
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,590
He's expelled no less than
ten people from that room.

156
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,230
How about...

157
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,040
another bet?

158
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,200
This time, let's bet...

159
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,120
if they'll be able to return
within three days.

160
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,520
They won't return for another 30 days,
let alone three.

161
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,640
Since you're so confident,

162
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,120
why don't you place your wager?

163
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,480
I'll be the house.

164
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,840
Ten to one.

165
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,760
Come on. Place your bets.

166
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,760
I bet 100 strings of coins.

167
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,800
Look.

168
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,720
How starry the night sky is.

169
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,960
How can you be so cheerful?

170
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,680
We just got kicked out of our room.

171
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,800
What can you do about it?

172
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,200
Take the bitter with the sweet.

173
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,690
For me,

174
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:55,090
each day brings
a new challenge to be solved.

175
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,880
What are they talking about?

176
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,080
It takes a lifetime to find a soul mate,

177
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,400
a thousand lifetimes
to find true love.

178
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,080
What are you on about?

179
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,550
We'll see in three days.

180
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,800
I'm going to bed.

181
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,680
Good idea.

182
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,080
Let's go to bed.

183
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,600
Don't you have a place to sleep?

184
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,800
This is definitely your fault.

185
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,030
[Have you treated me as a friend?]

186
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,400
[Haven't I been helpful
at the admission ceremony?]

187
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,000
You have a place for us to stay?

188
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,080
That's great.

189
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,520
We were still worried about it.

190
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,520
Thanks, Brother Le Xuan. Let's go.

191
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,430
Wait a minute..

192
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,800
What do you mean by "us"?

193
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,040
You, me and him. Us.

194
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,640
Thanks for showing your kindness.

195
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,480
[I can only show
my kindness to one person.]

196
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,880
Aren't you staying alone?

197
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,080
I am.

198
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,110
But...

199
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,600
my room is too small for three people.

200
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,000
But it's perfect for you and me.

201
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,570
It's okay.

202
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,320
We'll make do, won't we?

203
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,240
Come.

204
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,760
[He's just a poor copier,]

205
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,600
[who's from a humble background.]

206
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,590
[Mu Xiao Man doesn't even
have regard for Han Sheng Zhi.]

207
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,150
[What did she see in him?]

208
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,910
[What special qualities does he have?]

209
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,760
Brother Le Xuan, what are you doing?

210
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,310
I just want to see...

211
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,880
if my blanket is wrinkled.

212
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,240
Wen Bin always sleepwalks.

213
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,000
Sometimes, he attacks people too.
You'd better stay away.

214
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,520
Got it.

215
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Rise and shine!

216
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,040
Guys,

217
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,200
how did last night go?

218
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,160
We were kicked out.

219
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,640
You were?

220
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,880
Did you sleep outside?

221
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,470
I'll report this matter
to Principal Feng today.

222
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,080
Brother Cheng Jun, that's a bad idea.

223
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,680
You mustn't let the school know.

224
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,520
There's nothing Lei Ze Xin hates
more than a snitch.

225
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,110
Back then, a scholar reported
his hard treatment to a teacher.

226
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,360
After that, his life here
became a living hell.

227
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
The Student Council has the authority
to step in, doesn't it?

228
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,710
One of the council members, Yu Le Xuan
is an old friend of his.

229
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,920
Besides,

230
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,670
the President has nothing on him.

231
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,600
Because Lei Ze Xin's father
works for the President's father.

232
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,630
He wouldn't want to sour
their relationship.

233
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,880
Birds of a feather.

234
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,760
In this situation,

235
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,470
you can only pray to the gods.

236
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,770
-Master.
-Don't call me master.

237
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,520
I have no disciple like you.

238
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,800
I remember the day...

239
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,240
your father left you in my care.

240
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,240
You were such a prodigious boy.

241
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,280
Not to mention ambitious.

242
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,920
Master Wang held you in high regard,
letting you enter Yun Shang.

243
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,280
And I have taught you everything I know,

244
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,920
in hopes that you'd make me proud.

245
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,040
But look what's become of you!

246
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,200
Child,

247
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,070
lift up your head.

248
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,560
Think of your father...

249
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,920
and your mother and brothers
who have lost their lives.

250
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,280
-This is great.
-Yes.

251
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,440
Brother Wen Bin, have a soak.

252
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Hurry up.

253
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,640
Don't miss the principal's speech.

254
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,600
Brother Wen Bin, you're indeed frail.

255
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,720
There's not much hair on your legs.

256
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,920
You don't have facial hair too.

257
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,000
Maybe he's malnourished.

258
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,120
-Hurry up.
-I know.

259
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,710
Let's go.

260
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,640
Principal Feng has arrived!

261
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,040
Greetings, Principal Feng.

262
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,560
You may sit.

263
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,000
Welcome to Yun Shang Academy.

264
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,430
I'm your principal, Feng Yan Wu.

265
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,040
It's my utmost desire...

266
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,640
to mold all of you
into exceptional officials...

267
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,760
who'll lead our nation.

268
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,800
Before you begin your classes,

269
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,640
allow me to explain
Yun Shang's scoring system.

270
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,760
The Four Books and Five Classics and the
State Code of Yun are compulsory subjects.

271
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,360
In addition,

272
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,920
you'll choose among...

273
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,200
etiquette, music, archery, equitation,
literature, art, math,

274
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,950
medicine and horticulture...

275
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,760
as your other major.

276
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Then, you'll choose three more subjects...

277
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,720
as your electives.

278
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,720
At the end of every lesson,

279
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,910
your respective instructors...

280
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,880
will immediately give you a rating...

281
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,360
of either a "pass" or a "fail".

282
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,680
Each major subject...

283
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,960
requires at least 100 passes.

284
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,120
So many passes?

285
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,480
Each of your electives...

286
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,400
requires only ten passes.

287
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,120
Only then you will be ready
to take the imperial exam.

288
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,720
If within four years,

289
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,270
you're still unqualified
to sit the imperial exam,

290
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,640
you'll be dismissed
from Yun Shang Academy,

291
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,790
into a future that's both bleak and grim.

292
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,280
I hope your experience at Yun Shang...

293
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,200
will be some of the
best years of your life.

294
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,000
Now, make haste!

295
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,000
Mr. Liu awaits at the field with a speech!

296
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,960
[Hang in there.]

297
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,160
[One more month,]

298
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,840
[and I'll make off with my allowance.]

299
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,560
Brother Wen Bin, it's time to go.

300
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,350
Brother Wen Bin.

301
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,720
What's wrong?

302
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,630
I was thinking...

303
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,160
with my poor foundation,
and the course being hard,

304
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,720
there's no way I'll make the grade.

305
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,560
Don't worry.

306
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,640
Believe in yourself.

307
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,800
I believe in you too.

308
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,070
I... I'm not that confident.

309
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:43,190
I'm the man responsible for
your fitness here at Yun Shang,

310
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,680
Liu Qian Yi.

311
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,120
From now on,

312
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,000
I'll be conducting your martial arts
classes and physical training.

313
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,110
I have only one motto,

314
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,310
which is, "there's no impossible,

315
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,110
but only laziness".

316
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,520
And I expect only one thing out of you.

317
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,280
And that's...

318
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,590
everyone must be
possible in doing anything.

319
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:09,920
Understand?

320
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,320
Yes.

321
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,280
Yes.

322
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,480
What is martial art?

323
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,760
Military practice?

324
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,350
Don't you know?

325
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,840
Wen Bin,

326
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,880
it's pure torture.

327
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,600
Be prepared.

328
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,120
I can't go on.

329
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,640
Brother Wen Bin, are you ill?

330
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,880
Don't force yourself.

331
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,590
Why don't you go to Fu Ze Hall?

332
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,800
[You're one sick girl.]

333
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,110
[Dressing up as a man...]

334
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,400
[and sneaking into Yun Shang Academy.]

335
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,510
[Are you insane?]

336
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,110
-[I...]
-[You're a girl?]

-[Execute her.]
-[Yes!]

341
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,480
You look a little pale.

342
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,120
I'm fine... Don’t touch me...

343
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,400
What's that?

344
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,950
What a menacing face.

Speak lower.

Lord Feng said the last incident...

348
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,950
might have been a prank.

349
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,750
But now, the Book of 10 Thousand Words...

350

has found its way into my residence.

351
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,350
I sense...

352
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,640
there's an ulterior motive.

353
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,200
We've spent so many years...

354
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,520
to erase this book from existence.

355
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,990
How could it have risen from the ashes?

356
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,080
Perhaps we've overlooked something?

357
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,840
You should know it better
than anyone, Lord Han.

358

Could it be that...

359

you've failed to tie up the loose ends?

360

That's impossible.

361
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,200
The consequences of losing
such an object is unthinkable.

362

I have no reason to do it.

as a proof that I committed murder.

[And when I do,]

00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,800
[I attack people.]

425
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,000
ask him to pay in advance.

426
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,120
If you say so, Mr. Yu.

427
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,400
If he comes next time,

428
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,800
I won't put it on his tab.

429
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,110
Look at you.

430
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,030
You're a bigger drunk now than ever.

Do you want to become bankrupt?

432
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,800
You're virtually penniless.

00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,110
Jeez.

434
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,030
Just lend me the money. What a nag.

435
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:55,910
Sure.

436
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,560
Pay me the ones you owed me.

437
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,840
You insufferable jerk.

438
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:05,870
You...

439
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,070
I'm not drunk. Leave me alone.

440
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,910
The door's this way.

441
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,120
You must have gotten into trouble again.

442
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,520
Something's fishy.

443
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,030
Lei Ze Xin, can you stop breaking
into houses through window?

444
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,640
Hands off that wine.

445
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,630
You... Stop drinking already.

446
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,640
Stop drinking.

447
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,120
Listen, if you don't go back,

448
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,040
you'll be advised to leave the academy.

449
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,280
Feng Yan Wu wouldn't
thrust me back to my father.

450
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,400
You have a point.

451
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,320
Your father is the commander
of the Imperial Brigade.

452
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,040
Principal Feng's hands are tied.

453
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,960
But as a friendly reminder,

454
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,390
you only have one year left.

455
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,550
After that, you'll never
become an official.

456
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,240
Becoming an official?

457
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,600
Who cares?

458
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,590
What matters now...

459
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,360
is clearing my brother's name.

460
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,720
I knew something's up with you today.

461
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,640
Tell me. Did you find new clues?

462
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,720
18 years ago,

463
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,560
Mr. Xue Ding Kun,

464
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,920
with the help of my brother
and his other students...

465
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,000
authored this book.

466
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,280
Look at the publication date.

467
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,800
Soon after it was published,

468
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,910
they were all arrested and executed.

469
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,720
I suspect their death...

470
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,200
is related to this book.

471
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,440
Where did you get this book?

472
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,480
From my brother's belongings.

473
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,680
I must clear my brother's name.

474
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,400
I...

475
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:37,920
Morning.

476
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,110
How did I end up...

477
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,040
sleeping here?

478
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,200
I think...

479
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,110
Is my face all right?

480
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,190
You're fine.

481
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,060
Welcome to your first abacus lesson.

482
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,720
Can anyone of you tell me
the origins of abacus?

483
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,560
Sir,

484
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,480
the abacus was invented by Liu Hong.

485
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,430
It dates back to the Han Dynasty
in "The History of Arithmetic",

486
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,920
where it's compared to the
four seasons and the three forces.

487
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,440
The abacus has three beams.

488
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,270
The beads rest at the outer beams.

489
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,200
The middle beam dictates the unit.

490
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,480
There's one odd-coloured bead
out of five.

491
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,110
The odd-coloured beam equals five,
while the rest equals one.

492
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,760
The four beads on a rod...

493
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,639
alludes to the four seasons.

494
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,840
And the three positions they take...

495
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,920
represents the three forces.

496
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,600
Good.

497
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,670
Very good.

498
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,870
Abacus is a fascinating subject.

499
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,400
I urge you to take up my course.

500
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,630
Next,

501
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,639
you'll experience first-hand...

502
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,199
the mystery of the abacus.

503
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,800
You'll find a ledger on your desks.

504
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,080
Let's see who can calculate
the answers the quickest.

505
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,280
Wen Bin,

506
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,360
do you find my course intolerable?

507
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,310
No, Sir.

508
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,430
Why haven't you touched your abacus then?

509
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:22,990
I'm done.

510
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,840
It's completely correct. You...

511
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,310
How did you do it?

512
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,240
When there's money involved,

513
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,800
I become a genius.

514
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,120
You have quite a head for numbers.

515
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,630
Will you major in my course?

516
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,280
Thanks for the compliment.

517
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,360
But I wish to major in medicine.

518
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,600
What a pity.

519
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,000
The Shui Tu Point lies
on the stomach meridian.

520
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,040
Pressing it helps to alleviate...

521
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,640
sore throat, cough,
and shortness of breath.

522
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,200
Portraits...

523
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,960
may not have been popular
with past master painters.

524
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,880
But a good portrait...

525
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,320
not only showcases
the beauty of a culture,

526
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,920
but portrays the everyday lifestyle
and tastes of the ancients.

527
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,960
Hence, enrolling in my course...

528
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,960
is crucial to your education.

529
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,200
All right.

530
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,880
Take out your drawing paper.

531
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,520
Let's begin by copying this portrait.

532
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:21,990
Brother Wen Bin,

533
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,480
what are you doing?

534
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,120
Check out Wen Bin.

535
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,790
It's brilliant.

536
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,390
Brother Wen Bin,

537
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,640
use the paint brush.

538
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,000
Ruined! Ruined!

539
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,440
It's totally ruined!

540
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,400
I'm new to this.

541
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:22,800
There is an order to everything we do.
