[Episode 34]

4
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,260
Father.

5
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,880
Father.

6
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,840
Mr. Feng never killed anyone.

7
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,420
Please spare him.

8
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,900
Please, Father.

9
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,460
Why, you...

10
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,100
Come.

11
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,740
Min'er, your father only wants
what's best for you.

12
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,120
Why are you helping an outsider?

13
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,120
Mother.

14
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,660
Mr. Feng is a good person...

15
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,240
We all know that.

16
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,120
How could you...

17
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,340
Watch your mouth.

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,020
Listen.

19
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,960
Even if Feng Cheng Jun
is not a murderer,

20
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,880
he still broke his promise
to marry you.

21
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,920
Our family is now a laughing stock.

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,500
Because of this,

23
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,640
I must teach him a lesson.

24
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,560
Father.

25
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,480
It's two separate matters.

26
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,160
You're just being unfair and spiteful.

27
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,880
-Min'er.
-What did you say?

28
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,000
-Come with me. Let's go.
-Say that again!

29
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,100
Father, you're so vindictive!

30
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,380
Young Lady Han.

31
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,400
Min'er.

32
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
-Young Lady.
-Are you alright?

33
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,940
Dear, what are you doing?

34
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,820
Listen here.

35
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,860
From today onwards,

36
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,700
-the Feng family is our enemy.
-Young Lady Han.

37
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,220
You'd better forget about him.

38
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,980
-It's alright.
-Young Lady Han.

39
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,280
No.

40
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
I'm still worried.

41
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,280
I must go there.

42
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,280
You can't.

43
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,260
Why?

44
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,140
Feng Cheng Jun is the son of a governor.

45
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,079
Master Wang thinks highly of him.

46
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,700
As long as Lord Han
doesn't have any evidence,

47
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,140
he'll be alright.

48
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,240
I'm worried Lord Han will blame
the crime on him.

49
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,820
Still, he needs some kind of basis.

50
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,940
Brother Cheng Jun's record
is as clean as a whistle.

51
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,020
It's not that easy...

52
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,780
to frame him.

53
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,900
At a time like this,

54
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,340
you going to see Cheng Jun...

55
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,260
would be a godsend to Lord Han.

56
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,660
He'll send troops to the academy
to catch the murderer again.

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,220
All our efforts will be wasted.

58
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,660
I hope you're right...

59
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,660
and Brother Feng is safe.

60
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,780
Still,

61
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,820
why did Feng Cheng Jun suddenly
plead guilty?

62
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,140
What could've compelled him
to do such a thing?

63
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,659
Is he trying to protect someone?

64
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,500
[It's alright.]

65
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,340
[I'm here.]

66
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,540
[He must have heard Gu Da Chao's words.]

67
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,780
[He must have known.]

68
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,820
[He was worried I would be tested.]

69
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,220
[So...]

70
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,180
Alright.

71
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,900
Stop worrying.

72
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,340
Feng Cheng Jun isn't stupid.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,680
Since he's made that decision,

74
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,960
he must have a solution already.

75
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,980
But keep this from Lei Ze Xin for now.

76
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,300
Otherwise, being the hothead that he is,

77
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,740
he'll probably rush to plead guilty again.

78
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,020
What are you guys planning again?

79
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,080
Why are you being so secretive?

80
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,220
Senior, you're up?

81
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,820
I'll get the medicine.

82
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,780
Tell me, how many people have you killed?

83
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,740
I didn't kill anyone.

84
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,180
You didn't kill anyone?

85
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,460
Then why are there so many people
after your life?

86
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,780
I was set up, along with the other guy
who distributed the flyers.

87
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,860
Someone led us
into Han Zheng Liang's trap.

88
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,460
There's another guy?

89
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,460
Take your medicine first.

90
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,820
Do you think...

91
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,540
the man who led you
into Lord Han's trap...

92
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,700
is part of Lord Han's ploy?

93
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,420
Maybe he's only a bait?

94
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,260
You mean...

95
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,140
the murderer was sent by Lord Han?

96
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,580
Xiao Man.

97
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,820
You're awake?

98
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,180
That's great, you're finally awake.

99
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,580
Come, take your medicine.

100
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,620
What is this place?

101
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,300
Haven't you...

102
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,580
always wanted a house of our own?

103
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,260
So, I bought this house...

104
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,260
thinking we can spend our future
together here.

105
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,780
Our future?

106
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,100
I'm afraid there's no future.

107
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,140
Xiao Man.

108
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,620
Why did you do that?

109
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,820
Why?

110
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,500
Many years ago, my family
was wrongfully accused.

111
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,100
Why didn't the government
investigate properly?

112
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,780
It's been a generation, who knows
what the truth was?

113
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,580
If your family were wrongfully accused,

114
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,380
will you say the same thing?

115
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,700
That's not what I meant.

116
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,780
I...

117
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,620
Can I ask you a question?

118
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,260
Sure.

119
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,420
When you were with me,

120
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,900
was it to save your family?

121
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,100
Did you ever...

122
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,660
have any feelings for me
while we were together?

123
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,180
When we were together,

124
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,260
I truly loved you...

125
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,020
and only you.

126
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,860
But none of that matters now.

127
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,760
I just want to stand up for my family...

128
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,659
and redress injustice.

129
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,700
You rest first.

130
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,340
Don't forget to drink the medicine
while it's hot.

131
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,420
When I feel better, I'll leave.

132
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,500
No need to hurry.

133
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,700
Take care.

134
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,260
I've never seen you fight so hard
for justice, Principal Feng.

135
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,640
Principal Feng, you've offended
the Han Family.

136
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,900
Aren't you afraid it'll affect
your career?

137
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,020
As the principal
of Yun Shang Academy,

138
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,860
if I can't protect the academy...

139
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,800
and every student in the academy,

140
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,820
how can I continue to hold this position?

141
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,400
Yes.

142
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,260
I am trying climb the ladder,
as you may know.

143
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,900
But if I allow someone else to encroach
on my jurisdiction,

144
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,960
how can I serve the country?

145
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,640
Even if I'm granted the highest of ranks,

146
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,980
I'll still be a joke to other people.

147
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,340
I'm sure you guys know...

148
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,940
the purpose of this meeting.

149
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,460
Han Zheng Liang,
the Attendant Officer of Yunzhou,

150
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,740
insisted that Yun Shang Academy...

151
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,980
is harbouring a suspect...

152
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,940
without proper investigation.

153
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,220
Under false charges,

154
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,140
he had harmed a student
of Yun Shang Academy.

155
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,700
This isn't only a violation
His Majesty's edict,

156
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,500
but an insult to the students
who're most valued by Master Wang.

157
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,700
It's absurd and despicable.

158
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,540
It's outrageous.

159
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,180
Therefore,

160
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,020
as the principal of Yun Shang Academy,

161
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,020
I ask everyone to unite...

162
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,340
and stand up against Lord Han's actions.

163
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,660
Principal is right.

164
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,660
Everyone.

165
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,780
Think about it.

166
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,360
Lord Han is an official,

167
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,320
but he disregarded the law.

168
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,200
We must protest!

169
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:23,160
Protest!

170
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,920
We need to stand together...

171
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,940
and rally help from our family members
in office.

172
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,920
Let's write a letter...

173
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,020
and explain our situation truthfully.

174
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,860
Let's report Lord Han's actions.

175
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,760
Yes.

176
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,440
I'll tell my father.

177
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,420
Let's report him.

178
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,860
Principal Feng.

179
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,920
Can this incident prove that...

180
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,260
Feng Cheng Jun could not have possibly
assassinated Commander Gu?

181
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,860
Yes.

182
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,020
This is the second thing
that I want to state today.

183
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,060
Regarding Commander Gu's attempted assasination,

184
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,060
we've made an investigation.

185
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,220
I can prove that...

186
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,520
Feng Cheng Jun is innocent.

187
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,380
I've reported this
to the state government.

188
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,120
Fortunately,

189
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,500
Master Wang is highly valued
by His Majesty...

190
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,680
My father?

191
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,340
and was appointed as a special envoy.

192
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,620
Therefore,

193
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,260
I really hope that Master Wang...

194
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,800
will clear Feng Cheng Jun's name.

195
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,060
My father?

196
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,500
No, it's impossible.

197
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
-Zi Ming.
-Zi Ming.

198
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,760
-Take him back to the dorm to rest.
-Don't worry.

199
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,640
-It's alright.
-No.

200
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,780
After this,

201
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,020
I'll ask his family
to come to the academy.

202
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,180
I want to go home right now.

203
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,040
I want to see my father!

204
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,400
-Zi Ming!
-Father!

205
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,680
Zi Ming!

206
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,140
Will he be alright?

207
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
I'll go comfort him.

208
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,940
Hurry.

209
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,980
Everyone.

210
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,340
First, I want to apologize
on behalf of my uncle.

211
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,140
I'm shocked and saddened
by my uncle's actions.

212
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,060
Anyhow, we're family.

213
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,080
I can't join you guys...

214
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,060
in condemning or reporting him.

215
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,200
I'll leave now.

216
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,740
I hope you guys will forgive me.

217
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,320
Are you alright?

218
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,300
Careful.

219
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,980
Don't worry.

220
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,860
This matter...

221
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,980
will definitely be resolved.

222
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,120
How?

223
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,180
This time,

224
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,220
I'll ask my grandfather for help.

225
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,000
Han Zheng Liang must be punished severely.

226
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,100
Xiao Huan.

227
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,780
Who is your grandfather?

228
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,260
I come from a long line
of founding ministers.

229
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,380
-Founding minister?
-Yes.

230
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,460
Is your grandfather Lord Mo?

231
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,140
Yes.

232
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,140
Actually, I knew about this.

233
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,780
And in great detail.

234
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,820
Mr. Li.

235
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,100
I remember you've spanked
Mo Xian Huan before.

236
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,140
You have to be careful.

237
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,660
I can't seem to recall.

238
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,440
-It's alright.
-Mo Xiao Huan.

239
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,860
Who would have guessed?

240
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,820
No.

241
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,700
I've always told you
my grandfather is an amazing man.

242
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,540
You guys didn't believe me.

243
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,960
Thank god for Xiao Huan.

244
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,240
-Xiao Huan,
-We'll succeed.

245
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,340
can you tell Lord Mo that...

246
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,880
Feng Cheng Jun was set up?

247
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,780
Brother Wen Bin, don't worry.

248
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,100
Your problem is my problem.

249
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,440
Besides,

250
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,960
you're always right.

251
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,740
Brother Cheng Jun must have been wronged.

252
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,760
Don't worry, leave it to me.

253
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,740
Thanks.

254
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,220
We're friends. No need to thank me.

255
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,720
Careful.

256
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,740
-Sit down.
-I still can't believe it.

257
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,180
Lord Han ignored His Majesty's edict...

258
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,640
and barged into Yun Shang Academy
with his troops.

259
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,540
How unfortunate.

260
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,840
If the special envoy doesn't step in,

261
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,880
nobody would want to study
in Yun Shang Academy anymore.

262
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,960
Yes.

263
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,860
-That's right.
-What should we do?

264
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,380
You think...

265
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,860
Lord Han.

266
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,340
Lord Feng.

267
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,120
You don't look so good.

268
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,460
Let's cut to the chase.

269
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,680
Feng Ji Chang, you're a governor
yet failed to educate your son.

270
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,900
To think Feng Cheng Jun would
spread seditious propaganda...

271
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,640
in an attempt to disrupt peace
in our society.

272
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,200
Nothing sickens me more than
people like him.

273
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,800
I hereby declare...

274
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,140
the marriage between my daughter,
Han Shu Min,

275
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,860
and your son, Feng Cheng Jun, cancelled.

276
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,060
Lord Han.

277
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,340
You can cancel the marriage.

278
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,940
But you claimed that my son is spreading
seditious propaganda.

279
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,100
Where's your evidence?

280
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,240
My fellow officials,

281
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,800
as you all may know,

282
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,140
me and my son have a close
and loving relationship.

283
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,460
This flyer...

284
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,780
clearly states me as one of the officials
who took bribes.

285
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,140
What could compel him
to betray his father?

286
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,100
A desire for attention?
Or a sense of righteousness?

287
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,020
This is why he's smart.

288
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,480
Your name may be on the list,

289
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,940
but at least...

290
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:12,319
he'll get himself off the hook.

291
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,500
Nobody will suspect him.

292
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,900
But what he didn't know was that...

293
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,619
all parties related to this ledger...

294
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,980
have been killed one after another.

295
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,940
Governor Feng,

296
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,240
is it not your doing?

297
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,680
This way, you'll free yourself
of any suspicion.

298
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,860
First,

299
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,220
you can eliminate those who posed
as threats to you. Second,

300
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,640
you can protect your position
and your son's life.

301
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,620
This is really a good strategy,
killing two birds with one stone.

302
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,500
Lord Han.

303
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,500
Unfortunately,

304
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,340
you're wrong again.

305
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,340
Everyone.

306
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,380
Looking at this bribery record...

307
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,900
it's apparent that...

308
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,100
it is a name list.

309
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,040
As Lord Han said,

310
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,520
businessman Gu Da Chao is dead.
There's no evidence anymore.

311
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,420
This is my question.

312
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,620
Who can prove that...

313
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,580
I didn't accept bribes?

314
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,820
Let me tell all of you,

315
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,520
as far as this record is concerned,

316
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,260
I have indeed accepted bribes.

317
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,180
Therefore,

318
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,620
I'll explain it to Master Wang later...

319
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,880
and request an investigation
all the officials,

320
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,580
starting with me...

321
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,880
to get to the bottom of this.

322
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,440
Don't bother Master Wang with this matter.

323
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,400
Leave the investigation to me.

324
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,940
I'm afraid Lord Han is not qualified
to investigate this case.

325
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,940
Lord Mo.

326
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,780
Lord Mo.

327
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,780
Why are you here?

328
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,440
Lord Han, you've ignored
His Majesty's edict,

329
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,200
barged into the academy with his troops,

330
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,940
and even assaulted a student.

331
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,440
You've violated the law.

332
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,520
You're currently a criminal.

333
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,940
What right do you have
to investigate this case?

334
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,460
Lord Mo.

335
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,080
Whether I'm qualified to handle
this case...

336
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,300
cannot be decided by you alone.

337
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,280
I support Lord Mo's decision.

338
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,480
I also think...

339
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,520
Lord Han should give an explanation
to Yun Shang Academy.

340
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,140
Lord Mo, please make the decision...

341
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,600
to let Master Wang handle this case.

342
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,320
-Please make the decision.
-Please make the decision.

343
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,580
Everyone.

344
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,840
Lord Mo.

345
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,100
It's an honour.

346
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,140
I've heard everything just now.

347
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,580
Lord Mo.

348
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,420
What do you think of their proposal?

349
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,280
Since Governor Feng
has pleaded guilty...

350
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,620
and Lord Han is guilty,

351
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,420
I think this case
should be handled by you, envoy.

352
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,040
Don't worry, Lord Mo.

353
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,140
I'll do my best.

354
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,260
You took a big risk,

355
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,600
sacrificing yourself...

356
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,780
and taking Han Zheng Liang's cronies
down with you.

357
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,880
Now he has no power in Yunzhou.

358
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,100
I see what you've done.

359
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,500
Master Wang.

360
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,740
I've been waiting for this day.

361
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,900
Now I can finally go for it.

362
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,860
As for the rest,

363
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,180
I'd appreciate your help.

364
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,880
Just bear with it for now.

365
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,840
Once the dust has settled,

366
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,100
I'll clear your name.

367
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,940
Thank you, Master Wang.

368
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,500
But I cannot run away...

369
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,300
from the case that happened years ago.

370
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,820
Mr. Wen, you're here.

371
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,600
What's wrong with you?

372
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,580
She wanted to save Mr. Feng.

373
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,300
But my master disagreed.

374
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,460
So he slapped her.

375
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
I'm alright.

376
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,620
I'm just worried about Mr. Feng.

377
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,220
I heard Governor Feng
was sent to jail too.

378
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,660
[I'm sorry.]

379
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,640
[As my elder,
you should be accommodating.]

380
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,020
[You should treat me better.]

381
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,460
[I'll try my best.]

382
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,660
[I like someone who can share
weal and woe with me.]

383
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,200
[That's asking too much.]

384
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,920
[I don't think so.]

385
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,660
[You share weal and woe with me.]

386
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,080
[I'm not a prisoner.
Don't boss me around.]

387
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,960
[You're right.]

388
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,180
[I'm nobody to you.
You needn't listen to me.]

389
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,020
[Out of my way.]

390
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,040
[Twist it.]

391
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,660
-[Twist it.]
-[Twist it.]

392
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,480
[Well?]

393
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,580
[Are you happy now?]

394
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,260
[Yes.]

395
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,340
[In the future?]

396
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,260
[With you?]

397
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,680
[When I'm with you,]

398
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,980
[I'm happy every day.]

399
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,620
[Why don't you press on?]

400
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,580
[Pursue what you want.]

401
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,220
[Change what you think is unfair.]

402
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,620
I won't let anything happen to you.

403
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,760
[Yunzhou Southern County
Government's Office]

404
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,260
My lord, I'm turning myself in.

405
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,980
Le Xuan.

406
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,320
What's wrong? What happened?

407
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,980
Wen Bin had just turned himself in.

408
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,000
What did you say?

409
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,340
My friend told me Wen Bin
turned himself in.

410
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,020
He admitted to distributing
the banned books.

411
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,340
What did you say?

412
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,780
Careful.

413
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,620
Don't let the wound tear open.

414
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,260
What's going on?

415
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,920
What's wrong with Junior?

416
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,880
Why did he surrender?

417
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,840
Don't be anxious.

418
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,300
I'll tell you in detail.

419
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,900
However, you must promise me...

420
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,460
that you'll follow my plan from now on.

421
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,220
Why do you say Feng Cheng Jun
took the blame for you?

422
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,020
This is the evidence.

423
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,180
Master.

424
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,640
The two copies are identical.

425
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,740
The handwriting are exactly the same.

426
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,420
It doesn't seem to be fake.

427
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,980
You've turned yourself in.

428
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,760
That shows you're repentant.

429
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,500
But if you claim that...

430
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,220
Feng Cheng Jun
is taking the blame for you,

431
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,260
I disagree.

432
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,440
Two people, one tall, one short,
distributed the flyers.

433
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,860
This means...

434
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,820
it was you and Feng Cheng Jun.

435
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,540
Do you want to surrender, too?

436
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,500
I won't let anything happen to them.

437
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,380
Don't you...

438
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,740
care about your life at all?

439
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,820
Is my life that important?

440
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,080
This incident is clearly a conspiracy.

441
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,620
The truth is still out there.

442
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,600
You can't just throw yourself
at the enemy.

443
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,360
If three out of four of us
have surrendered,

444
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,260
who's going to find out the truth?

445
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,380
Le Xuan.

446
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,100
If you're the one in prison today,

447
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,020
I'd do anything to rescue you.

448
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,540
Sorry, I was being an idiot.

449
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,180
Don't take it to heart.

450
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,380
I'm grateful...

451
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,340
to have friends like you guys.

452
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,540
But I know better than anyone...

453
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,580
what it means to be friends.

454
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,700
They were caught because of me.

455
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,860
As long as there's still hope,

456
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,300
I must rescue them.

457
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,340
However,

458
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,780
how can you be sure...

459
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,300
you'll bring them back?

460
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,460
I have something they're interested in.

461
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,780
Don't worry.

462
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,300
I'm not being reckless...

463
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,540
this time.

464
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,660
Just wait for our return.

465
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,860
Don't worry.

466
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,980
I'll be fine.

467
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,460
Thank you for your teachings.

468
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,740
Thank you for saving me once again.

469
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,100
You're my disciple.

470
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,580
I ought to rescue you.

471
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,380
It's just that your father
was there too...

472
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,220
on that night.

473
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,980
My father?

474
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,500
The man in black.

475
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,100
All these are...

476
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,700
I haven't forgotten...

477
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,980
about Ze Xun's death.

478
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,860
Then why did you disown him?

479
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,060
That's what he wanted.

480
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,540
At that time,

481
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,760
when Mr. Xue and his disciple
were arrested,

482
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,740
I tried everything...

483
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,440
to rescue him.

484
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,240
However, he was worried...

485
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,940
the government would try to get to him
through his family.

486
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,960
To keep the family safe,

487
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,860
he insisted on severing ties with me.

488
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,780
Why?

489
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,380
Why didn't you tell me?

490
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,260
You've been suffering in silence
all these years,

491
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,900
searching for evidences by yourself.

492
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,580
And I thought you're a coward.

493
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,140
It's never too late for revenge.

494
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,500
I've been waiting for the
right opportunity.

495
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,260
Father.

496
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,460
I'm sorry.

497
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,980
Xin'er.

498
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,780
Stand up.

499
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,740
Your brother's death will not be in vain.

500
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,900
As long as you're alive and well...

501
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,700
and make something of yourself
in the future,

502
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,200
Ze Xun and I won't have any regrets.

503
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,420
Don't worry, Father.

504
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,780
I won't let you down again.

505
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,000
Wait here for a while.

506
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,660
I'll get something for you.

507
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,280
Father!

508
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,260
Father!

509
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,060
Father!

510
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,140
Open the door, Father!

511
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,280
I know Lei Ze Xin only distributed
the flyers.

512
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,020
The murderer is someone else.

513
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,760
I've asked Gu Zhe Yuan.

514
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,700
He said there was an obvious scar
on the murderer's hand.

515
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,460
You mean here?

516
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,100
Lord Gu.

517
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,500
Commander Lei.

518
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,300
How's your injury?

519
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,460
I'm fine now.

520
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,300
Commander Lei.

521
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,520
Why are you here?

522
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,460
I have something...

523
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,700
to ask you.

524
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:52,580
Was there a scar on the assassin's hand
the other day?

525
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,300
Yes.

526
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,900
How did you know?

527
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,880
It's Xu Wei.

528
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,840
Commander Xu.

529
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,020
Commander Xu?

530
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,120
Commander Lei, hurry.

531
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,840
Arrest that scoundrel right away!

532
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,720
Calm down, Lord Gu.

533
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,860
Calm down, Lord Gu.

534
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,400
Xu Wei wore black clothes that night.

535
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,700
He was killed by arrows.

536
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,300
He's dead?

537
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,880
Do you know why he wanted to kill you?

538
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,360
Why did he want to kill me?

539
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,340
He...

540
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,140
No.

541
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,940
It can't be Commander Xu.

542
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,900
Could it be...

543
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,940
Lord Han?

544
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,160
This is the testimony of
some of the teachers,

545
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,060
students and guards at Yun Shang Academy.

546
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,240
It proves that Feng Cheng Jun...

547
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,700
didn't leave Yun Shang Academy that night.

548
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,960
Commander Lei said...

549
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,540
the person who distributed the flyers
was severely injured.

550
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,860
But on Feng Cheng Jun's body,

551
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,260
there's nary a nick.

552
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,820
This proves that Feng Cheng Jun
has nothing to do with this.

553
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,060
Master Wang.

554
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,720
That night, Feng Cheng Jun admitted
to the crime.

555
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,340
So, I didn't investigate further.

556
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,900
It was indeed a negligence on my part.

557
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,940
I heard Wen Bin turned himself in
to the county government.

558
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,820
Is it true?

559
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,780
Master Wang.

560
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,500
It's true.

561
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,400
Why not send him
to the state government...

562
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,420
and let me interrogate him myself?

563
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,540
It shall be done.

564
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,740
Also,

565
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,820
the officials in the ledger...

566
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,900
have affirmed Feng Ji Chang's bribery.

567
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,500
Lord Han.

568
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,219
According to you how should I deal with it?

569
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,000
Master Wang.

570
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,060
I'll leave everything up to you.

571
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,500
It's all my own fault...

572
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,900
for being a greedy, corrupt official.

573
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,060
This is my punishment.

574
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,860
Father.

575
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,460
When I asked you about this matter
last time,

576
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,179
you denied it.

577
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,100
I don't think you are a corrupt official
this time, either.

578
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,340
Cheng Jun.

579
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,700
The truth...

580
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,620
will eventually come to light.

581
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,260
No matter what happens,

582
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,100
you must stay true to your convictions.

583
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,780
Don't be influenced by me.

584
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,260
Remember.

585
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,220
Concentrate on learning...

586
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,660
and serve the country.

587
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,780
Go.

588
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,680
You're gravely injured.

589
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,260
What are you doing?

590
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,500
Feng Cheng Jun and Wen Bin
are innocent, Father.

591
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,820
They need me now.

592
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,860
Let me go and rescue them.

593
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,440
I don't want my brothers
to sacrifice themselves again.

594
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,320
You've only known them for a short while.

595
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,900
Are they worth it?

596
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,860
Xin'er.

597
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,580
Have you thought about me?

598
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,900
I've lost your brother.

599
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,400
If I lose you too, how shall I live?

600
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,580
I'm sorry, Father. I was wrong.

601
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,180
I see the error of my ways.

602
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,140
I was ignorant.

603
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,580
I thought I had it worse than you.

604
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,780
I thought I loved Brother more than you.

605
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,700
But I understand now.

606
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,820
Don't worry, Father.

607
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,100
I will protect myself.

608
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,820
Feng Cheng Jun, that idiot.

609
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,840
I haven't got to know him properly.

610
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,180
He mustn't die.

611
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,660
And Wen Bin, too.

612
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,640
Wen Bin needs me, too.

613
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,860
Please, Father.

614
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,860
Calm down.

615
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,220
Listen to me.

616
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,740
Feng Cheng Jun has been released.

617
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,880
Wen Bin has been handed over
to Master Wang for interrogation.

618
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,620
Master Wang is the special envoy now.

619
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,540
He'll protect Wen Bin.

620
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,580
As for you,

621
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,340
don't be reckless anymore.

622
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,540
Stay at home and recuperate.

623
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,060
Then, return to the academy.

624
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,140
On the way to the state government office,

625
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,140
kill him.

626
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,980
Yes, sir.

627
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,620
Lord Tian.

628
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,160
Congratulations, Mr. Feng.

629
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,220
-Thank god...
-Lord Tian,

630
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,680
-you're redeemed.
-where's Wen Bin?

631
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,400
Unfortunately, the suspect, Wen Bin,

632
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,740
had just been taken away
to the state government office.

633
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,260
What did you say?

634
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,180
Xiao Man.

635
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,900
Xiao Man?
