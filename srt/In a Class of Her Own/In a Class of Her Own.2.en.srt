Flowers. Take a look.

Flowers.

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,940
Why did you return?

7
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,039
It's Feng Cheng Jun.

8
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,840
Feng Cheng Jun? Where's he?

9
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,030
He's outside.

10
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,400
Le... leave, quick.

11
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,830
You must be careful too.

12
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,270
Just go.

13
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,430
You're Mr. Chao, right?

14
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,430
Don't be nervous.

15
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,390
I... I'm not.

16
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,150
Mr. Feng, please forgive me.

17
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,760
Give me a chance to start over.

18
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,280
I won't break the law any more.

19
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,720
Don't worry,
I'm not here to give you a hard time.

20
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,840
I just want to know where the copier is.

21
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,190
He made a huge mistake,

22
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,960
I've punished him severely...

23
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,280
by throwing him off South Street.

24
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,310
Rest assured that he'll never
show up in front of you any more.

25
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,990
What?

26
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,510
What, what?

27
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,350
Why?

28
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,950
What is it?

29
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,190
Watch out.

30
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,030
Come and take a look, it's freshly
plucked. There's even dew on it.

31
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,670
Take a look.

32
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,910
You?

33
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,750

[Yu Le House]

35
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,910
Take a look.

36
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,310
This is where I do my business.

37
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,510
Isn't it brilliant?

38
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,950
Le Xuan.

39
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,390
Are you a scholar...

40
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,829
or a merchant?

41
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,790
I'm a scholar as well as a merchant.

42
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,400
I do anything that can make money.
I can handle both.

43
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,710
Seems to me like you're wiser
in doing business than studying.

44
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,310
You don't know how good I am in studying.

45
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,910
Don't judge.

46
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,270
I was just kidding.

47
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,750
How interesting.

48
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:41,040
You were so panic a while ago,

49
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,270
but now, you have the mood
to joke already.

50
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,840
What can I do?

51
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,520
Now matter how suffering or tired, I
still need to make money and pay my debts.

52
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,600
Why are you always in debt?

53
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,630
Did you sign a contract to sell yourself?

54
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,470
In fact,

55
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,560
I have a business,
and I need you to do it.

56
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,200
When you're done,

57
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,640
you'll get 200 taels, how about it?

58
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,670
I'll do it.

59
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:11,990
What is it?

60
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,710
You don't think I can do it?

61
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,230
I haven't said what it is
that I need you to do.

62
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,470
The money matters a lot to me.

63
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,029
I'd do anything for it.

64
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,950
But this is a very dangerous task...

65
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,070
I'd even go to hell for the 200 taels.

66
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,960
Have some tea, Mr. Feng.

67
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,120
Mr. Feng,

68
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:42,110
you made me frighten out of my wits.

69
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,070
Here you go.

70
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:51,909
Well, Mr. Wen Bin is like a "goose-man".

71
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,390
A mysterious man, you mean?

72
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,430
A "goose-man".

73
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,790
Splendid as a peach blossom,

74
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,150
and bright as autumn moon.

75
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,150
At first sight,

76
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,950
you'd mistake him for a girl.

77
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,670
Mr. Chao, I can tell that by myself.

78
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,390
I wish to know his personality.

79
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,550
Do you get what I mean?

80
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,390
I got it.

81
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,990
Actually,

82
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,710
all I know is his name's Wen Bin.

83
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:18,430
But I don't have a clue about
where or with whom he lives.

84
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,870
As far as I know,

85
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,840
he needs money.

86
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,600
In order to increase his income,

87
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,950
he'd even copy the books
all day and night for days.

88
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,640
There were times when his eyes
turned red from the copying.

89
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,560
How pitiful.

90
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,000
Yet, as poor as he is,

91
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,320
he's a man of principle.

92
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,630
He'd never hurt or deceive others.

93
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,240
I've known Mr. Wen for a few years.

94
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,840
This is the only time...

95
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,760
he gave up his principle entirely.

96
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,230
Maybe...

97
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,680
he is really in a big trouble

98

Isn't this Feng Cheng Jun,
the popular student at the exam hall?

99
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,430
What a coincidence to meet you here.

100
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,110
And you are...

101
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,280
I'm Yu Le Xuan.

102
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,320
Brother Cheng Jun,
are you looking for someone?

103
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,680
I think you're looking for the person
who tricked you in the exam hall.

104
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,880
I won't call that "being tricked".

105
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,080
I can help you find him.

106
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,320
Why would you?

107
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,590
I thought you'd be grateful for that.

108
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,310
Fine, forget it.

109
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,750
No, I just felt that...

110
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,150
you don't have to help me.

111
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,990
What if I say...

112
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,750
I'm doing this out of my care and
concern for a fellow classmate...

113
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,310
who'll be living with me...

114
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,400
and for the friend whom I took
as confidant when we first met?

115
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,400
Will you believe that?

116
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,240
Well, forget it. Even I don't believe it.

117

What is he doing there?

120
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,630
He's a poor man.

121
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,520
Of course he'll be making money there.

122
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,510
But, a gentle reminder.

123
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,320
He wouldn't be doing
anything good there at this hour.

124
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,240
If you went there,
and it were to be found out,

125
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,790
and someone saw that...

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,550
the young master of
the Feng family is breaking the law...

with a commoner,

128
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,360
the Feng family's reputation
might be tarnished.

129
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,240
Why are you warning me about that?

130
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,080
I'm curious about your intention.

131
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,360
But here's a piece of advice.

132
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,870
You'd better not go.

133
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,720
I won't change my decision.

134
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,710
What kind of person
would choose such a place?

135
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,880
This is what you asked for.

136
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,550
What is this?

137
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,600
You again?

138
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,110
Brother Wen Bin, we need to talk.

We've nothing to talk about.

Don't you know how messed up you made me?

141
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,549
There must be a
misunderstanding between us.

142
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,750
I can explain.

143

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,920
Go that way.

171
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,230
Commander.

172
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,600
Commander, I think...

173
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,900
that they climbed upwards.

174
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,440
Do you find anything down there?

175
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,040
There's nothing here.

176
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,070
Everybody, go up the mountain!

177
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,310
Yes, sir.

178
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,030
Commander, there's a path.

179
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,830
After them! Quick!

180
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,720
It's so packed in here. Get out.

181
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,200
Be patient.

182
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,280
Pull your stomach in.

183
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,990
What a nasty man.

184
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,750
I...

185
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,710
How am I nasty?

186
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,950
Are you hurt?

187
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,440
I'm fine.

188
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,070
I have given you the book,
you have to pay.

189
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,840
Did someone ask you to hand me that book?

190
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,550
Didn't you buy it?

191
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,880
Why would I buy that book?

192
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,380
I just wanted to talk to you.

193
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,100
Talk to me?

194
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,660
Talk about what?

195
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,620
Mr. Wen,

196
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,820
please take the second exam
of Yun Shang Academy.

197
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,740
You're too talented.

198
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,860
I don't want your talent to
be used in the wrong way.

199
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,340
The wrong way?

200
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,960
You tricked me into meeting you.

201
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,760
Is this how a scholar is?

202
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,900
Or did you plan to make me
realise my mistake with all this?

203
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,260
Thank you for your favour,

204
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,420
I'm unworthy of it.

205
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,540
Why don't you just pay up?

206
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,800
And we can go our separate ways.

207
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,640
You'll head to the right direction,
and I'll continue on the wrong way.

208
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,500
Okay?

209
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,620
I'll pay, Mr. Wen.

210
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,800
Thanks then.

211
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,120
It's 200 taels.

212
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,740
What is it, no money?
No more talking then.

213
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,700
Hang on.

214
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,320
Why are you so reluctant to take the exam?

215
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,780
As a scholar,

216
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,500
don't you want to have a bright future?

217
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,740
That's not my life's goal.

218
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,780
Why did you study then?

219
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,820
There's no reason. I just study.

220
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,640
And why did you write on my back?

221
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,500
I don't mean to blame you.

222
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,140
The words you wrote on my back...

223
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,300
[were criticising my lack of
knowledge about hunger and cold.]

224
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,660
[You were implicating that...]

225
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,900
[you are experiencing hunger and cold.]

226
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,780
That's why you couldn't spare
any effort to pursue your ambition.

227
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,660
Was that what it was about?

228
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,100
Yes, am I wrong?

229
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,300
No, you're not.

230
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,460
That's why...

231
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,340
I'm asking you to take the second exam.

232
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,830
You said that you wouldn't
do such thing in the past.

233
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,900
But you have no choice as
you've encountered difficulties.

234
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,500
I can help you...

235
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,020
as long as you're willing to
sit for the second exam.

236
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,680
Thank you for your kind intention.

237
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,700
One more question.

238
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,200
You can't help a person forever.

239
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,000
It'd be better to teach someone
to fish than to give him a fish.

240
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,660
All I ask is this stable life
I'm having now.

241
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,340
I don't care about having an ambitious goal in life,

242
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,380
yet, I would hanker
after some salted fish.

243
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,620
So, stop wasting your time
on a man without vision.

244
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,380
As for the exam,

245
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,780
I'm not going.

246
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,020
Mr. Wen.

247
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,740
It seems like...

248
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,780
he is really in difficulty.

249
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,060
Mother,

250
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,700
you should eat well...

251
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,140
and take good care of yourself.

252
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,780
You need to look after
Wen Bin when he's back.

253
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,140
Tomorrow's the last day.

254
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,100
I'm so useless.

255
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,580
Stay there.

256
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,140
How could you ignore the President?

257
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,060
Are you blind?

258
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,620
He must be missing his father,

259
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,340
wishing that he could be home now...

260
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,920
to complain about us to Governor Feng.

261
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,740
Feng Cheng Jun,

262
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,400
you're from a noble family.

263
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,780
Yet, you wouldn't hesitate to
destroy your people's honour,

264
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,380
instead of fighting for them.

265
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,240
Whose side are you on exactly?

266
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,340
Are you going to stay silent?

267
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,500
I'm only on the side of justice.

268
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,580
These candidates even
cheated during the exam.

269
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,460
They're simply shameless.

270
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,500
As a scholar,

271
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,100
I should set an example...

272
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,620
by changing this decadent condition.

273
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,740
Very well.

274
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,140
How righteous.

275
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,180
To be frank,

276
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,620
I admire your daring and fearlessness...

277
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,780
in speaking up and making moves.

278
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,620
However,

279
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,140
I'm warning you.

280
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,440
Yun Shang Academy isn't a
place you can do whatever you like.

281
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,700
Here,

282
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,980
you're bounded by the rules.

283
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,380
Nor is Yun Shang Academy...

284
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,660
a place for you to deceive others.

285
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,140
How dare you be
disrespectful to the President.

286
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,500
I...

287
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,980
Mr. Chao.

288
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,220
Mr. Chao.

289
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,290
Mr. Chao.

290
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,900
This...

291
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,940
[Tomorrow's the last day.]

292
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,020
[I must get enough
money to redeem Wen Bin.]

293
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,910
Mr. Wen,

294
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,080
I was just thinking about finding you.

295
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,400
And here you are.

296
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,300
Mr. Chao,

297
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,940
is there a job in which I can make
800 taels before the end of tomorrow?

298
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,900
I need it urgently.

299
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,380
Please help me.

300
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,740
I got it.

301
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,660
But 800 taels...

302
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,579
is quite a lot.

303
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,819
How about this?

304
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:25,460
Will you take another risk?

305
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,579
A risk?

306
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,020
This time, you don't have
to help with someone's exam.

307
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,220
Instead, disguise yourself as a candidate
and take the exam.

308
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,700
Got it?

309
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,220
No.

310
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,580
The rules have been
rectified after the first exam.

311
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,380
It's impossible for me to
replace anyone to take the exam.

312
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,100
Rumours had it that...

313
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,000
the rectification during the first exam...

314
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,240
was just a show for
Mr. Feng Cheng Jun's sake.

315
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,440
So,

316
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,640
you can still do it
during the second exam.

317
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,240
The employer has even
guaranteed your safety,

318
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,160
as long as you do it.

319
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,120
As long as I do it?

320
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,840
You mean, the employer appointed me?

321
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,740
No, he didn't do that.

322
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,300
It's just my word choice.

323
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,640
The employer also said...

324
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,880
that he'll pay no matter the outcome.

325
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,860
How much is he paying?

326
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,460
Five hundred taels?

327
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,780
One... One thousand taels?

328
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,500
For the second exam,

329
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,680
the exam hall will be strictly guarded.

330
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,020
If you try cheating, by any means,

331
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,620
you'll be taken to the court and punished.

332
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,300
You may enter the exam hall.

333
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,100
Principal Feng.

334
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,740
Principal Feng.

335
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,220
Grand Secretary Ding,

336
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,960
what brings you here?

337
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,760
I'm invited by Master Wang...

338
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,840
to join both of you as the invigilators.

339
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,780
He wants me to pass this order.

340
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,900
Here, please.

341
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,340
Have a seat.

342
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,540
Candidates, take your seats.

343
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,420
Are there any surrogate exam-takers?

344
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,260
If you are,

345
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,180
turn yourself in now,

346
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,300
and tell us who is your employer.

347
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,300
Your punishment shall endorse leniency.

348
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,220
Otherwise...

349
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,820
I have something to report.

350
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,300
Say it up here.

351
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,940
This is a recommendation letter.

352
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,460
[This is my only recommendation letter.]

353
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,460
[You may fill in the name of the recipient.]

354
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,780
[Thank you, Principal Feng.]

355
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,080
[He's a talented scholar and
he cares about the people.]

356
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,140
[Yet, he couldn't participate in
the exam because he's poor.]

357
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,180
[I don't want such
talent to be overlooked.]

358
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,700
[That's why I hope you'd give him a
chance to serve the country.]

359
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,660
Get him up here.

360
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,780
Mr. Wen.

361
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,400
Mr. Wen, you must be really knowledgeable.

362
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,040
Otherwise,

363
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,300
you wouldn't gain such
recognition from Mr. Feng.

364
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,820
Grand Secretary Ding,

365
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,020
what do you think?

366
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,840
Since both Principal Feng and
Mr. Feng recommended him,

367
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,260
and there was a similar case
previously in Yun Shang,

368
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,060
then...

369
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,620
I approve it.

370
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,860
About what?

371
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,660
You're allowed to skip the first exam
and take the second exam.

372
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,490
[View on National Policies]

373
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,540
Mr. Wen,

374
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,980
why aren't you writing?

375
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,020
I've never wanted to be
enrolled in the Academy.

376
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,260
Why should I write?

377
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,180
If you hand in a blank paper,

378
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,940
you will be sentenced to
the national law of contempt,

379
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,840
and be treated as cheating.

380
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,640
[I've got the money, anyway.]

381
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,800
[I can write anything I want.]

382
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,880
I spoke very highly of you
to Principal Feng...

383
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,400
so that you can take
the second exam directly.

384
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,980
If your answer is much
worse than other candidates',

385
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,840
you'll still be sentenced to the national
law of contempt by Principal Feng.

386
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,760
In what way did I offend you?

387
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,960
Why did you beset me?

388
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,180
I'm helping you.

389
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,380
I have a question.

390
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,660
What is it?

391
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,620
If I passed the second exam...

392
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,720
but was absent during the third exam,

393
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,280
what punishment would I get?

394
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,380
Being absent for the third exam...

395
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,340
equals to giving up on all of the exams.

396
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,460
You won't be punished.

397
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,380
Thank you, invigilator.

398
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,180
Mr. Wen, what are you doing?

399
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,270
Be disciplined in the exam hall.

400
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,430
Hand in your paper.

401
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,940
What's going on?

402
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,860
This year,
for Yun Shang Academy's third exam,

403
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,500
Master Wang will be inspecting
your papers for the second exam here.

404
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,680
Come to Ming Lun Hall with me.

405
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,030
Move now.

406
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,950
Let's go.

407
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,180
All of a sudden.

408
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,180
Mr. Wen,

409
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,180
let's go.

410
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,760
[Ming Lun Hall]

411
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,540
Cheng Jun,

412
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,220
I know what you're capable of.

413
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,460
I intend to...

414
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,560
recommend you to the imperial court and
you can serve the country right away.

415
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,820
What do you think?

416
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,300
I wish to stay in
Yun Shang Academy and learn more.

417
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,340
The reason why I wish
to continue studying...

418
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,960
is because I'm not knowledgeable
enough to serve the country now.

419
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,080
Also, coming from a noble family,

420
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,340
I should set an example...

421
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,620
by following the rules.

422
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,980
What's happening?

423
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,060
-They're out.
-They came out.

424
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,920
The candidate, Wen Bin, come inside.

425
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,500
Don't be nervous.

426
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,780
Master Wang's not that scary.

427
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,220
He cherishes people's talent.

428
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,540
He'll notice how talented you are.

429
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,900
I'm not talented.

430
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,860
All I wish is to walk out
of this Academy safely.

431
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,820
Wen Bin.

432
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,500
Get up.

433
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,820
Thank you, Master Wang.

434
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,100
Student,

435
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,640
look up.

436
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,960
Stop looking down...

437
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,120
or you'll be taken as
disrespecting Master Wang.

438
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,840
What's your family name?

439
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,070
It's Wen.

440
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,220
Wen Bin,

441
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,100
your essay may not be one of the best,

442
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,280
but you're very lucky.

443
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,180
Master Wang has granted you...

444
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,100
entrance into Yun Shang Academy as
the last candidate during the second exam.

445
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,620
I'm guilty,

446
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,300
please forgive me.

447
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,620
Student,

448
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,460
how are you guilty?

449
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,900
[How should I answer him?]

450
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,020
[I can't enter the Academy,
no matter what.]

451
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,620
I...

452
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,500
I got the last place,

453
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,020
I'm unworthy to be
given the chance by Master Wang.

454
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,140
This student is really funny.

455
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,580
I have high expectations for all of you.

456
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,520
I hope you'll study well
at Yun Sheng Academy.

457
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,740
Be virtuous and loyal.

458
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,980
Congratulations, Brother Wen Bin.

459
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,500
You finally got in.

460
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,280
Aren't you happy making fun of me?

461
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,460
I am happy,

462
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,220
but I wasn't making fun of you.

463
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,380
You should be proud to become a scholar.

464
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,780
Be proud?

465
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,380
I don't come from a family that wants
me to become an official like yours.

466
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,860
I just want to feed my family,

467
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,900
and be able to live in peace
during this difficult times.

468
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,740
Live in peace?

469
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,180
Can scribing bring you peace?

470
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,560
A man should be ambitious.

471
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,120
I know you're naggy, but don't go too far.

472
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,950
You're an accomplished scholar,
but lack common sense.

473
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,420
I was hoping you can
put what you learned to use,

474
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,500
and not let your talent go to waste.

475
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,100
Why don't you get it?

476
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,860
Why should I?

477
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,460
Did I ask for your help?

478
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,360
No.

479
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,540
Absolutely.

480
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,020
You made the decision yourself,
forced me to accept it,

481
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,080
and now you're putting
me in a difficult position.

482
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,800
Aren't you exaggerating?

483
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,620
Anyway,

484
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,020
you're imposing your thoughts on me.

485
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,700
This is very ungentlemanly.

486
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,460
And all those teachings about study well.

487
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,660
You should focus on
perfecting yourself instead.

488
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,980
You put yourself in danger
out of greed for money,

489
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,420
and I got you out of it.

490
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,520
Why am I immoral?

491
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,060
Congratulations, Mr. Wen.

492
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,660
Tell me honestly.

493
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,820
Was it Feng Cheng Jun who employed
me as the surrogate exam-taker?

494
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,660
Mr. Wen, you must be kidding.

495
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,860
If you think it's Mr. Feng,

496
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,320
you should be thanking him now.

497
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,560
Yes, you're right.

498
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,420
I should thank him by chopping him off!

499
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,500
This is something every scholar
would be delighted to receive.

500
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,700
Mr. Wen,

501
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,900
why aren't you happy?

502
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,180
And you shouldn't look so despaired.

503
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,600
You're now a scholar of Yun Shang Academy.

504
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,940
With who you are now,

505
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,100
you'll worth ten times more as a copier.

506
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,580
Don't take it for granted.

507
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,700
What did you say?

508
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,020
What, what?

509
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,380
What did you just say?

510
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,980
Don't take it for granted.

511
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,980
The previous line.

512
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,780
As a copier...

513
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,740
No, the next line.

514
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,500
Worth ten times more.

515
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,100
[In this case,]

516
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,500
[I'll have the money
to get Wen Bin treated.]

517
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,780
A scholar will even receive
300 taels every month.

518
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,260
[300 taels?]

519
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,460
[But if they found out that I'm a girl...]

520
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,380
[Well...]

521
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,540
[I've cleared the debt with Lord Gu.]

522
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,900
[Now, I need to return the
money for betrothal gifts,]

523
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,900
[and I'll be free.]

524
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,800
[A very beautiful lady...]

525
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,640
I have nothing.

526
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:53,420
Aren't you afraid of the hard life when
you're not the daughter of an official?

527
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:00,100
I will travel to the end of the
world with you until we grow old.

528
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,800
Rebel,

529
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,580
don't trouble the fine lady.

530
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,080
You miserable people,

531
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,440
you'll never know
what it's like to be in love.

532
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,260
Take this.

533
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,340
-You...
-Let's go.

534
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:29,640
[She left with the man.]

535
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,620
Take a look.

536
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,740
Give me one.

537
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,660
I want one.

538
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,560
Wait for your turn.

539
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,380
Wait for your turn, you'll get yours.

540
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,940
[He's inside.]

541
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,460
[That evil man.]

542
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,560
Sir, did you see a lady in red?

543
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,000
I want the book. Do you still have it?

544
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,600
-Take turns, queue up.
-I want my book.

545
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,640
You'll get yours.

546
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,220
I told you, they'd be together.

547
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,700
It's brilliantly written.

548
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,700
That's right.

549
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,660
We're not meant to be together.

550
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,980
See you in the next life.

551
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,560
[What will happen next? To be continued]

552
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,520
You're really good-looking, mister.

553
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,000
How old are you?

554
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,860
Where're you from? Are you married?

555
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,320
Look at my pretty daughter.

556
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,159
-No, thanks.
-Just take a look.

557
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,300
Mr. Handsome

558
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:19,260
my young master has asked me
to carry your baggage.

559
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,620
Never mind.

560
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,120
I'm not so precious that I can't
punch my way out of a paper bag.

561
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:24,219
I'll carry it myself.

562
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,760
It's okay, let me carry it.

563
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,190
Do... Don't touch me!

564
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,300
I...

565
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,980
This feels like nothing.

566
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,500
I was being nosy then.

567
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:39,060
Woman.

568
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,060
What?

569
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,199
I said, even women are stronger than you.

570
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,199
You're too weak as a man.

571
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,880
What? Am I wrong?

572
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,940
Exactly, Mr. Handsome

573
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,460
You're indeed less masculine.

574
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,500
Young Master, is he angry?

575
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,620
I told you to watch what you say.

576
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,580
Let's go.

577
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,100
Mr. Pretty.

578
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,260
Cheng Jun,

579
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,580
you're here.

580
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,340
You're finally here.

581
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,220
I've been waiting for you.

582
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,540
Come on, let's go inside.

583
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,740
-Let's...
-Isn't this inappropriate?

584
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,460
They're still checking our names.

585
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,030
It is appropriate.

586
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,360
Don't you know the son of the Governor?

587
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,740
Let's go inside now.

588
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,540
You'll get tanned standing
under the scorching sun.

589
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,700
Come on. You, carry his things.

590
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,140
Come, let's go inside.

591
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,700
Hurry up.

592
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,260
Young Master, take good care of yourself.

593
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,660
Young Master,

594
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:47,810
take care.

595
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,140
You may enter.

596
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,360
Put your things here for now.

597
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,740
We'll meet here after two hours...

598
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,820
to assign you to your dorms.

599
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,920
Let me carry that for you.

600
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,280
I'm Mo Xiao Huan from the eastern area.

601
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,740
My father is an official.

602
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,260
What about you?

603
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,420
I'm Wen Bin,

604
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,460
a commoner.

605
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,820
I live in the West Village.

606
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,700
Birds of a feather flock together.

607
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,660
Both of you aren't meant to be friends.

608
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,900
Ridiculous.

609
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,500
How should I address you, mister?

610
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,400
Brother Zi Feng, keep it low.

611
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,000
Brother Yi De, I am keeping it low.

612
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,920
I never do this to anyone...

613
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,540
I'm Yang Yi De.

614
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,750
I'm Wen Bin.

615
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,860
Brother Wen Bin,

616
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:41,220
you impressed me at the
exam hall the other day.

617
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,380
We're of the same status.

618
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,660
Why don't you, I and Zi Feng...

619
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,140
choose the same room later?

620
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,400
So we can take care of each other.

621
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,740
Never mind, I have my own plan.

622
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,060
Your own plan?

623
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,960
Staying with your fellow townsman?

624
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,420
Something like that. I'm taking
a look at the study hall up ahead.

625
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:01,160
[Ming Lun Hall]

626
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,220
To learn something and timely practice it,

627
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,980
isn't that a pleasure?

628
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,180
To have friends coming from afar,

629
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,820
isn't it a delight?

630
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,740
Do not blame a person
who does not recognise you.

631
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,580
That's gentlemanly, is it not?

632
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,820
Zengzi said,

633
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,980
[Every day, I examine
myself in three ways.]

634
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,460
[When I work for others,
have I been disloyal?]

635
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,640
Shoot.

636
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,500
Here, here.

637
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,900
Pass to me.

638
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:34,980
Take it.

639
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,060
Here, pass it here.

640
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,940
The President's here.

641
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,820
The President's coming.

642
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,540
Congratulations to all of you for
becoming scholars of Yun Shang Academy.

643
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,860
-You're full of surprises.
-I'm Han Sheng Zhi.

644
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,220
It seems like you've
abandoned your principles.

645
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,680
And we're closer now.

646
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,680
I dare not get involved with Mr. Yu,

647
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,880
as I might get caught
by the Imperial Brigade.

648
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,860
You still resent me for
what happened that day?

649
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,740
But I paid you to work.

650
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,460
Why the resentment?

651
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,040
Had I known that was a banned book,
I would've asked for more.

652
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,760
A man must be forgiving.

653
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,260
Moreover, aren't you alive and kicking?

654
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,980
You've even become a scholar.

655
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,060
Mr. Wen,

656
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,380
your courage is indeed admirable.

657
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,740
But I'm warning you.

658
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,420
This is Yun Shang Academy,

659
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,220
not the market where
you can always be carefree.

660
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,820
Here,

661
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,140
you have to follow the rules, got it?

662
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,340
I will keep that in mind,

663
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,260
and always listen to you, President.

664
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,180
Next,

665
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,420
you'll be assigned to your dorm
by Steward Han Sheng Xiong.

666
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,180
Every common room
is shared by three people.

667
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,040
You may choose your own roommates.

668
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,420
I'll be taking you to your rooms.

669
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,780
You may move your things into
your room when you've chosen it.

670
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,980
Why is it shared by three people?

671
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,960
Yes.

672
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,760
I discussed with you just now, didn't I?

673
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,160
What is it?

674
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,400
You want to sleep alone?

675
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,740
What are you doing?

676
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,420
Why did you blush?

677
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,180
Did I?

678
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,540
Room Five of Regular Dorm.

679
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,520
Jin Pei Feng and two other friends.

680
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,660
Where is it? Where is it?

681
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,400
Room Three of Regular Dorm.

682
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,360
Guo Dong and two other friends.

683
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,740
Here!

684
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,100
Room One of Regular Dorm.

685
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,100
Chen Yun and two other friends.

686
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,100
It's here.

687
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,900
Room Six of Regular Dorm.

688
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,020
Chen Zhi Qian and two other friends.

689
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,260
Here it is.

690
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,880
What a nice room.

691
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,230
There're windows on its south and north.

692
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,500
Who dares to stay with Lei Ao?

693
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,180
He must have a death wish.

694
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,720
Who's Lei Ao?

695
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,360
He's three years more senior than us...

696
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,020
and is known for his stupidity.

697
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,060
He failed all subjects
other than martial arts.

698
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,900
He's been staying only here
since he joined the Academy.

699
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,980
How did someone this stupid
enter Yun Shang Academy...

700
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,580
and stay in a single room?

701
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,580
Call him stupid when
you meet him in person.

702
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,260
Believe it or not, he can beat up
10 students like you easily.

703
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,780
We're at Yun Shang Academy.

704
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:52,100
Students aren't allowed
to fight in the Academy.

705
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,620
But,

706
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,060
a friendly fight is allowed.

707
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,820
Wen Bin,

708
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,860
the President specially arranged you
to stay in Room Two.

709
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,500
Lei Ao seldom comes back here.

710
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,540
So, you'll be alone most of the time.

711
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,020
Sure. Thank you, Steward.

712
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,940
Brother Wen Bin, are you crazy?

713
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,820
You look really weak.
Are you sure you want to stay here?

714
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,860
What if Lei Ao comes back...

715
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,620
-and wants to try out martial arts on you?
-I'll take this room.

716
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,300
He's crazy.

717
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,740
He really is.

718
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,340
[It's quite dirty and messy,]

719
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,920
[but still liveable after cleaning up.]

720
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:56,230
[Continuation of Confucius]

721
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,820
All done.

722
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,620
Where is Wen Bin staying?

723
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,140
Room Two of Regular Dorm.

724
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,180
Room Two of Regular Dorm.

725
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,060
Why does it happen to be that room?

726
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:07,090
He didn't choose it.

727
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,640
Sheng Xiong assigned him to the room.

728
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,540
Isn't that Feng Cheng Jun?

729
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:21,980
Feng Cheng Jun.

730
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,300
Your room isn't that way.

731
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,740
We've prepared a superior room for you.

732
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:27,980
Follow me.

733
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,220
A superior room?

734
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,940
Why did you prepare
a superior room for me?

735
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:32,650
Aren't all freshmen
living at Regular Dorm?

736
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,520
How can we let someone
like you live in Regular Dorm?

737
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,340
The President suggested this.

738
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,060
So you can live more comfortably.

739
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,780
I'm treated specially because I'm a noble?

740
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,900
When did the Student Council start
doing things based on hierarchy?

741
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:53,820
Feng Cheng Jun.

742
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:57,460
Since you want it the hard way...

743
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,060
and wasted our good intention,

744
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,440
fine, we'll assign you to a room.

745
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,720
Which room in Regular Dorm
is not fully occupied?

746
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,300
Lei Ao,

747
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,340
please don't ever come back.

748
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,000
It's wonderful to live here alone.

749
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:36,580
Hi.
