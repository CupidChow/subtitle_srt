[In A Class of Her Own]

00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,840
[Episode 20]

4
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,240
I'm not taking the leave.
I don't want to leave school.

5
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,410
Why?

6
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,440
I've thought about it.

7
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,320
I can't leave school now.

8
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,420
Even though my real identity
is not Wen Bin,

9
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,490
but I'm the one who took
the entrance exam.

10
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,030
The one whom Master Wang approved was me.

11
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,280
I'm the one whom all the students know.

12
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,509
Mr Ding, please just acknowledge me
as Wen Bin.

13
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,710
Do you know...

14
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,259
that you'd be sentenced to death
if you don't leave?

15
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,340
During the interview,

16
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,150
I had rejected Master Wang's invitation,

17
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,900
but he still accepted me as a student.

18
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,560
I didn't do anything wrong.

19
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,990
You said it before.

20
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,410
Getting an education
is for the sake of the people.

21
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,770
Are women not able to contribute
just because they're female?

22
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,330
Yun Shang Academy...

23
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:11,080
is the place where men are shaped
into government officials.

24
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,850
Women are not qualified to be officials.

25
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,130
More accurately, they are not qualified
to study here.

26
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,560
So are all the things that
you’ve taught us before fake?

27
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,829
When it comes to females,

28
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,930
yes, they are.

29
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,400
I don't believe so.

30
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,079
Since joining the school,

31
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,579
my performance and result
are on par with the men.

32
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,540
In many instances, I've performed better.

33
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,740
So how could you say
that women are not as good as men?

34
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,890
Your thinking is good,

35
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,400
and you're doing well too.

36
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,320
But the difference between ideals
and reality...

37
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,320
is like heaven and earth.

38
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,670
Stop being so naive.

39
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,480
The time is not right.

40
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,280
If your identity is exposed,
the only outcome is death.

41
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,960
You are risking your life
by deciding to stay.

42
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,360
That is commendable.

43
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,270
I've thought it through.

44
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,800
There will be another plan for you.

45
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,560
So don't take unnecessary risks.

46
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,550
Please give me a chance.

47
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,360
I wish to take part
in the archery ceremony.

48
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,810
It is not for myself,

49
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,840
but for the women of the world.

50
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,410
As well as for fairness.

51
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,040
Putting gender aside,

52
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,360
a person, particularly a scholar,

53
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,590
should not abandon their posts
when they're on the battlefield.

54
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,110
Why are you doing this?

55
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,430
Is it worth it?

56
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,800
Yes.

57
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,200
[So you won't write the apology letter?]

58
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,310
[I did nothing wrong.]

59
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,110
[Why should I apologise?]

60
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,630
[You rather die...]

61
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,560
[than admit your mistake?]

62
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,570
[Is it worth it?]

63
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,350
[Yes.]

64
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,340
I'll prove it to you.

65
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,820
Anything a man can do,
a woman can too.

66
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,420
Please give me your blessing.

67
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,380
Give me a chance to prove myself,
to chase after my own dream.

68
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,660
Let me get this straight.

69
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,190
A girl who can't even pull the string
on the bow,

70
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,320
is expected to win
at the archery ceremony?

71
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,020
If you want me to accept you as Wen Bin,

72
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,180
if you wish to stay,

73
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,579
you'd have to be better than everyone
in every aspect.

74
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,079
Only then would people not question
your identity.

75
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,800
Hence, you must win
in the archery ceremony.

76
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,590
Can you do it?

77
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,990
I will.

78
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,330
Scholar Wen Bin.

79
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,090
I will continue to keep
your identity a secret.

80
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,750
But you have to be cautious and mindful.

81
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,530
There must not be any flaws.

82
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,760
Otherwise,

83
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,040
you, me...

84
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,590
and your family...

85
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,409
will be doomed eternally.

86
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,350
I, Wen Bin,

87
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,330
thank Mr Ding for agreeing.

88
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,270
If you fail to be the top scorer
at the ceremony,

89
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,680
I will still kick you out
from the academy.

90
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,900
Understand?

91
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Yes.

92
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,190
I'm hoping...

93
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,100
your dream...

94
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,800
will not end up...

95
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,750
like this list.

96
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,420
-Look who's being hardworking.
-Good.

97
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,380
Not bad.

98
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,270
I brought more arrows for you, Wen Bin.

99
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,350
Now, this is the Wen Bin I know.

100
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,400
The infallible Wen Bin.

101
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,330
Protect us, Great God.

102
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,610
I want to create the miracle you said
together with you.

103
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,650
Come.

104
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,950
Cheng Jun came up
with this fantastic idea.

105
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,580
See? You're looking at a miracle.

106
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:14,690
It fits.

107
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,840
Wen Bin probably can't even serve
as a stopgap.

108
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,710
This is far from being a miracle.

109
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,400
How about you teach him?

110
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,960
The school is on a break
in preparation for the ceremony.

111
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,470
I'm going to go home while I can.

112
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,470
Go home?

113
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,990
At this time?

114
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,670
Good.

115
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,040
So you guys are secretly practising
over there.

116
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,780
Is this the best you can do?

117
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,430
We're just observing, Feng Cheng Jun.

118
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,560
You can continue.

119
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,560
As long as you don't get in our way.

120
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,720
Lei Ze Xin is here too?

121
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,720
Could it be...

122
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
that you've joined Feng Cheng Jun's team?

123
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,020
Show us what you've got.

124
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,680
Wen Bin.

125
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,160
Step aside.

126
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,920
-Brother Zhao Rong, just ignore them.
-It's fine.

127
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,159
Cheng Jun, I'm still recovering
from my recent bout of arthritis.

128
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,850
Rest assured I'd be in tip-top condition
at the ceremony.

129
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,350
Lu Zhao Rong.

130
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,020
President.

131
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,730
If I recall correctly,

132
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,940
the archery ceremony
is critical for your future.

133
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,820
It is.

134
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,570
So I'm hoping...

135
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,520
you'd be as sharp
when choosing your team.

136
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,610
President.

137
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,050
What you said is right.

138
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,100
My arthritis does pose a problem.

139
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,960
But no matter how bad I am,

140
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,560
I'm still better than him.

141
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,130
Such a stubborn old man.

142
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,370
Wen Bin, let's see you try.

143
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,230
The arrow became a feather.

144
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,880
But the arc was pretty good.

145
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,460
Wen Bin, the phrase,
"unable to tie a chicken"...

146
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,300
turns out to be made for you.

147
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,440
Brother Bin.

148
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,840
Don't overdo it.

149
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,440
We will practise more.

150
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,700
Feng Cheng Jun, if you're thinking
of getting into the final round,

151
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,320
my advice is...

152
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,570
to get rid of the dead weight...

153
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,240
and reassemble your team.

154
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,630
Thanks for your concern.

155
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,080
Wen Bin.

156
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,620
All the best.

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,200
Make sure you don't make a fool
of yourself before Master Wang.

158
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,080
If not, the rest of the students would
feel embarrassed for you.

159
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,330
See you then.

160
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,560
Sure, looking forward to it.

161
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,940
But there will be winners and losers
in a competition.

162
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,000
Shouldn't there be some stakes?

163
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,760
I know.

164
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,630
The losers will apologise and submit
to the winners.

165
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,680
How about that?

166
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,890
All right, you said that yourself.

167
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,720
Making empty promises,
arrogant and rude.

168
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,840
You and Feng Cheng Jun
share the same symptoms.

169
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,610
I can't let your despicable conduct
be a bad influence on the other students.

170
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,460
This time, I'll make sure...

171
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,320
to get rid of this stubborn illness
once and for all.

172
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,520
But gather your members before you brag.

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,970
You wouldn't want to be disqualified
because you didn't meet the criteria.

174
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,000
Pay them no heed.

175
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,880
-Come.
-The Great God will protect us.

176
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,760
Wen Bin.

177
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,660
One, two, three...

178
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,840
-Let's do it!
-Let's do it!

179
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,870
What would you like to learn, Young Lady?

180
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,150
I wish to become an independent woman.

181
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,490
Independent?

182
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,860
That means...

183
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,520
a person who wishes to know
the world and themselves better...

184
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,920
need to have good virtues.

185
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,540
A person's virtue...

186
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,100
comes from their actions,

187
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,170
knowledge,

188
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,160
character and depth.

189
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,750
Actually, when you've built
an independent character,

190
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,590
it means meshing well
and living in harmony with the world.

191
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,280
It is due to this harmony,

192
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,190
that makes something stand out
from the common herd.

193
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,030
So what should I do?

194
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,250
As long as you persevere,

195
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,410
you will definitely become someone
more outstanding.

196
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,400
This way, Lord Ding.

197
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,520
I'm now a teacher.

198
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,230
Please don't address me
as "Lord", Lord Lei.

199
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,760
You're too humble, Lord Ding.

200
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,800
You didn't join Yun Shang Academy
just to teach, right?

201
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,400
Don't tease me, Lord Lei.

202
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,000
-Take a seat, Lord Ding.
-You too.

203
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,250
I must say this is an unexpected visit.

204
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,160
What's the matter?

205
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,430
I'd like to know how
Xue Ding Kun's family members are doing.

206
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,810
That year, under the order of Lord Feng,

207
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,300
I killed every person
that I was supposed to.

208
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,170
This matter you asked...

209
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,750
I've reported it to Lord Feng.

210
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,930
If I remember correctly, you were there
at the time too.

211
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,310
[So it is Feng Ji Chang,
Feng Cheng Jun's father.]

212
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,190
Governor Feng had denied the matter.

213
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,650
So how did you get the order?

214
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,150
By the time I'd received
Lord Feng's order,

215
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,690
it had passed through several people.

216
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,680
But my guess is...

217
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,240
the order was given to Han Bie Jia...

218
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,210
and he instructed Yu Lin Wei
to carry it out.

219
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,030
But at last, Lord Feng himself denied it.

220
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,610
Your son, Lei Ze Xun,

221
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,450
was also a victim of this incident.

222
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,690
Didn't you try to find out
who was really behind it?

223
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,790
That year, Mr Xue made
the wrong choice that...

224
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:07,630
damaged the interests of the aristocrats
and caused an uproar.

225
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,000
It had to be the work of a nobleman.

226
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,700
But as to who exactly it was,

227
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,700
I do not have any proof.

228
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,480
At the time, Madam Xue was pregnant
with the sixth child.

229
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,740
How could you have done it?

230
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:34,200
I was only trying to save my eldest son...

231
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,900
and protect my family.

232
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,390
I had no choice.

233
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,270
Looks like you still won't tell the truth.

234
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,460
Mr Xue's family is still alive.

235
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,030
Because you had spared their lives,
hadn't you?

236
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,110
Don't believe in hearsay, Lord Ding.

237
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,470
You need not panic, Lord Lei.

238
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,260
Mr Xue was both a mentor
and friend to me.

239
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,099
If you had indeed spared Mr Xue's family
back then,

240
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,829
you have my utmost gratitude.

241
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:18,190
Don't be.

242
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,599
If you're unwilling to talk about
the Xue's,

243
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,590
I will not ask further.

244
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,140
As for the person who alerted
Qin Bei Chuan that year,

245
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,890
was it also you?

246
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,680
It was Mu Jiang.

247
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,000
Commander Mu was the first
to know about...

248
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,170
the manhunt on Mr Xue and his pupils.

249
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,520
I'm indebted to him too.

250
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,440
It was thanks to his timely warning...

251
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,840
that I was able to be on guard
and save my family.

252
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,280
That allowed Ze Xun
to live a few more years.

253
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,980
It’s a pity that the good man
did not have a good ending.

254
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,860
His whole family was sentenced
to death row.

255
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,110
Mu Jiang.

256
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,330
Thank you for being honest with me.

257
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,690
I pray that a day would come...

258
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,340
where justice would be served...

259
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:28,790
for Mr Xue, your son
and those who sacrificed.

260
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,400
[Commander Mu Jiang would not let
the good people die in vain.]

261
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,550
[He crossed the aristocrats
and his family was put on death row.]

262
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,260
[When will his name be vindicated?]

263
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,080
[South Street Market]

264
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,800
What is this?

265
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,390
Something is falling from the sky.

266
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,800
Where is it from?

267
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
There are words.

268
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,240
[Vindication]

269
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,240
[Qin Residence]

270
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,880
[Vindication]

271
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,210
Father, Mother...

272
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,000
Finally, someone is fighting
for your injustice.

273
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,620
I'm sure it was the work of one person.

274
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,290
I don't care what it takes.

275
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,250
Make sure you find the culprit!

276
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,730
Do you hear me?

277
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,740
Understood.

278
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,060
I recall something.

279
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,080
The last time,

280
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,970
we lost track of the culprit
near the entrance of Yun Shang.

281
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:40,340
That was why I was stopped
by Mr Liu Qian Yi...

282
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,870
and couldn't continue the search.

283
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,680
Yun Shang Academy?

284
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,020
Yun Shang Academy has always been run
like a tight ship.

285
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,500
Could it have been a scholar?

286
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,440
A scholar?

287
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,240
Go take a look.

288
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,000
Wen Bin, they're all on the board!

289
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,120
You did great!

290
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,410
Brother Ze Xin.

291
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,560
-Check it out.
-Not bad.

292
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,750
He really did it.

293
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:11,980
Yeah.

294
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,110
-He got them on the board.
-Pretty good.

295
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,380
We're still short of one member.
Won't you join us?

296
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,980
Must feel nice to be pursued.

297
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,110
[That year, Mr Xue made
the wrong choice that...]

298
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,400
[damaged the interests of the aristocrats
and caused an uproar.]

299
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:32,060
[It had to be the work of a nobleman.]

300
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,750
Ze Xin, this year is your last year
at the academy.

301
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,940
You've lost too many nobility points.

302
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,780
The only way to make up the deficit
is by winning the competition.

303
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,310
It's your last chance
to become an official.

304
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,720
Not everyone is interested
in becoming one.

305
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,120
Go away.

306
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,960
What is wrong with you?

307
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,010
Lei Ze Xin.

308
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,880
You can't accomplish anything on your own!

309
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,560
Are you made of paper or something?

310
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,390
Because you pushed me!

311
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,720
I'll get you treated.

312
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,570
Do you show off only to your friends,
Brother Ze Xin?

313
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:08,850
Come on.

314
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,800
I don't know what happened in the past.

315
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,200
You have to accept the world
to accept yourself.

316
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,760
Fighting alone is just foolhardiness.

317
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,910
Who are you to criticise me?

318
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,630
Do you want to die?

319
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,120
What are you doing?

320
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,150
-Have you lost your mind, Ze Xin?
-Brother Cheng Jun.

321
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,550
Why do you begrudge me so?

322
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,410
What a grouch.

323
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,470
Are you okay?

324
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,260
Ze Xun.

325
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,340
Perhaps Wen Bin is right.

326
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,280
Feng Cheng Jun is not like what we think.

327
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,630
I realised...

328
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,670
I'm not as strong as those people.

329
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,870
I'm such a failure, right, Ze Xun?

330
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,850
[If you think you're so good,
you should do the best you can.]

331
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,380
[Beat them through academics.]

332
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,130
[Make those who ridiculed you gasp.]

333
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,510
[That is the real strength.]

334
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,130
[That is the true challenge.]

335
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,930
[You have to accept the world
to accept yourself.]

336
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,590
[Fighting alone is just foolhardiness.]

337
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,960
[You can't accomplish anything
on your own!]

338
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,790
[Student, Lei Ze Xin,
wants to be like my brother.]

339
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,570
[I will study hard
and accomplish great things.]

340
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,130
[I'll help the people
and uphold the truth.]

341
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,180
[A man should be courageous.]

342
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,840
[We rather shed blood...]

343
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,370
[than cry.]

344
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,910
[It's time. Leave.]

345
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,180
-[Ze Xin.]
-[Big brother!]

346
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,580
[Big brother!]

347
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,080
-[Ze Xin!]
-[Big brother!]

348
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,070
[Even if you think there's no way out,]

349
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,720
[do not lose confidence.]

350
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,350
[Besides, you still have me.]

351
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,650
Ze Xin, it's no use
even if my hand is better.

352
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,380
The archery ceremony
takes place soon.

353
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,390
If you won't join us,

354
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,310
we won't even be able to qualify.

355
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,590
Everyone is hoping that you'd join.

356
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,970
It'd be nice.

357
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,530
Why must you win the competition?

358
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,910
I want to prove myself.

359
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,110
Wen Bin.

360
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:56,910
Have you ever thought...

361
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,390
what would happen if you lost?

362
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,190
Brother Ze Xin, we should do our best
to win.

363
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,830
Winning or losing is inevitable
when competing.

364
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,110
If you could win by just thinking,

365
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,200
we should all just think then.

366
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,790
You know very well that we need you.

367
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,200
You're being difficult on purpose.

368
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,530
Brat, you only want to win.

369
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,160
It's all for Brother Feng.

370
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,030
All you need is Brother Feng.

371
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,780
The three of us share the same room.

372
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,230
It's only right for us to compete
and win together.

373
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,110
Brother Bin.

374
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,040
We each have our own ideas.
Don't force him.

375
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,570
I'll ask someone else tomorrow.

376
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,470
Ask who?

377
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,750
I have to agree to it.

378
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,270
I'll invite someone who is confident,
responsible...

379
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,710
and willing to join us.

380
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,760
If not for fear of losing,

381
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,360
why won't you join the competition?

382
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,140
Who said I'm scared?

383
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,870
Then why won't you join us?

384
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,390
Don't tell me you wish to join Han's team?

385
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,390
Right.

386
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,070
You really think you're invincible, huh?

387
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,510
How dare you challenge me?

388
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,030
Go to sleep.

389
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,960
President.

390
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,470
Good day, President.

391
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,010
-President.
-Hello, President.

392
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,090
President.

393
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,530
Feng Cheng Jun, have you found
all five members for your team?

394
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,300
Not yet.

395
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,750
You're looking way too calm.

396
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,670
I do hope you'd be able
to form your team quickly...

397
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:55,180
so we can have a proper match
to see who's better.

398
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,060
I'm looking forward to beating you
fair and square.

399
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,130
If you guys don't have enough members,

400
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,830
letting us win automatically
without playing,

401
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,050
that would be unsatisfying.

402
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,350
Don't you think?

403
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
Save yourself the worry then.

404
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,260
You finally came to your senses.

405
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,530
Now, it's getting interesting.

406
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,950
How is your injury?

407
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,390
I've long recovered.

408
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,100
The bow I wield will not show any mercy.

409
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,510
Good.

410
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,130
I've been wanting to take care
of that arrogance of yours.

411
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,760
Stop tooting your own horn.

412
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,600
If you're truly capable,

413
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,630
you can take me on at the ceremony.

414
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,350
I can't wait.

415
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,650
All of you finish your meals...

416
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,030
and get to practise.

417
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,560
Hurry up and eat.

418
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,470
I'm not about to let some guy
get their way.

419
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,660
Let's go.

420
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,920
What are you looking at?

421
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,670
What's there to see? Finish up your food.

422
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,400
Principal Feng, gentlemen.

423
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,220
Something strange has happened.

424
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,910
Lei Ze Xin has joined their team.

425
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,210
Whose team?

426
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,080
Feng Cheng Jun and Wen Bin's.

427
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,690
With the addition of Lei Ze Xin,

428
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,380
Feng Cheng Jun's team will be
a step closer to winning.

429
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,990
[Team Feng Cheng Jun
and Team Han Sheng Zhi.]

430
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:54,050
[The Fengs versus the Hans.]

431
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,800
[What should I do about it?]

432
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,960
Principal Feng.

433
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,760
What's on your mind?

434
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,290
I'm wondering about Lei Ze Xin.

435
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,610
Why would...

436
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,290
Is he going to make trouble
for Cheng Jun and Wen Bin?

437
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,880
Mr Liu.

438
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,060
Comparing Lei Ze Xin and Feng Cheng Jun,

439
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,670
how are their archery skills?

440
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,080
I've taught Lei Ze Xin martial arts
since young.

441
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,390
If we're talking about archery skills,

442
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,880
his level is cream of the crop...

443
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,320
within Yun Shang.

444
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,940
The once rebellious prodigal son,
Lei Ze Xin,

445
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:35,430
is slowly coming around to the light.

446
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,800
The archery ceremony...

447
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,360
is becoming more anticipated than before.

448
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,440
Will Lei Ze Xin really help Cheng Jun
and Wen Bin?

449
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,780
You already asked that question,
Principal Feng.

450
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,640
But have you answered?

451
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,840
It's impossible to get ten points.

452
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,890
Your stance is wrong.

453
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,200
The bow is really hard.

454
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,040
You're in no position to criticise.

455
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,480
Work on your own problems.

456
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,360
Wen Bin.

457
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,760
Your biggest problem right now
is being distracted.

458
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:52,040
You're focusing only on the bullseye
and winning.

459
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,240
You'll become impatient,

460
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,900
causing a discrepancy between
your sight and hands.

461
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,960
Get it?

462
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,820
Yes.

463
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,640
Be calm like still water.

464
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,560
Yes.

465
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,420
You only need to...

466
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,940
aim at the centre...

467
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:13,370
and enjoy the thrill
of releasing the arrow.

468
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,010
Be one with the arrow.

469
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,840
I'll try it.

470
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,230
Not bad.

471
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,690
That was pretty good.

472
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,800
I'm sorry, guys. Age is catching up to me.

473
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,140
I'm afraid I'd be weighing you guys down.

474
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,480
Stop training.

475
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,430
Go back and rest.

476
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,310
It will be fine
if you perform as normal tomorrow.

477
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,720
Okay, Ze Xin.

478
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,840
I feel much better hearing that from you.

479
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,880
All the best!
The Great God will protect you.

480
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,920
Only eight points.

481
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,030
I usually score ten.

482
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,900
As for you...

483
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,360
You have the skills.

484
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,380
But you lack mental fortitude.

485
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,830
Tomorrow, Master Wang is the one
hosting the ceremony.

486
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:26,179
There will be many spectators.

487
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,330
I worry that you'd suddenly panic
and fail.

488
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,010
Nonsense.

489
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,219
I can do a good job.

490
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,489
Can you guarantee it?

491
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:37,590
I...

492
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,250
What then?

493
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:40,620
I have an idea.

494
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,980
Will this really work?

495
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,210
Brother Chao Hui is deeply religious.

496
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,400
I'm sure he thinks performing
such a formal ritual...

497
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,320
would get the blessing of the gods.

498
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,639
Once spiritually comforted,

499
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,000
he'd be able to perform as normal
during the ceremony.

500
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,950
There's no harm.

501
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,640
Honourable Confucius.

502
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,840
Please protect us and guide us...

503
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,500
to get a good result.

504
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,990
I'm surprised that Lei Ze Xin,
the rogue who acts on his own,

505
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,310
can be this calm and accommodating
in this matter.

506
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,970
-It's an eye-opener.
-Help us...

507
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,810
so we can win.

508
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,500
Brother Ze Xin.

509
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,170
I have a hunch.

510
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,150
We will definitely win.

511
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,200
The rest of you.

512
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,230
Come and kneel before Confucius.

513
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,600
Come on.

514
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,900
This year's archery ceremony...

515
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,010
is a grand affair.

516
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,010
Why so?

517
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,550
Is Wang Hao Zhen...

518
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,600
really hosting it following
the emperor's order?

519
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,360
Wang Hao Zhen thinks highly
of Feng Cheng Jun.

520
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,960
Could it be he's going there
for Feng Cheng Jun?

521
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,960
Is he trying...

522
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,540
to help Feng Cheng Jun become
the student president?

523
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:16,570
Father.

524
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,960
Sheng Zhi should aim to become
an official.

525
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,380
Why put so much emphasis
on being the president of Yun Shang?

526
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,850
What do you know?

527
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,400
Why are you always carrying around a book?

528
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,190
If you don't let me read,

529
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,290
would you rather I sleep all day long?

530
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,210
A woman...

531
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,760
should focus on doing womanly things well.

532
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,450
Is reading not a good thing?

533
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,570
You want Sheng Zhi to be educated
and well-read.

534
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,700
Shouldn't you hope the same
for your daughter?

535
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:00,900
I'm a grown-up.

536
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,680
I'd like to help share your burden too.

537
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,930
Hearing you say that...

538
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:12,690
does make me think
you've really grown up.

539
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,950
Since you wish to share my burden,

540
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:18,970
then I have...

541
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,940
-a question to ask you.
-Father.

542
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,010
You need not worry about Feng Cheng Jun
snatching away the role of president.

543
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,430
Because he is only interested in studying.

544
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,260
I'm sure he has no time
to run the student council.

545
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,950
You sound like you know him well.

546
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,300
No, I just happened to hear Sheng Zhi
talk about the school sometimes.

547
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,110
I think he's too self-centred.

548
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,470
He doesn't empathise with other people.

549
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,560
I think you need to do
something about it, Father.

550
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,340
Min Er.

551
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,320
Let me ask you.

552
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,320
What do you think I should do?

553
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,260
That was a mistake, President.

554
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,480
I'll shoot again.

555
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,830
Listen carefully.

556
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,730
You better improve your scores quickly.

557
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,580
I must win at all cost.

558
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,600
The gold was as good as ours...

559
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,700
with you four before.

560
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,390
But then, Lei Ze Xin joined.

561
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,630
So what?

562
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,440
This is the chance to show them
our skills.

563
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,330
Bing Shen.

564
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,470
You have to step up.

565
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,090
Bing Shen.

566
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,690
You can't afford any mistakes, you hear?

567
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,960
If Sheng Zhi doesn't win the competition
this time,

568
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,850
he won't be able to answer to his father.

569
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,390
Time to eat!

570
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,790
No need to rush, kiddo.

571
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,890
-What a spread!
-Look at this.

572
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,890
-Look.
-Looks good.

573
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,250
-A beauty, a feast.
-So much food!

574
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,890
-Smells nice.
-What's the occasion?

575
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,670
It must be a gift from the Great God.

576
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:41,760
Calm down.

577
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,110
The president wants to thank everyone
for preparing hard for the ceremony.

578
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:47,870
So he specially asked Ms Han Shu Min...

579
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,450
to prepare a scrumptious feast
for everyone.

580
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,280
Do your best tomorrow...

581
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,700
and don't let President down.

582
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,580
-Okay.
-Okay.

583
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,590
-Thanks, Ms Han.
-Nice.

584
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:01,110
My brother specifically asked me
to prepare these food for you all.

585
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,630
-Let's go, Wen Bin.
-Where to?

586
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:05,530
Han Sheng Zhi has never been kind to you.

587
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,270
Are you sure you want to eat his food?

588
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,920
Please enjoy the food.

589
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,980
-Okay.
-Nice.

590
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,670
Thanks, Ms Han.

591
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,080
Let's go.

592
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,160
Where are you two going?

593
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,240
Mr Feng.

594
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:23,480
-Come on.
-Why don't we get one, Ms Han?

595
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,880
Only he has it.

596
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,920
-What about us?
-Yeah.
