[Episode 13]

4
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:26,890
Little Brother.

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,810
Brother Feng.

6
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,210
I have good news.

7
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:34,630
My books are selling really well.

8
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,750
They were sold out.

9
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,270
Is it so?

10
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,270
Congratulations.

11
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,030
Is there anything else?

12
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,720
Brother Feng, are you mad at me?

13
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,370
No, I'm not.

14
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,820
You're very busy lately,

15
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,870
but don't forget to study.

16
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,000
Although you're energetic and smart,

17
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,820
studying should be your priority.

18
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,940
Are you looking for this?

19
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,880
What a brilliant note.

20
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,060
It's simple and understandable,
not to mention the neat handwriting.

21
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,250
I will study well.

22
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:26,750
And you may check my work.

23
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,000
Brother Feng,

24
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,070
you're really nice.

25
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,730
You'd better spend more time studying.

26
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:47,950
Brother Feng,

27
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,520
I have a small favour to ask.

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,970
You have to help me.

29
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,360
What is it?

30
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,090
Well...

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,760
It's about Lady Han.

32
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,430
You knew how much she's been
hurt by your words the other day, right?

33
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,870
A gentleman like you...

34
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,550
always shows tenderness to women.

35
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,470
You wouldn't want her to
feel depressed, would you?

36
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,050
Is it that serious?

37
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,580
If she falls sick because of this,

38
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,270
I'm certain you'll feel bad.

39
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,079
Forget it.

40
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,390
I shouldn't see her.

41
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,400
I went too far with my words.

42
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,620
I'll be careful next time.

43
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,490
But I already promised her.

44
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:33,850
Little Brother,

45
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,520
how could you?

46
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,920
She's suffered blow after blow.

47
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,110
If she can't accept it,

48
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,490
you should know what to do.

49
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,390
Little Brother.

50
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:53,950
What?

51
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,510
Mr. Feng agreed?

52
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,390
Yes, he did.

53
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,700
Mr. Yu is indeed a man of his words.

54
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,430
Young Lady, you should think...

55
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,950
about what you can do so that Mr. Feng...

56
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,650
will not misunderstand you further.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,680
I must do well this time...

58
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,610
and impress Mr. Feng.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,380
Xiao Qin, help me think of a plan.

60
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,959
Don't worry, Young Lady.

61
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,230
You can count on me.

62
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,280
Now, you care too much about Mr. Feng.

63
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,530
If you stay calm,

64
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,630
you can do it.

65
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,630
-Amazing.
-Bravo.

66
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,159
Sister,

67
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,820
such a nice view and show.

68
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,620
You should forget what makes you unhappy.

69
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,490
Why did Mr. Wen do that to me?

70
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,600
I couldn't figure out the reason.

71
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,170
I think Mr. Wen likes you.

72
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,960
He must have his reason for doing that.

73
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,760
Sister, don't worry.

74
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,280
Who wouldn't fall for your beauty?

75
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,480
Then tell me, why?

76
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,240
Didn't Mr. Wen tell us...

77
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,680
that the academy is very strict?

78
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,150
And you believed him?

79
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,360
Ask him the next time you see him.

80
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,580
Relax.

81
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,900
You're a clever woman.

82
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,430
There's nothing you can't solve.

83
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,950
Such a sweet talker.

84
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,710
Let's watch the show.

85
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,590
Let's go.

86
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,030
Good!

87
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,560
Little Brother, let's watch the
show while we wait.

88
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,440
Okay.

89
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,840
She's here. Let's go.

90
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:40,950
Lady Han.

91
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,210
I was too disrespectful
towards you the other day.

92
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,110
I am sorry.

93
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,860
It's okay. I'm over it.

94
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,930
Young Lady.

95
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,810
What you said makes sense somehow.

96
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,050
I have reflected on myself.

97
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,870
Your words may be harsh,

98
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,180
but they are right.

99
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,570
I've learned a lot from you.

100
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,300
You may lecture me again.

101
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,180
Thank you. You're too kind.

102
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,750
Since we run into each
other on such a lovely day,

103
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,340
why don't we have fun together?

104
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,710
[She doesn't look depressed.]

105
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,420
[Le Xuan lied to me again.]

106
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,450
Mr. Feng.

107
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,010
What do you say?

108
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,550
The show has started.

109
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,720
It's interesting.

110
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,480
Xiao Qin, take Mr. Wen there.

111
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,230
Mr. Wen, take a look.

112
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,190
Mr. Feng, let's go see the flowers.

113
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,070
Come on.

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,350
Isn't it nice?

115
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,190
Well... my... my leg hurts.

116
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,450
Enjoy yourself.

117
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,590
-What's with your leg?
-Nothing.

118
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:44,690
Amazing!

119
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,940
Isn't it amazing?

120
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,820
Watch it.

121
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,020
Amazing.

122
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:52,880
Mr. Feng,

123
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,030
what an incredible view.

124
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,360
Let's spend some time here.

125
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,790
I'm tired of walking.

126
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,830
Let's stay here.

127
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:00,710
Come.

128
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,450
Look, it's gorgeous right there.

129
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,290
The air is fresh as well.

130
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,930
The air here is very fresh.

131
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,690
You can almost smell
a floral scent in the wind.

132
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,570
Can you smell...

133
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,360
Mr. Wen.

134
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,850
Shouldn't you be enjoying the show?

135
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,850
Mr. Wen.

136
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,260
Aren't you watching the show?

137
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,370
I was.

138
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,270
Was it nice?

139
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,150
It was.

140
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,040
It was?

141
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,770
Why didn't you stay there then?

142
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,190
It... It ended.

143
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,270
I almost forgot,

144
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,830
Principal Feng wants to see us.

145
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:35,120
We have to go. Bye.

146
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,010
Come on.

147
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,670
Mr. Feng, Mr. Feng.

148
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,480
It's still early,
why not stay a little longer?

149
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,870
Never mind.

150
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,030
Ms. Xiao Qin and Lady Han,

151
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,960
have fun.

152
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,000
Have fun.

153
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,159
-Let's go.
-Mr. Feng.

154
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,670
Young Lady,

155
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,870
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,780
Young Lady.

157
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,610
Bravo.

158
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,800
Where are we going?

159
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,840
To watch the performance.

160
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,760
It's wonderful.

161
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,260
It's not every day we come out.

162
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,480
We should enjoy ourselves.

163
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,860
Didn't you say Principal Feng
wants to see us?

164
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,370
Did you really want
to see flowers with Lady Han?

165
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,470
I could tell that you
were too shy to reject her.

166
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,470
That's why I "saved" you.

167
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,270
Now tell me, how are
you going to thank me?

168
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,800
Thank you for saving me.

169
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,940
You're really good at telling lies.

170
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,120
How skillful

171
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,070
Brother Feng,
I did that for your own sake.

172
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,039
Anyway, you have to believe me.

173
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,919
Because you're the best, Brother Feng.

174
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,860
Enjoy yourself. I'm going back.

175
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,580
Brother Feng.

[Interrogation Hall]

177
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:16,750
Mr. Li,

178
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,550
where could you be going?

179
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,080
I'm going to meet a friend.

180
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,740
I'll be back before the door closes.

181
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,100
Write that down.

182
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,430
Awesome!

183
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,270
Brother Feng, Brother Feng.

184
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,130
Brother Feng, please don't be angry.

185
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,040
Brother Feng.

186
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,960
Mr. Wen, it's rare to see
you out on the street leisurely.

187
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,470
It's hard to meet Mr. Wen as he
is usually busy with his studies.

188
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,720
What a coincidence it is
to see you here.

189
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,260
You should make it up to Sister
by keeping her company today.

190
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,190
Can you do that, Mr. Wen?

191
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,860
This diligent-looking gentleman...

192
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,830
must be the famous Mr. Feng.

193
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,400
I'm Mu Xiao Man.

194
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,500
You must have heard of me.

195
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,070
It's been days since I met Mr. Wen.

196
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,880
I'd like to have a nice chat with him.

197
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,230
Please allow us to
spend some time together.

198
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,980
Don't leave.

199
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,520
Since both of you haven't
met each other for a long time,

200
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,780
I'll be taking my leave now.

201
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,560
Don't leave, Brother Feng.

202
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,920
What are you doing?

203
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,830
Well,

204
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,400
Principal Feng said he'll deduct
my points if I go back late.

205
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,720
I've lost quite a few already.

206
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,660
Is it true, Mr. Feng?

207
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,490
It's not every day that you two
get to be together.

208
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,580
Forget about the points.

209
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,400
No way. I got a warning
from the president.

210
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
Don't leave me behind.

211
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,120
I'll stay with you.

212
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,410
Don't let Ms. Mu down.

213
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,570
Perfect!

214
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,210
We're on our way to Mingren Tavern.

215
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,140
Sister has a few jugs of
Liquid Gold Wine.

216
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,540
Why don't you join us?

217
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,800
Let's go.

218
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,290
Mr. Wen,

219
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,760
[Mingren Tavern]

220
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,770
here we are.

221
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,000
I hear the tavern has a new menu.

222
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,740
Everything is made by the best
cooks using expensive ingredients.

223
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,420
You and Mr. Feng will
have a great time here.

224
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,650
Let's drink till we drop.

225
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,880
Let's go.

226
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,760
Hi,

227
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,960
I'm sorry, but the tavern is closed.

228
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,030
-Closed?
-That's right.

229
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,040
At this hour?

230
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,850
Mingren Tavern never closes at this hour.

231
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,100
Don't you want business?

232
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,390
I'm really sorry.

233
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,710
The entire tavern is reserved.

234
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,290
Please come again.

235
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,820
Who could've booked
the entire Mingren Tavern?

236
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,020
Is there a party?

237
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,520
A wealthy lady booked it.

238
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,670
One lady?

239
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,830
How... How arrogant.

240
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,480
We must have our wine today.

241
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,360
Come on.

242
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,280
Sirs, Misses.

243
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,810
Please don't make it hard for me.

244
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,790
Come another day.

245
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,730
Too bad, Brother Feng.
Let's come another day.

246
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:03,610
No.

247
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,770
I'll see to it that Ms. Mu gets a taste
of her wine.

248
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,640
Let's go.

249
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,360
Guys.

250
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,770
How do you say it?

251
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,000
Our minds are...

252
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,070
-In sync.
-in sync.

253
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,040
I wasn't asking you.

254
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,400
Anyway, this must be fate.

255
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,560
How imaginative you are, Lady Han.

256
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,940
Mr. Feng and Mr. Wen are here...

257
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,650
at my invitation.

258
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,520
Since Lady Han has
booked the entire tavern,

259
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,910
Mr. Wen and Mr. Feng,

260
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,060
let's find another place.

261
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,290
So, Mr. Feng lied about returning
to the academy...

262
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,100
so he could drink with this woman?

263
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,600
How could you do this to our Young Lady?
Don't you feel bad?

264
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,820
We were on our way back, Lady Han, but...

265
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,700
-I...
-Brother Feng,

266
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,310
it was indeed our mistake.

267
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,810
Apologise to Lady Han.

268
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,350
If you're going to apologise,

269
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,510
have some drinks with my young lady.

270
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,850
Mr. Wen,

271
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:15,740
in that the case,

272
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,290
we should do as they say,

273
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,440
and let Mr. Feng stay here.

274
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:28,010
It's such an honour to be
able to drink with Mr. Feng.

275
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,470
Here, a toast to you.

276
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,590
Mr. Feng, are you all right?

277
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,630
Are you not a good drinker?

278
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,810
Wine is bad for the body.

279
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,120
You shouldn't drink too much.

280
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,210
Here, Mr. Wen.

281
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,520
I'm giving you a toast too.

282
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,140
Thanks for your care, Mr. Feng.

283
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,040
I seldom drink wine.

284
00:13:59,170 --> 00:13:59,970
Tasty.

285
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,440
Mr. Feng,

286
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,390
even if you don't drink wine,
you may try the dishes.

287
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,080
Cheers.

288
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,470
To Brother Feng.

289
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,960
Little Brother, what's that about?

290
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,310
Because you're such a gentleman...

291
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,570
who is nice to everybody.

292
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,030
Drink slowly.

293
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,780
Mr. Feng,

294
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,390
I will give you a toast as well.

295
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,320
Thank you for looking after Mr. Wen.

296
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,430
Hey, Ms. Mu.

297
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,100
You made it sound like you and Mr. Wen
have already tied the knot.

298
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,700
Thanks, I'm counting on that.

299
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,560
When the day comes, I hope Mr. Feng
and Lady Han...

300
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,210
will come to our wedding.

301
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:01,810
Sure.

302
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,950
Looks like Little Brother and Ms. Mu's
wedding is happening very soon.

303
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,040
Since you're marrying a pretty wife,

304
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,130
I wish you both a long-lasting marriage.

305
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,760
Brother Feng, what nonsense is this?

306
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,170
Nonsense?

307
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,190
I mean,

308
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,310
he sounds too formal and serious.

309
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,730
Here come your dishes.

310
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,010
Let's eat something.

311
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,860
And we'll drink after that.

312
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,680
Sister.

313
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,990
Mr. Wen,

314
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,520
don't you want to drink more with me?

315
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,120
You women can drink the wine,

316
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,760
while we, men, will just eat.

317
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,680
Mu Xiao Man,

318
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,080
your taste is getting worse.

319
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,400
You rejected a good
catch like my brother...

320
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,140
for such a cowardly man.

321
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,710
Han Shu Min,

322
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,380
you may talk bad about me,

323
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,360
but don't you dare...

324
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,040
say anything bad about Mr. Wen.

325
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,680
Furthermore,

326
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,320
Mr. Feng doesn't seem...

327
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,960
to be a better drinker than Mr. Wen.

328
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,940
Unlike Little Brother,
I have a low tolerance for alcohol.

329
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,920
With me sitting here,

330
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,910
Mr. Feng doesn't have to try the wine.

331
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,120
You're quite a good drinker, aren't you?

332
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,170
Of course.

333
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,800
Waiter, another jug!

334
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,060
-Coming up.
-Young Lady, stop.

335
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,510
-Make it two.
-Leave me alone.

336
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,430
-Sister.
-Okay.

337
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,050
Here you go.

338
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,350
Fill it up.

339
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,100
All of them.

340
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,350
Both of you,

341
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,510
you should drink slowly.

342
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,359
He's right, be rational.

343
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,270
No way.

344
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,349
No way.

345
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,310
Sister.

346
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,720
Mr. Wen,

347
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:19,210
you're more than lucky to be able to
receive Mu Xiao Man's embroidered ball.

348
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,750
You should be nice to her.

349
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:24,430
Don't let your duck fly
out of your platter.

350
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,930
She's a swan.

351
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:26,849
Don't call her duck.

352
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,210
Whether she's a duck or a swan...

353
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,520
depends on whom she is with.

354
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,380
No matter who that is,

355
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,520
he is definitely better than...

356
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,890
the one who keeps pestering me...

357
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,240
after abandoning me.

358
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,670
How dare you criticise my brother?

359
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,510
I... I'll make you drunk today.

360
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,200
Young Lady.

361
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,660
Finish it.

362
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,480
Lady Han.

363
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,000
-Sister, that's enough.
-Mr. Feng,

364
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,440
come and teach this
duck a lesson together.

365
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,600
Who are you calling a duck?

366
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,580
How rude!

367
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,880
Ms. Mu,

368
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,300
let's smash her.

369
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,180
Young Lady.

370
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,480
Lady Han, you're drunk.

371
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,160
Little Brother, don't throw tantrums
like the two ladies.

372
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,520
Why?

373
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,250
Must one be a lady to lose temper?

374
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,370
Little Brother, knock it off.

375
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,630
Am I the one causing trouble here?

376
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,680
She's the one talking drunk.

377
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,320
Mr. Wen and Mu Xiao Man are bullying me.

378
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,060
Enough, Little Brother.

379
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,900
-Mr. Feng.
-Let's return to the academy.

380
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,080
Young Lady.

381
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,800
-Goodbye, everyone.
-Mr. Feng.

382
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,160
-Xiao Jie,
-Mr. Feng,

383
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,100
-please take Ms. Mu home for me.
-Stay here.

384
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,060
I'll visit you on the next open day.

385
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,570
Good riddance, all of you.

386
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,330
I, Han Shu Min, will never give up anyway.

387
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,250
Young Lady.

388
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,430
Brother Feng, are you mad?

389
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,800
She was drunk,
why must you take it to heart?

390
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,940
Do you fancy Lady Han?

391
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,240
Why do you care if I fancy her?

392
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,410
You're my brother.

393
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,590
Of course I care.

394
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,630
Little Brother, I said nothing
when you took the embroidered ball.

395
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,880
Why do you care who I like?

396
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,130
This again?

397
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,750
If I didn't take the embroidered ball,

398
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,570
Mu Xiao Man would be disgraced...

399
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,300
and lose her reputation at Cai Yun House.

400
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,750
So you were just trying to save her face?

401
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,720
What would you have done then?

402
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,340
I had no choice.

403
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,530
Now what?

404
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,260
If you leave her now,

405
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,480
it'd be no different from leaving her
on that stage.

406
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,970
What a conundrum.

407
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,750
What should I do, Brother Feng?

408
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,740
What's done is done.

409
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,080
Moreover, Ms. Mu loves you deeply.

410
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,860
You have no choice.

411
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,580
No.

412
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,310
What do you want me to do then?

413
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,150
It's best if both of us
could study abroad...

414
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,410
at a place where no one knows us.

415
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,590
[Oh my god.]

416
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,230
[What's gotten into me?]

417
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,680
[Why did I say that?]

418
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,120
Brother Feng, wait up.

419
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,420
Here.

420
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,520
And you said you could hold your liquor.
My foot!

421
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,420
You always look arrogant...

422
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,710
giving the cold shoulder to my brother.

423
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,760
Who are you to do that?

424
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,840
You only saw me giving him
the cold shoulder.

425
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,220
But did you know...

426
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,720
that he had let me down?

427
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,930
Did he?

428
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,450
That's impossible.

429
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,390
He loves you deeply.

430
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,300
The deep love you're talking about...

431
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,510
is, in my opinion,

432
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,790
just his desire...

433
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,630
to possess someone,
as his failure to win her over...

434
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,730
makes him upset and
keeps him awake at night.

435
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,890
Failed to win someone over?

436
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,290
Feeling upset?

437
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,080
Keeps him awake at night?

438
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,830
Isn't that how Mr. Feng makes me feel now?

439
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,240
We should forget
about those blind jerks.

440
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,290
Forget about them.

441
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,700
So what if he's a scholar
of Yun Shang Academy?

442
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,810
They're not even up to my taste.

443
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,050
Come, sister.

444
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,680
Pay no attention to them.

445
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,700
We shall get drunk while there's wine.

446
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,630
Come on.

447
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,700
Young Lady.

448
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,830
Young Lady, stop drinking.

449
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,670
You've drunk a lot today.

450
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,660
Young Lady.

451
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,220
Every woman in the
world gets troubled by love.

452
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,770
I really wish Mr. Feng would fall for me.

453
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,500
-When will he...
-Young Lady.

454
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,680
fall in love with me?

455
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,260
Let's go.

456
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,710
This wall is the easiest
to climb in the academy.

457
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,250
It seems like you always go over the wall.

458
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,160
I also happen to know
a short-cut to the dorm.

459
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,440
What are these two doing here sneakily?

460
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,250
They must be doing something sneaky.

461
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,870
[Interrogation Hall]

462
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,000
It's Mr. Li Hu.

463
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,460
What an idiot.

464
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,010
Come, come.

465
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,510
You're Lin Bing Shen, aren't you?
Come here.

466
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,110
Don't be afraid. Come here.

467
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,770
Come.

468
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,270
Mr. Li,

469
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,280
I didn't do this, I swear.

470
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,910
Do you think I'll buy that?

471
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,330
You've gone too far.

472
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,080
How could you make fun of your teacher?

473
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,750
What a smart boy.

474
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,110
You shouldn't stay in Yun Shang Academy.

475
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,450
Instead, you should leave now.

476
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,880
Step out through the door
if you're so good.

477
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,290
The outside world is free.

478
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,100
You're free to do whatever you want.

479
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,090
[He doesn't seem like a martial artist.]

480
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,650
And you dare deny it?

481
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,330
How remorseless.

482
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,660
I have to punish you severely, then.

483
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,440
I'm going to deduct your behaviour points.

484
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,740
How many points should it be?

485
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,000
Three points?

486
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,520
Or five points?

487
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,720
I'm going to take 100 points.

488
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,980
What do you have to say
for yourself? Speak!

489
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,370
Do you repent?

490
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,630
-Good boy.
-Mr. Li.

491
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,510
Return to your room.

492
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,520
-Reflect on yourself there.
-He's done for.

493
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,080
Go now, go.

494
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,110
No, I didn't do this.

495
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:13,990
Go now.

496
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,950
-Go.
-Mr. Li.

497
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,580
Mr. Li.

498
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,150
-I didn't do this.
-Good job.

499
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,380
Well done.

500
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,290
Isn't Mr. Li scary?

501
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,500
That's why we shouldn't
break the school rules.

502
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,840
If I go crazy
because of Mr. Li's brutality,

503
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,510
will you still be my friend?

504
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,720
Fine, I got it.

505
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,430
If I go crazy, you would've abandoned me.

506
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,300
Don't worry.

507
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,370
If you're crazy,

508
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,530
I'll cure you.

509
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,150
Stay there.

510
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,100
How could you leave me behind...

511
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,970
and have wine with another person?

512
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,880
Senior,

513
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,760
only a little.

514
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,540
But you still drank, didn't you?

515
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,950
I'll make it up to you.

516
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,110
Not make it up to me.

517
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,650
Repay me.

518
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,870
No problem.

519
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,580
I'll repay you, alright?

520
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,860
[Was Li Hu hiding his
martial arts deliberately,]

521
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,930
[or was it not him?]

522
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,410
[Interrogation Hall]

523
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,420
What's wrong?

524
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:26,630
It's nothing.

525
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,930
Shut up and sleep.

526
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,050
[What's wrong with me?]

527
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,420
[What's the matter?]

528
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:11,710
Little Brother,

529
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,050
look how careless you are.

530
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,530
Little Brother.

531
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,630
What's the matter?

532
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,040
I have no idea.

533
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,520
Then,

534
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,470
the Smiling Tiger deducted 100
points from my behaviour points.

535
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,200
It's worth it.

536
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,230
At least now we know...

537
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,840
that Wen Bin always enters the academy
by climbing over that wall.

538
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,960
That's right.

539
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,560
We need to teach them a lesson this time.

540
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,560
Your task...

541
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,910
is to keep an eye on them.

542
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,770
As for your behaviour points,

543
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,270
I'll do something about it.

544
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,600
Thank you, President.

545
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,980
This is weird.

546
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,960
Who was it that tried to tease Mr. Li?

547
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,290
It was me.

548
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,090
I knew it was you.

549
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,140
So, did you get your answer?

550
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,920
It wasn't Mr. Li.

551
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,130
Could the Smiling Tiger have known that...

552
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,950
you were testing him,
so he fell into your trap deliberately?

553
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,410
That man was a skilful fighter.

554
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,700
When there's danger,

555
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,740
he'll dodge instinctively.

556
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,640
So it seems that...

557
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,610
the masked man is leading
you in the wrong direction...

558
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,510
on purpose.

559
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,580
At the end of the day,

560
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,120
I still need to find Ke Shi Jun.

561
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,680
One word from me.

562
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:06,900
Difficult.

563
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,900
If he's still in Lin Village,

564
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,090
he must have friends there.

565
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,200
Do you think his friends...

566
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,200
will tell you where he is?

567
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,570
I'll make them look for him.

568
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,300
Pay attention...

569
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,870
and read the "State Code of Yun"
in your hands properly.

570
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,060
Do not hesitate to ask if you have
any questions.

571
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,260
I'll be happy to guide you.

572
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,240
[Why do I have a strange feeling?]

573
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,150
What's wrong?

574
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,880
Wen Bin,

575
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,390
can you at least make it
look like you're actually reading?

576
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,080
Look at Wen Bin.

577
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,260
He wouldn't even look
Feng Cheng Jun's way.

578
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,460
Exactly.

579
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,040
That's weird.

580
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,110
Let's follow them later.

581
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,230
Okay.

582
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,350
What was taught in the class today?

583
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,150
I was completely clueless.

584
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,350
-So tiresome.
-Me too.

585
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:49,890
Little Brother.

586
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,180
Little Brother.

587
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:53,980
You seem out of sorts recently.

588
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,410
Is anything wrong?

589
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
Nothing's wrong.

590
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,620
Tell me. What is it?

591
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,200
Why is Wen Bin afraid of Feng Cheng Jun?

592
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:04,730
I'm fine,

593
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,490
as long as you keep your distance.

594
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,060
I'm almost sure my guess was right.

595
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,950
Poor Wen Bin.

596
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,700
Feng Cheng Jun threw him
out of their room at night.

597
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,000
But I wonder...

598
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,350
where's Wen Bin going so late at night?

599
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,270
That's right.

600
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,730
Why aren't you sleeping
in your room, students?

601

-What's written on it?
-I wonder.

627

Did you notice that?

656
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,020
Given the way Wen Bin is acting,

657
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,170
he must be bullied by Feng Cheng Jun.

658
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,400
I agree.

-Me, too.
-Brother Le Xuan.

Le Xuan, you finally came to class?

scores than me if I keep skipping class.

Judging by Wen Bin's demeanour,

665
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,670
he's trying to get away
from Feng Cheng Jun,

666
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,840
and get closer to Yu Le Xuan.

667
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,490
Poor Wen Bin.

668
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,510
Look at Feng Cheng Jun's face.

669
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,510
Doesn't he look weird?

670
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,420
He doesn't.

671
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,400
No?

00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,340
-What should we do?
-The teacher's here.

"But I couldn't be with her."

677
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,700
"Han River was broad,"

678
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,140
"But I couldn't cross it."

679
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,950
Where is it from?

680
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,840
Lu Zhao Rong.

681
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,110
Here!

682
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,560
Mr. Ding...

683
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,840
Where is it from?

684
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,600
Well...

685
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,990
It... It is from...

686
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,530
"The Vast Han", "Book of Poems".

687
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:33,240
Do you know what the poem is about?

688
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,830
Yes, it is about...

689
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:35,730
Don't tell.

690
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,110
Sit down.

691
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,370
Wen Bin.

692
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,490
Tell us.

693
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,060
Mr. Ding,

694
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,570
it's a Pre-Qin folk song
from "Zhou Nan", "Culture".

695
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,270
It tells the story of a woodcutter...

696
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,080
who has a secret crush on a pretty lady.

697
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,180
But he isn't able to be with her.

698
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,580
That's why he's been troubled by love.

699
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,390
So, before the surging river water,

700
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:01,160
he sang this song to express
his longing for her.

701
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,270
Good.

702
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,560
Sit down.

703
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,230
In the whole poem,

704
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:11,030
there's not a line that
describes what the lady looks like...

705
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,160
or the way she behaves.

706
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,920
Like a blurry cloud,

707
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:20,270
she lives in the woodcutter memories,

708
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:24,220
and becomes his spiritual support.

709
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,160
She is very far away.

710
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,570
She's out of his reach,
but still sticks in his mind.

711
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,790
Able to meet your loved one,
but unable to be with her.

712
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:38,020
This will be the topic of today's lesson.

713
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,030
It's a really difficult task when
a man is courting a lady,

714
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,240
but it's the other way round
when a lady courts a man.

715
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,570
Brother Cheng Jun, am I right?

716
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,910
One-sided love is unrequited.

717
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:55,800
Exactly.

718
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,150
It's painful to have a
secret crush on someone.

719
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,220
-That's right.
-It's totally unfair.

720
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,970
Being in love...

721
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,710
isn't about fairness.

722
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,260
It isn't a business.

723
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,660
Feng Cheng Jun.

724
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,660
What do you think of this poem?

725
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:16,180
I think it has portrayed
the landscape beautifully.

726
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:18,250
What do you mean?

727
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,880
A person takes a rest under the tree
in the south.

728
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:24,300
The water of the Han River
gushes relentlessly.

729
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,160
At the bank, the weeds spring up.

730
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,120
From afar, there are mountains.

731
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,520
I think it is a beautiful scene.

732
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,350
Expressing his feelings through
the landscape is inspired.

733
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,070
The dreamy environment...

734
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,670
brings out the woodcutter's yearning...

735
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,150
and allows readers...

736
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,370
to have a wider imagination.

737
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,520
Feng Cheng Jun,

738
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,750
after reading the poem,

739
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:50,320
how do you think the woodcutter feels?

740
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,600
I think that woodcutter...

741
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,910
was expressing how heartless he was
towards his love.

742
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:56,980
Well, but he loved her.

743
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,170
As the saying goes, "the soberer
a person, the crueler he is."

744
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:02,930
Well done.

745
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,710
We should also learn and possess...

746
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,160
the ability to see things...

747
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,460
from a different perspective.

748
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,820
The next poem is a Wei style poem...

749
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,900
that's included in the classic
section of "Book of Poems",

750
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,830
"Melon".

751
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,480
Feng Cheng Jun,

752
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,380
and Wen Bin

753
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,500
read the poem.

754
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:40,000
"Give me a whittled melon,"

755
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,270
"I shall return with a jade."

756
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,520
"It's not the gift, but the friendship
that counts."

757
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,450
"Give me a whittled peach,"

758
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,040
"I shall return with a gem."

759
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,850
"It's not the gift,"

760
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,850
"but the friendship that counts."

761
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,610
Wen Bin,

762
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,500
read louder.

763
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,820
"Give me a whittled plum,"

764
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,040
"I'll return with jade."

765
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,230
"It's not the gift, but the friendship
that counts."

766
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,550
[Wen Bin looks a lot like a
lady with this expression.]

767
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,330
Stop it.

768
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,820
Let go of that boy at once!

769
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,570
Is this much anger even necessary?
