[Episode 10]

4
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,510
Mr. Feng, what brings you here?

5
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,430
Mr. Feng is finally meeting me in person.

6
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,190
Did you hear thunder?

7
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,150
Crack boom, crack boom.
I need to collect my clothes.

8
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,509
Mr. Feng, what brings you here?

9
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,670
Lady Han,

10
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,310
I've read your letter.

11
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,150
There may be a misunderstanding
between us.

12
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,390
Mr. Feng, you exaggerate.

13
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,350
I've heard it all from Mr. Wen.

14
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,150
There's no misunderstanding between us.

15
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,830
I feel that...

16
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,230
my presence is quite unnecessary.

17
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,190
I should get going.

18
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,270
One thing at a time.

19
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,789
Set things straight with her.

20
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,430
Then we can talk.

21
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:11,870
I want you to be my witness.

22
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,910
It's so awkward.

23
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,390
Awkward? What about me?

24
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,990
That's not what I meant.

25
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,350
I'm just feeling embarrassed.

26
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:21,710
It's too late now.

27
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,310
Mr. Feng,

28
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,030
what were you saying?

29
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,870
Misunderstanding.

30
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,910
That's incorrect.

31
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,310
We have no misunderstanding.

32
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,870
Please forgive me, Ms. Han.

33
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,790
Today,

34
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,630
I have to clarify this matter.

35
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,550
Please speak your mind, Mr. Feng.

36
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,470
Thank you for you admiration.

37
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,910
But I'm busy with my school work.

38
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,710
Before I graduate,

39
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,470
I have no intention for romance.

40
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,110
I hope you understand.

41
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,310
Mr. Feng,

42
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,790
why are you saying things
that I don't like to hear?

43
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,670
You told me how touched you were
in your letter,

44
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,630
and you praised Mr. Wen's
literary talent.

45
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,790
Perhaps Mr. Wen didn't comprehend...

46
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,230
what I meant in the letter.

47
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,430
What do you mean then, Mr. Feng?

48
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,070
Lady Han, I'm telling you,

49
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,990
do not give your heart away easily,

50
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,829
don't be too subservient.

51
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,590
You'll only hurt yourself.

52
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,870
You can't force yourself to like someone.

53
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,030
Mr. Feng, I see your point.

54
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,870
I'm sorry to have bothered you
so many times.

55
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,790
Young Lady.

56
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,270
Young Lady.

57
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,990
Young Lady, don't be sad.

58
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,630
-Young Lady.
-What should I do?

59
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,470
Will Mr. Feng hate me?

60
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,270
He won't. You're a nice girl.

61
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,310
Why would Mr. Feng hate you?

62
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,350
Young Lady,

63
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,030
don't be upset.

64
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,710
Even if you don't like Lady Han,

65
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,470
that was kind of harsh.

66
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,310
Look how upset you've made her.

67
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,590
You've played a prank on me
and lied to me.

68
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,149
Shouldn't I be upset, too?

69
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,829
I didn't intend for this to happen.

70
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,829
I think you just didn't intend to tell me.

71
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,550
A noble man makes an honourable living.

72
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,670
As a scholar, don't you know this?

73
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,030
I didn't mean to do it.

74
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,670
But you did it.

75
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,430
Can't you focus your efforts
on your studies instead?

76
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,830
I didn't mean to.

77
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:34,670
Can't you give me a different answer?

78
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,950
Believe it or not,

79
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,670
I didn't intend for this to happen.

80
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,270
I'm upset about it, too.

81
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,110
Mr. Yu, Young Lady has spent
so much money.

82
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,590
Yet this happened.

83
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,190
Don't you feel sorry?

84
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,190
You've paid so much for the lesson.

85
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,430
Of course it's worth it.

86
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,670
What lesson?

87
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,909
Feng Cheng Jun's message is clear.

88
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,909
He likes a girl who is
principled and has personality.

89
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,030
Lady Han, what you should do now...

90
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,230
is transform your pain into strength.

91
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,830
Better yourself.

92
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,990
Make yourself a person with dignity.

93
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,950
He'll look at you differently, then.

94
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,590
Once you have a clear goal,

95
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,390
everything will work in your favour.

96
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,790
Carry on.

97
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,030
-Young Lady...
-Xiao Qin, don't interrupt.

98
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,950
I thought you'd focus on your
studies after the observation period,

99
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,070
yet you started writing dialogue novels.

100
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,910
I thought you'd focus on your studies
after earning enough money,

101
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,390
yet you did such disgraceful thing.

102
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,110
I don't know whether
I can still trust you.

103
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,390
Don't yell at me. It's my fault
that I lied to you this time.

104
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,030
But you've been forcing your
beliefs on me time and again.

105
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,310
I've gotten over it.

106
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,270
So don't push it with me.

107
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:47,990
Little Brother,

108
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,590
you've disappointed me.

109
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,070
From now on, you're not allowed
to leave the academy.

110
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,670
I'm not a prisoner.
You have no power over me.

111
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,910
Get out of my way.

112
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,870
[I...]

113
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,310
[Was I wrong to speak to him like that?]

114
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,590
[How could I speak to him that way?]

115
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,630
[I was too rash.]

116
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,110
Mr. Yu, you're absolutely right.

117
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,350
I believe you.

118
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,750
Lady Han, you're indeed sensible.

119
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,270
Feng Cheng Jun has no idea
how lucky he is.

120
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,510
Xiao Qin.

121
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,790
How much do you need this time?

122
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,390
Let me see.

123
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,990
The concept, material, manpower...

124
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,990
all comes down to...

125
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,950
Le Xuan, I need to speak with you.

126
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,350
Excuse us, we're talking business here.

127
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,670
Lady Han, I'll tell you the truth.

128
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,990
Brother Feng was never pleased to receive
your love letters.

129
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,070
Le Xuan and I have been lying to you.

130
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,790
-Wait...
-I'd like to apologize to you.

131
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,230
Le Xuan,

132
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,190
you can keep the money.

133
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,470
Lady Han is a kind girl.

134
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,070
We should stop deceiving her.

135
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,270
Wen Bin, are you drunk?

136
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,270
What nonsense are you talking about?

137
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,470
This is none of your business.
Go away...

138
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,790
I'm chiefly responsible for this matter.

139
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,430
I must set Lady Han straight.

140
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,410
Lady Han, don't mind him.

141
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,790
He doesn't know what we are talking
about right now.

142
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,790
That's why he's speaking rashly.

143
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,950
Lady Han,

144
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,790
I'm telling the truth.

145
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,830
You're a beautiful girl.

146
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,030
You shouldn't pander to others
in a humble manner.

147
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,030
That's not the kind of girl
Brother Feng likes.

148
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,710
You're right.

149
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,590
Lady Han, did you hear that?

150
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,790
Wise advice, isn't it?

151
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,590
Mr. Yu told me the same thing just now.

152
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,070
You two are such good friends.

153
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,909
Xiao Qin.

154
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,390
-Young Lady...
-That's enough.

155
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,590
Mr. Yu.

156
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,870
Have you lost your conscience?

157
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,990
What a flake.

158
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,590
Young Lady,

159
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,550
judging by Mr. Wen and Mr. Yu's behavior,

160
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,909
they must've fallen out.

161
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,550
Probably because of money.

162
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,870
So unreliable.

163
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,790
Looks like he has swindled
a lot of money out of us.

164
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,630
He's a fraud, a big fat fraud.

165
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,470
Is that so?

166
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,830
No wonder they look like
they're having a dispute.

167
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,470
Young Lady, let's hire someone better.

168
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,550
Let's go.

169
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,390
Hey, Lady Han.

170
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,870
Wen Bin,

171
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,670
do you realise you've just ruined
a big deal?

172
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,470
Le Xuan,

173
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,310
stop making money through unethical means.

174
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,630
Do you know you've just cost me
a rich client?

175
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,470
Let us make some plans together...

176
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,429
to make money morally.

177
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,230
Us?

178
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,789
Who was the one that boldly declared...

179
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,110
he doesn't want ill-gotten gains?

180
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,390
And now you say "us"?

181
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,030
Excuse me, Brother Wen Bin.

182
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,590
Our friend-ship has
been scuttled by you.

183
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,630
We can still raise it out of the water.

184
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,950
Even if we salvage it,

185
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,510
it'd have been wrecked.

186
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,510
It's too late.

187
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,510
Don't be so petty.

188
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,230
You're interesting.

189
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,470
How can someone desperate for money
do such a stupid thing?

190
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,710
I know what I can or cannot do
to make money.

191
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,670
Le Xuan, you call
yourself a businessman.

192
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,910
You should know...

193
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,350
that credibility is the
foundation of a business.

194
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,390
I'm a bit confused today.

195
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,030
I can't talk about this right now.

196
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,790
I've learned a lot from today's class.

197
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,670
-Have you?
-Yes.

198
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,030
It's good that you're learning.

199
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,510
I like this teacher's teaching style.

200
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,830
I see.

201
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,390
You guys go ahead.

202
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,590
If I'm not mistaken,

203
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,150
you're thinking about how to make money.

204
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,710
Do you regret it?

205
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,270
I would only regret...

206
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,160
if I make ill-gotten money.

207
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,150
Then what are you planning to do?

208
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,670
What else can I do?

209
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,990
I'll take up writing jobs from Mr. Chao...

210
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,470
to stay afloat.

211
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,350
Good for you.

212
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,550
However,

213
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,590
you should stop writing
your dialogue novel.

214
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,870
Your fourth volume of Where Love Begins...

215
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,950
is too brilliant.

216
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,270
It was being circulated
among the students.

217
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,030
In the end, Mr. Li Hu found out about it.

218
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,430
It's now under strict investigation,

219
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,910
do you understand?

220
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,950
Every time I see your pitiful face,

221
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,830
it makes my heart ache.

222
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,030
How about this? I'll look for...

223
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,310
some better paying writing jobs for you.

224
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,070
I thought you said our friend-ship...

225
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,790
has been scuttled by me?

226
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,270
I bought a new ship.

227
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,630
You're the best, Le Xuan.

228
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,470
Well,

229
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,710
that's because I like you a lot.

230
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,190
It's such a cheesy thing...

231
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,710
to say between two men.

232
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,070
Alright,

233
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,560
I have an errand to run
in South Street tonight.

234
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,400
I'll see you at...

235
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,670
Mu Lai Bookstore then.

236
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,950
"Eminence is the source from which
all goodness spring."

237
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,270
"Expansion is the amalgamation
of excellences."

238
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,790
"Fruitfulness is the harmony
of all that is right."

239
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,030
"Determination is the faculty of action."

240
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,830
The benevolent shall preside over men.

241
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,670
The righteous shall appease all creation.

242
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,910
The powerful shall live in harmony
with nature.

243
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,870
The steadfast shall rule nations.

244
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,230
A noble man practises four virtues.

245
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:21,510
Namely eminence, expansion, fruitfulness
and determination.

246
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,830
Wen Bin is giving me such a headache.

247
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,390
You're such a selfish guy.

248
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,630
I haven't even spoken,

249
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,270
and you're having a headache already?

250
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,110
Is something giving you a headache?

251
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,670
I need you to ask around about two men.

252
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,110
Which daring duo...

253
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,270
has offended the notorious Lei Ao?

254
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,110
Ke Shi Jun, Qin Bei Chuan.

255
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,830
I've never heard of them before.

256
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,390
You have a lot of connections.

257
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,190
Help me to find out their whereabouts.

258
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,080
This is the first time I've heard you
ask for help.

259
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,710
Alright. I'll do it.

260
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,310
I'll help you.

261
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,470
The class is not until later.

262
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,070
Is he in a hurry?

263
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,710
You're going out again?

264
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,710
Yes.

265
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,590
I'm going to South Street.

266
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,630
It's midnight.

267
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,590
Here.

268
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,430
Make two copies...

269
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,630
for each of these books.

270
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,710
How much can I earn from these?

271
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,870
I've pulled some strings...

272
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,110
to get you these copying jobs.

273
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,950
He's right.

274
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:44,990
Thank you for helping us again,
Mr. Le Xuan.

275
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,630
Not you.

276
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,070
Just him.

277
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,830
The one and only Wen Bin.

278
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,350
You won't be able to make
a profit from it this time.

279
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,550
I understand.

280
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,310
I understand.

281
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,470
You seem reluctant.

282
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,830
Why? Do you still want to
earn money unethically?

283
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,910
I do not.

284
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,110
A noble man makes money
through honourable means.

285
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,990
Listen to yourself,

286
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,710
you sound like Feng Cheng Jun.

287
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,470
Don't talk about that petty guy.

288
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,550
What's wrong?

289
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,230
Did you scuttle your friend-ship with him?

290
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,030
He was the one who scuttled it.

291
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,070
Aren't you going to buy a new ship?

292
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,390
No, it's better this way.

293
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,870
I'm free to come and go everyday.

294
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,270
Just leave it there.

295
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,510
Go back to your room.

296
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,550
Put out the lights.

297
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,390
Here, please lift your arm.

298
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,590
Junior, you're so hardworking.

299
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,790
Unlike some people...

300
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,870
who don't clean up their own mess.

301
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,510
Excuse me.

302
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,950
Come here.

303
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,680
Are you two having a fight?

304
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,870
I don't know if this could
be considered a fight.

305
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,520
So it's a fight.

306
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,110
How about this?

307
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,550
Let's work together tonight...

308
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,790
and kick this obnoxious
guy out of here.

309
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,870
This sounds bad.

310
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,230
There's nothing bad about it.

311
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,070
He has been really
annoying these few days.

312
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,710
Moping about every day...

313
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,590
like the world owes him something.

314
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,070
Senior,

315
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,470
let's just pretend he's invisible.

316
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,270
Have you found anything on those men?

317
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,590
Shush.

318
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,920
Lower your voice.

319
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,750
I don't understand what you're afraid of.

320
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,030
You missed out a man.

321
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,550
Who?

322
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,270
Li Hu.

323
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:43,110
According to sources from the capital,

324
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,630
Qin Bei Chuan, Ke Shi Jun...

325
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,070
were fugitives, wanted
by the imperial court.

326
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:53,630
The other man who was on the run
with them was Li Hu.

327
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,750
Tell me more about it.

328
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,190
I've also heard that...

329
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,350
Ke Shi Jun, Qin Bei Chuan and Li Hu...

330
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,710
were the students of Yunzhou
scholar Xue Ding Kun,

331
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,790
like your brother Lei Ze Xun 18 years ago.

332
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,350
They were scholars
of Yun Shang Academy.

333
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,310
But why aren't their names...

334
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,710
on the executioner's list?

335
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,150
They are wanted by the imperial court.

336
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,830
They must've escaped from execution.

337
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,630
Do you know where they are?

338
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,230
Brother,

339
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,030
calm down.

340
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,280
I've heard that...

341
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,840
they disappeared without a trace
when things went south.

342
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,110
I think they must have gone into hiding...

343
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,990
to save their skins.

344
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,030
No matter where they're hiding,

345
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,070
I'll find them and get to the bottom
of this.

346
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,310
Yun is so vast.

347
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,830
It won't be easy...

348
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,710
to find those guys.

349
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,710
They were scholars
of Yun Shang Academy.

350
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,110
There must be records of them.

351
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,190
They were expelled.

352
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,870
Their names were taken off the book.

353
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,270

[Diligence Pavilion]

355
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,510
Here, take a look.

356
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,110
This essay...

357
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,110
is so...

358
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,510
What's with that get-up?

359
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,350
Are you here to clean...

360
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,310
the Diligence Pavilion?

361
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,510
Mr. Li,

362
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,150
Lei Ze Xin has become rather cute
these days.

363
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,670
Stop punishing him.

364
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,150
I didn't give them any punishment.

365
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,790
Principal Feng, you've misunderstood.

366
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,080
We've come here to clean
on our own initiative.

367
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,350
Lei Ze Xin saw how dusty
this pavilion was.

368
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,430
It has been troubling him ever since.

369
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,830
How could he let his teachers dwell
in such filth?

370
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,790
He won't allow it.

371
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,350
So...

372
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,750
he brought me here...

373
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,110
to do our beloved teachers a favour.

374
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,750
Are you sure...

375
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,110
these were the words Lei Ze Xin said?

376
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,190
Of course.

377
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,070
Good for him.

378
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,550
Wonderful.

379
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,870
Good, he's worthy to be taught.

380
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:52,150
What a miracle it is to hear Lei Ze Xin
refer to us as his "beloved teachers".

381
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,070
It doesn't make sense at all.

382
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,550
Miss, how about this?

383
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,190
Let's take a walk in front.

384
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,310
Sure, let's go.

385
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,630
What a coincidence.

386
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,630
Are you talking to me?

387
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,790
Is there anyone else here?

388
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,590
So you can talk.

389
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,430
I'm not a mute.

390
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,910
You have been silent for a while.

391
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,550
I thought you've become mute.

392
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,750
It's my freedom to pretend
to be deaf or mute.

393
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,590
Aren't you mad at me?

394
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,030
It's been so long.

395
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,430
I'm not angry anymore.

396
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,230
Such a bore.

397
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,550
Has your anger subsided,
or has it worsened?

398
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,150
Take a guess.

399
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,430
I'm too stupid for that.

400
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,590
You're so good at lying.

401
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,150
You call yourself stupid?

402
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,270
So, Mr. Deaf and Mute,

403
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,350
where are you going?

404
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,310
South Street.

405
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,110
What a coincidence. Me too.

406
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,150
Let's walk together.

407
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,870
This is the only way.

408
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,150
We can only walk together.

409
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,110
Come again.

410
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,150
I'll walk this way.

411
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,390
Me too.

412
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,870
It seems inconvenient.

413
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,070
Nothing is inconvenient.

414
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,070
You do your things, I do mine.

415
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,550
Let's go our separate ways.

416
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,630
Mr. Chao.

417
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,030
Mr. Chao.

418
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:10,790
Misters,

419
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,590
how are you here together?

420
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,950
We met each other on our way here.

421
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,150
What should I do?

422
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,980
Deal with Mr. Feng first.

423
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,990
My work will be overdue.

424
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,670
I've copied it all for you.

425
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,990
If you say so, Mr. Feng.

426
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,670
There should be no problem,

427
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,790
You've been working day and night...

428
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,390
just to copy this for me?

429
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,150
If I hadn't done it,

430
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,790
how could you focus on your studies?

431
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,790
I may be poor,

432
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:52,910
but I have integrity.

433
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,630
I don't accept charity.

434
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,430
I've earned these with my labour.

435
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,790
It didn't come from my family.

436
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,230
If you feel bad about it,

437
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,630
you can pay me back.

438
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,270
You should've told me.

439
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,390
Why did you lie to me?

440
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,110
You were the one who lied.

441
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,510
Mr. Wen, don't let...

442
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,310
Mr. Feng's hard work go into waste.

443
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,110
The fact that he hunkered down...

444
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,830
shows how much he cares about you.

445
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,990
I hope you understand.

446
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,390
Is there anything else you've
been lying to me about?

447
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,230
Nothing.

448
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,440
Don't lie to me again.

449
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,430
You too.

450
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,430
I'll do my best.

451
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,230
What do you mean by that?

452
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,590
You can lie to me...

453
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,750
but I can't lie to you?

454
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,790
Of course.

455
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,030
What gives you the right?

456
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,190
Don't be so petty.

457
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,470
You're older than me, so you
you should treat me nicely.

458
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,920
I'll do my best.

459
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,550
Mr. Li,

460
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,800
you look so tired.

461
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,270
Why don't you go back and rest?

462
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,870
Your suggestion...

463
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,750
is very wise.

464
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,030
And you've reminded me that...

465
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,350
I do feel a little tired.

466
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,710
I'll leave it to you, then.

467
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,670
I'll go back now.

468
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,630
Alright.

469
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,350
You tidy up this place.

470
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,910
I'll look for clues.

471
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,110
No.

472
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,230
Why?

473
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,790
Because you're better at it.

474
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,710
I'm better than you when it
comes to snooping around.

475
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,070
Lei Ao,

476

477

This is the only box here that is locked.

"All of you,"

482
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,550
"do you have a death wish
or are you tired of living?"

483
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,670
Why does this guy talk like that?

484
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,440
Did you write this dialogue novel?

485
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,190
I'm not that capable.

486
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:10,950
Who is it then?

487
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,990
Little Brother,

488
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,070
I have a question for you.

489
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,070
Brother Feng, you can ask me anything.

490
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,430
You're welcome to do so.

491
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,990
About that limping man...

492
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,270
with a big mole on his face,

493
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,230
how did he turn into...

494
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,110
a formidable hero?

495
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,950
How is it possible?

496
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,710
I don't think it's possible, either.

497
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,950
Brother Feng, what are you talking about?

498
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,390
I don't understand a word of it.

499
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,070
I've read all your dialogue novels.

00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,350
Shush.

501

Keep your voice down.

00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,670
let's not talk about it.

506
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,670
Actually, you wrote well.

507
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,270
Your ideas are original.

508
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:15,310
It's just that this
part doesn't make sense.

509
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:20,430
I have little talent
and limited knowledge.

510
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,510
I would appreciate your guidance
in the future.

511
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,150
In the future?

512
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,670
I guess not.

513
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,630
I'll focus on my studies from now on.

514
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,910
Do you have a death wish
or do you want to die?

515
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,710
What's wrong, Senior?

516
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,270
Tell me,

517
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,910
why is my catch phrase
in the dialogue novel?

518
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,330
What are you talking about, Senior?

519
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,190
I don't understand a word of it.

520
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:04,110
I've read Volume 3 and Volume 4
of your novel, Where Love Begins.

521
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,990
Shush, keep it down.

522
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,710
The academy is cracking
down on the dialogue novels.

523
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:11,150
Aren't you afraid of having
your buttocks hit by Mr. Li?

524
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,590
If you're not afraid, why should I be?

525
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,990
What are you so happy about?

526
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,670
Limping man...

527
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,830
with a big disgusting mole on his face...

528
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,190
who betrayed the lead character.

529
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,670
You're so gross.

530
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,360
Little Brother,

531
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,430
tell me honestly,

532
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,430
is that really me?

533
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,110
-No.
-Of course it is.

534
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,710
The way he talks resembles somebody.

535
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,590
Little Brother,

536
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,070
I understand your motives.

537
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,790
I finally realize...

538
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,550
why this chapter doesn't make sense.

539
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,310
I hope you'll give a logical
explanation in the next volume.

540
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,150
What's there to explain?

541
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,630
A disgusting person like you...

542
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,430
should be run over and killed by cow...

543
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,310
in the beginning of the next volume.

544
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:59,310
The formidable hero even saved
the maiden, Xi.

545
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,670
How could he be so easily killed by a cow?

546
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,670
Ran over and killed by cow?

547
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,230
Are these two people
actually the same person?

548
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,470
Your writing is nonsensical.

549
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,270
It's illogical.

550
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,470
I'm warning you,

551
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,590
I'm the knight in Volume 3.

552
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,510
You made me look so
reckless in Volume 4...

553
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:21,110
vying with this disgusting loser
for the woman I love.

554
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,190
You're ruining my image.

555
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,550
I'm very unhappy about it.

556
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,940
You better watch out.

557
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,510
I might actually punch you.

558
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,550
I get it, Senior.

559
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:32,990
You are laughing?

560
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,070
Behave yourself.

561
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,510
Little Brother,

562
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,630
as a scholar of Yun Shang Academy,

563
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,350
your writing must be fair and just.

564
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,910
I get it, Brother Feng.

565
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,190
What are you two doing?

566
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,510
Don't worry.

567
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,190
The academy has been so strict.

568
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,070
I'll never write again.

569
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,680
And...

570
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,680
it's getting late now.

571
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,070
Senior, Brother Feng,

572
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:04,030
how about we get some rest now?

573
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,670
You've sabotaged my image...

574
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,230
and now you're just going
to walk away?

575
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,310
Don't worry, Senior.

576
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,830
No one knows you are that knight.

577
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:13,990
I don't care.

578
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,670
You have to clear my name.

579
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,350
Little Brother, I hope to see...

580
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,270
a reasonable resolution
in the next volume.

581
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,350
Okay.

582
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,430
Such a hypocrite.
