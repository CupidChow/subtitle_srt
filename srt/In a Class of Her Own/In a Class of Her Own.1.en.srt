if you become their bride.

167
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,040
You can even have meat
for all three meals.

168
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,680
Do I look like I crave
only for meat and enjoyment?

169
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,160
How could you simply accept
a betrothal gift, Mother?

170
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,680
A woman has to get married. That's a fact.

171
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,880
Moreover, many girls...

172
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,760
wish to be married into that family.

173
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,760
Sorry, sister.

174
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,120
Don't blame mother.

175
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,120
It's all my fault.

176
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,200
It's my fault I'm weak
and prone to getting sick.

177
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,480
It's not your fault, Wen Bin.

178
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,760
Anyway, I'm not getting married.

179
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,600
Mother, please return the gift
to whomever gave it.

180
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,200
I've already used the gift.

181
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,560
You've used it? How?

182
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,080
The point is, I've already spoken to them.

183
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,880
They will pick an auspicious date
and you'll be married off.

184
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,320
No way!

185
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,480
Look at the way you currently are.

186
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,520
You're out there selling your work
in your brother's clothes.

187
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,170
Is this the life you want?

188
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,300
I'm fine with it.

189
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,720
I don't know what's going on
inside your head.

190
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,560
It's fine if you think I'm forcing you,

191
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,860
or selling you off.

192
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,520
But I'm doing this for your own good.

193
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,480
When the day comes for me to go,

194
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,240
and I see your father,

195
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,840
I will not be ashamed.

196
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,560
I'm not marrying.

197
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,600
Now, how much gift money did you spend?

198
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,120
I'll pay them back.

199
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,760
Are there no orders that pay better?

200
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,160
I'm in need of money urgently.

201
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,920
Other than writing papers
and sitting for exams, anything is fine.

202
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,870
Understandable.

203
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,840
I actually do have a special request.

204
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,360
The Yun Shang preliminary exam
is happening in two days.

205
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,600
There's a guy that needs...

206
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,400
an assistant.

207
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,920
"Assistant"?

208
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
To do what?

209
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,000
Hand out the papers?

210
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,720
Prepare the ink?

211
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,160
-Preparing drinks?
-Something like that.

212
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,320
Basically, the assistant...

213
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,000
will read out the answers
to help the participant with the exam.

214
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,120
That's cheating!

215
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,920
How is that different from
sitting on their behalf?

216
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,720
Of course it is.

217
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,440
Sitting on their behalf
is replacing the participant.

218
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,680
That's cheating.

219
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,400
I know you are a man of principles.

220
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,160
I won't put you in a difficult spot.

221
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,440
An assistant is different.

222
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,600
That's a helping hand, a good deed.

223
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,720
A person who helps the needy
is commendable.

224
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,120
-Do you understand?
-Not at all.

225
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,480
Forget it then.

226
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,640
[Where Love Begins, Volume II]

227
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,940
Young Master.

228
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,160
Young Master, shouldn't you
be focused on revising for the exam?

229
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,720
How do you have time for novels?

230
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,240
This book looks to be unsophisticated,

231
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,280
but the writing is refined.

232
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,360
The relationship depicted in the story...

233
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,880
is alluring and draws the reader in.

234
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,760
Still, it isn't something an intellectual
like you should be seen with.

235
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,120
Remember the young man?

236
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,360
Clearly, he's been blinded by
those unrealistic love stories.

237
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,800
That's true.

238
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,760
These materials aren't suited
for a person at his age.

239
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,200
But, I have to say his imitation
of father's handwriting...

240
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,680
is indeed very accurate
and difficult to tell apart.

241
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,920
Unfortunately, he's making a living...

242
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,480
off of the counterfeits.

243
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,220
Young Master, you only just
returned to Yunzhou.

244
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,600
There are many things about the society
that you don't yet see.

245
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,560
There are actually
quite a lot of people like him.

246
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,680
Those from good backgrounds
take part in the selection exam.

247
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,040
Those with bad backgrounds
have to make do with whatever.

248
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,680
That is life.

249
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,320
By the way, the Academy said
we can visit in the afternoon.

250
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,000
I'll go and prepare.

251
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,120
-Get out of here!
-Pay up!

252
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,760
-You can't come in!
-Stop!

253
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,840
What is this?

254
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
What are you doing?

255
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,320
Committing a crime
in broad daylight?

256
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,520
-I'll report you!
-Who's reporting who?

257
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,400
Stand aside!

258
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,960
Yes, sir.

259
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,960
Madam.

260
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,440
I see you've got
an exquisitely beautiful daughter.

261
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,369
Why even borrow usury loans?

262
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,880
You borrowed usury loans?

263
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,880
Sister, mother didn't have
any other choice.

264
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,240
The doctor said I needed an expensive
medicine that costs 500 taels.

265
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,640
500 taels?

266
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,360
That's right. Now you know the story.

267
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,840
Since you're not paying what you owe,
we have to come knocking.

268
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,280
But I've changed my mind.

269
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,440
The money and interest your mother owes...

270
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,480
can be forgotten.

271
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,360
I want the pretty girl in exchange.

272
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,280
You will come with me.

273
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,200
No!

274
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,240
My daughter's already
betrothed to the Li family.

275
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,000
She is no longer of this household.

276
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,120
The debt owed by us
has nothing to do with her.

277
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,800
I'll pay you what I owe myself.

278
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,480
-Mother.
-Looks like you've got everything planned.

279
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,930
You're purposely
dragging your feet on this.

280
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,840
-Men!
-Yes, sir.

281
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,680
-Bring them to the magistrate court.
-Yes, sir.

282
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,560
Wait!

283
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,240
Seven days.

284
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,320
I'll pay you every penny
within seven days.

285
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,040
And what if you fail to pay in seven days?

286
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,960
What will happen then?

287
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,120
I'll go with you if I can't pay up.

288
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,920
-All right.
-Sister!

289
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,120
What are you saying?
She doesn't get to decide.

290
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,640
I'll take your word for it.

291
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,320
I'm getting more attracted
to this pretty lady's personality.

292
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,440
However,

293
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,780
before you clear your debt,

294
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,960
I'm afraid your little brother
will have to stay with me for a few days.

295
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,760
Don't you worry! He will be treated well.

296
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,320
He'll be fine.

297
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,360
No way! You can't take my brother.

298
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,840
Miss,

299
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,720
I'm already being very understanding here.

300
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,320
It's rude to take it too far.

301
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,120
Wen Bin!

302
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,960
Sister.

303
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,190
Mother.

304
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,960
Don't worry about me.

305
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,240
-I'll go with them.
-You can't!

306
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,080
Let it be.

307
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,640
Don't worry, Wen Bin.

308
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,960
I'll get you home quickly.

309
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,480
To learn something and timely practice it,
isn't that a pleasure?

310
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,320
To have friends coming from afar,
isn't it a delight?

311
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,320
Do not blame a person
who does not recognise you.

312
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,200
That's gentlemanly, is it not?

313
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,040
Scale the wall?

314
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,720
Aside from the designated open day,

315
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,320
Yun Shang Academy
is off limits to the public.

316
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,880
Did you think you could sashay in
through the main entrance?

317
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,000
Hurry up! Stop dawdling!

318
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,040
Hurry.

319
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,840
Listen, the client is the president
of the Student Council.

320
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,680
He is known as the President.

321
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,440
Mind what you say.

322
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,520
This is the President
of Yun Shang Academy,

323
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,360
the eldest son of aristocrats Han.

324
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,880
Good day, sirs.

325
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,480
This is the guy I found for you.

326
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,960
Mr. Chao.

327
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,400
You've brought the right person this time.

328
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,280
Of course.

329
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,760
This person is definitely
the cream of the crop.

330
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,600
You call him the "cream of the crop"?

331
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,560
Isn't he much too young?

332
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,200
You call me out for being young,

333
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,880
but from your voice,
we should be around the same age.

334
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,600
And yet you're a scholar at Yun Shang.

335
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
I may not have the same qualifications,

336
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,800
but to strike me off as not being suitable
based on my age...

337
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,240
is unfair.

338
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,920
If you're truly skilled,

339
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,840
why didn't you sit for the exam yourself
and be a scholar?

340
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,160
There are countless professions
in this world.

341
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,920
Some choose this, others choose that.

342
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,440
If you must argue who's better and not,
half would be ousted.

343
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,720
The world would be in chaos.

344
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,920
I didn't sit for the exam
because that's not what I'm interested in.

345
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,440
No interest in that, huh?

346
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,480
So what can you do?

347
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,320
Show us.

348
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,360
I will test you with
the content of this book.

349
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,800
I'll read the first half,
you continue with the rest.

350
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,490
Why are you laughing?

351
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,760
I don't think just memorizing...

352
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,640
is enough to eliminate
the doubt completely.

353
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
What about this?

354
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,360
Write a phrase on the paper.

355
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,840
I'll fill in the complete excerpt.

356
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,720
How about that?

357
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,120
Your turn.

358
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,160
[Be prudent. The so-called sincere one,
don't deceive yourself.]

359
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,320
President.

360
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,200
Not one word is amiss.

361
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,260
Last year,

362
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,840
Mr. Chao brought me three copiers.

363
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,840
Right before the exam ended,
the invigilator caught them...

364
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,080
and they were punished to 30 beatings
until their flesh broke.

365
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,520
That was just an accident.

366
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,640
I hope you understand.

367
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,080
No matter what happens,

368
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,080
you will only be getting payment from me,

369
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,520
not protection.

370
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,600
I'm not someone
you can afford to mess with.

371
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,840
Got it?

372
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,880
I'll remember that.

373
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,400
I will bear all consequences.

374
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,360
"One, not helping scholars."

375
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,760
"Two, not sitting for the academy exam."

376
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,600
What happened to your principles?

377
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,680
You're such a tease, sir.

378
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,120
He only accepted the job
because I forced him to.

379
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,400
Principles are the most
useless standards in this world.

380
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,600
It's money that rules the world.

381
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,240
What about working for me after this?

382
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,280
I have plenty of opportunities
for you to make money.

383
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,320
You flatter me, sir.

384
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,720
It's true that I'm doing this
because I need money.

385
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,800
But it doesn't mean
I agree with your viewpoints.

386
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,680
Farewell.

387
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,800
Calm yourself.

388
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,000
Will staying calm help me get out?

389
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,000
Sure.

390
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,440
You can get out
if you get whacked 30 times.

391
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,520
But I don't want to get whacked.

392
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,720
Then, get yourself out of here!

393
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,480
-What about you?
-I have to cover for you.

394
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,190
-Make sure you stay safe.
-Don't worry about me.

395
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,480
-Stop!
-Stop right there!

396
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,460
Stop!

397
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,120
Hey, you!

398
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,440
I'm sorry, so sorry!

399
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,880
-I didn't mean to.
-Do you think just apologising...

400
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,840
would make the hurt you caused disappear?

401
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,080
Your face, Young Master.

402
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,360
Do you know who my young master is?

403
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,720
Are you okay?

404
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,460
Stay here, Young Master.
I'll make him pay for this!

405
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,360
Open up!

406
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,680
Open the door if you're a man!

407
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,320
Open up!

408
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,960
You can hit someone
but can't open the door?

409
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,480
Open up!

410
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,040
Now!

411
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,790
Open the door!

412
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,320
-Sir.
-Sir.

413
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,560
Did you see a guy?

414
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,520
I believe he's a copier that snuck in.

415
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,310
What would you do with him
if you caught him?

416
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,080
He'd get at least 30 beatings.

417
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,120
Such a person should be punished.

418
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,640
So did you see anyone like that
pass through here?

419
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:55,970
He’s in there.

420
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,880
Let's go.

421
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,040
Quick, break down the door.

422
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,440
Hey, did you see a man come inside?

423
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,440
No, nothing.

424
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,880
It's a girl.

425
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,360
What is up with the fire?
There's so much smoke.

426
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,200
-Let's go.
-Go.

427
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,960
The student just now
must have seen wrongly.

428
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,680
The 100 taels is not enough
to save Wen Bin.

429
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,120
I need another plan.

430
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,640
-Freeze!
-Stop!

431
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,560
Stop!

432
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,120
-What do you want?
-Rob him!

433
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,760
-No, don't!
-Give it to me!

434
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,800
Come on.

435
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,320
-Give it back!
-You little scoundrel.

436
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,960
Are you guys looking for death
or are sick of living?

437
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,400
Who said that?

438
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,160
Big brother, they stole my ransom money!

439
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,640
Who are you calling big brother?

440

442
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,360

A grown man...

450
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,000

00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,960
This may my first time being an aide,

492
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,440
but I'm confident in helping you
get on the board.

493
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,680
Your answer is good,
but it lacks subjective input.

494
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,480
You're the one taking the exam.

495
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,960
I'm just providing you with a bit of help.

496
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,760
What is your understanding
on "application of knowledge"?

497
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,680
I help you with the answer
so that you can pass.

498
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,720
Then, I get paid.

499
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,080
That is the application of knowledge.

500
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,920
How shallow-minded you are.

501
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,880
I'm sorry. I got the wrong person.

502
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,400
You're disrupting the exam.

503
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,320
Taking the exam for someone else
is a disgrace to a literati.

504
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,560
You're not getting away.

505
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,480
Sir, I wouldn't be doing this
if I had a choice.

506
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,080
My family is in trouble, a member is sick.

507
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,600
We're being chased by the creditor.

508
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,520
That's the only reason why I'm doing this.

509
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,680
I swear, this is my first time.

510
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,280
I won't do it again.
Please spare me this once.

511
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,160
What's your name?

512
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,400
My surname is Wen.
My name is a single word, Bin.

513
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,380
Invigilator, someone is trying
to disrupt the exam!

514
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,160
What did you say?

515
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,440
Who dares to break the rules?

516
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,560
Who is cheating?

517
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,760
It's every one of the
participants and copiers.

518
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,920
Including myself.

519
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,670
As well as the invigilators seated there.

520
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,080
[Preliminary exam]

521
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,000
What did you say?

522
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,840
I don't seem to understand.

523
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,719
As students, we have failed
to be of clear conscience,

524
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,280
but resorting to craftiness instead.

525
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,800
Openly copying answers...

526
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,320
or even using copiers to fish for fame.

527
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,639
This is unacceptable!

528
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,679
Yet, all of us here
have turned a blind eye towards it...

529
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,800
for our own sake.

530
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,199
How is this different
from cheating ourselves?

531
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:28,280
You pretend to be oblivious
to what's happening before you.

532
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,440
You're not qualified as the invigilator.

533
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,440
What an arrogant brat.
How dare you to question the authority?

534
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,440
State your name.

535
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,000
I will strike you off the list!

536
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,080
I am Feng Cheng Jun.

537
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,159
Show me your registry.

538
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,639
I want to know which family
this crazy boy is from.

539
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,600
No need to check, Principal Feng.

540
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,199
Feng Cheng Jun is the son
of Lord Feng, Yunzhou's governor.

541
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,320
-No wonder.
-The governor's son?

542
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,000
I see.

543
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,640
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

544
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,360
Did you guys see that?

545
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,680
Did you hear that?

546
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,480
This is doing what's best
for public interest.

547
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,480
This is owning up to your actions.

548
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,560
Don't just stand there.

549
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,920
Rectify the problem!

550
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,560
But they were doing well...

551
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,480
Right.

552
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,880
All the aides will be removed
from the venue!

553
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,000
What are they doing?

554
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,560
-Go, leave the venue.
-Leave.

555
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,440
Move it!

556
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,360
-Move along.
-Hurry up!

557
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,520
Go wait outside.

558
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:52,610
I'm off.

559
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,520
-Hurry up.
-Quick.

560
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,290
Continue answering.

561
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,160
Finally, a proper academy exam.

562
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,000
I've been waiting for it.

563
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:25,660
This is how the academy exam
is supposed to be.

564
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,280
Mr. Feng, it's all thanks to you.

565
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,160
There hasn't been such a smooth exam
in a long time.

566
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,130
I only did what I was supposed to.

567
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,120
Then, why did you bring your own notes?

568
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,840
Notes?

569
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,640
He really has them.

570
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,920
[A distinguished scholar...]

571
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,850
-[Such a busybody.]
-[Rectify the problem!]

572
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,600
-[Now I won't get paid.]
-[Hurry up.]

573
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,800
-[Leave.]
-[Go on.]

574
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,840
[Hurry up.]

575
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,040
[Go!]

576
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,200
Mr. Feng, is this supposed
to be your motto?

577
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,000
Silence!

578
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,280
[Blame the seating plan!]

579
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,960
It read the same vertically
or horizontally.

580
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,600
Did you forget who the client is?

581
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,880
It's the president of Yun Shang,
Young Master Han!

582
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,360
Yes, I know.

583
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,000
And do you know...

584
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,440
that he is in charge of all matters
pertaining to the scholars of Yun Shang?

585
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,200
You managed to ruin everything.

586
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,120
I will probably never get another piece...

587
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,320
of Yun Shang Academy's pie.

588
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,440
It wasn't just me who got in trouble.

589
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,680
Every one of the aides
were removed from the venue.

590
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,640
Almost all of the aides present...

591
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,480
were arranged by President Han.

592
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,920
It's all because you...

593
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,760
stepped on the governor's son,
Feng Cheng Jun's toes.

594
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,680
That's why things turned out like this.

595
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,360
It was an accident.

596
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,640
I can't do anything.

597
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,440
You couldn't even manage
this small matter properly.

598
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,880
How do you expect us Hans
to compete with the Fengs...

599
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,080
for the position of leader
of the aristocrats?

600
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,880
Those useless fools.

601
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,040
If they had to cheat
to pass the preliminary,

602
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,720
they wouldn't be capable of much more.

603
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,640
Those useless fools are the ones
who will help you become the head!

604
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,560
I personally gave my word to the Tians...

605
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,440
that I'd get his son into
Yun Shang Academy this year.

606
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,360
You couldn't even do that.

607
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,880
How am I supposed to face the Tians now?

608
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,680
Did you do that to get attention...

609
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,840
and public praise?

610
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,560
I only did what I was supposed to do.

611
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:00,410
Those with outstanding talents
are susceptible to jealousy.

612
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,960
The higher you climb,

613
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,440
the harder the fall.

614
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,440
It is better to keep a low profile
and bide your time.

615
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,160
Listen carefully. At Yun Shang Academy,

616
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,720
you have to be the ruler.

617
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,960
Make sure all the scholars
submit themselves to you.

618
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,000
That's how you'll become like me,

619
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,600
with prestige and status.

620
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,680
Yes, Father.

621
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,160
You're unwilling to bear the burden,

622
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,440
nor stand out from the rest.

623
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,120
So what exactly is your intention?

624
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,160
Fairness.

625
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,920
Whoever it is,

626
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,840
as long as they are smart,

627
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,240
and with the aspiration
to serve the country,

628
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,400
should be supported.

629
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,880
As expressed by Mr. Xue Ding Kun
18 years ago.

630
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,880
Even though he died
before accomplishing much,

631
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,240
his dream and ambition...

632
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,000
will one day be known to the world
and be lauded.

633
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,600
What Xue Ding Kun did is seen
as traitorous in the eyes of the public.

634
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,710
Never mention him again.

635
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,720
Okay.

636
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,120
If Mr. Feng found out
I'm still dealing with you,

637
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,200
-I'd really be out of business. Leave now.
-Wait...

638
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,840
-You're chasing me away?
-I have to.

639
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,600
-But I really need money.
-So do I, Mr. Wen.

640
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,320
I'm sorry.

641
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,760
Fine then.

642
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,000
I shouldn't cause you more trouble.
Please take care.
