[Episode 21]

4
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,000
Delicious!

5
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,560
-Yeah, it's delicious.
-It really is.

6
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,750
Help yourselves.

7
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,750
The young lady of Han isn't only pretty,

8
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,000
she delivers good food, too.

9
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,570
Brother Zi Feng, calm down.

10
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,020
Help yourself.

11
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,740
How unnecessary.

12
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,380
You're not being appreciative
of Father's hospitality.

13
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,330
I am the best student in Yun Shang.

14
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,060
Besides,

15
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,530
I have never let Father down.

16
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,289
And I hope...

17
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,820
he stays out of my business.

18
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,280
Despite your talent and wealth,

19
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,740
you will not gain others' respect...

20
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,570
if you don't treat them with sincerity.

21
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,570
I'm not well educated.

22
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,340
But I know any relationship
is a two way street.

23
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,440
As the president,

24
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,690
if you treat your fellow
students with sincerity,

25
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:21,800
I believe...

26
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,180
they'll respect you from
the bottom of their hearts, too.

27
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,560
My sister's all grown up now.

28
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,260
You're lecturing me already.

29
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,470
Don't you agree with me?

30
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,540
Yes, you're always right.

31
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,079
Okay. You're done here.

32
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,820
It's late. You should head home.

33
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,360
Don't stick around at Yun Shang Academy...

34
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,130
or people will talk.

35
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,460
I shall take my leave, then.

36
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,020
Stop drinking.

37
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,460
Tell me,

38
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,930
did Wen Bin take some
magical pills or what?

39
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,490
It's been only a few days.

40
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,210
Yet, he's had made such a big improvement.

41
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,290
It's absurd.

42
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,800
Come on, Bing Shen.

43
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,670
Instead of drinking
and whining alone here,

44
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,690
you should spend your time practicing.

45
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,750
I do. I practice everyday.

46
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:56,690
Look.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,930
Tell me,

48
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,020
did you say that
because you don't trust me?

49
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,540
Do you think I will lose?

50
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,410
-That's impossible.
-Enough!

51
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,570
Knock it off.

52
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,690
Get more practice.

53
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,779
Listen,

54
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,570
make one mistake tomorrow
and see what the president will do to you.

55
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,570
I told you...

56
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,810
I will not lose.

57
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,900
Wen Bin...

58
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,620
doesn't hit the bullseye every time.

59
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,780
But me,

60
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,690
I hit it almost every time.

61
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,280
-You're still laughing?
-Let's drink.

62
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,530
Stop drinking!

63
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,130
Are you sober now?

64
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,250
You want to drink?

65
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,740
Why hasn't Brother Ze Xin returned?

66
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,760
Maybe he went out for a drink.

67
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,500
The archery ceremony's tomorrow
and he's out drinking?

68
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,850
It's just a guess. Don't worry.

69
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,180
Don't move.

70
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,620
Arrest him.

71
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,460
Let's see who's behind that mask.

72
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,840
Stay where you are,

73
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,370
or I'll kill him.

74
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,780
Don't you know that I'm
a government official?

75
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,290
Shut up.

76
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,840
Out of my way!

77
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,900
Back off.

78
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,220
Go.

79
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,940
Stay where you are.

80
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,850
Get lost!

81
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,410
My lord.

82
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,670
Get the injured one.

83
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,970
-Go!
-Get him!

84
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,880
Let's go!

85
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,130
That way.

86
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,350
This way, hurry up.

87
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,060
-Get him!
-There he is.

88
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,220
-Stop! Come down.
-He's here.

89
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,940
Deputy Commander.

90
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,940
Commander Xu.

91
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,940
This area belongs to Yun Shang Academy.

92
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,720
Take your men and leave.

93
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,570
But, my lord, the criminal is right ahead.

94
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,169
You can't simply enter Yun Shang Academy.

95
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,570
Don't you know that?

96
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,490
-Retreat.
-Come on, get him!

97
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,050
Head General.

98
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,420
Where's he?

99
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,930
Did he escape to Yun Shang Academy?

100
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,120
I'm unsure of that,

101
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,900
but he did head towards the school.

102
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,730
-After him.
-Lord Gu,

103
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,730
trespassing Yun Shang Academy...

104
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,370
is a serious crime.

105
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,250
I will go in there myself.

106
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,660
I'll go with you, Lord Gu.

107
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,130
What are you doing?

108
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,660
Mr. Liu.

109
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,900
You're in Yun Shang Academy's premises.

110
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,160
Show some respect.

111
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,540
It's you, Mr. Liu.

112
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,220
I'm sorry.

113
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,340
I'll leave right away.

114
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,170
My lord.

115
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,340
The archery ceremony is tomorrow.

116
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,690
Please leave at once.

117
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,250
Don't make a scene here.

118
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,370
Let the scholars rest.

119
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,550
In order to capture a criminal,

120
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,930
I had no choice but to trespass.

121
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,050
I'll admit my mistake
to Lord Han tomorrow.

122
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,900
Good bye.

123
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,370
Mr. Ding,

124
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,220
I'm not against this.

125
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,220
Mr. Ding,

126
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,170
for tomorrow...

127
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,610
-Who's that?
-Who's there?

128
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,220
It's Lei Ze Xin.

129
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,050
Lei Ze Xin?

130
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,250
Come here.

131
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,340
I finally caught you!

132
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,610
Principal Feng, Mr. Ding.

133
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,860
You were always so strong.

134
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,420
Why do you fall down so easily now?

135
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,020
I... I'm drunk.

136
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,100
Oh, my.

137
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,980
You are audacious.

138
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,800
How dare you drink wine...

139
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,370
the night before an important ceremony?

140
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,810
Very well.

141
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,340
Listen,

142
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,050
if Cheng Jun and Wen Bin...

143
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,420
don't get first place tomorrow, I...

144
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,300
I'll take 1000 points off
your nobility marks.

145
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,360
Principal Feng, look,

146
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,870
all that matters is he's here.

147
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,070
Let him return to his room and rest.

148
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,980
You have no discipline.

149
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,610
You're hopeless!

150
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,490
Principal Feng,

151
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,120
when Governor Feng learns how nice
you are to Feng Cheng Jun,

152
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,980
he'll be pleased.

153
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,540
Little Brother,

154
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,860
I might not be able to
keep my promise this time.

155
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,810
[He's badly injured.]

156
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,660
[Winning the archery ceremony
seems like a long shot.]

157
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,120
There were two of them?

158
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,300
Yes.

159
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,280
The second person came out of the blue,

160
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,860
or we would've captured
the badly injured one.

161
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,220
It seems...

162
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,930
things are getting more complicated.

163
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,170
Lord Han,

164
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,680
I don't think either of
them has anything to do...

165
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,420
with the Book of Ten Thousand Words.

166
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,490
According to my spies,

167
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,170
there was only one person
distributing the book.

168
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,690
He was always alone.

169
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,900
The man in black
who appeared unexpectedly...

170
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,610
doesn't seem to be related to him
in any way.

171
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,610
The man must be up to something else.

172
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,610
We thought we had the injured man
in our grasp.

173
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,490
But to our surprise,

174
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,810
he entered Yun Shang Academy's grounds,

175
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,550
and got away...

176
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,120
since we could not raid the place.

177
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,220
Yun Shang Academy, again?

178
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,340
Yes.

179
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,280
I think that the
criminal is very likely...

180
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,980
to be someone in the academy.

181
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,420
Looks like...

182
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,460
we're left with no choice...

183
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,730
but to search Yun Shang Academy.

184
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,420
His Majesty has decreed...

185
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,730
that soldiers and weapons aren't
allowed in Yun Shang Academy.

186
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,250
Lord Han,

187
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,550
this is against His Majesty's order.

188
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,840
I have always...

189
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,340
kept His Majesty's decree in my mind.

190
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,340
Today's the archery ceremony, isn't it?

191
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,430
During the ceremony, all scholars...

192
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,730
will be present in the academy.

193
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:12,420
This is too good an opportunity to waste.

194
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:17,070
We can enter Yun Shang Academy
with Master Wang...

195
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,810
to watch the archery ceremony.

196
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,220
Once we're inside,

197
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,050
we'll search every nook and cranny.

198
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,050
A wise decision, my lord.

199
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,100
The criminal is severely wounded.

200
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,020
If he's one of the scholars,

201
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,720
he'll have to use his
strength as he draws the bow.

202
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,610
And that's when he'll reveal himself.

203
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,690
God bless us.

204
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,930
God bless us.

205
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,020
God bless us.

206
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,810
Lei Ze Xin can't be trusted.

207
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,860
It's no wonder no one is friends with him.

208
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,480
He's not like that.

209
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,540
Besides,

210
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,660
it was my idea to invite him.

211
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,020
It was all my fault.

212
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,810
Little Brother, don't blame yourself.

213
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,990
Although we've been disqualified,

214
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,150
you've grown tremendously
during the training...

215
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,520
and surpassed yourself.

216
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,329
You're the champion in our hearts.

217
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:09,910
Yeah.

218
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,000
I think he's right.

219
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,339
It's the journey that counts.

220
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,609
That's right.

221
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,020
President!

222
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,580
President.

223
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,790
President, good news!

224
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,300
Lei Ze Xin has gone missing.

225
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,670
We will win for sure!
Aren't you surprised?

226
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,130
Are you glad?

227
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,940
Listen,

228
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,250
this is the last thing I want to hear.

229
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,130
Don't get carried away.

230
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,300
I don't want any mistakes from you,

231
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,450
with or without the opponent.

232
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,020
You got it?

233
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,730
Let's go.

234
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,300
Principal Feng,

235
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,430
is there anything else...

236
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,900
that we need to change?

237
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,180
Not bad, not bad.

238
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,730
-Bring it there.
-Give it to me.

239
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,450
Who let you in?

240
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,300
How dare you barge in
before Master Wang arrives?

241
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,190
What nerve!

242
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,970
You should know better! Get out!

243
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,520
Principal,

244
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,210
I have something urgent to tell Mr. Liu.

245
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,020
What is it?

246
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,700
Tell me now.

247
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,940
What is it?

248
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,950
Mr. Liu, did you patrol
the school last night?

249
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,900
Yes, I did.

250
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,020
Did you see Lei Ze Xin?

251
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,550
I couldn't find him...

252
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,720
since last night.

253
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,760
If this goes on,

254
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,400
Feng Cheng Jun and Wen Bin's team...

255
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,610
will be disqualified from the ceremony.

256
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,670
He's no where to be found? Says who?

257
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,880
I saw him drinking wine
at the backyard last night.

258
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,520
Why can't you find him?

259
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,210
Could he have gone missing?

260
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,970
The backyard?

261
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,300
I'll look for him now.

262
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,370
Go ahead.

263
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,430
Lei Ze Xin is such a troublesome lad.

264
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,330
I regret letting him join
Feng Cheng Jun's team.

265
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,420
Report to me as soon as you've found him.

266
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,610
They're all troublesome.

267
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,970
Lei Ao.

268
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,940
Lei Ao.

269
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,300
Once we're in Yun Shang Academy,

270
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,570
take our men and begin the hunt in secret.

271
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,090
Rest assured, my lord.

272
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,030
I will know right away...

273
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,130
if it indeed is one of the scholars.

274
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,190
Kill him secretly if necessary.

275
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,370
Got it.

276
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,300
Master Wang's here.

277
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,420
Halt.

278
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,610
Greetings, Lord Han.

279
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,250
-Welcome, Master Wang.
-Welcome, Master Wang.

280
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,720
Lord Han, why are you here too?

281
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,190
Gu Zhen Yuan and I have been
waiting for you, Master Wang.

282
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,880
We wish to follow you
to Yun Shang Academy...

283
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,970
and watch the archery ceremony.

284
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:02,130
I'm delighted by your
interest in the ceremony.

285
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,480
Both our sons...

286
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,600
are students in the academy.

287
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,950
Master Wang has shown
so much concern for these students.

288
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,190
As their fathers,

289
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,520
we should pay attention
to their performance.

290
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,430
Therefore, Master Wang, I wish you...

291
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,730
could take us there.

292
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,640
Don't stand on ceremony.

293
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,670
Let's all go and watch
the archery ceremony.

294
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,020
Thank you, Master Wang.

295
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,660
I remember I recommended
one of your sons...

296
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,380
for admission to Yun Shang Academy,
am I right?

297
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,270
Yes, sir.

298
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,600
The three of you...

299
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,270
must be looking forward to seeing...

300
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,700
your sons' performances
in the archery ceremony.

[Yun Shang Academy]

302
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,030
Let's go to the field.

303
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,820
Brother Ze Xin might be waiting there.

304
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,580
What if he's not there?

305
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,400
Will the president laugh at us?

306
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,720
Didn't your God tell you...

307
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,820
to stay positive?

308
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,120
I think Wen Bin's right.

309
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,400
-Let's go to the field.
-Yeah.

310

-Come on, Brother Feng.
-I'm so anxious.

311

Let's go, Cheng Jun.

312
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,700
Go...

313
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,640
Don't worry.

314
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,730
We've been practising.

315
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,580
Time to show them what we're made of.

316
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:28,970
Look.

317
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,060
Feel it.

318
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,700
The grip's terrible.

319
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,330
-This one is good.
-You can use it.

320

Lei Ze Xin still hasn't shown up?

321
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,060
You seem very concerned about him.

322
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,940
No, I'm not.

323
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,780
I just don't want you to be disappointed.

324
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,940
Besides, something's troubling me.

325
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,430
What if Master Wang decides to stay...

326
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,210
after the archery ceremony?

327
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,420
Then,

328

You get to see Mr. Wen again.

Are the clothes and
jewelry for the show ready?

So,

00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,480
the more reason we should be...

342
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,250
fair, open and just.

343
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,720
As usual,

344
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,950
make your choice...

345
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,910
and place your bet.

346
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,060
Okay.

347
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,820
Han...

348
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,780
But of course...

349
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,910
You're early.

350
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,270
All in on Mr. Feng.

351
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,060
Excellent choice. Take this.

352
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,580
Misses, this way please.

353
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,600
Next, allow me...

354
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,330
to explain the strength of each team.

355
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,940
Team one,

356
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,190
President Han Sheng Zhi.

357
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,210
Han Sheng Zhi.

358
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,880
Listen,

359
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,090
the previous batch of
bows were bad in quality.

360
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,700
This batch is the best one in the school.

361
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,450
Zi Ming.

362
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,780
-Lord Gu.
-Lord Gu.

363
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,150
Yes, Father?

364
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,820
Did any students come
back late last night?

365
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,030
Yes.

366
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,900
Take me to them.

367
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,370
So,

368
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,970
Looks like Feng Cheng Jun and Wen Bin...

369
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,210
have become quite valorous.

370
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,820
You do have an eye for talent,
Master Wang.

371
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,240
There's an old saying,

372
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,540
"Pearls are everywhere, but not the eyes
that can spot them."

373
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,850
I hope they will outshine everyone...

374
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,450
in the archery ceremony.

375
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:22,820
Master Wang,

376
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,660
it's time. Shall we head to the field?

377
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,910
Let's go.

378
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:27,850
This way, please.

379
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,180
Did you find him?

380
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,660
Mr. Liu, Mr. Liu.

381
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,780
Let's go.

382
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,700
This way.

383
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,130
That's it.

384
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,450
Thank you.

385
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,820
You may leave.

386
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,660
All the teachers, guards
and assistants are clean.

387
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,850
So are the three scholars.

388
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,090
Looks like you are mistaken.

389
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,420
My lord,

390
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,070
there's one more student...

391
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,820
who didn't go to bed on time
named Lei Ze Xin.

392
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,730
He's gone missing.

393
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,430
According to the school guards,

394
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,840
he was seen at the backyard last night.

395
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,130
Find him at once.

396
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,420
Yes, sir.

397
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,130
Brother Zhao Rong,

398
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,030
everyone's here. Why hasn't he shown up?

399
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,330
-We...
-Feng Cheng Jun.

400
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,730
Looks like my chance to teach
you people a lesson has slipped.

401
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,090
What a shame.

402
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,480
Guys, guys.

403
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,910
The archery ceremony is about to start.

404
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,540
Nice! Finally!

405
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,780
Good.

406
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,330
Mister, which team is Wen Bin on?

407
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,330
Team Two.

408
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,370
-Team Two.
-You want to bet on them?

409
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,310
Good choice.

410
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:26,130
Any team with Mr. Feng
is a shoo-in to win.

411
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,150
-Team One, please.
-Me too.

412
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,910
-Team One for me.
-Me too.

413
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,600
I'm betting on Han Zhi Sheng's team.

414
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,550
-He'll win.
-For sure.

415
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,880
They've always won.

416
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,310
The archery ceremony starts now.

417
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,450
Team One, step forth!

418
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,150
Team One, step forth!

419
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,210
-It's started. Go for it.
-Yeah.

420
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,660
You'd better not let me down.

421
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,910
-Go, President!
-President.

422
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,450
-Go for it.
-Go for it.

423
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,730
We're done for.

424
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,820
Lei Ze Xin is not coming.

425
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,940
What should we do?

426
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,610
Fine.

427
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,330
Team One has entered the field.

428
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,850
Team One has entered the field.

429
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,610
Team One has entered the field.

[Mu Lai Bookstore]

431
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,300
Team One has entered the field.

432
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,300
Team One has entered the field.

Team One has entered the field.

00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,520
You heard it.

435
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,000
Team One has entered the field.

436
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,550
It's show time.

437
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,210
Nice!

438
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,250
The flag will be positioned in the middle.

439
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,300
Shoot in order.

440
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,190
Do not cheat.

441
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,210
Yes, sir.

442
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,060
[Search every single corner.]

443
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,030
Keep your eyes open...

444
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,420
and search carefully.

445
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,540
-[Yes, sir]
-[Yes, sir.]

446
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,250
-[Search there.]
-[Okay.]

[He's not here.]

[He's not here, either.]

The archery ceremony.

450
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,610
The contestant is ready.
Permission to shoot?

451
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,060
Granted.

452
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,330
Han Sheng Zhi, ten points.

453
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,420
[Ten]

454
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,480
Mr. Han is very strong indeed.

455
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,130
Like father, like son.

456
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,250
Another ten points for Han Sheng Zhi.

457
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,610
Another ten points for Han Sheng Zhi.

458
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,610
The president's amazing.

459
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,370
Han Sheng Xiong, get ready.

460
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,190
Mr. Han hits the bullseye every time.

461
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,210
That's the president for you.

462
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,060
Master Wang and Principal Feng,
thank you for praising him.

463
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,190
We're going to lose without
Brother Ze Xin, aren't we?

464
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,730
Calm down, it's still anyone's guess.

465
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,580
Why are you looking at the sky?

466
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,250
I hope Lei Ze Xin will
descend from the sky.

467
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,700
What are you doing?

468
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,020
What are we doing?

469
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,730
What do you think?

470
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,030
I'm a Yun Shang scholar.

471
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,090
A scholar?

472
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:06,330
We'll see about that after we check you
for wounds.

473
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,660
Stop it.

474
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,940
Freeze.

475
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,020
What are you doing?

476
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,250
Gu Zhe Yuan.

477
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,760
This is a place of learning.

478
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,250
What do you want,
breaking in with these armed men?

479
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,900
I'm here to capture the criminal...

480
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,610
by Lord Han's order.

481
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,700
Ridiculous.

482
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,530
There are only teachers and
scholars in Yun Shang Academy.

483
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,730
The criminal you're
looking for isn't here.

484
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,490
Why are you standing here?

485
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,000
Go to the ceremony now.

486
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,020
-Yes, sir.
-Not so fast.

487
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:46,450
I managed to stab the criminal last night.

488
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,610
I just want to check...

489
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,000
his belly...

490
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,850
to see if he's the one we're looking for.

491
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,300
Sirs,

492
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:58,020
this an acceptable request, isn't it?

493
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:01,370
Please cooperate.

494
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,450
Lord Gu,

495
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,900
don't get ahead of yourself.

496
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,430
You want a scholar...

497
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,940
to strip off his clothes...

498
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,900
and let you pat him down in public?

499
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,730
Do you know what you're talking about?

500
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,090
This is an insult to the scholars of Yun,

501
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:26,850
as well as an act of
disrespect towards His Majesty.

502
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,060
But...

503
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,210
we're looking for a criminal.

504
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,580
We followed him here.

505
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,370
You must have got the wrong person.

506
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,970
This student has been
drinking wine here since last night.

507
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,970
He never left the room.

508
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:50,400
How could you have stabbed him?

509
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,270
It's true, I saw Lei Ze Xin sneakily...

510
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,600
drinking wine here last night.

511
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,310
He couldn't even walk straight.

512
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:58,900
That's right. He was too drunk to go out.

513
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,210
Lord Gu,

514
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,780
please leave him alone.

515
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,020
If he's not in time for the ceremony...

516
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,660
and the Imperial Preceptor gets mad,

517
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,020
none of us can bear the consequences.

518
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,469
If you insist that he is the criminal,

519
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,650
please inform Master Wang about it,

520
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,730
and let Master Wang decide.

521
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,340
I'll keep him here.

522
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,170
He won't be able to escape.

523
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,679
Letting Master Wang decide...

524
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,250
is the sensible thing to do.

525
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,060
Never mind.

526
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,690
Sirs,

527
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,100
sorry for the intrusion.

528
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,380
Good bye.

529
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,100
Let's go.

530
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,679
As expected of the president's team.

531
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,710
The first three members each
received full score.

532
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,780
[Team One, Han Sheng Xiong,
Yu Le Xuan, Han Sheng Zhi]

533
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,889
They've scored 90 points already.

534
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,489
What should we do?

535
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,100
It's a good thing, I guess.

536
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,140
We might lose anyway with my arthritis.

537
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,930
It's okay.

538
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,990
We have no regrets.

539
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,120
We'll try again next year.

540
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,340
This year, we hide our lights
under a bushel.

541
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,690
[If you don't get first
place in the archery ceremony,]

542
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:18,170
[I'll still kick you out of the school.]

543
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,300
Is this my fate?

544
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,580
It's okay.

545
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:27,140
We can get our nobility
points back using other ways.

546
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,450
But this is my last chance.

547
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,690
Team Two.

548
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,250
Wen Bin.

549
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,780
Feng Cheng Jun.

550
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,380
Wei Zhao Hui.

551
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,250
Lu Zhao Rong.

552
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,580
Lei Ze Xin.

553
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:45,600
Lei Ze Xin.

554
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,890
Great God bless us.

555
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,860
Where's Lei Ze Xin?

556
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:00,060
Guys, guys.

557
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,170
Life is indeed full of uncertainties.

558
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,710
Feng Cheng Jun's team...

559
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,960
might get disqualified.

560
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,920
So, those who have placed
their bets on Team Two,

561
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,440
please take your money back...

562
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,930
and bet again.

563
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,620
Bet again?

564
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,490
Why?

565
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,200
I hear one of them is absent.

566
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,300
Absent?

567
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,920
Why?

568
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,120
Lady Han, what about you?

569
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,140
-I'm still betting bet on Mr. Feng.
-What's this?

570
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,960
You'll lose your money for sure.

571
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,270
I never take back my words or my bets.

572
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,450
Team Three.

573
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,890
Yang Yi De.

574
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,110
Here.

575
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,310
Team One is still in the game.

576
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,960
We can wait for Brother Ze Xin.

577
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,020
Lei Ze Xin always comes
and goes as he pleases.

578
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,200
Don't get your hopes up.

579
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,020
He will come.

580
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,380
Lei Ze Xin.

581
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,890
You can't go to the archery ceremony.

582
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,310
You're badly wounded.

583
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,490
If you compete,

584
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,620
they will notice it right away.

585
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,860
I have to go.

586
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,310
When you draw your bow,

587
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:10,100
your wound will crack open.

588
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,300
When that happens,

589
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,450
not only will you fail to help Wen Bin,

590
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,060
you may even get yourself killed.

591
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,820
I made a promise to Wen Bin.

592
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,380
So, I must go to the ceremony.

593
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,930
Don't you care about your own life?

594
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,170
In this world,

595
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,020
there are things that
matter more than lives.

596
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,820
Hope.

597
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,450
Wen Bin and Feng Cheng Jun...

598
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,210
taught me about hope.

599
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,020
I can't let them...

600
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,140
or myself down.

601
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,380
[Even if I'm smashed to pieces,]

602
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,250
[I will see to it that
our hope lives on.]

603
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,580
[Please let me go.]
