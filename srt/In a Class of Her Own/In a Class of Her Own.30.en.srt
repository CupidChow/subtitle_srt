[Episode 30]

4
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,400
These two sentences
represent two characters.

5
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,920
And that two characters can form a word.

6
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,360
Please make a guess.

7
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,400
"Missing someone and heart is broken."

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,080
"Two people in love with each other."

9
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,160
The word "Jin"

10
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,120
"Two people in love with each other."

11
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,960
The word "tian"?

12
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,320
"Jin tian" (today).

13
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,479
It's so easy, everyone can guess it.

14
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,440
Mr Feng is indeed smart.

15
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,320
How about this?

16
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,920
"Cowherd has a date at the old temple."

17
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,720
"Another heart, knives facing each other."

18
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,640
"Te bie" (special).

19
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,160
Today?

20
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,480
Special?

21
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,120
What's this?

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,080
"Wood and eyes are connected
with hearts feeling the same."

23
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,960
"Thereafter, one person is infatuated."

24
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,280
All the words connected are...

25
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,680
All the words connected are...

26
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,000
"Today"...

27
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,680
"Especially"...

28
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,320
"Miss you."

29
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,480
Shameless.

30
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,360
All the words connected are...

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,600
"Today, especially, miss you".

32
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,560
But I don't know if I'm right.

33
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,880
What's there to be uncertain about this?

34
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,280
Besides, this is what you said.

35
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,400
Not me.

36
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,840
Ms Han is really clever.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,600
So, I said it.

38
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,600
Not you.

39
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,560
I haven't seen you for a few days,
I think you've changed.

40
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,120
But I'm not sure what has changed.

41
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,280
Recently, I asked a teacher
to teach me to read.

42
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,160
All thanks to you.

43
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,200
You made me realise that there are so many
interesting things in the books.

44
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,240
It's much more fun than before.

45
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,880
Reading makes a man graceful.

46
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,800
A book contains a lot of knowledge.

47
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,280
Knowledge is one's wealth.

48
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,160
That's right.

49
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,240
It's commendable of you
to have such realisation.

50
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,560
I am impressed by your change
in such a short while.

51
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,520
When reed and rush grew tall,
the dew has frosted.

52
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,840
The person whom I love
must be somewhere along this stream.

53
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,280
"The Reeds and Rushes"
really suits the moment now.

54
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,680
It seems that you've read many books.

55
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,240
There're too many books to be read.

56
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,400
I'm reading "Book of Rites" recently.

57
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,000
The more I read, the more I'm scared.

58
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,520
I know I still have many good books
that I haven't read.

59
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,800
If only I'd met you earlier.

60
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,600
"Book of Rites" is hard to read.

61
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,880
Which chapter are you reading right now?

62
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,880
I've read until "Rite of Marriage"
of "Ceremonies".

63
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,680
Don't you feel bored?

64
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,640
When I was a young girl,

65
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,079
I dream of having a grand
and romantic wedding.

66
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
However,

67
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,040
I slowly understand that...

68
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,760
the wedding represents the prosperity
of a family.

69
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,680
It's much more important
than the fantasy of an ignorant girl.

70
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,040
And it makes me more alert that...

71
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,920
I shoulder the responsibility
of my family.

72
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,440
Ordinary people can do as they please.

73
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,040
But aristocrats can't do that.

74
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,200
Sometimes, I envy them.

75
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,120
That's right.

76
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,600
You are sensible and a model for women.

77
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,600
It's really rare to be praised by you.

78
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,720
Thank you.

79
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,560
I should be the one thanking you.

80
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
I learnt something today.

81
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,400
Your changes are really amazing.

82
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,880
I'm ashamed.

83
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,760
Oh, right.

84
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,280
I'm almost finished reading
"Book of Rites".

85
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,360
Is there any good book to recommend?

86
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,360
Three days later, Yun Shang Academy
will hold an Open Day.

87
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,520
I'll invite you to take a look
at the Bo Lan House.

88
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,280
There're many types of books in there.

89
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,440
Xiao Qin.

90
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,920
All right.

91
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,160
See you in three days.

92
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,080
Wen Bin.

93
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,280
Come here.

94
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,040
Feng Cheng Jun
cannot focus in class recently.

95
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,760
I guess it's related to you?

96
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,760
It's indeed related to me.

97
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,840
But I haven't told him about my identity.

98
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,040
You haven't?

99
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,480
You mean you'll confess to him
sooner or later?

100
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,840
I understand what you think.

101
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,600
But you're different from Feng Cheng Jun.

102
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,800
He's a nobleman.

103
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,960
He's born to bear the mission
of his family.

104
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,840
The nobles pay particular attention to
an appropriate match.

105
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,720
Even if Feng Cheng Jun
doesn't dislike your background,

106
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,240
The Feng family...

107
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,760
will not agree.

108
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,480
Mr Ding.

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,440
Feng Cheng Jun is a person
who refuses to compromise with profanity.

110
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,159
Humans can't choose their origin.

111
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,920
Destiny is strong.

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,840
If you want to change the tradition
of noblemen,

113
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,800
it won't happen in a day...

114
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,320
or by the power of one person.

115
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,320
A person can change his destiny
through his own efforts...

116
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,280
and not admitting defeat.

117
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,840
This is what Feng Cheng Jun taught me.

118
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,720
Wen Xi.

119
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,120
You're too stubborn.

120
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,520
Don't worry.

121
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,080
I won't expose my identity.

122
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,520
However,

123
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,280
I'll still try my best
to fight for my own happiness.

124
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,040
Brother Feng.

125
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,600
You haven't eaten dinner, right?

126
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,560
I kept this for you.

127
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
This...

128
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,080
It's nice, right?

129
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,760
I've already eaten.

130
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,520
Did you eat outside alone?

131
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,720
With Han Shu Min.

132
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,840
There's food,
I happen to be hungry.

133
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,880
You eat it.

134
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,120
No...

135
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,080
No...

136
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,440
Why did you fight with me?
You're hungry too?

137
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,960
I was not hungry at first.

138
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,000
But I want to eat after seeing food.

139
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,960
Can't I?

140
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,680
You two are too much.

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,840
Junior.

142
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,200
You're biased.

143
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,680
I come back late often too.

144
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,640
You never kept dinner for me.

145
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,600
I can't even shut your mouth with food.

146
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,919
In the future,

147
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,799
you have to treat us equally.

148
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,480
What's the matter with them again?

149
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,240
What happened again this time?

150
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,360
Don't be a busybody.
Just continue writing.

151
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,080
Read your book.

152
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,080
[It's best to have self-awareness.]

153
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,720
[I'm relieved.]

154
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,840
Brother Ze Xin.

155
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,120
Didn't you want to sleep in the middle?
You can change it now.

156
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,800
It's so troublesome.

157
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,840
I'm used to sleeping in the middle,
I don't want to change.

158
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,720
Brother Bin, to be honest,

159
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,880
you've been tossing around
in your sleep recently.

160
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,600
So, my sleep is particularly bad at night.

161
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,320
Please fulfil my wish.

162
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,720
You're the one who asked us to change.

163
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,000
You're also the one
who asked us not to change.

164
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,280
Why do you get to decide?

165
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,160
I don't want to change.

166
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,200
It won't happen again.

167
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,640
Do whatever you want.

168
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,640
Why must you sleep next to me?

169
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,160
I want to be next to you.

170
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,880
Why?

171
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,600
Do you hate me?

172
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,560
Or does Ms Han hate me?

173
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,920
Did she tell you to stay away from me?

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,040
In Mr Ding's class,
you answered...

175
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,360
brothers are as important as wives.

176
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,040
Is that your true words?

177
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,440
Mr Ding said I was wrong.

178
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,480
You like Ms Han.

179
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,560
So you don't want me anymore.

180
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,920
You value love over friendship!

181
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,360
Listen, I want to watch over you.

182
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,840
Brother Bin, I'll go out
if you be like this.

183
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,240
It's more dangerous if you go out.

184
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,200
Just try it.

185
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,880
You...

186
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,680
Brother Cheng Jun.

187
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,240
Why are you awake late at night?

188
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,360
Where are you going?

189
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,160
To read at Bo Lan House.

190
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,800
Is Room Two of Regular Dorm haunted?

191
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,400
Lei Ze Xin went to the backyard
to practise martial arts at night.

192
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,680
And you're going to Bo Lan House?

193
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,760
This...

194
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,080
It's really haunted.

195
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,000
No.

196
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,160
Don't talk nonsense.

197
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,720
-You're just trying to scare me.
-No.

198
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,600
Guilty conscience.

199
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,240
Who has a guilty conscience?

200
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,360
I think it's me, but...

201
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,840
I don't know right now.

202
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,440
I think it's not my problem.

203
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,880
But if it's not me,

204
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,440
then it's Brother Wen Bin's problem?

205
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,440
You mean something's wrong
with Wen Bin?

206
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,640
No.

207
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,520
It's still my problem.

208
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,240
So who has a problem?

209
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,720
I don't know either.

210
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,080
Since you don't know
who has a problem,

211
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,520
tell me what's the problem.

212
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,680
The problem is I don't know...

213
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,040
if it's Brother Wen Bin or me
who has the problem.

214
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
It's weird, right?

215
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,040
Now,

216
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,080
I sympathise with Lei Ze Xin.

217
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,600
He met you and Wen Bin
who are strange guys.

218
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,080
He really needs to practise martial arts
in the middle of the night...

219
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,800
to keep himself awake.

220
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,320
Brother Le Xuan.

221
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,400
You said that Brother Ze Xin
can stay awake with that method.

222
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,920
Should I practise martial arts too?

223
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,360
No, don't practise martial arts.

224
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,640
You should read books.

225
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,680
Listen to me.

226
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,640
Relax.

227
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,280
Go back and sleep.

228
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,720
I'll leave now.

229
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,760
Yun Shang Academy's
Open Day for family and friends.

230
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,160
Hubby, right here!

231
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,000
-Father!
-You're so tall now.

232
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,600
Father!

233
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
-Son, we can finally see each other.
-Brother.

234
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,880
I brought this for you.

235
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,000
Long time no see.

236
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,360
Our academy is very good.

237
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,560
How are my clothes?

238
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,840
Why did you become thin?

239
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,000
You've lost weight.

240
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,200
To see you...

241
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,320
Father purposely made this for you.

242
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,960
-Hold it.
-We're busy.

243
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,360
-Let's go in and take a look.
-Are you obedient?

244
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,920
Let's go.

245
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,800
Are you hungry?

246
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,680
I'll take you to the canteen
to have some good food.

247
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,760
Come, take it.

248
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,840
-Brother, this is a lot of money.
-Hush.

249
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,160
Keep it well.

250
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,440
Don't let the others
see your money.

251
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,280
Yu Le Xuan introduced
a very stable writer job to me.

252
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,360
I no longer need to rely on other people
for a living and be watchful.

253
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,400
You're amazing.

254
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,680
I want to study too.

255
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,480
I also want to be a good writer...

256
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,360
so that I can help you to make money.

257
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,880
Good.

258
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,640
Son!

259
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,080
Come and take a look.

260
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,560
This is where I usually play chess
with those uncles.

261
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,680
These two buildings are where I study.

262
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,400
Darling.

263
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,320
I made a wish this morning.

264
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,520
Guess what's my wish.

265
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,360
I guess it should be you wished that...

266
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,120
Yun Shang Academy will give us
more subsidies this year.

267
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,920
You keep thinking about this.

268
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,960
It's my fault.

269
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,640
But this year's wish is not like that.

270
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,120
My wish for this year is...

271
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,400
I must become an official.

272
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,960
Look at you,
why are you looking at me like that?

273
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,680
It's real, Son.

274
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,400
I used to think that...

275
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,120
civilians like us...

276
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,120
becoming an official is useless.

277
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,640
Now, I don't think of it this way.

278
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,000
I think if I'm an official,

279
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,320
no matter it's low-ranking
or high-ranking,

280
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,680
I can help the civilians
voice their real opinions.

281
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,600
Is that right, Son?

282
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,920
Hubby, you finally figured it out.

283
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,560
Son, look at your father.

284
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,720
He finally figured it out.

285
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,320
I've figured it out.

286
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,280
The students here are outstanding.

287
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,280
You can ask me
if there's anything you don't understand.

288
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,400
All right.

289
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,280
[Interrogation Hall]

290
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,720
Yu Le Xuan?

291
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,040
If I'd missed it,

292
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,600
-I'll regret it to death.
-Let's go take a look over there.

293
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,640
It's so lively today.

294
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,680
It seems like you're earning a lot.

295
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,840
No.

296
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,960
Money is not important to me anymore.

297
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,200
I'm just doing it for their happiness.

298
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,080
I want to help them.

299
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,120
All right, go help them.

300
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,000
Mr Li, look at this.

301
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,200
The Open Day is really lively.

302
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,520
Yes, young people are really energetic.

303
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,200
Why didn't I see your family
come to visit you?

304
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,280
I'm alone, I don't have a family.

305
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,360
Where is your hometown?

306
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,360
Li Village of the North District.

307
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,800
My family separated when I'm young.

308
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,520
I grew up with my grandmother.

309
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,120
He's right in each place.

310
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,840
You should have a reason.

311
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,800
He doesn't need a reason.

312
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,840
He's right no matter what.

313
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
-He...
-Hush.

314
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,920
Mr Feng, I'm on time.

315
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,560
Mr Wen is here too.

316
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,720
Ms Han, you're here.

317
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,200
Ms Han is really radiant-looking.

318
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,800
The whole dorm lights up
when you're here.

319
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,600
No.

320
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,560
I'm honoured to visit
the student's dormitory.

321
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,960
Brother Wen Bin.

322
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,120
Pour some tea for Ms Han.

323
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,200
Hurry.

324
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,960
Hurry.

325
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,600
Drink tea?

326
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,000
Gosh.

327
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,680
Drink it.

328
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,520
Drink ten cups.

329
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,599
Let me do it.

330
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,160
Ms Han, after you drink this tea,

331
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,720
I'll take you to Bo Lan House.

332
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,720
Let's go.

333
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,120
Half a year.

334
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,840
I just need to endure
another half a year.

335
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,280
I must pass the imperial examination.

336
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,000
By then,

337
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,520
let's see who's more radiant.

338
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,080
It's going to be half a year.

339
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,440
What should I do if Brother Feng
got seduced by people?

340
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,160
Mr Wen.

341
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,320
Why are you here?

342
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,480
I came to visit you and the academy.

343
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,680
I prepared some food and wine for you.

344
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,160
Is my appearance too abrupt?

345
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,120
It's all right.

346
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,440
I'll leave if you don't welcome me.

347
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,360
No.

348
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,920
You came at the right time.

349
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,880
Have a seat.

350
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,440
There's no place there.

351
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,040
Can we sit here?

352
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,040
Ms Han.

353
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,280
Mr Feng is here too?

354
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
Since you're here,
let's eat together.

355
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,880
Thank you, Ms Mu.

356
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,680
We'll accept your invitation.

357
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,480
Ms Mu, you're my most important guest.

358
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,640
You must eat more.

359
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,600
Come.

360
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,280
You two are really lovey-dovey.

361
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,360
Seems like you like Ms Mu.

362
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,520
Ms Han.

363
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,200
Eat this.

364
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,240
Brother Feng, didn't you say
you want to learn from me?

365
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,080
So it's duplicity.

366
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,080
Ms Han is really beautiful
inside and out.

367
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,800
He is captivated by you.

368
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,160
You two are really compatible.

369
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,240
Mr Feng and I...

370
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,360
do have many common interests.

371
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,440
Let's eat.

372
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,080
Try my cooking skills.

373
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,320
Come.

374
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,120
Mr Wen.

375
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,440
What's wrong with you?

376
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,200
You're good at everything,
just that you have a bad temper.

377
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,520
You should learn from Mr Feng for this.

378
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,920
Brother Feng, do I have a bad temper?

379
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,800
-Stop talking.
-Mr Feng.

380
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,160
Let's eat.
The dishes are getting cold.

381
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,560
Brother Feng really values love
more than friendship.

382
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,400
You only protect Ms Han.

383
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,840
I thought brotherhood
was the most important thing.

384
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,960
I'm a fool.

385
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,760
Brother Wen Bin is talkative
after drinking.

386
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,600
It's not easy for all of us
to get together.

387
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,720
We should be happy.

388
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,120
Come, let's drink.

389
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,320
Brother Wen Bin.

390
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,840
Seems like the dishes today...

391
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,640
have become tasteless.

392
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,240
Ms Han, I'll send you back.

393
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,440
Mr Wen really has a bad temper.

394
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,840
Everything's good
but I somehow annoyed you again.

395
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,320
Ms Mu, I'm sorry.

396
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,760
I'll apologise to you someday.

397
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,760
Mr Wen.

398
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,720
I'll leave too.

399
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,640
Don't be unhappy.

400
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,240
I'm glad that you came.

401
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,440
No, Mr Wen.

402
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,880
I think...

403
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,400
sometimes...

404
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,800
we should really think about
what we want in our hearts.

405
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,600
Don't worry.

406
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,600
I wish you all the best.

407
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,240
Gosh.

408
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,600
This is wine, not water.

409
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,880
I'm not finished!

410
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,560
Fool.

411
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,880
I'm the biggest fool in the world.

412
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,960
Even if you're a fool,

413
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,000
I won't dislike you.

414
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,080
You're more stupid than me.

415
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,480
It's too hard to get someone
who doesn't belong to me.

416
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,560
It'll be hard for sure.

417
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,000
Feng Cheng Jun.

418
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,320
I'm such a fool.

419
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
I'm sad because of you.

420
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:44,760
Yeah.

421
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,640
You're such a fool.

422
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,440
I guess everyone will become a fool
when they have someone they like.

423
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,480
You two...

424
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,240
are a pair of destined fools.

425
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,440
I seem to be a fool as well.

426
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,760
Ms Han, let's part here.

427
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,560
Goodbye.

428
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,080
Young Lady.

429
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,240
Shu Min.

430
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,680
Did you go to Yun Shang Academy today?

431
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,200
I saw...

432
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,320
Feng Cheng Jun sending you back.

433
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,440
When did you two know each other?

434
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
Are you two close?

435
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,360
Young Master, you're slow.

436
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,880
You and Mr Feng are fated.

437
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,520
Your classmate will soon become
your brother-in-law.

438
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,440
Xiao Qin!

439
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,560
Is Feng Cheng Jun wooing you?

440
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,880
No, Brother.

441
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,200
Mr Feng and I...

442
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,640
like each other.

443
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,600
No one is wooing anyone.

444
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,120
When did it happen?

445
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,560
I just found out tonight.

446
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,560
Looking at Shu Min,

447
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,560
I think it just happened recently.

448
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,840
No wonder Min Er said she wanted
to find a man she likes.

449
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,640
In a blink of an eye,

450
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,480
the two most outstanding men
in Yun Shang Academy...

451
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,840
will become a family soon.

452
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,520
Father.

453
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,240
As the saying goes,
one cannot accomplish much on his own.

454
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,800
I think if both big families
can be connected by marriage,

455
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,360
it's really a good thing.

456
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,280
What do you say, Father?

457
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,880
Zhi Er.

458
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,480
Follow me to meet Governor Feng
tomorrow morning.

459
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,440
This marriage must be organised soon.

460
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,600
Yes, Father.

461
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,960
You're still drinking at such a late hour?

462
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,840
Stop drinking and go to bed.

463
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,120
Stop drinking.

464
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,560
You're drunk.

465
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
It would be nice if I could get drunk.

466
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,520
But I'm still awake.

467
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,880
You're the one who's too drunk.

468
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,120
What's wrong with you guys recently?

469
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,120
Tell me if something's on your mind.

470
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,520
I don't have any worries.

471
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,120
I just want to tell you that...

472
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,360
I'm leaving for a few days.

473
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,000
Why?

474
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,440
Some things need to be done right now.

475
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,520
It can't be delayed.

476
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,160
Don't make him sad again.

477
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,760
[Brother Bin.]

478
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,480
[Our friendship is deep,]

479
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,920
[understanding makes us happy.]

480
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,880
[For the both of us to focus on study,]

481
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,080
[I must leave.]

482
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,000
[In the future,]

483
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,720
[please take care of yourself.]

484
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,040
Father, here.

485
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,480
Lord Han's here.

486
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,120
Lord Feng.

487
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,600
Uncle.

488
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,280
Lord Han.

489
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,280
I can't accept these expensive gifts.

490
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,000
Lord Feng.

491
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,760
These are just small gifts.

492
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,440
Just to return your favour.

493
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,880
You're going to spend a lot of money soon.

494
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,440
What do you mean?

495
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,920
Don't you know?

496
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,120
Your son, Cheng Jun,
and my daughter are dating.

497
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,720
We'll be a family soon.

498
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,840
I really don't know about this.

499
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,880
Lord Han, how about this?

500
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,480
Let me ask my son first.

501
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,040
Then, we'll discuss it again.

502
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,040
All right?

503
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,080
All right.

504

I'll wait for your good news.

Yes, Father.

512

You're anxious to see me.

513

What's wrong?

514
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,200
Cheng Jun.

515
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,320
I want to ask you something.

516
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,800
I heard that...

517
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,360
you're dating Lord Han's daughter,
Han Shu Min.

518
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,560
Yes.

519
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,040
What do you think about her?

520
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,480
Ms Han Shu Min...

521
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,040
is proactive,

522
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,000
educated and smart.

523
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,640
Cheng Jun.

524
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,520
You must think carefully...

525
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,960
whether Han Shu Min is suitable
to be a member of Feng Family.

526
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,240
Father.

527
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,280
I'm not an impetuous person.

528
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,840
I've already thought about it.

529
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
Feng Cheng Jun.

530
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,120
Have you thought about...

531
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,600
your relationship with Ms Han?

532
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,320
Ms Han and I really like each other.

533
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:00,360
Do you have a marriage agreement now?

534
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,200
We haven't reached the point
of discussing marriage.

535
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,120
But since the matter has been made public,

536
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,000
I'm willing to respect
the opinions of the elders...

537
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,120
and get married.

538
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,040
I always thought that Room Two
of Regular Dorm is a happy place.

539
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,400
But it's full of sadness.

540
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,160
I don't understand why Brother Feng
became like that.

541
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,000
You should know best.

542
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,000
The two of you are together day and night,
you still don't understand?

543
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,080
It's funny.

544
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,600
Do you think his attitude
towards Han Shu Min has changed...

545
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,800
or has his attitude towards you changed?

546
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,280
It's the same.

547
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,320
If you say so,

548
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,520
it seems that this situation today
is quite normal.

549
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,680
You should think about it.

550
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,560
How did you mix these two things
into one?

551
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,040
This happened because of me?

552
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,400
If you behave generously like always,

553
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,240
it won't become like this now.

554
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,760
Han Shu Min will not get implicated
by Feng Cheng Jun.

555
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,400
I'm too stubborn
and implicated Ms Han.

556
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,360
There's no time
to think about Ms Han now.

What's wrong with him?

00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,200
He's leaving the academy
and going home to study.

has come to pack his luggage.

563

I'll come back after my wedding.

564
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,199
Didn't we agree to think about marriage
after we've become an official?

565
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,560
Why did you break your promise?

Brother Wen Bin.

567

After I'm gone,

568

you have to concentrate on your studies.

569
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,400
By now, I must tell you the truth.

I believe Feng Cheng Jun
will help me keep the secret.

No secrets can be kept forever.

576
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,080
The more people know about this,

577
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,680
the more dangerous it'll become
for your family.

578
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,760
Even if you don't think about yourself,

579
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,560
you must think about
the safety of your family.

580

You're too reckless.

581

I'm the one who did wrong.

582
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,480
Why is Feng Cheng Jun
responsible for the consequences?

583
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,880
He did too much for me,
he needs to know the truth.

584
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,160
Feng Cheng Jun is getting married soon.

585
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,600
If he knows your real identity,

586
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,000
if he wants to fight for you,

587
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,480
the consequences will be even heavier.

588
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,280
Why do we have to endure this?
