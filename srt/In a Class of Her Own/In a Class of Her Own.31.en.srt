[Episode 31]

4
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,539
All right. You may go.

5
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,300
Stop right there.

6
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,730
What do you want?

7
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,370
What do I want?

8
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,259
I should be asking you that question,
Lei Ze Xin.

9
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,080
It's late at night.

10
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,780
Shouldn't you be in the academy...

11
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,640
instead of wandering around?

12
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,550
I was bored at the academy.

13
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,140
I came to South Street for drinks.

14
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,850
You lot,

15
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,460
keep an eye on him.

16
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,620
Yes, sir.

17
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,010
Lord Feng.

18
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,690
Leave us now.

19
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,060
Yes, sir.

20
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,340
Attendant Officer Han.

21
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,420
Lord Feng,

22
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,290
what's wrong?

23
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,950
we're going to be in-laws soon.

24
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,160
Why do you look...

25
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,770
so gloomy?

26
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,370
What happened?

27
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,980
Attendant Officer Han,

28
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,770
I'm aware that flyers
accusing me of bribery...

29
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,180
have been spreading around lately.

30
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,160
The content on the flyer came from...

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,010
a ledger that belonged to a
businessman called Gu Da Chao.

32
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,550
I was thinking...

33
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,880
whether I should take Gu Da Chao to court.

34
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,980
I want to know why he slandered me.

35
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,010
Lord Feng,

36
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,260
I don't think it's a sensible move.

37
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,280
If you take Gu Da Chao to court,

38
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,770
it'll make it seem
like the rumour is true.

39
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,060
I have an idea.

40
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,640
Would you like to hear it, Lord Feng?

41
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,620
Go ahead.

42
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,440
I believe the most important thing...

43
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,820
for Lord Feng right now is
to not arouse suspicion.

44
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,980
I'll take care of the rest...

45
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,730
for you.

46
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,829
I'll take care of the problem
as soon as possible.

47
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,260
I'll make it go away.

48
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,100
Lord Feng,

49
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,829
don't worry.

50
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,079
We're going to be in-laws soon.

51
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,470
I'll do everything I can to protect you.

52
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,820
Don't you fret over it.

53
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,460
You just need to think about...

54
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,670
Cheng Jun and Shu Min's engagement.

55
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,420
You'll feel better that way.

56
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:45,980
All right.

57
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,730
I'll leave it to you then,
Attendant Officer Han.

58
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,290
As the situation stands,

59
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,370
the imperial court will surely
investigate.

60
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,080
What should I do? Tell me.

61
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,060
Uncle,

62
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,130
you'll be fine with
Attendant Officer Han's protection.

63
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,570
Since we got the ledger back from Wen Bin,

64
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,950
the one who copied the
content of the ledger...

65
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,540
and spread the flyers...

66
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,329
must know Wen Bin.

67
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,860
Wen Bin?

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,900
That's right.

69
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,430
I didn't know...

70
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,610
it could be this boring...

71
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,610
without a certain someone in our dorm.

72
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,890
-It's so boring here.
-I know.

73
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,170
Proposing marriage to Han Shu Min
is one thing,

74
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,980
but did he have to move out?

75
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,100
Isn't it too late to say that?

76
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,650
Do you think he really likes Lady Han?

77
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,840
Don't you think he's being too rash?

78
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,210
Actually, I'm worried about it, too.

79
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,840
I'm worried Feng Cheng Jun...

80
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,300
might make a decision that
he'll regret in future.

81
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,980
I'm going to talk to him.

82
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,820
I'll ask him to think it over.

83
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,140
Get me an appointment with him.

84
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,400
If you want to see him,

85
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,820
go look for him yourself.

86
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,360
What if he misunderstands me again?

87
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,890
He might refuse to see me.

88
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,260
I'll help you one more time.

89
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,050
But remember,

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,050
a heartache calls for heart medicine.

91
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,890
Don't use the wrong medicine this time.

92
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,170
This is no time for jokes.

93
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,260
[If only...]

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,930
[there is an antidote for love...]

95
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,540
[in this world.]

96
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,170
Young Master,

97
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,240
look at yourself.

98
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,360
You're going to propose
marriage to Lady Han soon.

99
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,770
Why are you looking so sullen?

100
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,770
It's just a marriage proposal.

101
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,770
What's there to be happy about?

102
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,990
Of course there is.

103
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,750
You're going to get married soon.

104
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,420
It's a major event in life.

105
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,030
Young Master, I don't
suppose you know this.

106
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,150
There are four great events in life.

107
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,590
When there's rain after drought.

108
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,260
When one aces the imperial examination.

109
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,400
When one consummates his marriage.

110
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,360
And... when one...

111
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,590
Runs into an old friend.

112
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,890
That's right. When one...

113
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,770
Master, it's you.

114
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,450
Father.

115
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,100
Wang He,

116
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,420
I need to talk to Cheng Jun in private.

117
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,800
Please leave us.

118
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,780
Yes, Master.

119
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,500
Father.

120
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,820
Cheng Jun, have you made up your mind...

121
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,300
about the marriage proposal?

122
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,450
Son,

123
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,700
have you really thought it over?

124
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,540
I have.

125
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,540
Young Master.

126
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,130
Master.

127
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,650
Mr. Yu Le Xuan has come to visit.

128
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,750
Send him in now.

129
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,730
Yes.

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,540
Father, I'll go and meet him.

131
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,620
Go ahead.

132
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,620
Sir,

133
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,780
spare me something.

134
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,140
Anything.

135
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,930
Thank you, sir.

136
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,980
Thank you, sir.

137
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,020
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

138
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,840
I hope one day,

139
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,170
you'll cease to go hungry.

140
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,890
[I've arranged a meeting.]

141
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,770
[Nine o'clock tonight, in Mulan Alley,
South Street.]

142
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,450
Brother Feng...

143
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,010
Let's go.

144
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,080
[South Street Market]

145
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,690
What are you looking at?

146
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,860
I'm such a jinx.

147
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,890
Just after I told him good things
happen to good people,

148
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,900
he...

149
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,810
Wait.

150
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,270
Excuse me, have you seen...

151
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,690
a scrawny little scholar?

152
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,570
I saw nothing.

153
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,270
I'm just a beggar.

154
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,330
My life worth nothing.

155
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,980
Please don't hurt me, sir.

156
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,000
Don't be afraid.

157
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,940
Tell me what happened.

158
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,620
That scholar is my friend.

159
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,680
Sir, good things happen to good people.

160

Please let me go, sir.

161
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,450
Tell me, did something happen to him?

162
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,100
That young master was
abducted by a few strong men.

163
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,570
That sedan chair.

164
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,200
Have you seen a sedan chair?

165
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,500
No...

166
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,320
Sorry, have you seen...

167
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,440
a sedan chair pass by?

168
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,650
No, I haven't seen any.

169
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,360
Madam, have you seen a
sedan chair pass by?

170

Sedan chair?

171
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,150
-It went that way.
-That way?

00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,180
-Yes.
-Thank you.

173
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,980
What are you doing?

174
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,130
Isn't this the guy we saw just now?

175
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,450
Sorry.

176
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,250
I've made a mistake.

177
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,770
So, it is you.

178
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,830
[I was wondering...]

179
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,470
[why the name Wen Bin...]

180
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,130
[sounds so familiar.]

181
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:56,540
[Turns out it's the name
of the woman of my dreams.]

182
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,610
Get away from me.

183
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,940
Today's your lucky day.

184
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,030
As long as you hand over
the ledger and its copy,

185
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,300
and promise me you won't
circulate it anymore,

186
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,210
I...

187
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,810
will let you go.

188
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,300
Ledger?

189
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,620
What ledger?

190
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,690
Stop playing dumb.

191
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,440
Don't you know...

192
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,830
disguising yourself as a man and
enrolling at Yun Shang Academy...

193
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,940
is considered perjury?

194
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,540
[If I expose you,]

195
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,180
[your entire family will be executed.]

196
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,060
So Little Brother is a girl.

197
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,380
[Do I look like a girl to you?]

198
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,940
[Look closely.]

199
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,630
[But I'm still worried...]

200
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,180
[you won't be this nice to
me once you're married.]

201
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,860
[But I'm not married yet, am I?]

202
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,210
[You think too far ahead.]

203
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,570
[You think so?]

204
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,450
[It's time for me to tell you the truth.]

205
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,250
[I...]

206
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,300
[I'm not your brother.]

207
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,810
-[I am a...]
-[Wen Bin.]

208
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,540
[If you come around...]

209
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,940
[and agree to be my concubine...]

210
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,060
Who are you?

211
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,890
Are you all right?

212
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,010
I thought I'd never see you again.

213
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,210
I... I was just too frightened.
That's why I...

214
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,180
It's okay.

215
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,940
I'm here for you.

216
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,380
Gu Da Chao has been eliminated.

217
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,570
It's just that...

218
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,250
Just what?

219
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,650
Gu Da Chao had kidnapped
a scholar at the time.

220
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,860
I was about to kill that scholar...

221
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,570
after dispatching Gu Da Chao.

222
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,420
But before I could strike,

223
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,690
Governor Feng's son intervened.

224
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,950
Are you sure it was Feng Cheng Jun?

225
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,930
Yes.

226
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,450
Is he all right?

227
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,130
I dare not lay a finger on Mr. Feng.

228
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,650
I had to retreat.

229
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,940
Get up... get up.

230
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,560
You did the right thing.

231
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,510
If anything had happened
to Feng Cheng Jun,

232
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,980
things would become far more complicated.

233
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,420
But...

234
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,380
it's for the best.

235
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,830
We've tied up a loose end...

236
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,510
by killing Gu Da Chao...

237
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,770
and leaving an eyewitness.

238
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,060
We could pin the murder of Gu Da Chao...

239
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,540
on the person who distributed the flyers.

240
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,380
That should kill two birds
with one stone, right?

241
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,100
Yes.

242
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,300
You've done well.

243
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,540
It's an honour...

244
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,860
to serve you, my lord.

245
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,540
Tell me.

246
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,650
Are you in league with the murderer?

247
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,240
Is everyone from Gu family so hostile
and rude?

248
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,920
Instead of consoling me, the victim,

249
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,940
you suspect us of being accomplices.

250
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,380
Lord Gu,

251
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,860
the murderer wanted to kill
Little Brother...

252
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,390
after Gu Da Chao.

253
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,330
Fortunately I came just in time.

254
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,570
I swear by my family's name.

255
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,540
I saw everything with my own eyes.

256
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,420
What did the murderer look like?

257
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,380
He was masked and wore a black suit.

258
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,930
About this tall,

259
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,270
with a slim figure.

260
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,780
Did he look like the person
who distributed the flyers?

261
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,329
Yes.

262
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,530
That rascal.

263
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,720
Don't jump to conclusions, my lord.

264
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,230
Maybe he's not the one
who distributed the flyers.

265
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,410
There is no maybe.

266
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,859
The murderer wanted to
present the flyers' content...

267
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,050
as irrefutable proof.

268
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,140
That's why he silenced uncle.

269
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,940
That way,

270
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,660
no one could tell the truth.

271
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,780
Reporting in!

272
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,580
My lord, the man in black...

273
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,820
was spotted in the east.

274
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,170
You lot, stay back and clean up the mess.

275
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,970
Remember...

276
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,570
take great care with my uncle's body.

277
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,270
The rest, come with me
to hunt down the murderer.

278
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,250
Yes, sir.

279
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,390
It's late at night.

280
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,530
And you had quite a shock just now.

281
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,800
I'll walk you back.

282
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,870
It's fine, Brother Feng.

283
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,380
I can go back on my own.

284
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,980
Since when did you become so daring?

285
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,020
I won't let you put
yourself at risk anymore.

286
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,780
Brother Feng,

287
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,290
do you really like Lady Han?

288
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,810
Lady Han has changed a lot.

289
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,030
She has become more mature.

290
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,210
To be honest,

291
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,860
I quite admire her.

292
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,440
Why do you care about...

293
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,410
what I think of Lady Han all of a sudden?

294
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,210
I care about you, Brother Feng.

295
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,410
I hope you'll live happily forever.

296
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,780
Is that the only question you wanted
to ask me?

297
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,900
I was afraid you might get angry
and not talk to me.

298
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,780
I want to go back to
the way we used to be.

299
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,170
So...

300
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,870
Let's treat each other like we did before.

301
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,980
With honesty.

302
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,780
You really mean it?

303
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,380
So come back.

304
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,290
It feels strange not having you around.

305
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,350
I need some time.

306
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,620
I have other matters to deal with.

307
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,740
It's getting late.

308
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,130
You should go inside.

309
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,380
But I want to spend more time with you.

310
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,330
It's not that hard for us to meet.

311
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,260
We'll have plenty of time together.

312
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,610
Really?

313
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,020
From now on, there'll be no secrets
between us.

314
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,460
I promise.

315
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,440
All right. Hurry up.

316
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,500
The door is closing.

317
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,170
Stay safe.

318
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,010
Stop right there!

319
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,970
-Stop!
-Over there!

320
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,250
Stop!

321
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,780
Quick!

322
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,090
Quick!

323
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,680
Search the place. Hurry.

324
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,660
Yes, sir.

325
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,860
Let's go over there.

326
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,820
Over there.

327
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,970
Check that side.

328
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,390
My lord,

329
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,150
I've been keeping an eye on Lei Ze Xin.

330
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,680
He's done nothing suspicious.

331
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,780
He's back at the academy now.

332
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,920
Good.

333
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,980
Now we can rule Lei Ze Xin
out as a suspect...

334
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,410
and end our tiff with Lei Qi Ying.

335
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,820
You were kidnapped?

336
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,050
Why didn't you tell me?

337
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,720
Everything's fine now.

338
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,410
I'm safe.

339
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,930
Are you sure it was Gu Da Chao?

340
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,320
What happened exactly?

341
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,440
He threatened me...

342
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,100
to give him the copy of the ledger.

343
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,320
How dare he?

344
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,350
I'm going to kill him.

345
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,750
And then a masked assassin broke in.

346
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,620
He killed him and his goons.

347
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,530
A masked assassin?

348
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,980
Gu Da Chao is dead?

349
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,680
The Imperial Brigade said...

350
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,380
that masked assassin was the
one who distributed the flyers.

351
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,100
Fortunately, Brother Feng came
just in time.

352
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,530
Otherwise, I would've been killed.

353
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,210
[They're trying to silence everyone...]

354
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,500
[involved with the ledger.]

355
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,900
What happened after
Feng Cheng Jun showed up?

356
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,420
Go on.

357
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,450
He walked me back,

358
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,740
then went home.

359
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,860
Gu Da Chao is dead?

360
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,350
Gu Da Chao was an evil man.

361
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,900
He deserved to die.

362
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,320
Wouldn't that...

363
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,620
make me a prime suspect?

364
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,990
All the bribes I've taken...

365
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,450
are recorded in that ledger.

366
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,780
Now people will say
I killed him to erase the evidence.

367
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,170
Calm down, Lord Feng.

368
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,110
We are going to be in-laws soon.

369
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,680
Your family's problem...

370
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,510
is my family's problem.

371
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:03,140
I won't let anything happen to you.

372
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,290
Lord Feng,

373
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:12,660
when are you coming to our
residence to propose marriage?

374
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,660
To be honest,

375
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,050
I'm getting impatient.

376
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,690
About that, Attendant Officer Han,

377
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,230
I'm sorry.

378
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,660
It's because my son has been
busy with his studies.

379
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,030
We couldn't find the time.

380
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,630
Once he's done with his studies,

381
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,740
I'll make arrangements
for the marriage proposal.

382
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,210
Good to hear.

383
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,980
A scholar should prioritise his studies.

384
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,410
I believe Feng Cheng Jun is a noble man.

385
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,680
Your family...

386
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,810
always keeps their promise.

387
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,920
I leave my daughter's happiness...

388
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,900
in your son and your family's hands.

389
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,630
My daughter has always been...

390
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:59,050
the apple of my eye.

391
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,100
If she's offended your family in any way,

392
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,140
don't hesitate to tell me.

393
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,620
I'll have her change her ways.

394
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:12,980
On the other hand, your family must not
ever break her heart.

395
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,610
Sure...

396
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,380
Got you.

397
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,140
Oh, it's you.

398
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,330
Were you expecting someone else?

399
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,750
Mr. Feng is delighted by your surprise,
Young Lady.

400
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,810
I could tell from the smile
on Mr. Feng's face.

401
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,600
I didn't expect...

402
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,110
you would recognize me...

403
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,740
even when I'm dressed as a scholar.

404
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,530
You were so affectionate.

405
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,210
I wish to study with you...

406
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,570
and stay by your side.

407
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,100
Lady Han,

408
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,440
you come from a respectable family.

409
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,450
It's improper for you
to pose as a scholar.

410
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,210
What's the matter?
You looked so happy just now.

411
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,060
Lady Han,

412
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,860
I'm busy with my studies.

413
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,500
I don't have any spare time.

414
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,860
Please forgive me.

415
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,060
It's okay.

416
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,860
Since you're busy,

417
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,050
I'll leave you be.

418
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,450
I'll wait for you.

419
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,250
Young Master.

420
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,660
Young Master, time for lunch.

421
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,480
-Young Master...
-So...

422
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,810
what's with the room service?

423
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:10,390
The dining hall is under renovation.

424
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,290
So I brought your lunch here.

425
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,730
Wang He,

426
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,660
do we have a new cook?

427
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,720
Yes.

428
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,290
We have a new cook.

429
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,410
Young Master, are you all right?

430
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,020
Somebody, help!

431
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,380
Young Master is...

432
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,270
What's wrong? What happened?

433
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,840
See for yourself.

434
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,210
The food... has been poisoned.

435
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,500
How did that happen?

436
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,020
You're lying. How could you?

437
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,510
What's wrong with you?

438
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,720
You lied to me first.

439
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,980
I'm just giving you a taste
of your own medicine.

440
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,620
Young Master, look at you.

441
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,960
You're acting mighty chummy...

442
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,620
towards this good-looking fellow.

443
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,750
It's been a while since I saw him.

444
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,100
I miss him very much.

445
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,200
Good-looking fellow,

446
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,390
our young master seems more excited
to see you...

447
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,620
than to attend his own engagement.

448
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,080
All right, Wang He.

449
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,330
Pack my bags.

450
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,500
I'm returning to the academy
with Little Brother.

451
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,570
You're going back?

452
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,620
What are you waiting for? Get to it.

453
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,210
Come on...

454
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,780
Fine.

455
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,490
Father.

456
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,450
You may sit.

457
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,690
Feng Cheng Jun has returned
to Yun Shang Academy.

458
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,900
He should've come here and asked
for our daughter's hand...

459
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,450
before going back to the academy.

460
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,170
He's too much.

461
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,320
Father,

462
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,320
Mr. Feng wants to graduate
as soon as possible.

463
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,870
That's why he's busy.

464
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,290
He'll come and propose marriage
once he's free.

465
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,140
Don't hold it against him.

466
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,030
See,

467
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,740
our daughter is so understanding.

468
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,100
There's no way Feng Cheng Jun
won't marry her.

469
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,680
Dig in, my dear.

470
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,980
The food is getting cold.

471
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:04,330
-Let's eat.
-Feng Cheng Jun has always been decisive.

472
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,450
Yet this time, he seems hesitant.

473
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,930
What if...

474
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,290
What if he has a change of heart?

475
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,330
If Feng Cheng Jun changes his mind,

476
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,720
our family...

477
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,620
will become a laughing stock
among Yunzhou's upper crust.

478
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,810
He wouldn't dare.

479
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,960
Our family is...

480
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,620
one of the richest and most powerful
in Yun.

481
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,200
I don't think the Feng family...

482
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,690
would renege on their promise.

483
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,660
Let's just eat.

484
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,820
Let's eat.

485
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,530
However...

486
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,580
my lady,

487
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,860
I think...

488
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,500
it's also a good thing that
Feng Cheng Jun hasn't come to propose.

489
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,680
Now we have
more time and energy...

490
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,350
to find a girl from a good family...

491
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,660
and get our son married.

492
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,690
You're right, my dear.

493
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,620
The elder sibling should
get married first.

494
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,300
Son,

495
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:12,500
do you have someone you like?

496
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,130
Brother.

497
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,690
Eat... eat your food.

498
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,410
Well?

499
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,660
Do you?

500
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,500
Do you?

501
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,820
No.

502
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,450
That's it.

503
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,330
You should find a girl for him.

504
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,990
I will... I will.

505
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,740
I'll find a girl for him.

506
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,810
What did our son think about...

507
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,530
those girls he met last time?

508
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,980
What about the girl from the Mo family?

509
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,080
Father,

510
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,920
let mother find a few more girls...

511
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,150
for him to choose from.

512
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,150
There's no rush.

513
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,840
-More choices?
-Give him more time.

514
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,840
I think he's spoilt for choice.

515
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,750
No.

516
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,690
-Let's dig in.
-Let's.

517
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,010
[Father,]

518
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,450
[for my engagement with Lady Han,]

519
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,980
[I apologise.]

520
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,800
[I shouldn't leave her in limbo.]

521
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,260
[It's not the gentleman's way.]

522
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,330
[So I made it clear to
Lady Han Shu Min last night.]

523
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,260
[Forgive me, Father.]

524
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,510
-Thank goodness.
-God bless.

525
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,750
-Come, Cheng Jun.
-I knew...

526
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,660
Wen Bin could drag
Brother Cheng Jun back.

527
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,600
-Yeah.
-Not drag. Invited.

528
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,270
Doesn't matter. The point is he's back.

529
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,300
How shall we celebrate?

530
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,800
-Let's drink tonight.
-Who's buying?

531
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,780
Anyone?

532
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,290
-Mingren Tavern.
-They're happy together again.

533
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,380
Yes.

534
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,100
Even the gods would be jealous.

535
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,380
You are saying...

536
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,860
I didn't say anything.

537
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,760
[South Street Market]

538
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,630
[Only a loser...]

539
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,500
[makes excuses for himself,]

540
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,690
[seeking solace in drinks...]

541
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,740
[instead of facing his problems.]

542
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,260
[Let me tell you,]

543
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,080
[I despise cowards like you.]

544
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,100
I'm not a coward.

545
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,320
I'm not a coward!

546
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,930
Fool, watch where you're going.

547
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,170
You...

548
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,620
Who are you calling a coward?

549
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,920
Did you call me a coward?

550
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,920
I'm not a coward!

551
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,900
Hands off!

552
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,050
Are you looking to be punched?

553
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,600
You're the one...

554
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,140
-who's looking to be punched.
-Hey, back off!

555
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,110
You want to hit me?

556
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,140
So do it, coward!

557
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,680
I feel unsatisfied.

558
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,750
I'm not drunk enough.

559
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,620
It's because you drank like a girl.

560
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,720
Life is short.

561
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,600
All things in moderation.

562
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,620
That's right.

563
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,130
What's that noise?

564
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,720
Take that!

565
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,980
What's going on over there?

566
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,720
That voice sounds familiar.

567
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,570
It's the president.

568
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,920
-This is bad.
-What a wuss.

569
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,030
Can't even handle two hoodlums.

570
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,270
-Break it off.
-It is him.

571
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,290
Do you have a death wish?? or are you tired from living??

572
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,570
Run.

573
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,260
Come on, hit me harder.

574
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,500
You're so weak.

575
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,110
Look at him.

576
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,620
You call that a punch?

577
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,560
Get up.

578
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,680
-Don't stop.
-President.

579
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,630
Stand up.

580
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,740
Stand up.

581
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,860
What are you guys doing here?

582
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,530
You...

583
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,370
Mind your own business.

584
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,020
What an ungrateful guy.

585
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,720
Don't say that.

586
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,140
He's so drunk.

587
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,390
Wen Bin,

588
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,860
you must be really happy...

589
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,870
to see me like this.

590
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,230
Don't say that. Get up.

591
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,320
-I'm no coward.
-Get up.

592
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,390
Xiao Man, I'm no coward.

593
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,210
-I don't want your help!
-Get up.

594
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,750
[President went off the rails...]

595
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,690
[because of Ms. Mu.]

596
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,290
[Looks like he has been deeply hurt.]

597
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,330
Brother-in-law, you're here too.

598
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,510
You should spend more time with my sister.

599
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,680
-Brother-in-law?
-Brother-in-law?

600
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,110
Stop hanging out with them...

601
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:04,510
and drinking all the time.

602
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,500
So this is God's plan?

603
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,280
-They make a cute couple.
-You said it.

604
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,570
-Very compatible.
-Too bad I was too late.

605
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,350
Lady Han's character...

606
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:14,760
is completely different
from her brother's.

607
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,620
-True.
-Stop yapping.

608
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,770
We're all classmates. Help him up.

609
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,050
Come on. Get up, President.

610
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,699
No, don't touch me.

611
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,179
Yu Le Xuan,

612
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,520
you must be so happy...

613
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,460
to see me like this.

614
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,860
Let's go back to the academy.

615
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,590
-Get up, come on.
-I can get up on my own.

616
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,760
I can get up on my own.

617
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,969
I said I can get up on my own!

618
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,489
I'm not a coward!

619
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,460
I...

620
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,699
He's so drunk.

621
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:49,330
He won't be able to walk.

622
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,570
President,

623
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,100
what's your problem?

624
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,280
We're trying to be nice.

625
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,760
Yeah. Look at you.

626
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,050
Being drunk is no excuse.

627
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,220
It's the alcohol talking.

628
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,000
Since he's not feeling sociable,

629
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,460
why don't you guys go back first?

630
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,660
-That's right.
-Sure.

631
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,870
Let's get a sedan chair for the president.

632
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,830
Come on.

633
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,150
-All right.
-Let's go.

634
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,290
See you.

635
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,660
I know how painful unrequited love is.

636
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,940
Mutual love is the only true love.

637
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,050
You can't force someone to love you.

638
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,010
Only fools...

639
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,660
love without being loved.

640
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,870
But I have a feeling...

641
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,630
you still hold a place in Ms. Mu's heart.

642
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,140
The feeling is not one-sided.

643
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,940
What about your feelings for Ms. Mu?

644
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,570
We...

645
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,100
We sorted things out.

646
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,570
We're fine now. She's over it.

647
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,140
That's very rational of you.

648
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,660
I learned it from you.

649
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,900
Have you ever not been rational?

650
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:55,570
[We can't simply break off the engagement
with the Hans.]

651
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,420
[Keep this to yourself...]

652
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,330
[for now.]

653
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,660
[Wait until I come up with...]

654
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,100
[a mutually beneficial solution.]

655
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,330
The sedan chair is here.

656
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:20,810
Put it down.

657
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,680
How did the president...

658
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,770
become like this?

659
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,100
I feel bad for him.

660
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,420
You're not mad at him?

661
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,920
In a manner of speaking,

662
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,220
I should thank him instead.

663
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,390
You're very sensible, Le Xuan.

664
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,730
So are you.

665
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,490
Speaking of which,
I should be held responsible too.

666
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,070
If I hadn't stood up...

667
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,280
for Mu Xiao Man.

668
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,900
President wouldn't have hated me...

669
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:58,100
or lost his credibility
with the other scholars.

670
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,870
It sounds like...

671
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,220
he's responsible, too.

672
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,860
It's his fault for acting willfully.

673
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,570
Then again, he doesn't deserve this.

674
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,390
All of us should...

675
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,180
could cut him some slack.

676
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,680
No one would talk to him.

677
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,460
That'd make anyone feel emasculated.

678
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,530
Le Xuan,

679
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,100
try and talk to those guys
at the Student Council.

680
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,760
Ask them to stop alienating him.

681
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,570
He's a member of Student Council, too.

682
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,960
I've arranged the beds.

683
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,900
This way we won't disturb
each other anymore.

684
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,180
Your feet will be pointing at me.

685
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,730
What if you hit me when we're asleep?

686
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,140
Don't worry, Little Brother is tiny.

687
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,220
He won't reach you.

688
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,660
I'm talking about you.

689
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,900
Don't worry, I promise
I won't kick you.

690
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,050
What's your deal?

691
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,040
You used to criticise Little Brother
for keeping you up...

692
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,940
with his tossing and turning in bed.

693
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,250
Now you want to huddle against him?

694
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,100
I admit that I've said
something to that effect.

695
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,180
But...

696
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,700
when I was at home a while ago,

697
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,000
I couldn't sleep without Little Brother...

698
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,380
tossing and turning beside me.

699
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,520
I guess...

700
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,570
I've gotten used to him sleeping
beside me.

701
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,620
I forbid it.

702
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,180
Little Brother...

703
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,420
hasn't said anything.

704
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,250
What gives you the right
to be unreasonable?

705
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,350
What good is reason against you?

706
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,570
I said no!

707
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,700
That's enough.

708
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,860
Stop fighting.

709
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:08,920
I'm turning in.

710
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,970
You guys work it out.

711
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,290
That's his bed.

712
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,290
I'm fine with this.

713
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,250
I'm not a coward.

714
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,490
How did I get here?

715
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,610
[Sheng Zhi,]

716
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,420
[I've made you your favourite
braised pork.]

717
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,440
[President, the temperature
of the water...]

718
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,460
[is just right for you to freshen up.]

719
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:50,810
[President,]

720
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,860
[look how clean this table is.]

721
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,330
[Spotless.]

722
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,220
Sheng Zhi.

723
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,530
President.

724
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,680
Why are you here?

725
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,730
We're here because
we're worried about you.

726
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,290
Thank you.

727
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,220
President, do you remember
what happened last night?

728
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,970
Last night?

729
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,570
You were drunk last night.

730
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,040
You got into a fight.

731
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,940
Fortunately, we found you just in time.

732
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,150
As for your hand,

733
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,700
it was Wen Bin who dressed your wound.

734
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,700
Well? What do you think?

735
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,250
Wen Bin?
