*[Episode 29]

4
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,630
Yu Le Xuan does not return home often.

5
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,130
He's an unfilial son who
abandons his parents.

6
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,570
-Yes!
-That's right!

7
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:28,930
He's unfilial!

8
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,350
But, does anyone of you know
why he became like that?

9
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,140
Because of you.

10
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,090
Because of me. Because of us!

11
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,530
We focused too much on origin and lineage.

12
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,410
That made him worry about his own.

13
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,789
Would he be this way if we were true
and kind to one another?

14
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,670
Try putting yourself
in other people's shoes.

15
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,400
Imagine being discriminated if people
found out about our birth history.

16
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,890
But in order to be educated
and change our fate,

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,360
would we also choose to hide everything
from the world?

18
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,400
-I agree with Feng Cheng Jun.
-Me too.

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,350
-You're right!
-Yes!

20
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,970
So according to you,

21
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,690
Yu Le Xuan is right...

22
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,810
but we're wrong?

23
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,450
That's absurd.

24
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:19,210
The law clearly states that illegitimate
children cannot enrol at Yun Shang.

25
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,490
Yu Le Xuan did do wrong.

26
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,730
He's wrong about hiding his origin
and choosing to lie.

27
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,210
But after such a long time together,

28
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,770
did anyone encounter any bad experience
with him just because he's Yu Le Xuan?

29
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,250
If not,

30
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,780
why should we end someone's future
just because of his identity?

31
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,060
Everyone knows I'm not from
a prestigious family.

32
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,770
I felt hopeless about my life before.

33
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,450
It hasn't been easy for me
to survive until now.

34
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,490
Yun Shang Academy made its exceptions
and accepted me.

35
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,050
That allowed me to meet all of you.

36
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,370
I made friends with Le Xuan.

37
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,730
From everyone of you,

38
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,450
I learned to cherish and have courage.

39
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,220
I found my life goal.

40
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,480
Yun Shang Academy gave me
a chance to rediscover myself.

41
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,850
I sincerely wish that this chance will
be given to Le Xuan too.

42
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,930
Let him be like us.

43
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,370
May his future be bright.

44
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,770
I agree with Wen Bin.

45
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,130
Well said!

46
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,610
Well said!

47
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,730
There's no absolute royalty
or inferiority.

48
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:41,290
Yu Le Xuan.

49
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,130
You can't choose your origin.

50
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,930
But you can decide your fate.

51
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,890
A guy like you...

52
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,170
will flourish anywhere.

53
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,250
That makes sense.

54
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,610
Lei Ze Xin is right!

55
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,890
Yu Le Xuan.

56
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,970
What about you?

57
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,250
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

58
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,330
From the moment I knew what was going on,

59
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,290
I have been running away from
my family and origin.

60
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,870
I'm materialistic and two-faced.

61
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,890
Now that I'm exposed,

62
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,960
I actually feel exceptionally relaxed.

63
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,530
Now I understand.

64
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,530
I can only experience freedom
when my conscience is clear.

65
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,890
-We can't let Yu Le Xuan leave.
-Yes!

66
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,330
-He can't leave!
-Yes!

67
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,930
Don't let Le Xuan go!

68
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,810
Le Xuan.

69
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,570
I empathize with
your heartfelt confession.

70
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,640
But that's it.

71
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,240
We have to obey the laws of our country.

72
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,050
No matter what happens,

73
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,490
I'm fine with it.

74
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,690
I'll become a happy man.

75
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,690
I'll do what I must do,

76
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,010
and go where I should go.

77
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,650
Thank you, everyone.

78
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,680
Alright.

79
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,220
Your words touched me.

80
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,530
I have something to tell Yu Le Xuan.

81
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,890
To negatively influence others' perception
on someone is not noble.

82
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,490
You'll be invincible if you can
face and conquer yourself.

83
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:31,890
Principal Feng.

84
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,450
Let's cast votes.

85
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:35,930
Fine.

86
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,490
Those who are in favour of
Yu Le Xuan staying here,

87
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,840
please take your stand.

88
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,770
I'm sorry, President.

89
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,290
Thank you!

90
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,130
My apologies, President.

91
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,130
Thank you.

92
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,290
Thank you, everyone.

93
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,170
Thank you, everyone.

94
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,690
Thank you.

95
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,610
My apologies, President.

96
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,890
Thank you.

97
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,370
President.

98
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,650
Thank you.

99
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,020
-Sorry, President.
-Thank you.

100
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,910
Sorry, President.

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,360
Thank you.

102
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:18,850
Thank you!

103
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:21,890
Thank you.

104
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,570
Le Xuan gets to stay!

105
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,370
Thank you.

106
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,810
Thank you, everyone.

107
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,250
I'm sorry, President.

108
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:32,730
Thank you!

109
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,450
This is surprising.

110
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,409
-My apologies, President.
-Thank you.

111
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,650
Thank you.

112
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,290
Thank you.

113
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,650
Yu Le Xuan.

114
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,450
You must not let us down.

115
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,650
Thank you, Master Wang.

116
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,550
Thank you, everyone.

117
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,730
I told you he's blessed.

118
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,370
Keep up the good work, Yu Le Xuan!

119
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,080
One more thing, Master Wang.

120
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,450
What else?

121
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,690
Han Sheng Zhi instigated others
to beat up a student.

122
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,010
Please punish him.

123
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,210
We'll deal it with another time.

124
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,570
Isn't this bullying?

125
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,490
It's better for Master Wang
to oversee this matter.

126
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,020
President.

127
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,970
Do you admit?

128
00:07:57,659 --> 00:07:58,500
Master Wang.

129
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,740
I don't.

130
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,650
Lei Ze Xin!

131
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,210
Show me your evidence if
you want me to confess.

132
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,000
Do you dare to show us your wounds?

133
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,360
You!

134
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,950
Yes, examine his wounds!

135
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,170
-Examine him!
-Yes!

136
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,250
-Check him!
-What to do?

137
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,170
If you didn't do it,
you have nothing to hide.

138
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,090
-Yes, let's examine him.
-That's right.

139
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,120
We have to check him.

140
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,580
-We'll know if you're innocent after that.
-That's right.

141
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,890
-What are you doing?
-What is this?

142
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,970
Lin Bing Shen?

143
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,970
-This...
-What is happening?

144
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,140
What is it, Lin Bing Shen?

145
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,220
Master Wang.

146
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,480
I'm the one who did it.

147
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,039
Lin Bing Shen?

148
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,130
You, the scaredy-cat? That's impossible.

149
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,110
I never expect that.

150
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,280
Not only that.

151
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,809
I injured Feng Cheng Jun.

152
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,210
I damaged the bow and arrow
at the archery ceremony.

153
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,410
And...

154
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,250
I framed Wen Bin for stealing the herbs.

155
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,410
-He did it?
-I did everything.

156
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,650
-I never thought he's like that.
-True.

157
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,170
Wen Bin.

158
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,810
Cheng Jun.

159
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,630
I'm really sorry.

160
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,250
That's too despicable!

161
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,050
That's right! How can he do that?

162
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,490
I'm...

163
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,050
willing to accept any punishment.

164
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,130
President.

165
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,070
What should we do with Lin Bing Shen?

166
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,730
He shamed Yun Shang Academy.

167
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,400
You have the authority, Master Wang.

168
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,130
Four Gentlemen of Yun Shang.

169
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:29,210
I hope your decisions
will not be a let down to everyone.

170
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,900
Le Xuan.

171
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,630
Give us an opinion.

172
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,180
As Wen Bin said,

173
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,290
Yun Shang changes lives.

174
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,450
Punishment is not our goal.

175
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,030
Now that everyone gave me a chance,

176
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,250
let's give Lin Bing Shen a chance too.

177
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,300
A gentleman indeed.

178
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,260
-That's right.
-Good.

179
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,330
-Le Xuan is benevolent.
-Great!

180
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,650
-That's unexpected.
-Great!

181
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,610
Good!

182
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,890
You did well, Le Xuan!

183
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,450
That's great, Le Xuan!

184
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,650
You did well, Le Xuan!

185
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,010
You're our role model!

186
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,050
That's right!

187
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,370
President.

188
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,010
President!

189
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,930
Everything I did today...

190
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,530
is to thank you for funding
me all this time.

191
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,730
I'm leaving you.

192
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,990
I do hope you won't hate me.

193
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,530
Are you kidding me?

194
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,770
Even Yu Le Xuan can face himself now.

195
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,860
I also want to live with dignity
and do what I want.

196
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,220
Take care, President.

197
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,240
Bing Shen! Bing...

198
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,170
What are you doing?

199
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,330
Sheng Zhi.

200
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,890
You're not injured.

201
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,610
So what if I'm not?

202
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,410
Cousin.

203
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,630
I despise you.

204
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,790
As expected from the Four Gentlemen
of Yun Shang.

205
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,010
Commander Lei.

206
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,330
Congrats for having such
an outstanding son.

207
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,170
Thanks to Feng Cheng Jun and
Wen Bin's influence,

208
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,360
Ze Xin changed for the better.

209

[Ju Xian Hall]

210

My lord.

211
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,580
Why are you following us?

212
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,870
I want to appeal to Master Wang.

213
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,610
I think you've got the wrong person.

214
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,450
Master Wang does not possess
any official position.

215
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,490
If you have grievances,

216
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,370
you can go to the magistrate.

217
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,890
My lord.

218
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,880
Please pass this letter to Master Wang.

219

*[To Master Wang]

220
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,160
I'll advise you to bury the idea, Ms. Mu.

221
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,010
My lord!

222
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,890
It's alright, Bing Shen.

223
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,170
What do you two want?

224
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,210
Guys.

225
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,120
Lin Bing Shen and I are here to ask
for your forgiveness.

226
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,090
Le Xuan, this parasol is for you.

227
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,250
Please accept it.

*[Man in Rain]

"Man in Rain"?

230
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,730
Are you sure this parasol is for me?

231
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,170
I'm not a lady.

232
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,810
Why give me a man?

233
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:38,930
Le Xuan.

234
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,050
I've done many misdeeds in the past.

235
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,080
And I've earned too much dirty money.

236
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,010
I did wrong.

237
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,570
The first wage I received with pride...

238
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,970
is from the writing job that you
introduced to me.

239
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,370
You turned me into a man by...

240
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,770
working diligently.

241
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,290
I gifted you a parasol to shield you
from everything.

242
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,010
I hope you can fulfil your dreams.

243
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,050
-Great!
-Nice!

244
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,450
Never thought you're that eloquent.

245
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,730
But this is too much.

246
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:12,930
Wen Bin.

247
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,680
Should I keep it?

248
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:23,130
Wen Bin, beat me up if
you're still mad at me.

249
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,490
I'm really here to apologise.

250
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:27,690
That's right.

251
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,450
Wen Bin, I did you wrong before too.

252
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,010
Beat me up first.

253
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,810
Never mind. I'll keep track of it.

254
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,490
Wen Bin is too kind.

255
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,150
Le Xuan.

256
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,450
I know you're wealthy.

257
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,030
But this is way too wealthy!

258
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,490
I was planning to use this money
to buy a permanent aristocrat title.

259
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,810
It's useless now.

260
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,360
Why?

261
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,210
Buy me some wine with that money.

262
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,410
You wish!

263
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,730
Le Xuan,

264
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,130
you're my idol.

265
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:40,010
Let's earn big money together
after we graduate.

266
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,410
You miser.

267
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,250
After we graduate, we'll be taking
the imperial exam to become officials.

268
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,490
We'd be plenty busy.

269
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,970
There won't be time to make money.

270
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,940
We can earn for the poor.

271
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,370
But I think it's better for you to give
this money to your parents.

272
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,090
They can have a better life
with that money.

273
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,130
You're right.

274
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,570
It's been a long time since I
visited them back home.

275
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,730
I'll accompany you.

276
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,290
Yu Le Xuan!

277
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,329
I heard you're moving to the dormitory.

278
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:13,069
We can help you out if you don't mind.

279
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,130
Great!

280
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,010
We're here too.

281
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,010
These are all for you.

282
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:18,930
Take it.

283
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,730
I'm just moving places.

284
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,410
Why are so many of you here?

285
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,750
-Let's move.
-Move!

286
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,130
-Come on!
-Come.

287
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,620
You might catch a cold, so...

288
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,250
Sorry for waking you up.

289
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,880
I'll just go back to sleep.

290
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,450
Where are you going?

291
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,650
I'm going for a walk.

292
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,810
Chao Hui.

293
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,130
What done is done. Don't be sad about it.

294
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,850
Don't feel bad about it.

295
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,370
Who bullied you?

296
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,570
A beautiful lady.

297
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,010
Don't say it.

298
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,890
-It's embarrassing.
-Fine, we'll stop here.

299
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,930
Let me tell you, Ze Xin.

300
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,250
This guy met a beautiful lady outside.

301
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,730
He fell in love with her.

302
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,690
And he gave her an amulet!

303
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,050
So that girl thought he was cursing her,

304
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,810
and beat him up.

305
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,170
Ze Xin.

306
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,490
It's like this.

307
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,570
I was being kind.

308
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,130
I gave her a blessing amulet.

309
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,500
Tell me.

310
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,170
What should I do?

311
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,930
I don't know.

312
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,770
What do you think?

313
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,210
Me?

314
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:36,930
In my opinion,

315
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,450
if a man likes a woman,

316
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,130
he should give presents
like jewellery to her.

317
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,570
How could he give her an amulet?

318
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,410
-Jewellery?
-What jewellery?

319
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:46,890
Hairpin!

320
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,600
A hairpin is good.

321
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,810
Hairpin?

322
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,770
-Why?
-Think about it.

323
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,900
If the girl you like wears the
hairpin you gave her,

324
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,250
she'd think about you all the time, no?

325
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,410
That makes sense.

326
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,570
-What do you guys think?
-Great.

327
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,650
-Take it carefully.
-Thank you, sir.

328
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,930
Come again soon!

329
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,530
Welcome to my humble shop, mister.

330
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,410
Have a look.

331
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,850
Do you like any of these?

332
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,190
Pick one.

333
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,530
We provide word carving service
if you purchase from us.

334
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,330
After you pick a hairpin,

335
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,290
we'll carve unique words for you.

336
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:32,500
Your present for your loved one
will be the only one in this world.

337
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,130
For a loved one?

338
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,390
I...

339
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,630
I'm giving it to a friend.

340
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,930
Then this is not the right one.

341
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,370
Look at these ones.

342
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:46,810
These are the best sellers.

343
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,510
Every girl on the South Street has one.

344
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,960
My friend is different from them.

345
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,510
She's pure and doesn't like makeup.

346
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,180
I'll take this hairpin.

347
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,930
Sure!

348
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,440
As long as your friend accepts it.

349
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,160
I'll personalise it for you.

350
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,970
Please wait for a moment.

351
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,620
Who are you?

352
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,930
Master Wang doesn't show himself.

353
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,330
I thought I had found my chance.

354
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,010
But I still failed.

355
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,930
It might be a good thing that this letter
didn't reach Master Wang's hands.

356
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,490
The aristocrats have complex
ties between them.

357
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,850
We can't tell friend from foe.

358
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,530
You must be patient afterwards.

359
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:07,250
Do you mean Master Wang...

360
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,650
When the tragedy happened,

361
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:14,730
Master Wang was sent to Gui for
an academic exchange.

362
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,850
We must investigate to know if...

363
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,430
he did it deliberately...

364
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,730
or it's merely coincidental.

365
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,730
Then what should I do next?

366
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,170
Please guide me, Uncle.

367
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,650
Continue sending out flyers.

368
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,770
We need to know Master Wang's stand
about the incident.

369
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,650
Yes, Uncle.

370
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:30,810
Remember.

371
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:31,890
Be safe.

372
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,210
Don't worry, Uncle.

373
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,370
Zhi Er.

374
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,330
Father.

375
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:05,130
You've been at home for a while now.

376
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,330
Why haven't you returned to the academy?

377
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:11,090
As the student president
of Yun Shang Academy,

378
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,970
you have to be a role model.

379
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,400
Yes, Father.

380
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,850
But a person's energy is limited.

381
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,530
Besides becoming a good president,

382
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,390
I have to study well.

383
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,650
As Yun Shang Academy's student,

384
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,050
learning is most important.

385
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,490
You finally understood.

386
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,010
That's great.

387
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:36,970
You've grown up.

388
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:40,810
You did well with the ledger.

389
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,370
Yes, Father.

390
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,450
Old Han.

391
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,050
-Madam.
-Mother.

392
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,170
Old Han.

393
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,010
Stop scolding him.

394
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,290
Look at his little face.

395
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,650
It's turned white.

396
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,410
I'm not scolding him.

397
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,650
I'm praising him.

398
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,410
I said he's all grown up.

399
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,610
He knows about himself.

400
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:03,130
He knows how to share my burden.

401
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,530
If he's all grown up,

402
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,970
we should prepare for his marriage.

403
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,010
Old Han, should we find a
young and beautiful girl...

404
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:15,570
with a good family for our son?

405
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,250
Of course.

406
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,600
Whose son is he?

407
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,420
He's my, Han Zheng Liang's son.

408
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,810
We must choose the best for him.

409
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:31,330
A lady that is compatible with
his appearance.

410
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,970
-That's right.
-When you chose me back then,

411
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:37,300
didn't you choose me with that criteria?

412
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,180
Like father, like son.

413
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,250
You're right, Old Han.

414
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:04,890
Xiao Man.

415
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,240
Xiao Man!

416
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,010
Go!

417
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,640
Xiao Man.

418
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,850
Xiao Man!

419
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,410
Why did you drink so much alone?

420
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,850
Where are your friends?

421
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:43,890
Xiao Man.

422
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,290
Xiao Man...

423
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,940
You finally came to see me.

424
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,810
Don't mention those jerks.

425
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:04,090
Han Sheng Xiong, Lin Bing Shen
and Gu Zi Ming.

426
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,890
Those back-stabbing traitors.

427
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,110
They betrayed me.

428
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,810
Xiao Man.

429
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,260
Xiao Man,

430
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,450
you won't betray me, right?

431
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,410
Han Sheng Zhi.

432
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:33,490
If you treated others kindly
and acted fairly,

433
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,330
why would they betray you?

434
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,650
Yes.

435
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,100
It's my fault.

436
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,900
It's my own fault.

437
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,660
You guys are right.

438
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,170
If I admit...

439
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,370
I'm wrong,

440
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,370
everyone will be happy.

441
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,530
Stop drinking, Han Sheng Zhi.

442
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:05,300
Those who fail will always make
excuses for themselves.

443
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,050
They don't have the courage
to face their mistakes.

444
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,290
So they come here
and drink themselves silly.

445
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,770
Let me tell you.

446
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,290
I despise such cowards like you.

447
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,170
I'm not a coward.

448
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,090
I'm not a coward!

449
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,730
If you continue to be unreasonable,

450
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,290
this will be our last meeting.

451
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,930
I don't want to be a coward.

452
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,570
Wen Bin.

453
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,850
Is that bitter gourd soup?

454
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,370
You want some?

455
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,090
Here you go.

456
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:39,650
Look at them. Are they eating
bitter gourd or melon?

457
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,050
What sweet ambience!

458
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,290
Why don't we eat together?

459
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,560
It'll taste better.

460
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,330
Where are you going?

461
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,430
Why so petty?

462
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:05,370
Harmony with spouse is like
beautiful musical harmony.

463
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,910
Brothers who meet today enjoys
harmony and happiness.

464
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,970
In the passage on Moderation,

465
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:18,010
what did Confucius mean by his comments
on the Book of Poems here?

466
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,010
Feng Cheng Jun.

467
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,810
Please explain.

468
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,410
The meaning of this passage means...

469
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,810
if the wife is happy,

470
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:32,250
then brothers will be in harmony as well.

471
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,530
Close kinship builds a happy family.

472
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,570
This is Confucius's comment.

473
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,490
What are you talking about?

474
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,850
Confucius meant,

475
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:45,050
moderation in all things
should start with close kins.

476
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,480
That is, with wives and brothers.

477
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,450
Feng Cheng Jun.

478
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,430
What's wrong with you?

479
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,090
You kept answering questions wrongly.

480
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:04,930
Copy this poem 20 times.

481
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,530
Twenty times?

482
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,820
Just him.

483
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,090
What's wrong?

484
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,490
What's the matter with him?

485
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,850
What happened today?

486
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,150
How did he become like this?

487
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,450
Should I get closer?

488
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,240
Or should I stay away?

489
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,930
Tell me. Closer?

490
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,370
Or further away?

491
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,680
What do you say?

492
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,250
What do you think I should do?

493
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,420
Eat up.

494
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,770
You even misinterpreted the poem.

495
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,290
Why are you acting strange today in class?

496
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:24,370
What happened?

497
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,610
Is something bothering you?

498
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,170
No.

499
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,940
I'm anxious.

500
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,970
Tell me then.

501
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,170
Don't worry.

502
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,090
I'm good with secrets.

503
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,290
I'll keep it for you.

504
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,970
It's Wen Bin.

505
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,810
I kept following his emotions.

506
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:51,070
I care about what he cares.

507
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,570
I'm happy when he's happy.

508
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,250
I'll feel sad when he's sad.

509
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:55,930
Isn't this weird?

510
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,170
You're just a bookworm.

511
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:05,600
You don't have much experience with girls.

512
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:11,530
That's why you can't differentiate between
love and brotherhood.

513
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,880
Is that so?

514
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,540
Possibly.

515
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:22,290
I sleep with Brother Bin everyday.

516
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,180
We study together everyday too.

517
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,170
Maybe that's why I'm delusional.

518
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,170
That's it.

519
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,410
But...

520
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,490
Even though everyone is equal,

521
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,630
but with your family background,

522
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:40,270
it is not up to you when
it comes to your marriage.

523
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:44,130
There will be many implications.

524
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,460
What is your plan?

525
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:49,890
To be honest,

526
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,290
compared to getting married,

527
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,870
I rather have a bosom friend whom I can
stay together with for a long time.

528
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,770
It's more comfortable for me.

529
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,730
Anxiety comes from suspicion.

530
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:06,490
If you're worried,

531
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,409
try to socialise more with girls.

532
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,370
Perhaps you'll find the root
of the problem.

533
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:14,370
Socialise?

534
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,770
Let me see.

535
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,210
Look, Brother.

536
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,250
Madam.

537
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,250
From all these girls,

538
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:39,889
only the Mo family's background
is acceptable. Right?

539
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:41,250
Madam.

540
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:45,050
-Mo family does have a good background.
-Looks good?

541
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:47,969
But their daughter looks...

542
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:52,850
Madam, appearance is not crucial.

543
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:56,449
Though it's not crucial, but people say
the face is the index of the heart.

544
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,840
I think one's appearance can
reflect one's inner self.

545
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:06,570
My daughter.

546
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:10,010
We're discussing about your
brother's marriage.

547
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,850
Why are you more excited than him?

548
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,330
Old Han.

549
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:16,410
It's time to look for a suitable
candidate for our daughter.

550
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,450
Yes.

551
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,730
Father, Mother.

552
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,130
I want to find someone I like by myself.

553
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,570
By yourself?

554
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,490
Do you mean...

555
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:28,810
No!

556
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:29,730
Father, Mother.

557
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,210
I think...

558
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,540
a marriage can only last
when the couple share the same ideas.

559
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:36,840
This child.

560
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,570
I believe it too.

561
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,530
Me too.

562
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,730
The flowers are blossoming.

563
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,480
But someone has a heavy mind.

564
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,120
Staring into space?

565
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,610
Who's staring into space?

566
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,210
Feng Cheng Jun.

567
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,650
A highly-talented man...

568
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,260
is about to become an idiot.

569
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,170
That's worrying.

570
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:17,130
He is acting weird lately.

571
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:22,330
We can only blame Wen Bin for looking
so gorgeous as a woman.

572
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,410
That's really a headache.

573
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,450
Young Master Feng.

574
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,250
Your letter.

575
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:56,530
Thanks.

576
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:18,010
I received three riddles the other day.

577
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,530
They are quite interesting.

578
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,250
I hope you can solve them...

579
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,970
to ease your boredom in studies.

580
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:26,410
I don't know if I'm too sudden.

581
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,930
[Anxiety comes from suspicion.]

582
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,450
[If you're worried,]

583
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:34,410
[try and socialise more with girls.]

584
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:37,850
[Perhaps you'll find the root
of the problem.]

585
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,080
Ms. Han,

586
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,450
I'm willing to help you with the riddles.
