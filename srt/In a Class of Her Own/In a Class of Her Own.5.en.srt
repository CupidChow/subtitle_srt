[In A Class of Her Own]

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,440
[Episode 5]

4
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,660
You're making me worried.

5
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,080
Worried about what?

6
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,370
I'm worried that there is
something on my face.

7
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,470
It's nothing at all.

8
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,550
Can I have a word with you?

9
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,030
Come with me.

10
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,079
Come and have a seat.

11
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,700
What is it about?

12
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,520
Right,

13
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,030
this is a list of all the
students in Pufang Dorm,

14
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,000
and their academic progress report.

15
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,240
Take a look.

16
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,910
Why are you giving this to me?

17
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,550
You think I am willing...

18
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,470
What I mean is,

19
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,720
because all the new students,

20
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,240
they unanimously elected you
as the steward of Pufang Dorm.

21
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,000
-Steward of Pufang Dorm?
-That's right.

22
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,360
Why me?

23
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,910
There are two reasons.

24
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,550
First, your performance
at the admission ceremony...

25
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,800
was truly impressive.

26
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,670
Second, you did very well
in the secret mission.

27
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,310
That's why all the students
in Pufang Dorm elected you...

28
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,720
as the steward of Pufang Dorm.

29
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,920
Stop being humble,

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,110
I have already reported
the matter to the secretary.

31
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,000
What about the current
steward of Pufang Dorm?

32
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,520
He'll be removed.

33
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,550
Who is the current
steward of Pufang Dorm?

34
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,550
I must apologise to him.

35
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,910
There's no need to do so.

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,320
You've met the outgoing
steward of Pufang Dorm.

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,880
Who is he?

38
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,960
It's me.

39
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,160
Yes, it's me.

40
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,160
You look old, I thought you are...

41
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,440
What do you mean by old?

42
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,830
I grew faster than anyone else.

43
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,670
According to "Zhuang Zi,
The Inner Chapters",

44
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,110
life has a limit,
but knowledge is limitless.

45
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,080
I only want to gain all the
knowledge in the world,

46
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,000
to study them thoroughly in school.

47
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,950
That's why I've spent
so many years in Pufang.

48
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,960
It was tough for me.

49
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,520
Can you do me a favour?

50
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,269
Just name it.

51
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,430
Can you be my deputy?

52
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,990
You can help me to manage things.

53
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,990
Of course I can help.

54
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,240
I can do anything for you.

55
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,230
I'll leave the matter
in your hands then.

56
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,600
No, no.

57
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,590
You see...

58
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,720
you are the steward!

59
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,720
What happened in the
painting class today,

60
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,510
don't worry about it.

61
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,320
As long as you work harder,
you'll improve.

62
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,040
But I am curious.

63
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,720
Curious about what?

64
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,030
You have very nice handwriting,

65
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,909
how come you can't paint at all?

66
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,880
My father died early,

67
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:59,240
my mother raised me by herself
together with...

68
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,600
together with my elder sister.

69
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,990
In the beginning,

70
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,560
we lived on my father's saving,

71
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,870
but life was tough.

72
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,310
I even went to a private school.

73
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,270
But when my sister fell ill,

74
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,860
our savings dwindled.

75
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,520
So, I've only learnt to write,

76
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,860
but not painting.

77
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,390
This kind of life...

78
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,640
is not easy.

79
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,360
I believe in Yun,

80
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,640
there are others like you.

81
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,510
That's why we must study harder,

82
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,750
to find a good strategy
to change their lives.

83
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,880
When we secure an official position,
we'll obtain great achievements.

84
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,800
Everyone has his own ambition.

85
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,710
I envy you,

86
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,720
for you are free to choose your ambition.

87
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,830
Anything is possible.

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,310
For me to hold a position,

89
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,190
not unless girls
can attend school, too.

90
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,480
You think girls can't attend school?

91
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,310
There was once a teacher,

92
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,720
he put forward a plan
to allow girls to go to school.

93
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,120
He almost succeeded.

94
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Almost?

95
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,110
That means he didn't succeed.

96
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,920
Who was he?

97
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,390
It was eighteen years ago.

98
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,110
As for his identity,

99
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,890
no one remembers.

100
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,600
If everyone comes here to watch
Mu Xiao Man's performance.

101
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,870
this place won't be big enough.

102
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,040
So,

103
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,720
do you have any great plans?

104
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,320
We could use the character of a person...

105
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,760
as criteria for admission
to Mu Xiao Man's show.

106
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,560
You are tired, rest early.

107
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,760
-I wonder if Lei Ao is back?
-It'll be fine.

108
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,110
Go in and take a look.

109
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,160
Please step aside.

110
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,760
This is our room, too.

111
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,670
Ours?

112
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,390
Yours and whose?

113
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,160
Where do you live?

114
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,830
I live in West Village.

115
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,640
My father died early,

116
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,600
I live with my mother
and elder sister.

117
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,480
That's why I said...

118
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,390
you shouldn't be friends with Feng Cheng Jun.

119
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,480
You're not of the same kind.

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,800
Wen Bin.

121
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,260
Are you looking for me?

122
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,110
Why did she promise you to come?

123
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,480
Because she...

124
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,790
Ms. Mu...

125
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,680
I don't know why she agreed to come.

126
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,950
I am warning you,

127
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,910
leave her alone.

128
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,750
Could it be that you and Ms. Mu...

129
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,630
Shut up.

130
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,160
Let me tell you,

131
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,240
Yun Shang Academy
can be heaven to you,

132
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,520
it can also be hell for you.

133
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,400
Do you understand?

134
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,200
Enough is enough.

135
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,200
You are very daring,

136
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,270
making a fuss in front of my room.

137
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,080
Having a gang fight?

138
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,270
Calm down.

139
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,710
Calm down.

140
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,000
Engaging in gang fight in school...

141
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,840
calls for more than a deduction
in nobility marks.

142
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,080
Besides,

143
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,910
picking a fight with Lei Ao...

144
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,280
isn't worth it.

145
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,880
Wen Bin,

146
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,150
I must warn you again,

147
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,910
I'll be always watching you.

148
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,990
Don't let me catch you
making any mistakes.

149
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,470
Move along.

150
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,440
Move along.

151
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,120
Looks like Yun Shang Academy...

152
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,790
exists to make life difficult for me.

153
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,230
Make life difficult?

154
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,400
You have the famous and talented
Feng Cheng Jun looking out for you,

155
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,280
and Lei Ao protecting you.

156
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,160
If this is making life difficult for you,

157
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,230
then I'm willing to take all of it.

158
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,200
Thank you, Brother Cheng Jun.

159
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,920
Thank you, Brother Ze Xin.

160
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,800
What about me?

161
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,840
-Thank...
-Save mine...

162
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,280
for later.

163
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,640
Are you all right?

164
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,150
The atmosphere becomes
tense when you step in.

165
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,030
Come on,

166
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,470
lighten up.

167
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,440
The room is small.

168
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,080
It's too crowded.

169
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,800
Stop the nonsense.

170
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,320
Little Brother stays.
The rest of you get out.

171
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,760
Brother Ze Xin,

172
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,200
Brother Cheng Jun isn't the
type of person you said he is.

173
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,120
You saw it too,

174
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,630
Cheng Jun has been helping me.

175
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,520
Brother Wen Bin,

176
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,300
there's no need to talk to him.

177
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,400
This atmosphere...

178
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,630
Something is wrong.

179
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,120
Let's go.

180
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,790
Are you sure you want to chase
them out from Pufang Dorm Two?

181
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,790
I just want that
pretentious guy to move out.

182
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,440
He already has a place to stay.

183
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,030
You seem to have a good impression
of Wen Bin.

184
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,830
You call him Little Brother.

185
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,910
Did you know him before?

186
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,670
He helped me before.

187
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,960
You saw it too,

188
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,400
Feng Cheng Jun cares for Wen Bin, too.

189
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,560
Wen Bin and Feng Cheng Jun
must be close.

190
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,520
If you chase Feng Cheng Jun out,

191
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,960
Wen Bin might not stay here, too.

192
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,800
Chasing away a fellow student.

193
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,520
That's ten nobility marks.

194
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,710
Twenty points for chasing away
two students.

195
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,880
I don't care.

196
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,030
I do.

197
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,470
You!

198
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,320
Did you place bet on me again?

199
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,200
That's not important.

200
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,230
The point is...

201
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,230
the true victor is one who lives in peace
with the person he hates.

202
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,840
Lei Ao,

203
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,430
are you lacking in self-confidence?

204
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,760
Or you are scared?

205
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,710
Be serious.

206
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,270
Wipe that grin off.

207
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,440
It's very disgusting.

208
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,760
Fine,

209
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,870
I'm going back to collect my debt.

210
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,790
You guys rest early.

211
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,400
By the way,

212
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,920
although he seems
to have a bad temper,

213
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,670
he's actually very kind.

214
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,550
Pretend nothing happened...

215
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,520
and go to bed now.

216
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,440
[I might as well
be driven out by him.]

217
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,470
Brother Wen Bin.

218
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,270
I...

219
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,800
You sleep first.

220
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,000
I'll read for a while.

221
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,240
That's not allowed.

222
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,280
Lights out and sleep.

223
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,910
Lights out?

224
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,420
Can you sleep with the lights on?

225
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,640
I'm afraid of the dark.

226
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,000
You're really troublesome.

227
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,630
A man who is afraid of the dark.

228
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
Ten to one.

229
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,150
Pay up.

230
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,360
This is your blanket.

231
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,950
Junior,

232
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,800
I've agreed to let him
sleep on the bed,

233
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,110
but I didn't agree for
him to share my blanket.

234
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,920
You can have it all.

235
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,440
Junior.

236
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,350
From now on,

237
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,910
you can call me Senior.

238
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,000
Got it?

239
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,320
You are not willing?

240
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,590
You think it's beneath you?

241
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,950
No, of course not.

242
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,830
Senior.

243
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,910
Little Brother.

244
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,910
Are you calling me?

245
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,590
You can call me Brother Feng.

246
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,760
Brother Feng?

247
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,080
Junior,

248
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,840
why are you sleeping there?

249
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,760
Come here and sleep next to me.

250
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,560
Senior,

251
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,830
I am the youngest,

252
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,360
I should sleep outside.

253
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,320
Nonsense.

254
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,510
This is an order.

255
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,590
I don't want to sleep with him.

256
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,950
You can sleep in the middle.

257
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,670
It's easy to catch a cold at the sides.

258
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,310
I am fine, it's quite warm at the sides.

259
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,710
Lei Ze Xin,

260
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,950
we can talk.

261
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,480
Don't touch my little brother.

262
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,560
Junior,

263
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,440
you'll sleep in the
middle from now on.

264
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,590
Are you all right?

265
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,470
I am all right.

266
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,950
He is a man,

267
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,390
not a delicate woman.

268
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,000
Little Brother is frail.

269
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,960
He can't stand your rude behaviour.

270
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,760
What Little Brother?

271
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,470
He is my junior.

272
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,520
All right!

273
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,550
It's late, go to sleep.

274
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,400
[Hopefully, Wen Bin and Feng Cheng Jun
can get through the night.]

275
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
[Lei Ao,]

276
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,520
[you must get used to the change.]

277
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,000
Junior,

278
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,670
I am your senior.

279
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,320
You must respect me.

280
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,030
What are you trying to do?

281
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,790
I am his elder brother,

282
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,680
Little Brother is closer
to me naturally.

283
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,240
I knew it.

284
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,790
You'll snatch anything from me.

285
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,670
Knock it off!

286
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,880
This should be fine.

287
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,270
Sleep now.

288
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,829
Senior,

289
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,230
why do you take off your
clothes when you sleep?

290
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,680
Are you not cold?

291
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,190
It's comfortable to sleep naked.

292
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,590
You could've slept in a superior room.

293
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,590
Yet you came to sleep in
such a crowded place.

294
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,430
You are up to no good.

295
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,920
I have no ulterior motive.

296
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,430
Don't waste your time, Senior.

297
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,230
Don't call me Senior.

298
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,390
You don't deserve to call me that.

299
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,950
You don't deserve to call me by my name.

300
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,470
In Yun Shang Academy,

301
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,350
everyone is treated equally.

302
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,640
No matter how prominent
your family,

303
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,920
or how skilled you are,

304
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,350
you'll be judged by the same measure
as everyone else.

305
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,640
To rise above the others,

306
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,680
you must prove your worth
with academic results.

307
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,920
Senior, I hope you understand.

308
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,680
Do you want to die?

309
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,760
How dare you call me Senior?

310
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,550
Only my junior Wen Bin
can call me Senior.

311
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,800
Let go.

312
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,960
Let go.

313
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,920
Let go!

314
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,040
Knock it off!

315
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,640
Little Brother, are you hurt?

316
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,350
If this is my life from now on,

317
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,040
how am I going to survive?

318
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,880
My life is miserable.

319
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,640
I am sorry, Little Brother.

320
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,550
I'll listen to you from now on.

321
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,960
Go to sleep.

322
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,160
I can't stand a man who cries.

323
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,220
Only girls do that.

324
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,800
And,

325
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,760
if anyone wakes me up,

326
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,350
I'll beat him up.

327
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,470
[I'll quit school after
I get this month's allowance.]

328
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,200
[This life is not for me.]

329
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,560
[Little Brother.]

330
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,280
[Little Brother!]

331
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,700
[Little Brother.]

332
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,070
[Little Brother...]

333
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,960
[You can't do this, Little Brother.]

334
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,840
-[Little Brother, don't be like this.]
-[Let me go...]

335
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,710
Wake up, Little Brother.

336
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,520
Have you forgotten
what I told you last night?

337
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,840
I am sorry, Senior.
It's all my fault.

338
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,080
It's not your fault.

339
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,470
You have no shame at all,

340
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,060
letting other people bear
responsibility for your mistake.

341
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,750
I am talking to you, are you dumb?

342
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,760
Senior, I thought you aren't talking
to Brother Feng?

343
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
All of you get out!

344
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,190
Get out!

345
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,150
Wait.

346
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,800
What's the matter?

347
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,800
What are you doing?

348
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:44,560
Is Lei Ao giving you a hard time?

349
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,800
He didn't drive me out,

350
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,270
but he kept arguing
with Brother Feng,

351
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,680
I couldn't stand it.

352
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,230
I hear you are the only one who
can talk to Ze Xin in the academy.

353
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,480
Can you tell me...

354
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,560
how I can get them
to co-exist peacefully?

355
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,950
Let me see.

356
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,640
Lei Ao loves Liquid Gold Wine from
Mingren Tavern the most.

357
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,920
However,

358
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,560
as he owes a lot of money,

359
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,290
he has been blacklisted
by Mingren Tavern.

360
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,800
He can't buy it from them.

361
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,760
If you can get the wine...

362
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,870
and give it to him,

363
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,000
he'll definitely listen to you.

364
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,920
How much is the wine?

365
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,520
-This...
-Now,

366
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,000
let's talk about serious matter.

367
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,920
Look, now that you are in the academy,

368
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,470
you can't go out and
work for Mr. Chao.

369
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,640
But you need money, don't you?

370
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,960
Don't worry,

371
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,470
I won't ask you to do anything
against your principles.

372
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,880
I want you to do what you are good at.

373
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,310
What's that?

374
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,920
"Where Love Begins".

375
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,990
Did you know your last chapter...

376
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,950
has elicited tears from the eyes of girls
throughout this city?

377
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,190
Is it very popular?

378
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,990
Did you know how many young ladies...

379
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,570
are waiting for your latest chapter?

380
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,960
I am very busy lately,

381
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,470
I don't have time.

382
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,800
It's a very popular storybook,

383
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,820
but you only get paid for
transcribing fifty copies.

384
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,810
Am I right?

385
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,040
It's a big loss, Wen Bin.

386
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,750
Because of your talent,

387
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,280
you'll need a business prodigy
like me to help you manage...

388
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,880
to avoid being exploited
by the bad guys.

389
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,520
Why don't you work with me?

390
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,750
How?

391
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:40,520
You only need to pass me
your latest storybook.

392
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,960
The profit from the selling of books...

393
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,680
will be split seventy-thirty.

394
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,460
It's a deal.

395
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,630
This money will be the deposit
for our next collaboration.

396
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,760
Thank you, Le Xuan.

397
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,350
[South Street Market]

398
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,640
Innkeeper,

399
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,800
a jug of Liquid Gold Wine.

400
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,230
I am sorry,

401
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,070
Liquid Gold Wine is sold out today.

402
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,440
Sold out?

403
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,480
Our Liquid Gold Wine...

404
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,960
has a limited supply each day.

405
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,270
We use only the finest brew.

406
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,160
There's not a lot of it.

407
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,680
My apologies.

408
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,080
Are there any reserved ones?

409
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,440
We have a few bottles,

410
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,480
but they are as good as sold.

411
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,520
Unless the customer gives it up,

412
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,950
I have no right to sell it to you.

413
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,190
Perhaps you can
try your luck tomorrow.

414
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,680
Sir,

415
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,040
what's the matter?

416
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,760
To be honest,

417
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,430
my brother is very sick.

418
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,600
I am afraid he can't
make it through today.

419
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,920
All he wants is a taste
of Liquid Gold before death.

420
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,960
Innkeeper,

421
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,880
can you help me?

422
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,760
If that's the case,

423
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,280
I have no choice.

424
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,120
I'll give you a reserved bottle now...

425
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,710
and explain it to the customer later.

426
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,040
I believe...

427
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,080
he will understand the situation.

428
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,680
Waiter,

429
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,720
get a reserved bottle
for this customer.

430
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,600
All right.

431
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,640
Thank you, Innkeeper.

432
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,830
I thank you on behalf
of my sick brother.

433
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,960
You are welcome.

434
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,110
Good day.

435
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,070
That rascal!

436
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,110
He came out to buy wine.

437
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,110
He's daring.

438
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,560
Senior.

439
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,260
Senior.

440
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:16,970
Senior.

441
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,350
Liquid Gold Wine?

442
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,320
Yes.

443
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,400
Is this your favourite?

444
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,000
You dare to bring wine
into the academy?

445
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,280
Do you still want to live?

446
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,870
You always argue with Brother Feng.

447
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,160
I am fed up with you.

448
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,110
Junior,

449
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,760
I am unlike him.

450
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:53,400
Don't try to sweet-talk me.

451
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,270
That's why...

452
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,040
I'm sending my sincerity to you.

453
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:12,990
You don't want it?

454
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,200
If you won't drink it,

455
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,160
I am going to drink it.

456
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,310
You?

457
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,400
I think you can drink only two sips, tops.

458
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,720
If I take three sips,

459
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,410
will you stop arguing
with Brother Feng?

460
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,430
If you can take three sips,

461
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,950
I'll consider it.

462
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,840
You promise?

463
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,720
Drink.

464
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,040
Do you know how strong this wine is?

465
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,870
If I can take three sips,

466
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,630
you can't argue with
Brother Feng anymore.

467
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,720
You are long-winded, like a woman.

468
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,110
Stop nagging.

469
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,630
President,

470
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,680
I saw Wen Bin sneak out to buy wine.

471
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,470
Are you sure?

472
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,950
Rest assured,

473
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,680
I've seen it correctly.

474
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,350
Drink up.

475
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,110
Just swallow it.

476
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,150
You can't even take one sip.

477
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,350
Just forget it.

478
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,760
That's strange.

479
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,640
The wine tastes spicy in the mouth,

480
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,230
but after that,

481
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,390
it tastes sweet.

482
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,350
It's a good wine.

483
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,230
You are really good.

484
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,280
The Liquid Gold Wine,

485
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,800
I can only drink three or four sips, tops.

486
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,830
You can really drink.

487
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,210
Have you drunk before?

488
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,640
No.

489
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,150
My mother said I shouldn't drink.

490
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,160
She said a girl...

491
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,600
a child shouldn't drink.

492
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,750
You are lucky.

493
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:40,770
You get to drink Liquid Gold Wine from
Mingren Tavern for your first time.

494
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,110
I am afraid...

495
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:44,160
you won't take any other wine anymore.

496
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,710
I'll drink with you in the future.

497
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,110
Have you seen me in
South Street before?

498
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,920
Are you able to recognise me?

499
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,440
Why wouldn't I?

500
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,590
I am not drunk.

501
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,840
Do you remember that day
when you were in the countryside?

502
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,200
Countryside?

503
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,760
You saved a girl in the countryside.

504
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,110
A girl? What girl?

505
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:34,110
A beautiful and young maiden.

506
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,560
I have never seen a beautiful maiden,

507
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,560
but I have seen a few ugly girls.

508
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,400
And you said you are not drunk.

509
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,800
I am not drunk.

510
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,350
I can still drink three...

511
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,390
What happened to my fingers?

512
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,960
My fingers...

513
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,560
You promised me not to antagonise
Feng Cheng Jun anymore.

514
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,430
You are so kind to me.

515
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,830
I am not kind to you.

516
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,040
I have no choice.

517
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,310
You may seem fierce,

518
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,920
but...

519
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:15,070
you are a very kind man.

520
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,310
If I have a brother like you,

521
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,310
I won't be afraid anymore.

522
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,070
-What are you afraid of?
-Many things.

523
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,310
I am afraid...

524
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,560
that my mother works too hard,

525
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:34,920
that Wen Bin might die,

526
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,950
that I...

527
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,230
want to throw up.

528
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,750
You can't throw up here.

529
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,000
Easy there.

530
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,840
Are you all right?

531
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,150
Wen Bin, did you drink
in the dormitory...

532
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,600
to celebrate your becoming
the steward of Pufang Dorm?

533
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,710
Step aside.

534
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,680
Lei Ao,

535
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,800
please respect the president.

536
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,560
Let's go.

537
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,800
Why the hurry?

538
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,640
We are not done yet with Wen Bin.

539
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,110
Wen Bin is unwell.

540
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,520
Don't disturb him.

541
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,110
Unwell?

542
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,800
Lei Ao,

543
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,590
you need to learn from Wen Bin how to lie.

544
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,600
He smells of alcohol.

545
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,070
You can't fool us by telling us
he's unwell.

546
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,110
Even if he smells of alcohol,

547
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,520
what can you do?

548
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,760
The academy prohibits students
from bringing alcohol into the dorm.

549
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,110
You should know the rules.

550
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,400
Yun Shang Academy prohibits alcohol,

551
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,480
but it didn't say...

552
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,800
you can't come in drunk.

553
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,680
You mean...

554
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,160
he was drunk before he came in?

555
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,280
But Feng Cheng Jun,

556
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,950
it's not the academy's opening hours.

557
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,400
If he sneaked out to get a drink,

558
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,720
it's also against the rules.

559
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,110
Moreover,

560
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:15,030
compared to bringing
alcohol into the dormitory,

561
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,830
the punishment is heavier.

562
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,800
All of you,

563
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,920
do you want to die?

564
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,080
Lei Ao,

565
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,390
if you consider yourself
a student of the academy,

566
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,800
you must obey the rules.

567
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,270
I am not going to
follow the rules.

568
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,710
What can you do?

569
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,000
Lei Ao,

570
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,620
Wen Bin can't escape this time.

571
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,310
He violated the rules.

572
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,920
So I have the right to exercise
the power of the Council.

573
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,560
If you are not happy about it,

574
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,800
you can hit me.

575
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,590
Calm down.

576
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,230
Fighting over a
small matter like this...

577
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,600
is not worth it.

578
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,920
Yu Le Xuan,

579
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,710
stop interfering.

580
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,110
Everyone knows you are close to him.

581
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,000
If you want to help him,

582
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,070
you must see whether he's worth it.

583
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,430
Don't forget,

584
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,920
you are also a steward of the Council.

585
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,080
Yes.

586
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,350
A steward...

587
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,560
manages things.

588
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,760
I am now...

589
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,350
managing the situation.

590
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,830
I don't want to argue with you.

591
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,960
Search the dorm.

592
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,150
Yes.

593
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,870
You, search over there.

594
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:37,920
Don't you dare!

595
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,710
Today, I, Han Sheng Zhi,

596
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,110
will exercise my power as the president.

597
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,630
Who dares to stop me?

598
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,990
There's something fishy
in Pufang Dorm Two.

599
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,230
School has not reopened.

600
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,420
You have no right to punish us.

601
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,560
Feng Cheng Jun, this has nothing
to do with you.

602
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,110
You'd better don't get involved.

603
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,710
I stay in Pufang Dorm Two, too.

604
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,110
How could I stay out of it?

605
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,949
Since you said it,

606
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,190
Pufang Dorm Two...

607
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,429
must be searched thoroughly.

608
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,679
All right...

609
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,870
It's my fault.

610
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:20,800
Let go.

611
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,120
Fine.

612
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,230
Wen Bin,

613
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:36,230
I'll record today's event and raise it
to the Review and Punishment Board.

614
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:37,230
Let's go.

615
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,150
You are in big trouble.

616
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,760
Let's go.

617
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,110
Oh dear,

618
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,909
how much did he drink?

619
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,280
Where am I?

620
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,840
Brother Feng,

621
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,840
is that really you?

622
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,670
Is that really you?

623
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,080
Little Brother,

624
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
you drank too much.

625
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,910
No, I didn't.

626
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,150
It's never enough when drinking
with a bosom friend.

627
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,190
Don't you think so, Senior?

628
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,360
Come here, Senior.

629
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,630
Give me your hand.

630
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,350
From now onward,

631
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,950
the three of us are friends.

632
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,520
Not three,

633
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,080
but four.

634
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,670
Fine, four it is.

635
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,830
Go to sleep, you're drunk.

636
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,190
Cut the nonsense.

637
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,870
Why am I feeling hot?

638
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,720
Take your clothes off if you're hot.

639
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,600
Take it off.

640
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,070
He isn't used to sleeping without clothes.

641
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,950
Let him be.

642
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,920
Don't look at me.

643
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,430
I don't know anything.

644
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,270
I know very well why he did that.

645
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,470
Wen Bin did it for peace in the dorm.

646
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,710
He had no choice but to buy wine
from Mingren Tavern...

647
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,670
and offer it to the big bully in the dorm.

648
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,590
But news of it leaked out...

649
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,560
and the secretary caught him.

650
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,350
If the the Review and Punishment Board
hears about it,

651
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:39,160
he'll pay a heavy price.

652
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,720
How did Wen Bin know
I like Liquid Gold Wine?

653
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,070
Did you tell him?

654
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,760
I...I didn't know anything.

655
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,790
I didn't create chaos in the dorm.

656
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:52,670
I am off.

657
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,870
You are a heartless guy.

658
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,040
Your little brother
got drunk because of you.

659
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,950
Are you going to leave him like that?

660
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,280
I know,

661
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,840
I'll take care of him.

662
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,380
I'm going to fetch water.

663
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,190
You friend.

664
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,390
You can't drink,

665
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,800
and you have wasted a good wine.
