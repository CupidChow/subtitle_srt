[Episode 7]

4
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,070
You write beautifully, you copy art well,

5
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,210
but why are you so bad at drawing?

6
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,020
Give it back.

7
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,130
Art copying is different from drawing.

8
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,400
What makes it different?

9
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,470
All you do is draw what
you see on the paper.

10
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,480
How about this? Look at me
like I'm a painting.

11
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,240
And copy it on the paper, alright?

12
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,990
It's easy for you to say.

13
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,720
When I copy, I just follow the lines.

14
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,350
But drawing requires observation.

15
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,030
Looking at you like this,

16
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,380
I can't do it.

17
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,210
Lines...

18
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,190
How about this?

19
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,780
Use this tree as a reference
and trace my lines.

20
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,700
I'll give it a try.

21
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,850
Little Brother,

22
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,370
shall we begin?

23
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,300
Yes.

24
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,920
It's done.

25
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,100
Brother, take a look at my painting.

26
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,060
What's wrong with him?
He fell asleep again.

27
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,010
Look at him.

28
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,260
Brother Zhao Hui, switch seats with me.

29
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,610
Switch seats?

30
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:33,950
Did I hear you right?

31
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,409
Yes, you did. I'm genuine and sincere.

32
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,810
Brother Wen Bin,

33
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,260
you're a brave man indeed. Goodbye.

34
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,150
This...

35
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,630
Senior.

36
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,530
Senior! Senior!

37
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,530
Senior...

38
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,970
Leave me alone.

39
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,650
The teacher has arrived!

40
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,290
Today,

41
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,700
we're going to solve this math problem.

42
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,790
Alright, you may start now.

43
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,580
Wen Bin,

44
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,210
it's good that you're
studying hard in secret.

45
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,700
Even though no one does better
than you in arithmetic,

46
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,300
you need to focus on your current class.

47
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,659
Do you think it's funny?

48
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,260
Lei Ze Xin,

49
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,780
I heard you once attacked
a teacher in class.

50
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,930
You're not going to do it again, are you?

51
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,620
That's what I thought.

52
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,250
Wen Bin,

53
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,790
I know that...

54
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,730
you have poor drawing skills.

55
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,490
I know a thing or two about the subject.

56
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,290
After class,

57
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,620
come to Diligence Pavilion.

58
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,330
I'll give you a remedial lesson
one-to-one.

59
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,230
Don't worry.

60
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,860
Why doesn't it work?

61
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,880
Don't I look like a bad student?

62
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,420
Little Brother, what are you doing?

63
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,060
Nothing.

64
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,250
Why haven't you been studying
with me these few days?

65
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,970
Did I do something wrong?

66
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,820
No, don't take it personally.

67
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,470
I have other plans.

68
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,170
What happened?

69
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,290
What is Wen Bin wearing?

70
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,060
I think Wen Bin looks quite cool.

71
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,760
He looks ridiculous.

72
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,780
I agree.

73
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,250
Come on, let's go.

74
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,660
Wen Bin, you...

75
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,890
What do you think?
Do I look like a bad student?

76
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,640
Not bad enough.

77
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,590
Do you want to die...

78
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,160
Or am I tired of living?

79
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,940
It rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?

80
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,700
What are you doing?

81
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,110
I am learning from you.

82
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,060
Wen Bin,

83
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,420
has Pufang Dorm Two driven you insane?

84
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,400
Although you're my junior,

85
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,830
but if you keep tagging along,

86
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,420
I'll spare you no mercy.

87
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,360
Senior, please take me as your disciple.

88
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,750
I am already your senior.
How can I be your master?

89
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,580
Since you're my senior,

90
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,230
let me tag along with you.

91
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,830
You'll be expelled if you follow me.

92
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,750
Aren't you afraid?

93
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,130
No, of course not.

94
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,660
Such a reckless fool.

95
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,680
Senior,

96
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,400
I'm willing to do anything
to come along with you.

97
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,690
Can you hit him, then?

98
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,780
Wait here.

99
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,050
Lin Bing Shen.

100
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,300
If it isn't the popular Wen...

101
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,370
What are you doing?

102
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,680
-What's wrong?
-Wen Bin just hit him.

103
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,090
Are you insane?

104
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,450
How dare you?

105
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,620
Do you want to die or are you tired
of living? Fool.

106
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,930
Wen Bin, you're so cool.

107
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,130
You're cool.

108
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,800
He's annoyed me for too long.

109
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,050
How dare you hit me?

110
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,210
Are you satisfied now?

111
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,070
Wait...

112
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,910
He just received a letter from home.

113
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,220
His parents are sick.

114
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,850
How could you, at such a time...

115
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,510
I didn't know.

116
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,150
-Jerk!
-How could he hit him?

117
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,600
-What was he thinking?
-You call yourself a scholar?

118
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,780
He's gone too far.

119
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,250
He's way out of line.

120
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,220
Well?

121
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,690
Do you still want to be a bad student?

122
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,660
You're different from me.

123
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,090
Being a good student suits you more.

124
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,860
You're not me, and I'm not you.

125
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,650
Only I know what's best for me.

126
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,600
I have my reasons.

127
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,610
Brother Ze Xin,

128
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,450
can I have a word with you?

129
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,090
You and Wen Bin are not same

130
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,330
You father is the Commander.

131
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,180
Wen Bin is a student
from a poor family.

132
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,430
He has a mother...

133
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,130
and a sister that requires his care.

134
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,750
If he is expelled,

135
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,340
his future would be ruined.

136
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,180
You are saying that...

137
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,910
only Yun Shang can give him
a bright future?

138
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,100
I dare not assume.

139
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,610
But the way I see it,

140
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,610
graduating from Yun Shang Academy...

141
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,260
and taking up an official post
is the best option for him.

142
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,420
That's ridiculous

143
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,540
You're not him.

144
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,420
Who are you to decide what's best?

145
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,120
How do you know...

146
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,420
Wen Bin doesn't have a different ambition?

147
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,170
How do you know...

148
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,890
he won't be able to provide for his
family otherwise?

149
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,360
Then Brother Ze Xin,

150
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,860
what makes you think he would
have a better life out there?

151
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,370
Writing for the black market,

152
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,370
and living in fear every day?

153
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,490
What are you trying to say?

154
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,540
I just hope that...

155
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,900
you won't lead Wen Bin astray.

156
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,490
Are you lecturing me?

157
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,490
Not lecturing.

158
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,250
Just advising.

159
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,050
What a reckless fool.

160
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,610
Junior,

161
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,260
I've decided to bring you along.

162
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,310
I'm going out for a drink.
Are you coming?

163
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,290
-You bet.
-Let's go.

164
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,200
You can't go.

165
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,630
I want to.

166
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,780
I said...

167
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,010
you can't go.

168
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,540
Just stay out of this.

169
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,800
Come on.

170
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,540
Wen Bin,

171
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,570
are you threatened by anyone?

172
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,370
You can tell me if you're in any trouble.

173
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,180
Threatened?

174
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,450
Are you saying that
I threatened Junior?

175
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,700
Even if I did, what can you do about it?

176
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,900
Threatened?

177
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,500
I want to go with Senior
because I admire him.

178
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,420
Wen Bin,

179
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,700
do you know what you're doing?

180
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,930
Do you want to waste your opportunity
at Yun Shang Academy?

181
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,370
Opportunity?

182
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,870
Studying here was not my intention at all.

183
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,180
You have no idea how miserable I've been.

184
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,780
Mr. Feng, be strict with yourself
but lenient to others.

185
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,250
Don't impose your beliefs on others.
Let's go.

186
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,560
Could I be making a mistake?

187
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,010
One, two, three.

188
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,920
It's so lively here.

189
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,490
Check out our floral cloth.

190
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,220
Little knick knacks, little trinkets.

191
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,920
Let's go over there.

192
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,250
Sure, let's go.

193
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,020
-Goodbye.
-Take a look.

194
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,200
Why are you behaving like a girl,

195
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,110
taking interest in these knick knacks?

196
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,460
You are being boring.

197
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,820
Anyone, be it boy or girl,

198
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,550
would be attracted
by these knick knacks.

199
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,930
I think...

200
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,930
this suits you.

201
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,690
I don't want it.

202
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,860
-Let's go.
-Look around.

203
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,630
-I'm thirsty.
-Have fun.

204
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,740
Young Lady,

205
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,270
-it's late now.
-Sir, enjoy your drink.

206
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,850
Mr. Feng probably won't come.

207
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,420
There goes my chance encounter today.

208
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,800
-Have a seat.
-What do you think?

209
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,510
The song is nice, right?

210
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,780
It's interesting.

211
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,010
-I like it.
-What would you like?

212
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,370
-We'll have the usual.
-Got it.

213
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,360
Do they have money
to pay for their drinks?

214
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,640
Hush, Young Lady. Don't say that.

215
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,830
They might hear you.

216
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,300
I'm just saying.

217
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,530
Look at that scholar.

218
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,810
He looks so handsome.

219
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,260
But his clothes are sloppy.

220
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,020
Don't drink too much this time.

221
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,010
Or you might throw up
on someone again.

222
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,380
I won't. Last time was an accident.

223
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,860
Your wine.

224
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,190
-One more jug.
-And cups.

225
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,610
Got it.

226
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,050
I say, this girl looks pretty.

227
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,500
Come here, give me a hug.

228
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,420
-My daughter.
-Give me a hug.

229
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:15,130
I'll give this money to you as reward.

230
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,380
Come on...

231
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,119
-What are you doing?
-Come on.

232
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,780
What are you doing? Stop it.

233
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,980
Father!

234
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,540
You are way out of line!

235
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,430
Don't hit my father! Let go of me!

236
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,130
-What are you doing?
-Not so fast...

237
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,980
Sir.

238
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,360
Young Lady, they are fighting.
Let's leave now.

239
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,750
This man can fight.

240
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,370
Young Lady, let's go now.

241
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,340
Quick, let's go.

242
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,310
Mister, nice moves.

243
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,690
Young Lady.

244
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,860
Father, are you alright?

245
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,340
Thank you.

246
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,810
Watch out!

247
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,560
-This is my heirloom Wine God Statue.
-Are you alright?

248
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,440
I'm fine.

249
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,220
Are you two scholars of Yun Shang?

250
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,690
Don't you walk away from this.
Pay for my statue.

[Yun Shang Academy]

252
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,180
Keep this student tag.
I'll pay you tomorrow.

253
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,160
Let's go.

254
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,110
Stop there.

255
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,370
Pay for my statue.

256
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,480
You've searched high and low,

257
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:48,060
yet your true love lies right in front
of your nose.

258
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,330
Young Lady,

259
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,670
your prophecy says that...

260
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:57,130
someone is deeply in love with you.

261
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,040
Really?

262
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,250
Why?

263
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,600
Are you doubting my fortune telling
abilities?

264
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,580
No...

265
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,070
I was just overwhelmed.

266
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,400
And...

267
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,770
I don't know whether the person I like...

268
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,830
likes me back.

269
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,900
Ordinary people like you...

270
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,130
are so woefully susceptible
to the shackles of love.

271
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,170
But...

272
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,490
-you've come to the right person today.
-Give it to me.

273
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,180
You have to help me.

274
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,580
Young Lady,

275
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,190
sew this prophecy into a pouch.

276
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,540
And give it to the man you like.

277

[Good Fortune]

278
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:43,650
I guarantee that you two
will end up together.

279
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,220
That's great.

280
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,310
Thank you.

281
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,890
Young Lady, we can finally stop waiting
for a rabbit by a tree stump.

282
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,470
Mr Feng isn't a rabbit.

283
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,930
You're right.

284
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,160
We can finally stop...

285
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,780
waiting for Mr. Feng.

286
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,860
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

287
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,640
Come on.

288
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,940
Let's hear what you have to say this time.

289
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,900
-Are you...
-Senior,

290
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,100
sit back and relax.

291
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,400
I'll handle this.

292
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,520
President, hear me out.

293
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,300
Wen Bin, have you been drinking again?

294
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,970
At least this time you're honest.

295
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,460
Stay where you are.

296
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,230
We can talk at a distance.

297
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,030
Are you scared of getting puked on?

298
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,290
Don't worry.

299
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,750
I'm not drunk... this time.

300
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,250
Wen Bin,

301
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,030
the semester just started,

302
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,660
yet you've already broken a slew of rules.

303
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,760
Aren't you afraid of getting expelled?

304
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,730
I'm not.

305
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,290
When are you going to do it?

306
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,920
I'll be very grateful.

307
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,370
President, be careful.

308
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,240
You can't trust him.

309
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,300
He looks extremely intoxicated.

310
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,660
Wen Bin,

311
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:16,070
I have something I need
to verify with you.

312
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,960
Go ahead.

313
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,430
Did you hit Lin Bing Shen?

314
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,430
I didn't.

315
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,240
Wen Bin, as a man of dignity,
you shouldn't lie.

316
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,700
I really didn't.

317
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,340
I merely kicked him ruthlessly.

318
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,320
Listen to him.

319
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,240
Great. He admitted.

320
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,250
Note it down.

321
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,460
President,

322
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,050
I got into a fight tonight, too.

323
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,080
I taught two bullies a lesson.

324
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,580
Good.

325
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,730
Very good.

326
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,780
Wen Bin,

327
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,780
you did well tonight.

328
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,700
Go back and rest.

329
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,550
Senior, come on.

330
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,010
You little rascal,

331
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,770
you really want to leave Yun Shang?

332
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,180
I don't belong here.

333
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,010
Never did, never will.

334
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,770
That question?

335
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,730
I didn't get it, either.

336
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,090
Ask God.

337
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,980
Which one of you got drunk
at Mingren Tavern last night...

338
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,250
and broke a statue?

339
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,810
Come forward and admit it.

340
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,250
-Who would do that?
-The innkeeper is here right now,

341
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,750
making a scene at the gate.

342
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,250
The nerve of some people.

343
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,240
-Where's he?
-Where's he?

344
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,240
-Please calm down.
-Look, everyone.

345
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,170
He smashed my heirloom Wine God Statue.

346
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,250
And all he left was a message
and a stupid tag.

347
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:14,040
I can't believe a person like
that is a scholar of Yun Shang.

348
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,360
What a disgraceful scholar!
What a terrible academy!

349
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,980
-Hand him over.
-Hand him over.

350
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,460
-Hand him over.
-Rest assured.

351
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,080
If that person is proved to
be student of our academy,

352
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,620
we'll impose severe punishment.

353
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,250
The tag is mine.

354
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,780
I smashed the Wine God Statue.

355
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,880
-Was it them?
-What are you doing?

356
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,390
Yes! It was him!

357
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,190
It was them!

358
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,100
I can't believe it was you, Wen Bin.

359
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,240
But he looks so polite and gentle.

360
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,370
Yeah.

361
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,520
Please calm down.

362
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,020
We'll look into this
with the utmost impartiality.

363
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,610
Wen Bin,

364
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,180
I'm disappointed in you.

365
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,820
Go to the Review and Punishment Board...

366
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,220
and await your fate.

367
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,990
Have you gone mad, Junior?

368
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,070
What are you doing?

369
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,310
Did Wen Bin really do that?

370
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,780
No, it was me.

371
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,580
Why did you take the blame?

372
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,790
What if you get expelled?

373
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,070
I'm fine with that.

374
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,010
I don't want to waste my time here anyway.

375
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,830
Do you know that once expelled,

376
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,730
you'll be forever barred...

377
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,330
from holding office...

378
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,600
or enrolling in another academy.

379
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,050
You can't even become a
secretary for the government.

380
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,580
Is that what you want?

381
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,140
I'll be blacklisted forever?

382
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,260
Wen Bin,

383
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,520
first you hit a classmate,
now you're involved in this?

384
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,130
You've committed every offense
in the book.

385
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:33,820
Cherish your last moments in Yun Shang.

386
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,780
But it's no pity.

387
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,250
An unruly person like you...

388
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,150
doesn't belong in Yun Shang Academy.

389
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,260
Come with me to the Review
and Punishment Board.

390
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,850
[No. I mustn't be blacklisted.]

391
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,380
[What would Wen Bin do
if they blacklisted his name?]

392
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,520
Lei Ao, you've gone too far this time.

393
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,950
What do you know?

394
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,300
Wen Bin is innocent.

395
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,020
That means Wen Bin took the blame for you?

396
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,430
That little fool,

397
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,970
I don't understand him.

398
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,280
Such a pity.

399
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,010
One of you has to be expelled now.

400
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,580
Are you challenging me?

401
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,850
Who knew that the highly principled
Feng Cheng Jun...

402
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,900
would lose his cool, too?

403
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,970
I'm clear-headed, Yu Le Xuan.

404
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,970
Please excuse us for a moment.

405
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,250
I need to speak to him in private.

406
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,170
If you want to talk,

407
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,010
talk calmly like civilised men.

408
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,700
Am I right?

409
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,420
Lei Ze Xin,

410
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,790
I knew you never wanted to be here.

411
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,440
But why did you implicate Wen Bin?

412
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,210
Like Junior said before,
he doesn't belong here.

413
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,650
Little Brother cares about money.

414
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,170
He must've known that
the statue is valuable.

415
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,880
I don't believe he would smash it.

416
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,490
It was you.

417
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,440
You made a scene at the tavern
and got him into trouble.

418
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,700
How dare you challenge me?

419
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,520
For Wen Bin's sake,

420
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,970
I'll let you off this time.

421
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,050
But if you do it again,

422
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,970
I won't let you off easily.

423
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,060
Listen here,

424
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,580
if you lead Wen Bin into mischief again,

425
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,660
I won't let you off, either.

426
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,790
Are you aware that once he's expelled
from Yun Shang Academy,

427
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:00,300
he'll be blacklisted?

428
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,370
Not only will Wen Bin be forbidden
to go to school,

429
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,780
he'll be barred from holding office.

430
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,300
Mr. Li,

431
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,290
these are all of Wen Bin's misconducts.

432
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,280
Since Wen Bin acknowledged that
wild boy, Lei Ze Xin as his senior,

433
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,410
all his victims had to suffer in silence.

434
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,730
You may go.

435
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,600
Yes.

436
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,650
I've been wanting to clear things
up with you.

437
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,520
Why have you been avoiding me?

438
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,180
Well, there's nothing left
to clear up now.

439
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,340
I just want to ask you,

440
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,020
do you really want to leave the academy?

441
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
If that's what you want,

442
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,770
I can grant your wish right now.

443
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,830
I don't want to.

444
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,900
You don't want to?

445
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,100
Does your action make sense, then?

446
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:14,830
Mr. Li,

447
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,300
please give me a chance to redeem myself.

448
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,780
Principal Feng will make
the decision on this matter.

449
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,660
Raising a ruckus at the tavern,

450
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,980
breaking the owner's Wine God Statue,

451
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,520
which has been passed down for
several generations,

452
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,120
and causing the tavern owner...

453
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,580
to make a scene in the academy
early in the morning.

454
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,970
If word of this gets out,

455
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:44,370
it would be a humiliation
to Yun Shang Academy.

456
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,060
Wen Bin,

457
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,860
are you trying to drive me mad?

458
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,460
Principal Feng, please stay calm.

459
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,910
Wen Bin used to be a good student,

460
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,410
yet he trashed a tavern
in just a few days.

461
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,680
He must be under bad influence.

462
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,420
What do you mean by that?

463
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,950
I'm saying it was all
because of Lei Ze Xin.

464
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,580
Lei Ze Xin is incorrigible.
He should be punished severely.

465
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:16,850
Wen Bin,

466
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,940
do you have anything to say?

467
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,100
Principal Feng, Mr. Ding, Mr. Li,

468
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,230
it's not what you think.

469
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,130
Last night, Senior and I...

470
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,650
caused a ruckus trying to save someone.

471
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,120
We meant no harm.

472
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,180
Even if you were trying to save someone,

473
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,480
going out for drinks at night...

474
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,550
is still a violation of academy rules.

475
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,730
You've tarnished the academy's name!

476
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,090
Wen Bin,

477
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,900
tell us now.

478
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,730
Was it you or Lei Ze Xin
who broke the statue?

479
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,660
It was me.

480
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,850
Principal Feng,

481
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,150
please make a decision regarding
Lei Ze Xin and Wen Bin.

482
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,210
Expulsion. Expel them both.

483
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,580
Principal Feng,

484
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:08,130
expelling them without getting
to the truth...

485
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,210
Isn't it a bit rash?

486
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,250
Rash?

487
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:16,300
Wen Bin violated the rules by
leaving the academy at night.

488
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,240
Drinking at a tavern,

489
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,240
brawling,

490
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,180
vandalizing other people's property.

491
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,250
He admitted to every single one
of these offenses.

492
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,370
And you call my decision rash?

493
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,620
It's true that Wen Bin hasn't
been performing well lately.

494
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,730
But he wasn't an
ill-natured student before.

495
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,700
Why would he get into a fight
with others all of sudden?

496
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,360
Wen Bin's exploits at the tavern
are perfectly clear.

497
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,090
The facts are all there.

498
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,820
There's nothing more to say.

499
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,820
There's no point risking Yun Shang's
reputation for students like him.

500
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,780
Expel them immediately.

501
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,610
Principal Feng,

502
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,170
the expulsion of Lei Ze Xin
is unquestionable.

503
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,820
But as for Wen Bin,

504
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,460
Wen Bin was personally recommended
by Master Wang.

505
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,340
He can be considered a
one-in-a-million talent.

506
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,740
Since he came here, he had picked up
drinking and fighting.

507
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,060
Considering the way that he turned out,

508
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:32,170
shouldn't all of us, as teachers,
take responsibility for that?

509
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,380
Fine, then.

510
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,050
To be fair,

511
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,890
we'll let all the teachers and students...

512
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:47,150
of Yun Shang Academy vote on it.

513
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,050
Are you really not going to salvage
the situation?

514
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,860
How do I salvage it?

515
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,540
You're so annoying.

516
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,540
Senior,

517
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,720
how can you sleep?

518
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,060
Do you know we are going to get expelled?

519
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,460
I'm fine with that.

520
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,010
No way.

521
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,130
Once we are expelled,

522
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,510
our names will be blacklisted forever.

523
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,850
What's gotten into you?

524
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,620
You were so excited during that fight
last night.

525
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,850
A fight?

526
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,280
Did you really participate
in the fight last night?

527
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,700
I wonder what a pale-faced scholar like
you looks like in a fight.

528
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,210
I would really like to see it.

529
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:39,050
He was remarkable.

530
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,250
Was he that awesome?

531
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,180
Stop making fun of me.

532
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,860
We are in big trouble now.
Why are you still so relaxed?

533
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:48,000
Le Xuan, aren't you close friends
with Brother Lei?

534
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,660
Aren't you worried he'll be expelled?

535
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,850
I am more worried about you than I am worried about him.

536
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:01,420
A good boy like you
shouldn't be blacklisted.

537
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,490
Principal Feng is calling for a vote
from the entire academy.

538
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,010
We are going to be expelled for sure.

539
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,850
If that's the case,

540
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,290
I have an idea.

541
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,210
President.

542
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,550
[The kudzu vine]

543
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,460
You look so happy today.

544
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,420
What's the good news?

545
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,900
Principal Feng appointed us...

546
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,710
to collect the votes...

547
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:41,130
on Wen Bin and Lei Ze Xin's expulsion.

548
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,090
They've done it this time.

549
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,190
[Flourishes]

550
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,250
Spread the word...

551
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,980
that the two of them have misbehaved,

552
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,540
violating the academy's rules
time and again.

553
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,210
If we don't punish them severely,

554
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,890
our academy's rules would become
a laughing stock.

555
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,520
Urge everyone to vote...

556
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,290
for their expulsion.

557
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,250
Brother Zi Feng, let me give you hand.

558
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,350
I'm good at watering flowers.

559
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,570
Brother Wen Bin, you're too kind.

560
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,370
Here, let me do it.

561
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,860
It's okay.

562
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,290
-I can't believe it.
-This is ridiculous.

563
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,940
Out with Lei Ze Xin!

564
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:32,900
Well said.

565
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,120
-Sign here, then.
-Sure.

566
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,610
But...

567
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,090
Wen Bin can't leave.

568
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,350
What did I tell you?

569
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,860
Why are you so stubborn?

570
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,739
I...

571
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,450
What a waste of time.

572
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,570
Brother Yi De,

573
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,410
I'll help you with the ink.

574
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm good at this.

575
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,780
It's okay, Brother Wen Bin, really.

576
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,490
It's fine.

577
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,190
I was doing it for fun.

578
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,590
I'm done now.

579
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,500
Goodbye.

580
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,900
Please vote for Wen Bin
and Lei Ze Xin's expulsion.

581
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,850
How many have signed?

582
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,210
Half of the students at the superior room.

583
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,580
Others are observing.

584
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,230
They'll make up their mind soon.

585
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,900
As to this matter...

586
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,500
I'm rather torn.

587
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,260
I need some enlightenment...

588
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,290
from God.

589
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,450
Brother Zhao Rong.

590
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,350
Wen Bin.

591
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,740
Hey.

592
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:13,840
Do you need help?

593
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,080
No...

594
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,590
Wen Bin, I'm really sorry about this.

595
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,020
You've made such huge mistake this time,

596
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:24,270
I have to take your place as the
steward of Pufang Dorm.

597
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,870
I hope you don't mind.

598
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,470
I don't.

599
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,380
The job was yours in the first place.

600
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,390
Never mind.

601
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,350
When the dust has settled,

602
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,140
I'll return this job to you.

603
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,370
I've lost my chance.

604
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,920
Wen Bin.

605
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,470
Do you know...

606
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:49,050
why everyone is unwilling
to help you this time?

607
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,260
Because your name is put together
with Lei Ao's in the petition.

608
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,940
That's why everyone...

609
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,900
Do you know what I mean?

610
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,970
You are saying...

611
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,770
because of Brother Lei,

612
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,050
everyone is unwilling to help me?

613
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,660
It's possible.

614
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,850
Because everyone wants him
gone from Yun Shang Academy.

615
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,190
Unfortunately,

616
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,940
his unpopularity...

617
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,620
will be your downfall.
