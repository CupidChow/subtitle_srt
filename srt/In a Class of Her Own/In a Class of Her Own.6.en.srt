00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,880
[In A Class of Her Own]

3
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,920
[Episode 6]

4
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,450
You are awake.

5
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,650
Fortunately, you drank the
Liquid Gold Wine.

6
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,950
Otherwise, you would have severe headache.

7
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,680
Didn't you promise not to
make things difficult for Brother Feng?

8
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,280
Why did you go back on
your own words?

9
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,720
Junior.

10
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,890
Listen to my advice, don't mingle with
people like Feng Cheng Jun.

11
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,210
It's not beneficial to you.

12
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,210
I don't need anything from him.

13
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,480
I only know that he cares about me
and he helps me a lot.

14
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,960
He is a kind person.

15
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,570
Senior, not every high-born scholar
is as bad as what we imagine.

16
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,530
Not only Brother Feng,

17
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,250
there are still many outstanding
high-born scholar in our school.

18
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,079
You have to learn to understand them
and accept them, just like me.

19
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,970
I don't have the time.

20
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,320
You look up to him so much.

21
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,720
If you're a girl,

22
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,050
you would marry him at all cost.

23
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,329
What are you saying?

24
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,770
Fortunately, you are not a girl.

25
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,290
Otherwise, you would be doomed.

26
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,010
Your society status
is nothing close to his.

27
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,370
Those good things that he did for you...

28
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,240
prove that he is a hypocrite.

29
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,050
You are saying Brother Feng
is a hypocrite?

30
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,240
You are no different from them!

31
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,840
You bully the weak
just because you are strong.

32
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,800
Do you really think you can
afford to challenge him?

33
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,320
Do you really think that
you are stronger than him?

34
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,150
Do you really think you can satisfy your
vanity and sense of accomplishment?

35
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,760
If you really think that
you are outstanding,

36
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,640
you should work hard
to surpass them in the academic.

37
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,480
Make those who belittle you realise that
they are not on par with you.

38
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,760
That is being powerful for real.

39
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,600
That is the real challenge.

40
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,250
Are you teaching me a lesson?

41
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,290
Of course!

42
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,730
I am teaching a person who
goes back on his own words a lesson.

43
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,050
Are you still feeling drunk?

44
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,010
You're the drunk one !

45
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,690
Are you digging your own grave...

46
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,170
Or making a death wish, right?

47
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,440
I'm telling you , I want neither of those !

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,680
How do I end up with someone
who is not afraid of death at all?

49
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,880
Senior, look!

50
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,000
The weather is so good tonight.

51
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,690
Senior.

52
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,730
I am sorry for misunderstanding you.

53
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,180
You vomited on him.

54
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,570
I feel disgusted when I saw him.

55
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,240
Of course I have to chase him out.

56
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,320
I think the abacus lesson is great.

57
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
We are told to remember many things in
other classes. I can't remember a thing.

58
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,770
-I love medical lesson the most.
-The article that he mentioned...

59
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,490
-I think the lesson is useful.
-I have read it.

60
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,930
I shall show it to you.

61
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,090
Let's go.

62
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,240
I have some information.

63
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,650
What information is that?

64
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,490
With regard to the incident
where you got drunk...

65
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,080
our senior has reported it to
Review and Punishment Hall.

66
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,640
I thought something serious happened.

67
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,690
Only this?

68
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,170
I will accept the punishment.

69
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,200
Has no one ever told you that...

70
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,690
the person in charge of
Review and Punishment Hall is Mr. Li Hu?

71
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,050
Mr. Li Hu?

72
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:14,930
Yes.

73
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,530
Li Hu means the powerful tiger.

74
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,330
When he gets mad,

75
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,770
he will make you burst into tears...

76
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,450
and scream in pain.

77
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,930
I only made a mistake by getting drunk.
Is he going to punish me to death?

78
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,970
Don't try to scare me.

79
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,290
If you really think so,

80
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:33,930
I wish you best of luck.

81
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,850
Let me introduce myself.

82
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,090
I am the person in charge of
the Review and Punishment Hall.

83
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,520
I am also the teacher
who teaches laws and decrees.

84
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,690
My name is Li Hu.

85
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,130
[So much for being the powerful tiger.]

86
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,920
[He is nothing more than a smiling tiger.]

87
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,250
What is wrong?

88
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,450
I didn't receive any response
from all of you.

89
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,410
Are you nervous?

90
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,610
Don't be nervous.

91
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,410
When you attend my class,
you can be relax.

92
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,210
You only have to take note of a principle.

93
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,410
Everything has to be logical.

94
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,650
If you can do that,

95
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,930
nothing else is important.

96
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,650
You can do whatever you want/

97
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,240
[The State Code of Yun]

98
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,690
This is the book of laws and decrees
that you are going to study.

99
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,850
It's known as "The State Code of Yun".

100
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,330
It comprises the history, legal system...

101
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:45,210
and the description of the official ranks
in the state of Yun.

102
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,090
You have to memorise
all of the contents...

103
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,570
so that you can ascertain
the direction and target in your life.

104
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,690
Mo Xiao Huan.

105
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,080
What do you think of
"The State Code of Yun"?

106
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,690
-No.
-Why are you pulling a long face then?

107
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,210
In reply to that,

108
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,120
I look like this when I am happy.

109
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:15,730
I can only say that
your expression is not logical at all.

110
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,720
Don't go yet after the class.

111
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,850
We have to work on your expression, okay?

112
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,050
I think you know it well.

113
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,450
In order to become an official,

114
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,490
you have to score full marks.

115
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,250
At Yun Shang Academy,

116
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,840
you need to score nobility mark too.

117
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,120
-Nobility mark?
-What is that?

118
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,690
I am going to elaborate...

119
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,850
what kind of behaviour...

120
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,050
will cause demerit of nobility mark.

121
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,690
Firstly,

122
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,370
those who wake up late,
those who skip breakfast...

123
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,680
those who come back late
or those who drink and cause chaos,

124
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,570
would be demerited ten nobility marks.

125
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,210
I also need to tell you
something that is very important.

126
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,400
Each demerit of nobility marks...

127
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,850
means deduction of ten taels
from your monthly salary.

128
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,810
That's because the academy
will not feed those who misbehave.

129
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,040
I think I will lose money
instead of getting paid.

130
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,530
You must be Wen Bin, right?

131
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,200
How do you know my name, sir?

132
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,930
Not only I know your name,

133
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,970
the glorious deeds you did
after you got drunk...

134
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,330
have been playing on my mind.

135
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,370
You are indeed capable.

136
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,250
The semester has not even
started officially...

137
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,370
and you have been demerited
ten nobility marks.

138
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,010
That's incredible.

139
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,110
When the time is right,
we shall further discuss about it...

140
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,990
to clear your debt.

141
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,450
I shall listen to you.

142
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,049
In order to become an official,

143
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,010
regardless how outstanding
you are in studies,

144
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,400
if you are not noble,

145
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,610
you are not qualified
to become an official.

146
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:54,210
Mr. Li, if all of our nobility marks
are deducted,

147
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,010
what kind of punishment we will receive
from the Review and Punishment Board?

148
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,730
That is a good question.

149
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,050
They deserve to be punished.
What punishment?

150
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,570
They will get beaten on the palm.

151
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,050
Those who have committed
a serious crime...

152
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,690
would be expelled right away.

153
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,730
Expelled?

154
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,360
Lei Ze Xin is not here again?

155
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,940
[Think]

156
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,450
People like him will be
punished really soon.

157
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:23,850
You must have exhausted from the long day.

158
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,170
Yes, I have been working
for the whole day.

159
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,730
Come, have some water.

160
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,610
Excuse me.

161
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,520
May I know where is
Mr. Xue Ding Kun house?

162
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,920
-I have no idea.
-I have no idea.

163
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,330
This is the place.

164

Does Mr. Xue have any next of kin?

165
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,160
It's too much.

166
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,850
I lost 100 taels just because
I drank three gulps.

167
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,120
I don't think I will be able
to save up this month.

168
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,520
It's easier to make money
out of the school.

169
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,600
Are you thinking about making money
from somewhere else?

170
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,640
You can talk to me.

171
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,800
The jobs you give me are too scary.

172
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,960
I don't dare take it.

173
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,640
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

174
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,370
You have to take risk to earn big money.

175
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,400
Don't forget that...

176
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,920
I paid for the Liquid Gold Wine
that you drank.

177
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,760
You have the cheek to say that.

178
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,040
If it wasn't for your bad idea,
I wouldn't be this miserable.

179
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,240
Miserable?

180
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,360
How miserable can you be?

181
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,680
I got demerited
ten nobility marks by Mr. Li.

182
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,270
I also lost 100 taels because of that.

183
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,760
Look.

184
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,890
It has been sorted out.

00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,320
Look.

186
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,970
Mr. Li is not as scary as you described.

187
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,050
He is so friendly to the freshmen.

188
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,520
Look!

He looks as if he is laughing
when he is actually crying.

Come.

-Come here.
-Me?

Hi, Cheng Jun.

204
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,640
Wen Bin, you are now
the steward of Regular Dorm.

205
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,350
You should announce it.

206
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,650
I know nothing about it.

207
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,090
You should do it, senior.

208
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,760
I shall do it for you.

209
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,680
Dear classmates,

210
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,010
the official teacher respecting ceremony
will be held tomorrow.

211
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,560
After attending the ceremony,

212
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,090
you will officially become one of
the scholars at Yun Shang Academy...

213
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,850
and your studies will begin officially.

214
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,520
Therefore, I have to trouble you all...

215
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,680
to prepare six presents for our teachers.

216
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,560
-That's your mission of the day.
-Six presents.

217
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,360
What does that mean?

218
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,280
Senior, what does six presents mean?

219
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,240
The teacher respecting ceremony
which will be held tomorrow...

220
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,400
is a similar ceremony which
you attended at private school.

221
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,560
Six presents means...

222
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,560
celery, lotus seed,

223
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,170

-your hard work.

-let me know.
-the painstakingly effort of the teachers.

230
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,440
-No need, I have money.
-As for red mung bean,

231
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,480
it means good fortunes.

232
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,160
Red date brings blessing to students
so that they pass their exam.

233
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,890
Dried longan symbolises
completion and satisfaction.

234
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,930
Lean pork is given because
our teachers are gluttons.

No.

236
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,960
It is a token of appreciation
from the students.

The composition is exquisite.

00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,800
-The colour is vibrant.
-It's so special.

291
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,040
It must be drawn by a master.

292
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,930
-You are right.
-Drawing like this...

293
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,170
is not common.

294
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,530
I wonder who would get the drawing.

295
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,040
There are many people.

296
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,050

Look.

298
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,770
Look, this stroke
is the highlight of the drawing.

299
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,170
Obviously, this drawing
was drawn by Mr. Ren.

300
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,089
How old was he?

301
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,000
I mean Ren Bi Shu.

302
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,640
He was 36 years old.

Miss, don't get impatient.

304
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,480
Ren Bi Shu died at such a young age.

305
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:28,119
His calligraphy and drawing
has a sense of...

306
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,560
Why is that so difficult to memorise?

307
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,920
Miss, since it is hard to memorise,

308
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,990
we shall forget about it.

309
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,230
It's just a drawing.

310
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,120
No way.

311
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,640
What if someone asks me about it...

312
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,600
but I can't answer the question?
That would be really embarrassing.

313
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,260
I bet you are just worried that
you would embarrass yourself...

314

320
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,250
You must be exhausted from study.

I haven't started studying.

322
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,210
I am here to get presents
for my teacher...

323
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,800
as I will be attending
the teacher respecting ceremony.

324

Why do you look so pale?

325
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,440
Learning to get along with people
is even more tiring than studying.

00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,960
Not doubt getting along with people...

327
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,520
is a deep knowledge.

328
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,570
However, you should...

329
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,610
mingle more often with the
officials and the nobles...

330
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,320
as a preparation to become
an official in the future.

331
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,760
You are so thoughtful.

332
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,320
However, my alcohol tolerance is a joke.

333
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,600
I am totally unskilled
in social intercourse.

334
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,640
I got drunk the day before
and got into a big trouble.

335
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,000
Mister, to be honest...

336
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,810
Mister,

337
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,290
I have a magical potion.

338
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,890
I can guarantee that
after drinking the potion,

339
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,250
you can drink
a thousand glasses of wine...

340
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,680
and never get drunk.

341
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,130
Are you serious?

342
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,930
I have to attend important events
and performances regularly.

343
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,560
Drinking is inevitable.

344
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,280
But I don't want to be taken advantage of
by the officials and high-born men.

345
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,360
Therefore, I tried to find
this medicine at all cost.

346
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,570
To be honest,

347
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,250
after consuming the medicine,

348
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,010
I defeated everyone
who drank together with me.

349
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,330
Do you still have the medicine?

350
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,160
Just keep some of the medicine with you
for unexpected needs.

351
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,570
I couldn't be more grateful.

352
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,120
Mister, if you make a rise in the future,

353
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,760
these helps from me are
nothing but trifles.

354
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,080
-Mister, look.
-It's drawn by Mr. Ren Bi Shu...

355
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,280
when he was cultivating
at Qi Lin Mountain.

356
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,960
Miss, look!

357
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,240
It's Mr. Feng.

358
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,040
He was as mysterious as a magical beast.

359
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,570
We are meant to meet each other.

360
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,450
Bumping into each other twice
is the best kind of destiny.

361
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,490
That's right.

362
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,640
Both of you are destined to be together.

363
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,410
All right, let's begin the auction.

364
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,160
One thousand and two hundred.

365
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,680
One thousand and four hundred.

366
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,400
The chance is hard to come by.

367
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,600
One thousand and six hundred.

368
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,080
Anyone else?

369
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,650
The guest at the private room
is offering two thousand.

370
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,850
Two thousand and two hundred.
Anyone would like to offer more?

371
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,640
It's a long bell ringing means
an increment of five hundred.

372
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,920
Two thousand and seven hundred.
Anyone else would like to offer more?

373
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,360
Three thousand and two hundred.

374
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,840
-Anyone would like to offer more?
-Three thousand and two hundred?

375
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,080
Three thousand and seven hundred.

376
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,280
Three thousand and seven hundred. Is there
anyone who would like to offer more?

377
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,890
Three thousand and seven hundred. Is there
anyone who would like to offer more?

378
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:51,930
Three thousand and seven hundred.

379
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,450
-Are you not going to offer more, Mr. Feng?
-Is there anyone who would offer more?

380
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,600
It's rare to see people who has a craze
for Mr. Ren's drawing in the State of Yun.

381
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,810
It seems that the guest in the
private room is really obsessed with it.

382
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,200
I have many collections.

383
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,010
I shall let that person to have it.

384
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,560
The host has stopped calling.

385
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,160
I think we have won the bid.

386
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,600
It's fun to compete with Mr. Feng.

387
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,640
All right, this drawing belongs
to the guest in the private room.

388
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,080
Mr. Feng is leaving.

389
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,110
Why is he leaving?

390
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,840
Miss, you forgot your drawing.

391
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,880
Xiao Qin, bring the drawing.

392
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,840
Okay.

393
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,000
[Cai Yun House]

394
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,920
Miss!

395
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,530
Miss!

396
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,080
Miss, Mr. Feng is over there.

397
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,280
Mister, these books
have just been published.

398
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,640
Miss!

399
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,600
-Miss!
-Xiao Qin!

400
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,880
Push me when I approach him, okay?

401
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,450
Okay.

402
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,160
This suits you well.

403
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,280
By the way, there is another one
which is better.

404
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,450
-Do you like it?
-I shall check out the rest.

405
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,800
Mr. Feng.

406
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,080
Ms. Han.

407
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,760
We meet again. What a coincidence.

408
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,960
You were at the auction too?

409
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,330
You won the bid of the
Qilin Mountain Drawing?

410
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,960
I have been obsessed with
Mr. Ren Shu Bi's drawings.

411
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,810
Ren Shu Bi?

412
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,250
I mean Ren Bi Shu.

413
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,810
I am too nervous in front of you.

414
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,000
-I have mistaken his name.
-Yes.

415
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,040
Ms. Han likes Mr. Ren's drawings too?

416
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,210
Not only she likes his drawing,

417
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,140
she also knows his life story really well.

418
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,340
She can even repeat them in her dream.

419
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,690
Ms. Han is indeed knowledgeable.

420
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,600
If you don't mind, may I know
why do you like Mr. Ren?

421
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,530
As far as I am concerned,

422
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,840
not many in the State of Yun
know Mr. Ren well.

423
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,840
I personally think that Mr. Ren's
calligraphy and drawings...

424
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,440
are ethereal and out of this world.

425
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,160
It is also as if he had seen
through life and death.

426
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,600
Many writers and poets run after...

427
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,360
flowery language and magnificent sight.

428
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,570
In comparison,

429
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,440
Mr. Ren's state of mind
is extremely precious.

430
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,480
Yes.

431
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,520
You and I share the same thought.

432
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,130
May I know which phase of Mr. Ren's
drawings do you like the most?

433
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,920
Which phase?

434
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,800
Of course when he was
at the peak of his life.

435
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,880
To me,

436
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,320
he was at the peak of his life
when he was dying.

437
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,730
Why did you say so?

438
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,280
It's just a personal perception.

439
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,200
This is the first time
I heard perception like this.

440
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,040
But...

441
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,560
no doubt Mr. Ren had the best
understanding of the worldly wisdom...

442
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,850
at the end of his life.

443
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,770
It's not wrong to see that
as the peak of his life.

444
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,650
Are you interested to have
some tea at that restaurant?

445
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,210
We can talk about drawings.

446
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,770
I do have the interest
to discuss further...

447
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,090
but I have something else to do.

448
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,280
Where are you going?

449
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,160
I am going to the alley not far away
to get a few things.

450
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,040
I shall leave now.

451
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,090
Mr. Feng.

452
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,330
I have a question.

453
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,170
What is it?

454
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,720
I know well that I have
little talent and learning.

455
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,200
Though I know a few words,

456
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,720
but I am unable to communicate in writing.

457
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,970
I wonder if we can meet up
in person more often...

458
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,800
so that I can learn things from you.

459
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,650
It shouldn't be a problem if I am free.

460
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,800
Do you have a lover?

461
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,210
Lover?

462
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,450
If you already have a lover,

463
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,450
I shall stop contacting you.

464
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,840
I haven't gotten married.

465
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,330
I don't have a lover either.

466
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,930
Why do you ask so?

467
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,250
You are so slow in thought.

468
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,970
-She is confessing...
-Xiao Qin!

469
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,570
See you again.

470
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,320
You are so brave!

471
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,050
Having Grand Secretary Ding...

472
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,330
as the teacher of the five classics
at Yun Shang Academy...

473
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,920
is indeed an honour of the scholars.

474
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,840
Master Wang, you are very emphatic.

475
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:02,650
Scholars at Yun Shang Academy
which was established by you...

476
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:06,490
have always passed the imperial
examination with flying colours.

477
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,210
You have worked hard and
performed valuable services...

478
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:12,210
for the education in the State of Yun.

479
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,890
I am born in the State of Yun.

480
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,570
Contributing for the education
in the State of Yun...

481
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,170
is my duty.

482
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:22,650
However, I have no choice but
to put you to great inconvenience.

483
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,650
Don't say that.

484
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,690
You know how to
get the best out of people.

485
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:29,610
I will definitely do my best.

486
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,680
I had to make you stoop lower...

487
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,800
for a reason.

488
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:36,970
Please tell me the details.

489
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,090
Wen Bin has in his test paper written...

490
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,640
in order to be fair to all the people...

491
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:47,890
the examination system should be
more transparent and fair.

492
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,050
Nowadays, those who come
from poor family...

493
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,880
have no choice but to become
the surrogate exam-takers...

494
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,810
for high-born candidates
in order to make a living.

495
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,610
They hide their talents
in a napkin to live on.

496
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,320
They will never rise in life.

497
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,890
Those high-born candidates,
on the other hand,

498
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,530
are not competent and well-trained.

499
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,770
Instead, they cheat
in the imperial examination.

500
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,440
If they get selected as the officials,

501
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,970
how do we ensure
impartiality and integrity?

502
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,040
I still remember that before
I established Yun Shang Academy,

503
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,010
someone made a similar remark.

504
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,730
It's a shame.

505
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,360
Now,

506
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,560
I have finally met another student
who is upright and outspoken.

507
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,570
I'm really excited.

508
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,850
I know what you meant.

509
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,290
Mr. Li.

510
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,070
You are too used to slacking.

511
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,640
It's an important day.

512
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,530
How could you come so late?

513
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,730
When I was on my way,
I bumped into Grand Secretary Ding.

514
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,960
I had a short conversation with him.
Please don't be angry at me.

515
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,370
Grand Secretary Ding is here?

516
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,240
Yes.

517
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,530
If that's the case,

518
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,920
Master Wang is here too?

519
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,370
Master Wang is not here.

520
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,650
I came here alone.

521
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,480
Greetings to Grand Secretary Ding.

522
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:15,130
You don't have to bow to me.

523
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,290
We will be working together
moving forward.

524
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,330
Principal Feng.

525
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:23,410
Please don't bow to me.

526
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,680
Grand Secretary,

527
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,570
what do you mean?

528
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,250
I made a minor mistake.

529
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,930
Hence, I was stoped down
by Master Wang...

530
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,170
as the teacher of the five classics.

531
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,130
How about our ranks?

532
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,890
It goes without saying that
you are superior than me.

533
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,170
Mr. Ding.

534
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,770
Why are you so careless?

535
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,680
Yes.

536
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,360
You are ruining your own future.

537
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,880
Yes.

538
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,080
What about the position
of Grand Secretary?

539
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,600
It's vacant at the moment.

540
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,280
Master Wang intends to select
the candidate...

541
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,810
among the teachers in this school.

542
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,730
Master Wang has made a wise judgment.

543
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,320
-Yes.
-He should have done it early.

544
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,840
Yes.

545
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,810
Master Wang has made a wise judgment.

546
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,360
[Clean]

547
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,800
[Quiet]

548
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,360
[Respect]

549
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,120
Come forward.

550
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:27,050
The first bow represents that you
surrender yourself to the teachers.

551
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,480
The second bow represents that
you promise to discipline yourself.

552
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,730
The third bow represents the endless
admiration towards your teachers.

553
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,760
Teacher respecting ceremony?

554
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,010
Admission ceremony?

555
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,010
Martial arts performance?

556
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,050
I didn't expect that you had
participated in so many events...

557
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,760
as the school has just started.

558
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,600
Yes.

559
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,310
It's completely new to me.

560
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,970
In this period of time,

561
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,810
you must have struggled a lot.

562
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,530
I have experienced all kind of hardships.

563
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:44,520
This is nothing.

564
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,940
I heard that at Yun Shang Academy,

565
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,880
a few people have to share a room.

566
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,370
I guess you can't sleep in peace.

567
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,400
In the beginning,
that's the biggest problem.

568
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,870
However, it's solved now.

569
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,010
The best solution is...

570
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,490
stop attending school.

571
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,130
What's wrong?

572
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,440
Do you plan to continue studying?

573
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,440
Mum.

574
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,480
I haven't figured a way out.

575
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,040
There are so many students
at Yun Shang Academy.

576
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,370
Has none of the underachievers
been expelled?

577
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,610
Let me tell you

578
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,170
If you repeat the mistake,

579
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:37,850
you will be doomed.

580
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,090
You'd better behave.

581
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,520
Otherwise,

582
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,480
you will be expelled.

583
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,960
All right, You'd better work hard.

584
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,250
You fool.

585
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,800
Senior.

586
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,570
You didn't give any response despite
getting scolded badly by Mr. Li.

587
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,770
I couldn't be bothered.

588
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,050
[It's not difficult to be
an underachiever.]

589
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,130
How do you master all the subjects?

590
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,010
I was taught by another teacher.

591
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,680
-Therefore...
-Dear student,

592
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,160
please play a song for us.

593
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,410
He is talking to you.

594
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,720
I am talking to you.

595
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,530
Just give it a bold try.

596
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,570
All the best!

597
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,410
Good.

598
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,570
Lei Ze Xin.

599
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,530
Don't disturb the class.

600
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,160
You are not welcome here.

601
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,360
How could you say that?
I was playing it wholeheartedly.

602
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,880
How is that interference?

603
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,210
You are being disrespectful to the elder.

604
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:48,970
You are provoking.

605
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,970
Don't affect the other scholars.

606
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:51,850
Get out!

607
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:58,930
Did I affect you?

608
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,160
No.

609
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,570
Did I affect all of you?

610
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:04,890
Yes.

611
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:11,810
Lei Ze Xin!

612
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,889
You are such a jerk!
You will be punished by God!

613
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,489
-Anyone else?
-Stop it!

614
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,330
Lei Ze Xin, what are you doing?

615
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,199
Let go of me! Are you going to hit me?

616
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,000
Not you.

617
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,239
Let go of me!

618
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,960
I will surely chase you out
of Yun Shang Academy!

619
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,449
I have never wanted to study here.

620
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,449
You!

621
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,679
That's too much!

622
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,159
How could he do that?

623
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,130
Senior, what class do you have later?

624
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,330
It depends.

625
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:48,929
I shall keep you company.

626
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,610
You are doing it right.

627
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,330
At least you are conscientious.

628
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:54,120
Brother Wen Bin,
you love medical lesson, don't you?

629
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,639
-Let's learn it together.
-Medical lesson?

630
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,600
We shall talk about it later.

631
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,210
-Let's attend class together.
-What will we have for lunch?

632
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,780
-Whatever.
-Let's take a look.

633
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,740
Let's go.

634
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,280
Senior.

635
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,160
Senior.

636
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,760
Wake up.

637
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,280
Lei Ze Xin, you!

638
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,400
Wen Bin.

639
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,290
You may get out now if you don't have
the heart to attend the class.

640
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,320
-I...
-Stop explaining.

641
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,970
You have to draw a portrait
of your roommate as a punishment.

642
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,640
Mr. Lei.

643
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,400
[Master Ke Shi]
[Qin Bei Chuan]

644
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:35,960
Mister.

645
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,240
Are all the teachers' manuscripts here?

646
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,760
The newly joined teacher
hasn't submitted his manuscript.

647
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,530
[The newly joined teacher won't
have the command plate with him.]

648
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,160
[Who will that be?]
