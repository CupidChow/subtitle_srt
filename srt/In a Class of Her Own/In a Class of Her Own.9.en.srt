[Episode 9]

4
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,840
How am I different?

5
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,600
Their basics are better than mine.

6
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:24,440
This has nothing to do with basics.

7
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,960
They're doing things improperly.

8
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,440
They don't work hard,

9
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,260
but want to master everything
using the easier way before exam.

10
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,320
How do you know they didn't work hard?

11
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,280
Moreover,

12
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,759
it's never too late to start learning.

13
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,039
As students in the same academy,

14
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,600
we should help each other.

15
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,240
I don't want to waste my time on them.

16
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,840
Do you know why does
everybody stay away from you?

17
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,560
Why is it that people don't
say things to your face?

18
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,600
Brother Ze Xin looks

19
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,610
but you're more unapproachable.

20
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,360
You won't teach them?

21
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,080
If you won't, then I'll do it.

22
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,970
You have to close your lips naturally.

23
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,200
Place your left hand here.

24
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,960
Yes, and right hand here.

25
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,430
Then,

26
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,400
your lower lip must be at
the bottom of the mouth hole.

27
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,640
And you blow downwards.

28
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,720
-Like this?
-Yes, you're right.

29
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,600
Outstanding.

30
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,520
I've lived to see this.

31
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,400
I've finally lived to see this day.

32
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,680
He wasn't exactly skillful,

33
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,800
but I've given a lot of
points for his emotions.

34
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,480
Lei Ze Xin has passed!

35
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,880
Did you force yourself to let him pass?

36
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,000
No.

37
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,440
Not at all.

38
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,600
I saw Lei Ze Xin's huge improvement.

39
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,320
It seems like the fact that
Feng Cheng Jun and Wen Bin...

40
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,280
staying in Room Two of Regular Dorm...

41
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,600
brings great impact on Lei Ze Xin.

42
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,880
According to most of the scholars,

43
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,680
Wen Bin and Lei Ze Xin have
indeed changed for the better recently.

44
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,330
They've improved a lot.

45
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,690
That's great.

46
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,600
I hope all scholars...

47
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,120
can have such learning spirit.

48
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,960
Lei Ze Xin's improvement is also a result
of Yun Shang Academy's proper guidance.

49
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,640
Congratulations, Principal Feng.

50
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,159
Congratulations to you too.

51
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,080
In that case,

52
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,080
has the observation period for
Wen Bin and Lei Ze Xin ended?

53
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,720
That's for sure.

54
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,640
The observation period for
Wen Bin and Lei Ze Xin has ended.

55
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,150
That's fast.

56
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,130
I heard that Feng Cheng Jun
was a huge help to them.

57
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,480
An arrogant rich guy,

58
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,760
a poor lad,

59
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,280
and a useless Lei Ao.

60
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,560
The three of them live together,
and helped each other.

61
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,720
What a joke.

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Do you know...

63
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,480
what does this mean?

64
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,400
Feng Cheng Jun gave up his superior room,

65
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,240
and could get along with
Wen Bin and Lei Ze Xin.

66
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,050
This means...

67
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,040
he's challenging the rules
of Yun Shang Academy,

68
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,240
and me!

69
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,200
He's taken a successful first step.

70
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,320
Brother Feng.

71
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,840
The observation period for me
and Brother Ze Xin has ended.

72
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,960
Thanks for your help.

73

You're welcome.

You both are good on your own.

Wen Bin,

76
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,680
could you have succeeded if
it weren't for my cooperation?

77
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,800
Of course,

78
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,440
Brother Ze Xin deserves all the credits.

79
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,040
You're a new leaf now,
I'm really happy for you.

Do you think I want this?

81

You kept pestering me,
or I wouldn't have done that.

82

Now that you've got what you wanted.

83

So stop pestering me.

I don't want to fool around
with you any more.

himself again right after you're safe?

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,360
Seriously?

170
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,050
Can you get me a signature then?

171
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,160
Of course...

172
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,840
I can.

173
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,440
I'll ask him to come out now.

174
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,110
Let's go.

175
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,520
You're already here, don't be scared.

176
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,160
I didn't expect the crowd.

177
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,600
Will people recognise me?

178
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,320
With this look,

179
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,690
even I can't really tell who you are,
let alone the others.

180
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,730
Come on, let's go.

181
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,960
Mr. Bai's coming.

182
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,560
Both misters,

183
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,200
you're too popular.

184
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,360
Stop pushing, everybody.

185
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,240
Here, please move inside, misters.

186
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,210
Calm down.

187
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,610
Do this one by one.

188
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,800
Have a seat.

189
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,440
I'll get you some water.

190
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,600
Look at his charming moustache.

191
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,800
Grab this rare opportunity
to ask any questions.

192
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,720
Mr. Bai will answer
every single one of them.

193
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,930
Me, me!

194
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,040
I have a question.

195
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,320
Go ahead, Ms. Han.

196
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,240
Mr. Bai, may I know...

197
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
what is your ideal type of lady?

198
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,400
I think all ladies are
wonderful in their own ways.

199
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,280
Personally, I think...

200
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,080
a lady should be elegant, gorgeous,

201
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,840
unworldly,

202
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,440
smart and kind.

203
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,060
I want one too.

204
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,880
[Book signing event]

205
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,320
Am I not pretty enough?

206
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,560
If Ms. Han isn't pretty,

207
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,960
then there will be no pretty lady in Yun.

208
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,320
Then, why wouldn't
Mr. Feng take my pouch?

209
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,600
Maybe there's already a lady in his heart.

210
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,880
That's impossible.

211
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,410
Young Lady already asked him.

212
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,370
There's no one in Mr. Feng's heart.

213
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,160
You even asked him this?

214
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,570
Yes.

215
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,960
I thought that...

216
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,840
if he has someone in his heart,

217
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,200
I won't have to waste my effort.

218
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,080
You asked him that,

219
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,640
and he didn't do anything?

220
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,880
What a softhead.

221
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,400
It looks like I need to do
something to remind him.

222
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,000
Mr. Yu, I'm here for the
ways I can use to remind him.

223
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,200
Do you have any idea?

224
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,720
I have, for sure.

225
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's not a difficult task to build
a magpie bridge for both of you.

226
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,640
A magpie bridge? How long will that take?

227
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,560
But the Academy wouldn't allow that.

228
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,200
It... it's just a metaphor.

229
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,960
Then, what might the bridge be?

230
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,760
Show your affection via letters.

231
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,240
But my knowledge is limited.

232
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,680
You can have someone write it for you.

233
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,110
I can even get someone
to write a love letter for me?

234
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,070
Of course.

235
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,630
Everything can be substituted.

236
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,440
The thing is, can you afford it?

237
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,160
No problem, let me know the price.

238
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,010
Brother Wen Bin,

239
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,450
did the book signing event go well?

240
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,360
It was a huge success.

241
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,760
Then, why are you frowning?

242
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
I'm quite tired.

243
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,840
Brother Wen Bin,

244
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,120
from tomorrow onwards,

245
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,600
we'll start to study.

246
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,600
You promised me that.

247
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,000
Why isn't Brother Ze Xin back yet?

248
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,080
I haven't seen him for the day.

249
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,120
[You're staying at the
Academy until the first exam?]

250
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,840
[So, you want to be Wen Bin forever?]

251
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,200
[Of course not.]

252
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,400
[But a person who's
expelled from the Academy...]

253
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,480
[can never take the imperial exam,
let alone its first exam.]

254
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,410
[The only way now is
both of us have to work hard together.]

255
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,440
[These are the notes I made in classes.]

256
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,720
[Study them.]

257
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,600
[You must be a qualified student.]

258
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,480
[When the time comes,
you can have your identity back.]

259
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,160
[Don't worry, Sister.]

260
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,640
[I'll work hard.]

261
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,120
Mr. Yu, I need these herbs this month.

262
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:44,880
Wormwood, knotweed, Fortune
Bogorchid, Spreading Hedyotis Herb...

263
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,080
can't be collected for now.

264
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,920
Why is it so?

265
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,300
These herbs are short of
supply in the market lately.

266
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,400
There's a spike in price.

267
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,680
The Academy needs to keep them...

268
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,120
in case of emergency.

269
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,120
[What should I do?]

270
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,760
[Does this mean Wen Bin
can't have his medicine?]

271
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,920
Wen Bin.

272
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,040
The book signing event was a big success.

273
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,640
That's so stingy of you for
not having a celebration party.

274
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,480
Can you pay me the money
for Volume Five in advance?

275
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,920
You do lack business acumen.

276
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,400
Less is more.

277
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,640
If you release the fifth
volume within a short period,

278
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,120
you're degrading its value.

279
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,480
Release it only when the
readers are most anticipative.

280
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,400
What can I do?

281
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,240
I need money urgently.

282
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,400
What a coincidence.

283
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,230
I happen to have a bigger job for you.

284
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,120
You'll be highly paid.

285
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,240
But I know that you're a man of principle.

286
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,560
I'm afraid you wouldn't
want to do this one.

287
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,319
What job is that?

288
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,569
Something you're specially good at.

289
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,599
Writing a love letter.

290
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,760
Writing a love letter?

291
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,170
I've never written a love letter.

292
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,920
You're capable of writing books,
not to mention a love letter.

293
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,560
Are they the same?

294
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,720
They are.

295
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,240
To whom is it written?

296
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,800
You can ask the employer by then.

297
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,079
I heard that...

298
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,079
she's writing to an elegant gentleman.

299
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,120
I am a man,

300
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,640
how do I write a
love letter to another man?

301
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,880
That feels weird.

302
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,400
You're even more thoughtful than a women.

303
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,680
Moreover,

304
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,040
the female characters in your books...

305
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,120
are much more interesting
than the male characters.

306
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,400
If you won't take the job,

307
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,280
I'll look for someone else.

308
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,760
I'll take it.
When can I meet the employer?

309
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,640
As soon as possible.

310
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,130
Tell me.

311
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,640
What message do you want to convey?

312
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,310
Well, we don't want him to know
that it's from my young lady.

313
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,240
What a thinker you are.

314
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,350
-The letter makes no sense then.
-It can't be.

315
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,080
Well, I want him to know my feelings...

316
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,410
without realising it's from me.

317
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,450
But,

318
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,880
he can't realise it's from me too.

319
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,440
He should get a hint that it's from me,

320
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,960
but not knowing exactly that it's from me.

321
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,880
So,

322
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,600
do you want or
do you not want him to know?

323
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,600
She wants him to know.

324
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,000
And don't know at the same time.

325
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,520
[His eyes are enchanting.]

326
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,640
[Sometimes, they look melancholic.]

327
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,480
[Sometimes, they're gentle as water.]

328
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,550
There're no such charming eyes.

329
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,040
After him.

330
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,280
Don't move.

331
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,180
That way.

332
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,040
You again?

333
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,640
Yes, it's me, Wen Bin.

334
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,680
My Lord, what could you be doing?

335
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,890
My Lord, he's not the same size.

336
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,320
Mr. Wen Bin,

337
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,380
Yunzhou isn't safe recently.

338
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,840
Please avoid coming out at night.

339
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,920
Thanks for your reminder.

340
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,690
Did you see anyone suspicious passing by?

341
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,680
I did see a shadow.

342
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,280
But it disappeared very quickly.

343
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,360
I couldn't see it clearly.

344
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,240
Search for him.

345
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
That way, there's sound coming from there.

346
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,600
Continue to search!

347
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
You're finally back.

348
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,420
You disappeared after class.

349
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,460
Where have you been?

350
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,720
I went to South Street.

351
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,680
You went to see Ms. Mu Xiao Man?

352
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,360
What are you thinking?

353
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,560
I always run away from her.

354
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,000
Why would I go see her?

355
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,800
Moreover,

356
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,560
I know my place.

357
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,910
Given my condition, I'm
not good enough for Ms. Mu.

358
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,840
Don't belittle yourself.

359
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,720
You're talented,
and of course are good enough for her.

360
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,360
Both of you are at the age of marriage.

361
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,680
It's perfectly normal to fall in love.

362
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
In that case,

363
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,440
you're at the age of marriage too.

364
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,360
So, you would be dating as well?

365
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,320
Naturally.

366
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,400
What is it?

367
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,080
Nothing.

368
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,720
Brother Ze Xin, you're back.

369
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,280
Where have you been these two days?

370
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,560
Wen Bin,

371
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,960
thank you.

372
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,760
Thank me?

373
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,600
Thank you for showing me concern.

374
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,200
Don't you get expelled because
of the trouble you made out there.

375
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,240
Don't worry.

376
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,980
Drinking wine like water,

377
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,560
making recklessness your habit,
always coming back drunk,

378
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,960
get exhausted due to indulgence,
letting your energy go wasted.

379
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,280
You're unrestrained,

380
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,520
and undisciplined.

381
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,000
That's why you look old at the age of 50.

382
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,310
Brother Ze Xin,

383
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,590
did you feel that?

384
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,130
Feel what?

385
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,200
Brother Feng is showing his concern.

386
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,540
Feel it.

387
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,740
That'll do you good.

388
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,320
Brother Wen Bin,

389
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:36,850
please take a look for me.

390
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,370
What's this letter about?

391
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,680
Who wrote you this?

392
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,990
I have no idea, but it is very strange.

393
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,240
That's why I need your help.

394
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,280
Let me see.

395
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,510
"If Min has never encountered you..."

396
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,360
This...

397
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,720
How could this be?

398
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,600
What do you mean by "this"?

399
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:05,830
This and that, they're the same.

400
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,160
Do you think this is a letter for me?

401
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,440
-Of course.
-Why?

402
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,520
The letter was addressed to you.

403
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,000
What a strange letter.

404
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,240
I can't understand it at all.

405
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,960
This is not an ordinary letter.

406
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,680
It is a love letter.

407
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,800
A love letter?

408
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,520
How do you know that?

409
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,200
Isn't it written there?

410
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,420
"Encounter".

411
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,440
What a shallow writer.

412
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,000
He made this look like a riddle.

413
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,620
Not at all.

414
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,000
This really is a love letter.

415
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
It comes without a name.

416
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,680
What's the point of the letter?

417
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,750
There is a name.

418
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,340
"If Min has never encountered you."

419
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,350
Min.

420
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,120
This indicates that the
lady's name has the word "Min".

421
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,160
"Min and you".

422
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,410
Of all the girls you know,

423
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,840
is there a Min?

424
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,040
No.

425
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,060
No?

426
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,780
Isn't Han Shu Min a Min?

427
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,680
Why are you staring at me like that?

428
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,000
How smart you are.

429
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,520
I've written a number of love letters
trying to make a living all these years.

430
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,160
This isn't new to me.

431
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,880
Then, tell me,

432
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,600
what is this letter about?

433
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,540
"If Min has never encountered you,"

434
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,120
"she wouldn't have felt such sentiment."

435
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,280
"However, you don't know
how much I yearn for you."

436
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,200
"Not all encounter brings joy."

437
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,200
"Not all yearning worth telling."

438
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,320
Ms. Han is fond of you,

439
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,800
but she's too shy to let you know.

440
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,800
That's why she's depressed.

441
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,960
If it wasn't for your explanation,
I wouldn't have understood it.

442
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,760
The writer is obviously unlettered.

443
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,160
Why did you say that?

444
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,800
Look.

445
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:23,880
This part.

446
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,200
"Not every encounter brings joy."

447
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,120
But without joy,
there won't be anticipation.

448
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,080
And here.

449
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,000
"Not every yearning worth telling."

450
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,600
Then, what's the point of writing this?

451
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,560
Aren't they contradictory?

452
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,800
Am I right?

453
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,040
Are you replying her letter?

454
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,890
I'm going to tell Ms. Han
that studying is my priority now.

455
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,300
I have no time for love.

456
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,440
Right,

457
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,360
I'll tell her about this lousy writer
so that she won't be wasting money.

458
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,840
Yes, you're the smart one.

459
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,600
I have his reply letter.

460
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,360
How could you...

461
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,960
How could I be so shameless,

462
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,140
is it?

463
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,270
Ms. Han asked me to take it on her behalf.

464
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,080
If I knew I was writing to Brother Feng,
I wouldn't have done it despite the pay.

465
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,800
Will you give up the large sum of money?

466
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,280
I will.

467
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,150
Anyway, get someone else to do this.

468
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,320
I can't find anyone better than you.

469
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,520
Furthermore,

470
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,240
you have accepted the job.

471
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:51,120
And I won't continue working with
one who goes back on his words.

472
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,160
Don't you want to know...

473
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,120
whether Feng Cheng Jun likes Han Shu Min?

474
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,800
Does Brother Feng's feeling
for Ms. Han matter us?

475
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,640
It is interesting.

476
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,200
Of course it does.

477
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,630
Anyway, don't worry.

478
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,680
I won't make things hard for you.

479
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,920
Count on me.

480
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,280
Did Mr. Feng replied?

481
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,880
He is busy studying that
he has no time to reply.

482
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,320
However,

483
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,160
he could not bear to let you wait.

484
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,040
Therefore, he specially asked me
to pass you a message.

485
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,160
What did he say?

486
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,360
Junior Feng said that...

487
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,090
he's touched that you took the initiative
to write him a love letter.

488
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,640
But he said studying is his top priority.

489
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,320
He has no time for love.

490
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,020
He knew the love letter was from me?

491
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,100
That's for sure.

492
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,400
He even complimented the
literary talent of the writer,

493
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,030
saying it's admirable.

494
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,710
Is that true?

495
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,950
Mr. Wen,

496
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,410
you're indeed knowledgeable.

497
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,920
Ms. Han,

498
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,960
-actually...
-I know.

499
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,440
He kept telling me...

500
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,260
that's he's focusing on his studies.

501
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,600
Does that mean he's rejected me?

502
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,480
But Mr. Feng never asks you
to stop writing him love letter.

503
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,640
He even complimented Mr. Wen's writing.

504
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,080
I think Mr. Feng must be thrilled
to receive the love letter.

505
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,920
Well, you know,
Feng Cheng Jun is a reserved man.

506
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,360
I couldn't tell.

507
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,610
B... but,

508
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,480
there's a saying that goes,

509
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,080
"where there's a will, there's a way."

510
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,640
You should know that.

511
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,320
Well said, Mr. Yu.

512
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,010
What should we do next?

513
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,440
We have to make hay while the sun shines.

514
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,080
We're deceiving Ms. Han.

515
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,520
You're imagining things.

516
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,440
We're helping her.

517
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,160
But Brother Feng was firm
in his opinion in the letter.

518
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,640
You're really indifferent towards others.

519
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,940
Think about it.

520
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,480
If Han Shu Min learned that
she's rejected so soon,

521
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,440
you see,

522
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,800
she'll be very embarrassed and hurt.

523
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,660
Oh dear, of all the things
she could've done,

524
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,130
why must Ms. Han go for love letter?

525
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,650
You'd better worry about yourself.

526
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,240
Where would your money
come from if you did not do this job?

527
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,080
"Like a beautiful poetry,
a beautiful dream..."

528
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,880
"comes when you expect less."

529
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,440
"I love these dreams."

530
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,840
"As you're in there."

531
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,880
"And I'm the happiest
person in the world."

532
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,680
How poetic.

533
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,120
It's simple, straightforward
and understandable this time.

534
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,400
I already told Ms. Han
to stop going to the writer.

535
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,160
Didn't she get my letter?

536
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,360
How do I know?

537
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,600
This is not good,
I... I need to talk to her in person.

538
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,880
No way.

539
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,360
Why not?

540
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,410
Because...

541
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,130
if you were being too gentle...

542
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,760
and Ms. Han got the wrong idea,

543
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,920
it might have just the opposite result.

544
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,720
But if you were being harsh,

545
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,820
she would be sad.

546
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,720
Then,

547
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,280
it will be something worse
than a daily love letter.

548
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,640
Tell me then,

549
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,160
what should I do?

550
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,290
Let nature take its course.

551
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,760
When the novelty wears off,

552
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,080
she might no longer be interested in you.

553
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,360
What do you think of this letter?

554
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,300
It's always the same boring words.

555
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,600
You look nervous.

556
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,250
Did you do something bad?

557
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,520
Tricking Ms. Han into writing
the love letters is bad itself.

558
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,240
We're not tricking her.

559
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,400
We're just suggesting.

560
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,680
They're the same in nature.

561
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,500
I'm pretty sure that Brother Feng
doesn't have feelings for Ms. Han.

562
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,040
-So...
-So,

563
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,500
you should be forgiven as
you're facing a big trouble.

564
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,800
If I keep this up,

565
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,680
even I can't forgive myself.

566
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,960
Le Xuan, I want to quit.

567
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,320
You can take my money.

568
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,000
What a trouble.

569
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,080
How about this?

570
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,440
Help her with one last letter.

571
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,000
Your letter.

572
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,100
Thank you.

573
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,960
Are you all right?

574
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,920
I think it's quite creative.

575
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,870
You seem to be
thinking highly of this writer.

576
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,040
Not really.

577
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,020
Brother Wen Bin,

578
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,400
tell me honestly.

579
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,570
Where have you been these few days?

580
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,240
I didn't go anywhere.

581
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,040
When you weren't around,

582
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,360
I was really worried.

583
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,640
I looked all around the Academy
but I couldn't find you.

584
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,560
I'm sure you went out.

585
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,160
I...

586
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,380
Don't be too sure.

587
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,160
Here you go.
You left it at my place last night.

588
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:47,840
That's right.

589
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,040
I was at Le Xuan's place these two days...

590
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,440
to learn something from him.

591
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,940
I didn't let you know as you dislike him.

592
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:00,950
Brother Wen Bin,

593
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,400
you're free to go anywhere
with anyone and I can't intervene.

594
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,560
But you have to be careful.

595
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,120
That's some enviable friendship.

596
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,280
So, are you still coming tonight?

597
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,980
Brother Wen Bin,
I hope you can tell right from wrong,

598
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,930
and know what you can and cannot do.

599
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,240
[Is it true?]

600
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,880
He had a big reaction?

601
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,390
Absolutely. He has no
experience in love after all.

602
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,240
You're really awesome, Mr. Wen.

603
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,840
Now,

604
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,280
Mr. Feng will fall for my young lady...

605
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,120
How delightful.

606
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,040
What should we draw next?

607
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,440
To be frank...

608
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:57,890
Mr. Feng, you're here?

609
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,530
What an unexpected guest.
