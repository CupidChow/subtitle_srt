the last contestant of Team One,

Lin Bing Shen.

00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,470
Young Lady, looks like there
is no hope for them.

Let's go back.

9
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,830
I'll stay until the end.

10
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,390
Lin Bing Shen, seven points.

The first shot, seven points.

13
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,430

[Lin Bing Shen. Seven]

How did he even get into
the President's team?

16
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,830
Exactly.

17

The second shot, seven points.

18
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,230
Keep it steady, don't panic.

19

There is one more chance.

20

Attendant Officer Han,

24
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,920
teaming up with scholar of such level,

25
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,590
shows that your son is
unbiased and great-minded.

26
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,470
Thank you for the compliment,
Master Wang.

27
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,520
President, I...

28
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,640
Principal Feng,

29
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,280
next up should be Feng Cheng Jun
and Wen Bin, right?

30
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,280
That's right.

31
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,030
It's finally their turn.

32
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,350
I've been looking forward to this
for so long.

33
00:02:56,079 --> 00:03:00,240
Team One, leave the field.
Team Two, standby.

34
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,280
Let's go back.

35
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,000
Lord,

36
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,190
Ding Ruo Yang and Liu Qian Yi...

37
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,880
have been keeping an eye on me.

38
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,160
It's hard to make a move
inside the academy.

39
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,360
But I have arranged my men...

40
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,550
to block all entrances of the academy.

41
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,030
Once that man shows up,

42
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,950
we will capture him immediately.

43
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,280
There they are.

44
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,110
You've learnt your lesson.

45
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,079
Next time, when you are
teaming up with someone,

46
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,800
don't pick a guy who would chicken out.

47
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,110
It's such a disappointment.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,110
Let's go back.

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,079
Who is that?

50
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,920
Who? Look.

51
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,920
-Look, it's Lei Ze Xin.
-That's right.

52
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,800
-Lei Ze Xin.
-Lei Ze Xin is here.

53
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,920
He really came.

54
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,360
-What's going on?
-He's here.

55
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,190
-Brother.
-Let's go.

56
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,030
I knew you would come.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,470
Thank goodness.

58
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,190
There is hope now, there is hope now.

59
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,110
It must be the blessing of God.

60
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,440
Where have you been?

61
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,470
Little brother, I'm just here
as a fill-in.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,800
Don't expect me to win it for you.

63
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,840
No way, you could only
make it up to me by winning.

64
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,640
Wen Bin,

65
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,240
it's all on you.

66
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,030
I'll do my best.

67
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,150
Go for it.

68
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,120
-Mr Ding, they...
-Mr Liu...

69
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Team Three, take the field.

70
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,120
-Mr Liu...
-Can't you see...

71
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,080
every member of the
Team Two are here?

72
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,640
Let's go.

73
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,080
Team Two, take the field.

74
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,400
Wen Bin, go for it. Do you best.

75
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,430
You can do it.

76
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,200
Lei Ze Xin, you can do it.

77
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,360
You can do it.

78
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,990
-You can do it.
-You can do it.

79
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,360
Wen Bin, you can do it.

80
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,800
Team Two, take the field.

81
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,870
Team Two, take the field.

82
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,870
Did I hear it right?

83
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,960
You did, Young Lady.

84
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,800
It's Mr Feng and Mr Wen's team.

85
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,080
That's great.

86
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,550
My Lord, look.

87
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,150
It's that boy.

88
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,470
Didn't you say he is badly hurt...

89
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,430
and he won't make it to
the archery ceremony?

90
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,470
I did.

91
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,030
But I believe that...

92
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,590
he doesn't have any strength
to draw the bow.

93
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,470
I would like to see if he's
able to shoot an arrow today.

94
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,270
If he is unable to,

95
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,870
that makes him the one who released
the Book of Ten Thousand Words.

96
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,150
Arrest him immediately.

97
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,430
Yes, Sir.

98
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,030
Respects to Master Wang.

99
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,270
Thank you.

100
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,200
Feng Cheng Jun, Wen Bin,
and the few of you,

101
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,990
you'd better do your best.

102
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:08,030
Don't disappoint me and others.

103
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,430
Yes.

104
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,710
Team Two, on your positions.

105
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,590
For Master Wang's inspection.

106
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,590
Master Wang is here for Feng Cheng Jun...

107
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,800
and Wen Bin indeed.

108
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,800
Master Wang is here for the hope of Yun.

Very good.

113
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,360
Well done.

114
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,710
Is Feng Cheng Jun left-handed?

115
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,590
Master Wang, you don't know this.

116
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,800
Feng Cheng Jun injured his right arm.

117
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,710
He changed to use his left arm.

118
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,590
In order to train his left arm,

119
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,800
he has suffered a lot.

120
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,840
Feng Cheng Jun, ten points.

121
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,310
Right in the bullseye.

122
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,800
Feng Cheng Jun, ten points.

123
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,470
Awesome.

124
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,640
Look, Master Wang.

125
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,750
His left arm is very strong too.

126
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,470
-President, drink some water.
-Feng Cheng Jun, full marks.

127
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,430
Full marks.

128
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,310
We expected it.

129
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,920
Full marks, Feng Cheng Jun.

Next up is Lei Ze Xin, who
just returned to the team.

132
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,870
Don't worry, he's great.

Lei Ze Xin, zero?

137
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,030
How is it possible?

138
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,350
This is absolutely absurd.

140
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,000
This guy got zero.

141
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,400
He weighed down Mr Wen.

142
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,040
It can't be.

143

[I'm afraid my daughter
won't be better than him.]

What's going on?

145
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,350
Looks like he made a mistake.

146
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,030
Although the arrow has missed the target,

147
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,310
but the strength is there.

148
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,920
My Lord, let's just see...

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,310
his performance for the next two shots.

150
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,560
Lei Ze Xin, nine points.

151
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,800
He's not bad, not bad.

152
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,310
-That wasn't easy.
-Exactly.

153
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,720
Brother, you can do it.

154
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,230
You can do it.

155
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Hang in there.

156
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,310
Mr Ding,

157
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,280
why do you look so strange?

158
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,030
I'm a little bit nervous.

159
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,670
Mr Li, aren't you nervous?

160
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,750
Commander Lei,

161
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,320
your son is outstanding.

162
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,600
Thank you for your compliment,
Master Wang.

163
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,670
He still made a nine-point shot,
despite he's badly injured?

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,240
It could be just luck.

165
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,870
He has used a lot of strength just now.

166
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,790
His wound might have split.

167
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,750
Let's just wait for him
to shoot his third arrow.

168
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,480
My Lord, he's going to
give himself away soon.

169
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,510
Ze Xin, what's wrong?

170
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,560
-Ze Xin.
-Brother.

171
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,510
It must be him.

172
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,630
Go and check his wound now.

173
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,670
Yes, my Lord.

174
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,070
Commander Lei,

175
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,240
your son could actually pull
the bowstring until it broke.

176
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,430
He's really strong.

177
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,590
Please excuse him, Master Wang.

178
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,310
My son has always been reckless.

179
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,800
Brother.

180
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,910
Brother.

181
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,840
Are you hurt?

182
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,630
What stupid bow is this?
Such poor quality.

183
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,160
It broke immediately when I pulled.

184
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,640
Little brother,

185
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,640
go and pick a better one for me.

186
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,310
On it.

187
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,150
He actually has the strength to
pull the bowstring until it broke.

188
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,720
Is he really suffering from
a severe injury in his stomach?

189
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,590
My Lord, we'll find out about it...

190
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,110
once the archery ceremony ends.

191
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,150
[The moment you use
your strength to draw the bow,]

192
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,680
[your wound would split open.]

193
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,520
[Are you trying to get yourself killed?]

194
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,040
[In this world,]

195
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,640
[there is one thing that's more
important than my own life.]

196
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,550
[That's hope.]

197
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,720
[Wen Bin and Feng Cheng Jun...]

198
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,200
[have taught me about hope.]

199
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,910
[So I can't let them down,]

200
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,040
[and I can't let myself down.]

201
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,600
Brilliant.

202
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,550
Good job.

203
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,910
My Lord, I might have made a mistake.

204
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,400
-It's my turn.
-You can do it.

205
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,000
Ladies,

206
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,680
today is not the academy's visiting day.

207
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,630
Outsiders are not allowed to enter.

208
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,470
We're here at the
invitation of the scholars.

209
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,560
This is the invitation card.

210
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,680
This is Ms Mu Xiao Man.

211
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,240
Of course, I recognise Ms Mu.

212
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,560
But Master Wang personally attended
the archery ceremony today.

213
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,510
Outsiders are not allowed
to enter the academy.

214
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,960
Maybe you could come again
after Master Wang leaves.

215
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,310
I hope for your understanding, ladies.

216
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,000
We volunteered
to perform for the scholars.

217
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,270
Aren't you being rude
to treat us like this?

218
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,590
That's right.
How dare you treat Sister Mu with neglect?

219
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,750
Let's go back.

220
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,120
We don't dare to take it upon
ourselves on this matter.

221
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,670
That's enough. Xiao Qing, Xiao Jie,

222
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,000
stop pressuring this man here.

223
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,150
But, Sir,

224
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,070
can you pass a message
to Mr Yu Le Xuan for me?

225
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,560
Just tell him we're here.

226
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,480
All right, please wait here, ladies.

227
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,710
That was awesome.

228
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,880
Lu Zhao Rong performed quite well.

229
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,510
He has obtained 28 points now.

230
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,760
Looks like...

231
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,400
there is still hope for Mr Feng's team.

232
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,390
Even if Mr Wen and that
Wei Zhao Hui get full marks,

233
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,160
they are still one point
behind Young Master's team.

234
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,880
Everyone, everyone,

235
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,030
this is just the preliminary round.

236
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,950
This doesn't count as the final result.

237
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,590
The rule of Yun Shang Academy's
archery ceremony is...

238
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,830
top two teams of the preliminary
round will enter into the semi-finals...

239
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,150
before they compete for the championship.

240
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,510
As long as Mr Feng's team...

241
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,830
secures the second place,

242
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,680
there is hope for them
to win the championship.

243
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,350
-Do you get it?
-I get it now.

244
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,640
Rest assured, President.

245
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,800
How could that Wei Zhao Hui
who loves to pray...

246
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,870
possibly get high marks, right?

247
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,600
Wei Zhao Hui, 30 points. Full marks.

248
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,110
Blessing of God indeed.

249
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,080
If Wen Bin gets another 30 points,

250
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,080
we'll be competing against each other
officially in the final.

251
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,670
Principal Feng,

252
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,990
I hear that Wen Bin is an amateur.

253
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,150
His posture looks professional.

254
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,870
I wonder if he's really skilled.

255
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,950
Master Wang, you're really intuitive.

256
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,760
I can assure you,

257
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,960
Wen Bin won't let you down.

258
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,110
Well done, Wen Bin.

259
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,720
Awesome, so awesome.

260
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,550
That was good.

261
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,720
Wen Bin, ten points.

262
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,360
Wen Bin, ten points

263
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,070
That's so great, Young Lady.

264
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,400
Behave yourself.

265
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,440
Blessing of God.

266
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,080
Well done, Wen Bin.

267
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,280
Little Brother,

268
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,079
good job.

269
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,390
This is such a surprise.

270
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,599
It isn't, it isn't.

271
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,790
It's all within my expectation.

272
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,270
It's a surprise, a surprise.

273
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,079
[You just need to aim at the bullseye,]

274
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,200
[enjoy the pleasure of the moment
you shoot the arrow.]

275
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,510
[Feel the unity of
yourself and the arrow.]

276
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,600
-I did it.
-Wen Bin, you're so awesome.

277
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,000
I did it.

278
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,550
-I did it.
-Well done.

279
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,080
Thank you, brother.

280
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,000
It's fine as long as
you are not mad at me.

281
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,720
We have a chance to enter the finals.

282
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,030
-That's right.
-True.

283
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,840
Wen Bin, full marks.

284
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,600
[Ten]

285
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,360
-Awesome.
-That's great.

286
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,960
Wen Bin, full marks.

287
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,080
My girl,

288
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,840
she must have been through
so much to get such marks.

289
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,630
Brother.

290
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,080
You have a fever.

291
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,800
-No wonder you would miss your first shot.
-Come.

292
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,880
Let me check.

293
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,870
He's quite feverish.

294
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,910
He needs to be treated at Fu Ze Hall.

295
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,350
I'm fine. I'm not dying, I can do it.

296
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,720
Let's go.

297
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,870
There are still some
time before the finals.

298
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,670
Why don't you go to Fu Ze Hall first?

299
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,960
I've already lost one round.

300
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,390
Yet you still want to
sabotage my condition.

301
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,200
Do you want me to lose even more?

302
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,030
Brother, he is just concerned about you.

303
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,550
I don't need his concern.

304
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,870
Let me tell you, Feng Cheng Jun.

305
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:13,000
I lost to you this time
because I am not feeling well.

306
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,910
Don't get too happy.

307
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,670
Sure, once you get better,

308
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,390
I await your challenge.

309
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,910
What an immodest guy.

310
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,390
-No way, you should go to Fu Ze Hall.
-Wen Bin,

311
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,390
you performed very well today.

312
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,990
You should keep it up.

313
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,910
Yes.

314
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,750
Your team obtained 137 points.

315
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,550
That's quite logical.

316
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,510
Based on the results of the
archery ceremony in the past years,

317
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,800
there's a great chance that
you could enter the finals.

318
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,720
But don't let down your guard.

319
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,720
I wish you all the best for
your results in the final.

320
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,720
-Yes, Sir.
-Thank you, Sir.

321
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,390
What's going on with you today?

322
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,870
Brother has a fever.

323
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,310
It's quite high.

324
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,910
Lei Ze Xin,

325
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,480
come with me for a moment.

326
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,000
It's that awesome?

327
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,350
Wen Bin, are you tired?

328
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,390
I'm fine.

329
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,600
Ms Mu.

330
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,550
President.

331
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,270
Look.

332
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,800
Look, Ms Mu is here.

333
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,870
Why are you here?

334
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,110
You're so forgetful.

335
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,510
Didn't you invite me to come and perform?

336
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,880
Right.

337
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,510
You're here so early. Were you bored?

338
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,440
No.

339
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,430
I came here early just to
watch your archery skill.

340
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,870
But I felt that I still missed it.

341
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,600
I wonder how did you do
in the preliminary round?

342
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,390
He got full marks, of course. He won.

343
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,960
There's no place for you to talk.

344
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,110
Wen Bin is such a lucky guy.

345
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,390
Look.

346
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Xiao Man, you're here.

347
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,030
Wen Bin,

348
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,990
the final is coming up.

349
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,920
Don't get distracted.

350
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,270
I'll do my best.

351
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,720
Listen up,

352
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,320
we must win...

353
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,270
this year's archery ceremony.

354
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,030
That's the only way to prove...

355
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,790
we're the best scholars of Yun Shang.

356
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,630
Don't worry, President.

357
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,120
Wen Bin has only begun on
archery for a few days.

358
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,990
But we've been practising
martial arts since we were young.

359
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,720
No one knows for sure who
will win until the game.

360
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,910
Being good in archery relies on
diligent practice...

361
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,440
and innate intelligence.

362
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,320
And of course, a little bit of luck.

363
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,480
Mr Wen has been...

364
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,390
practising diligently lately.

365
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,270
Don't you underestimate him.

366
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,510
I don't believe it.

367
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,430
How could Wen Bin possibly better than us?

368
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,390
Look at their team,

369
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,390
Feng Cheng Jun is skillful indeed.

370
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,840
And Lei Ze Xin,

371
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,550
well, he's gone again.

372
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,720
Added with this Wen Bin,
who just started on archery.

373
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:16,240
We're bound to win this time.

374
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,750
Right, Bing Shen?

375
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,760
Right.

376
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,200
Isn't this Ms Mu from Cai Yun House?

377
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,310
What are you doing here?

378
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,310
I...

379
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,440
Ms Mu has been invited
by Student Council...

380
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,080
to perform here.

381
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,550
We've informed Principal Feng about this.

382
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,440
Since she's here early,

383
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,670
why don't we let her stay
and watch the ceremony?

384
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,720
Kindly make an exception for her.

385
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,630
Since Principal Feng has agreed,

386
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,030
then it should be fine.

387
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,080
Ms Mu,

388
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,600
Mr Han has prepared a fine place
for you to have a rest.

389
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,320
There is also luxurious food.

390
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,550
Why don't you sit here?

391
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,200
Mr Wen,

392
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,200
let's go for a walk over there.

393
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,080
Let's go.

394
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,720
Where are you going?

395
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,030
Why did you leave?

396
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,030
Thank you for coming
as you promised, Ms Mu.

397
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,150
Why are you being so polite to me?

398
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,240
I thought I've said it all in the letter?

399
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,600
Letter?

400
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,600
Yes. I had a drink with Han Shu Min
in Mingren Tavern that day.

401
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,960
After I became sober the next morning,

402
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,430
I wrote you a letter.

403
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,430
I didn't receive any letter.

404
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,120
Even now, I still don't get it.

405
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,510
How did Wen Bin...

406
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,630
get Mu Xiao Man to fall for him?

407
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,320
What ways could he have?

408
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,800
He must be dreadfully like-minded
with Mu Xiao Man.

409
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,270
They're so disgusting.

410
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,550
Shut up!

411
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,480
Lin Bing Shen, I am warning you.

412
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,080
It's up to you...

413
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,150
whether we can win this time.

414
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,550
Don't worry, President.

415
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,880
I'll do my best.

416
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,880
President.

417
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:34,390
Once your team enters the final,

418
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,910
you can't continue to use
your strength like this.

419
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,270
Why are you helping me?

420
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,030
Helping you is not my intention.

421
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,030
I'm just afraid that you might
drag down Yun Shang Academy.

422
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,960
So, from now on,

423
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,000
you must be cautious of
your words and actions.

424
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,200
You can never expose your identity.

425
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,960
Attendant Officer Han is now
suspicious of Yun Shang Academy.

426
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,990
Everything that you've been doing...

427
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,760
are meaningless to the current situation.

428
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,310
If you really care about Yun,

429
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:11,200
you should be like
Feng Cheng Jun and Wen Bin.

430
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,720
Focus on goals,

431
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,550
think about the future.

432
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,840
[137]

433
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,630
The result is obvious.

434
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,870
Everyone,

435
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,110
President Han Sheng Zhi's team...

436
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,990
and Feng Cheng Jun's team...

437
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,350
will compete against
each other in the final.

438
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:52,030
Good, that's great.

439
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,350
On one side is our Young Master,

440
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,800
on the other side is Young Lady's crush.

441
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,150
No matter which team wins,
we are still the winner.

442
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,910
But I still hope Mr Feng can win.

443
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,800
In that case,

444
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,600
it wasn't done by
Yun Shang Academy's scholar.

445
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,550
I've failed my duty,
please forgive me, my Lord.

446
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,910
It's a good thing
that it wasn't the scholar.

447
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,550
This way we won't have
a conflict with Master Wang.

448
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,600
[Wen Bin]

449

-I...
-Bing Shen.

450
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,080
Have you done checking it?

451
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,750
I'm done.

452
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,430
They are all good quality bows.

453
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,200
The game hasn't started yet,

454
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,960
you have already turned pale.

455
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,670
I'm not.

456
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,430
I'm just so furious.

457
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,030
We must win this time.

458
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,120
We must win.

459
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,150
Let's practise more.

460
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,400
[Wen Bin]

461
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,720
The targets move in the final.

462
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,390
[Most people can't even spot it clearly,]

463
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,960
[let alone they have to hit the bullseye.]

464
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,680
So, they can only rely on their intuition.

465
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,270
Intuition, do you get it?

466
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,080
Everyone, listen to me.

467
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,870
As of now,

468
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,750
among all scholars of Yun Shang Academy,

469
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,760
only Han Sheng Zhi has hit it.

470
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,360
Brother is so awesome.

471
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,390
But I believe that...

472
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,390
someone else can hit it too.

473
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,720
Me too.

474
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,030
The final of the archery ceremony,

475
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,990
will continue to adopt drawing of lots.

476
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,480
Between two teams,

477
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,150
contestants who pick the same colour...

478
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,230
will compete against each other.

479
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,270
Two by two, that's five teams in total.

480
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:54,270
Keep in mind that each of
you only have one arrow.

481
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,910
Whichever team...

482
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,800
hits more targets win.

483
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,960
I hope to see that every arrow counts.

484
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,800
Everyone, everyone,

485
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,110
the result of the drawing
of lots are coming out.

486
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,200
Fate has been written.

487
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,990
Whoever can win, other than luck,

488
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,030
it depends more on their skill.

489
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,480
Team One, Han Sheng Xiong
versus Feng Cheng Jun.

490

[Team One, Han Sheng Xiong

[Han Sheng Xiong versus Feng Cheng Jun.]

00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,200
We're in luck.

493
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,750
Only Feng Cheng Jun can
defeat Han Sheng Xiong.

494
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,390
Can you be more confident?

495
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,960
There's no need to use
a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

496
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,230
Everyone in our team can defeat him.

497
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,390
It doesn't have to be Mr Feng.

498
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,990
Look at those targets.

499
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,960
All I can see is just five red dots.

500
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,150
It's considered lucky if we can hit it,

00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,840
let alone hit it in the bullseye.

502
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,870
You're shattering our confidence.

Don't worry, competing
against this kind of guy,

509
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,960
it's still easy for me.

510
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,480
I've been blessed by God.

511

00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,720
He annoys me the most.

516
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,840
Don't be afraid.

517
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,360
Lei Ze Xin's performance
was unstable today.

Only Lu Zhao Rong and Wen Bin are left.

Doesn't matter whether
Zi Ming can win or not,

00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,920
as long as Lin Bing Shen could
compete against Lu Zhao Rong,

521
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,310
and take him down,

522

Don't worry, President.

00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,790
don't push yourself too hard,
the most important thing is your health.

Wen Bin,

537
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,390
you have to hit the bullseye.

538
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,030
Well,

539
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,030
if only you could spot the target clearly.

540
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,200
Thank you for your reminder, President.

541
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,480
Brother Wen Bin is so unlucky.

542
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,000
-Seriously.
-Why did it have to be the President?

543
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,440
I just hope Wen Bin won't lose miserably.

I doubt it.

545

What do you mean by lose miserably?

00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,960
-Wen Bin will win, stop your nonsense.
-That's right.

547
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,480
-Exactly.
-I doubt it.

548

This is so hard.

-It's too hard.
-What's so hard?

On the final round of
the previous archery ceremony,

551
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,310
Han Sheng Xiong was the contestant
who got nine points.

552
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,440
Competing against him,

553
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,200
Feng Cheng Jun has really
run into a tough opponent.

554
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,880
Feng Cheng Jun is using
his left hand to shoot.

555
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,510
For such a far shooting range,

556
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,630
if he uses his right hand right now,

557
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,960
I'm afraid it's beyond his strength.

558
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,030
-What's the matter?
-Use your right hand.

559

Why should I change it?

560
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,320
So arrogant.

What if you lose to Han Sheng Xiong later?

562

563
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,960
Yu Le Xuan is not an easy opponent.

564

On the final of the ceremony last year,

566
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,230
Wei Zhao Hui seems to have...

567
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,910
smaller chance of winning against him.

568
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,870
Then Team Three should be likely to win?

569
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,270
Lei Ze Xin has made a
ten-point shot just now.

570
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,560
It's hard to say.

571
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,150
Lei Ze Xin has entered
the academy for years,

572
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,840
but this is his first time
participating in the ceremony.

573
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,720
He's lacking experience.

574
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,990
-That's true.
-Then we're bound to win.

575

577
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,480
Lin Bing Shen's results...

578
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,270
from the previous ceremonies...

579
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,150
are much higher than Lu Zhao Rong's.

580
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,150
But Lu Zhao Rong
has improved amazingly...

581
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,550
in Feng Cheng Jun's team this year.

582
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,960
So which of them will win...

583
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,550
is still uncertain.

584
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,000
The winning shot...

585
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:01,200
lies on Lu Zhao Rong and Lin Bing Shen.

586
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,080
Mr Ding,

587
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,120
do you believe Wen Bin will win?

588
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:11,150
It would be hard for
Wen Bin to defeat Han Sheng Zhi.

589

can hit the bullseye now.

Han Sheng Xiong is really awesome.

He gets nine points every year.

Even this year.

595
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,910

Nice indeed.

597
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,870
But there is even a nicer one.

598
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,760
It's not that easy...

599
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,760
to hit the bullseye.

600
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,630
Brother Feng will hit it.

601
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,680
If he loses,

602
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,670
I'm going to beat him up.

603
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,670
What? Just him.

He's lucky.

608

Feng Cheng Jun, ten points.

609

00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,390
Sorry, I tried my best.

612
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,480
It's not your fault.
