Han Sheng Zhi's team won the second round.

7
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,070
One all. It's a draw.

8
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,110
-A draw?
-The first team is strong.

9
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,430
How can there be a draw?

10
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,150
Han Sheng Xiong and Yu Le Xuan
were selected by Han Sheng Zhi.

11
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,640
He has an eye for talent.

12
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,880
If he can win Feng Cheng Jun over
to his side,

13
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,550
they will win for sure.

14
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,110
This is an archery ceremony.

15
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,590
A close match is more exciting.

16
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,470
You're right.

17
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,790
Looks like I'm the fan favourite.

18
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,920
If you can't even beat Wei Zhao Hui,

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,240
it would be embarrassing.

20
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,350
Zhao Hui, don't be hard on yourself.

21
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,560
You still have us.

22
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,360
There are so many bull's eyes.

23
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,750
It's good enough
that you managed to score eight points.

24
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,040
I've tried my best.

25
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,560
Yu Le Xuan you twerp.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,400
Bring it on.

27
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,470
Ze Xin, it's your turn.

28
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,430
Just do your best.

29
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,360
You make it sound
as though I will lose for sure.

So this is God's plan.

35
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,440
If nothing unexpected happens,

36
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,430
Feng Cheng Jun’s team will win this round.

I beat Lei Ze Xin?

What's wrong with him?

41
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,840
-He got zero points?
-What's going on?

42
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,560
He's gotten weaker.

43
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,480
It shouldn't turn out this way.

44
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,390
What a shame!

45
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,550
You didn't pull hard enough, that's all.

46
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,960
Otherwise, you'd have nailed it.

47
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,990
That's right.

48
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,640
A loss is a loss.

49
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,560
No need to make excuses.

50
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,920
Little Brother is right.

51
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,430
It just needed more power.

52
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,200
All right.

53
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,120
President, looks like the game
is in the bag.

54
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,990
Why would you say that?

55
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,640
It... It's just a gut feeling.

56
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,310
You're up against Lu Zhao Rong next.

were to beat Lin Bing Shen,

-it'll only be a draw.
-That's right.

The last to play is Wen Bin.

62

He can never beat Han Sheng Zhi.

God answered my prayer. This is a miracle.

he can surely top that.

You really got us into trouble now.

Master Wang, calm down.

144
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,360
I'll take a look.

145
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,510
Are you going to report it to Master Wang?

146
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,680
Yes.

147
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,840
If Master Wang kicks them out
of Yun Shang Academy,

148
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,120
it will destroy the reputation
of the academy...

149
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,120
and of the scholars.

150
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,560
But they must be punished!

151
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,790
Do you realise what this means for them?

152
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,790
Their lives will be ruined forever.

153
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,560
Don't lose your cool.

154

Don't worry. Feng Cheng Jun
will know how to take care of it.

Is it bad? Can you still compete?

I don't think so.
Wen Bin, get your wound treated.

-I won't give up.
-Wen Bin.

We've overcome so many difficulties

171
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,070
This might sting.

172
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,760
Wen Bin.

173
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,040
Nice one!

174
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,480
[I don't expect you to win.]

175
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,710
[But I hope you'll embrace the challenge.]

176
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,920
[We can't decide our background.]

177
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,630
[But we can decide our own future
and the path that we take,]

178
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,560
[to pursue what you want...]

179
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,670
[and to change what you think is unfair.]

180
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,950
[You must prove all the naysayers wrong.]

181
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,710
[Even if you hit a dead end one day,]

182
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,750
[don't lose faith.]

183
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,270
[I'm here for you.]

184
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,520
[I'll participate
in the archery ceremony.]

185
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,950
[I will prove to you...]

186
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,270
[that women can do the things
that men can.]

187
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,870
[Please help me.]

188
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,710
[Give me a chance to prove myself
and fulfill my dreams.]

189
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,070
-Nice one!
-He hit it!

190
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,510
We won!

191
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,430
Wen Bin's performance is amazing.

192
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,670
That's right.

193
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,070
Wen Bin, ten points!

194
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,950
Wen Bin, ten points!

Wen Bin, ten points!

197
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,070
Ten points!

The winner
of this year's archery ceremony...

199
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,780
goes to Feng Cheng Jun's team!

200
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,920
Ze Xin, cheer up.

201
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,030
I'm happy.

202
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,520
You made me believe in miracles.

203
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,630
Thank you for your encouragement.

204
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,590
You must regret joining the wrong team.

205
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,360
Oh that's right.
We're not on the same team.

206
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,070
I've lost to you guys.

207
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,390
What a bummer.

208
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,550
Alright, I need to head back
and take care of my team mates.

209
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,070
See you.

210
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,510
That's so unexpected.

211
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,720
Isn't it?

212
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,600
Yeah.

213
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,120
Wen Bin performed really well today.

214
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,470
Look, don't underestimate Wen Bin.

215
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
I did it.

216
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,190
Good job.

217
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,590
You've won yourself a new lease on life.

218
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,830
Scholar Wen Bin,

219
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,030
never lose sight...

220
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,000
of your dreams and ambitions.

221
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,150
Work hard to realise them.

222
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,390
Yes.

223
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,270
Be careful in everything you do.

224
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,750
Don't worry. I'll be cautious.

225
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,360
Are you all right?

226
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,270
To think a president would stoop so low.

227
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,230
How shameless.

228
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,440
But we have no evidence.

229
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:09,470
Besides, we have got the result we want.

230
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,950
Just let it slide.

231
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,349
Things might turn ugly
if Master Wang finds out.

232
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,760
Mr. Ding said the same thing just now.

233
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,390
That's my brother.

234
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,430
Ladies, you have a nose for winners.

235
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,070
Go and claim your winnings!

236
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,760
Knowing Mr. Feng won
is enough for me.

237
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,870
You can keep the money.

238
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,630
Miss, that's very generous of you!

239
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,070
Thank you.

240
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,230
Take care.

241

Rise.

242
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,560
Wen Bin.

243
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,200
How did you get hurt?

244
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,070
Master Wang.

245
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,550
I aggravated an old wound...

246
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,000
while drawing the bow.

247
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,910
That's all.

248
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,030
But I'm fine now.

249
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,760
Wen Bin, you're very brave.

250
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,390
My hats off to you.

251
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,390
Lei Ze Xin.

252
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,440
This is the first time
I see you dressed appropriately.

253
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,240
I hope...

254
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,920
you'll apply yourself...

255
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,150
and become a great scholar.

256
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,720
Keep up the good work.

257
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,200
All of you have poured...

258
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,630
blood, sweat, and tears
into this archery ceremony,

259
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:41,030
especially Wen Bin and Feng Cheng Jun,

260
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,630
who created such a miracle.

261
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm very pleased.

262
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,550
I hope all of you
will keep up the good work,

263
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,750
and your perseverance and drive...

264
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,630
will rub off on other scholars,

265
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,110
and inspire them to realise
their own dreams.

266
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,390
Principal Feng.

267
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,560
Master Wang.

268
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
How will the academy...

269
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,840
reward them?

270
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,080
I intend...

271
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,920
to reward each of them
with 100 nobility marks...

272
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,800
and 1000 mace.

273
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,230
1000 mace?

274
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,880
What's the matter, Wen Bin?
You find that too much?

275
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
Not at all.

276
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,200
So you think it's too little, then?

277
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,160
Not at all. It's just right.

278
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,030
Jeez.

279
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,400
Thank Principal Feng.

280
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,430
No, don't thank me.

281
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,600
Thank Master Wang instead.

282
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,880
-Thank you, Master Wang.
-Thank you, Master Wang.

283
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,110
Thank you, Master Wang.

284

Let this slap...

285
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,600
be a reminder to you.

286
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,550
Don't get involved with hussies
like Mu Xiao Man anymore.

287
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,230
You hear me?

288
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,360
Loud and clear, Father.

289
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,680
You're so easily seduced.

290
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,270
That's why you lost the game.

291
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,230
A real man must be solid as a rock...

292
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,870
in everything that he does.

293
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,030
This slap...

294
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,480
is for losing the game.

295
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,070
As the president,

296
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,880
if you're not the best
in Yun Shang Academy,

297
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,750
you'll be stepped on by others.

298
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,000
I know, Father.

299
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,320
Don't you feel ashamed?

300
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,870
Don't you have the slightest conscience?

301
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,240
Why are you hitting me?

302
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,230
-I...
-I did that...

303
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,990
in hopes that we would win!

304
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,390
Have you lost your mind?

305
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,750
If Wen Bin hadn't kept mum to Master Wang,

306
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,280
it'd have been the end for us!

307
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,510
The buck stops here.

308
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,480
I won't implicate any of you.

309
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,950
You think the president
is out of the woods?

310
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,030
They have begun to suspect the president!

311
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,230
Can you use your loaf before you act?

[Room One of Upper Dorm]

313
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,350
Father, how did it go?

314
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:21,270
Why did you choose those idiots
as your team mates?

315
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,350
You muddlehead.

316
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,510
You should keep the top scholars in the
palm of your hand, not those idiots.

317
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,720
If you can't do that,

318
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,800
use your loaf and find a way
to have them expelled.

319
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,880
Otherwise, things are going to change
in the academy.

320
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,510
-Understood?
-Yes, Father.

321
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,990
If...

322
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,720
you make me lose face
in front of Master Wang again...

323
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,120
like how you did in today's game,

324
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,240
you'll never take up an official post.

325
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,440
You'll remain in Yun Shang Academy...

326
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,870
and be a king to those brats forever.

327
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,720
Yes, Father.

328
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,680
Why are you crying?

329
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,560
Get up!

330
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,080
Be like a man!

331
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,960
Why did he do that?

332
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,680
I guess he wanted to redress injustice
for his brother, Lei Ze Xun.

333
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,920
Tell Lei Ze Xin not to do
such a dangerous thing anymore.

334
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,950
His main task now...

335
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,430
is to study and take up an official post
as soon as possible.

336
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,990
Thank you for your magnanimity,
Master Wang.

00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,350
I'll give him a stern warning.

338
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,840
Have you investigated...

339
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,750
Wen Bin's family background?

340
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,440
I'll get to it as soon as possible.

341
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,840
Does it not hurt?

342
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,200
Of course it hurts!

343
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,350
Why don't you try it?

344
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,680
Why are you laughing, then?

345
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,440
I'm happy.

346
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,680
We actually won the game.

347
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,880
Next time, don't push yourself too hard.

348
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,390
You almost broke your hand.

349
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,720
The championship is important.

350
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,990
But what matters most is your safety.

351
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,070
Got it?

352
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,760
You can not have it both ways.

353
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,110
Brother Feng, if...

354
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,320
Be gentle.

355
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,030
Brother Feng, if it were you,

356
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,360
you wouldn't let the team to lose...

357
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,030
just for your own safety, right?

358
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,960
Wen Bin, I'm so proud of you.

359
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,350
My goodness, we actually won the game.

360
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,680
Your tenacity and willpower
have astounded everyone.

361
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,870
Brother Feng, it's because I had you
by my side.

362
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,840
I didn't do anything.

363
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,110
All the credit goes to you.

364
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,200
Just watching you is enough.

365
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,630
You may be scrawny.

366
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,720
But you're a real man.

367
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,720
What's wrong?

368
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,670
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

369
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,510
Excruciating.

370
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,400
I'll be gentle then.

371
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,560
Tell him yourself.

372
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,390
President.

373
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,350
I'm sorry.

374
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,600
I have wronged you.

375
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,080
I was the one who tampered with the bow.

376
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,920
But I did that...

377
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,600
to ensure your victory.

378
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,480
But I didn't expect...

379
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,630
that Wen Bin would...

380
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,750
He created miracle, right?

381
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,190
President.

382
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,630
I'm begging you.

383
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,110
Please forgive me.

384
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,150
Relax.

385
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,630
It's my fault...

386
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,030
for not being at the top of my game.

387
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,000
Sorry to let all of you down.

388
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,480
President.

389
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,840
No, it's not like that.

390
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,680
If you think...

391
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,350
you'll have a bright future
with Feng Cheng Jun and Wen Bin,

392
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,870
you may go to them.

393
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,870
Sheng Zhi, calm down.

394
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,870
That's right, President.

395
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,360
We'd never do that.

396
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,400
Neither will...

397
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,360
President.

398
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Just go.

399
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,880
-President.
-I don't want to see you again.

400
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,760
President.

401
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,640
Give me one more chance.

402
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:20,950
Get lost.

403
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,190
President.

404
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,680
I said, get lost.

405
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,230
President, can I not go?

406
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,960
President.

407
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,480
Get lost!

408
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,320
-Come on.
-President.

409
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,720
-Come on.
-President.

410
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,350
President.

411
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,390
-President, you can't just leave me!
-Come on.

412
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,670
Where's the other champion?

413
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,440
Ze Xin has a fever.
He's gone to Fu Ze Hall.

414
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:13,390
I didn't know a strong guy
like Lei Ze Xin could get a fever.

415
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,880
That's unbelievable.

416
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,950
How can I help you?

417
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,550
I want to invite you for a drink...

418
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,350
and bathe in the glory of your victory.

419
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,600
I'm flattered by your words.

420
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,920
But are you sincere?

421
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,670
I believed in you.

422
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,030
If you did, you should have been with us.

423
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,270
Otherwise, you're just lying.

424
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,200
Don't be so serious.

425
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,530
I've prepared a big celebratory meal
for you guys...

426
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,760
at Yu Le House, South Street.

427
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,760
Let's take the opportunity to unwind
and have fun.

428
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,230
It's been so stressful lately.

429
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,790
-That's right.
-I think...

430
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,350
Le Xuan is right.

431
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,750
We should take you up on your offer.

432
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,840
Isn't Mu Xiao Man performing tonight?

433
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,560
Don't bring her up.

434
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,880
Attendant Officer Han
chased Mu Xiao Man out...

435
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,320
when Master Wang came.

436
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,270
Besides, think about it.

437
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,630
Our president...

438
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,400
was thoroughly humiliated at the game.

439
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,960
The Student Council was in no mood
to host any performances.

440
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,390
Poor Ms. Mu.

441
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,230
All that effort and preparation,

442
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,390
and she couldn't perform
for her loved one.

443
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,870
We were looking forward it.

444
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,630
What a shame!

445
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,190
Not at all.

446
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,600
I think we should just...

447
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,790
take Le Xuan up on his offer...

448
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:29,120
and go to Yu Le House tonight
at South Street.

449
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,960
Let's drink till we drop.

450
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,400
My hand's injured. It's useless now.

451
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,390
I can't drink.

452
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,270
I'll buy you drinks once I recover.

453
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,600
Just take Brother Feng.

454
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,080
He'll drink with you.

455
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,720
I need to look after you.

456
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,790
Wen Bin, you think Brother Feng would
go without you?

457
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,750
-That's right.
-Without you guys,

458
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,440
it won't be fun.

459
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,000
As the team leader,

460
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,960
it's your duty
to take them out for celebration.

461
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,090
Wen Bin is right.

462
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,790
It's best if both of you come.

463
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,470
But if one doesn't show up,

464
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,430
the other must come. Right?

465
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,030
Go on.

466
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,880
[For Master Wang's eyes only]

467
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,670
[Father, Mother.]

468
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,230
[I will find a way...]

469
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,560
[to deliver this letter
to Wang Hao Zhen...]

470
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,600
[and redress the injustice.]

471
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,310
Who's that?

472
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,560
It's me.

473
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,630
[Mr. Wen, come in.]

474
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,990
-Mr. Wen.
-Ms. Mu.

475
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,720
Mr. Wen, how's your hand?

476
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,270
It's fine. It's only a scratch.

477
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,230
You agreed to perform at the academy
because of me.

478
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,320
Instead, you were humiliated.

479
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,600
I'm so sorry.

480
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,950
Mr. Wen, there's no need to apologise.

481
00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:00,110
I have only myself to blame
for my lowly status.

482
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,910
Ms. Mu, don't underestimate yourself.

483
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,270
Everyone is equal.

484
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,960
Don't worry. One day,
there'll be no more discrimination.

485
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,870
If only all the scholars
think like you do.

486
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,520
Talent is important.

487
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,080
But knowing how to respect people...

488
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,600
is the greatest virtue.

489
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,640
Here comes the wine
that I've kept for many years.

490
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,950
Here. Try some.

491
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,880
Fill it up.

492
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,920
You made a lot of money.

493
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,390
-It's a true vintage.
-Zhao Rong.

494
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,120
-I couldn't bear to open it.
-Here.

495
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Zhao Hui.

496
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,400
Here. Bottoms up!

497
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,520
Here.

498
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,880
-Bottoms up!
-Here.

499
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,120
-How is it?
-Nice.

500
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,270
Cheng Jun merely took a sip.

501
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,440
That's not the way.

502
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,600
I can't hold my liquor well.
Let's not let history repeat itself.

503
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,670
It's alright... I understand.

504
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,960
Mr. Chao, you're too easy on him.

505
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,510
We're here to get drunk.

506
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,360
Otherwise, it's no fun.

507
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,110
Besides, our team won.

508
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,600
You must drink it.

509
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,630
-Here.
-Come on.

510
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,480
We're gathered here today.

511
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,840
What matters is having a good time,

512
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,870
or as they say, "make merry".

513
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,720
If Mr. Feng won't drink,

514
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,880
how about a performance?

515
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,360
That would be just fine!

516
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,760
Yeah.

517
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,190
Good idea, Mr. Chao.

518
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,270
Cheng Jun, what will you perform for us?

519
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,600
I... Nothing.

520
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,030
Look.

521
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,110
How about nursery rhymes?

522
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,320
-That's good.
-I've come prepared.

523
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,040
Are you drunk already?

524
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,600
You expect Brother Feng
to sing nursery rhymes?

525
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,950
He's the heir of the Feng family.

526
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,840
How dare you?

527
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,880
That's exactly what we want.

528
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,700
A nursery rhyme by Brother Feng!

529
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,320
I...

530
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,200
I'll try.

531
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,800
Here.

532
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,800
"Kid."

533
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,360
-This is a good one.
-Are you kidding me?

534
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,560
Good luck.

535
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,310
I'm guessing the president
got distracted...

536
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,800
because of you.

537
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,240
The president has no eyes for anyone...

538
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,750
except you, Ms. Mu.

539
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,390
Love.

540
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,230
Once gone,

541
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,480
can never be the same again.

542
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,680
Forget what I just said.

543
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,320
Don't take it to heart.

544
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,480
I have other things on my plate.

545
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,590
I no longer think about relationships.

546
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,990
Don't worry.

547
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,950
I'm going to let nature take its course.

548
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,110
Our fate...

549
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,050
is not up to us.

550
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,720
It's great that you think that way.

551
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,790
"Kids, don’t be impatient."

552
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,760
"Spring Festival comes after Laba."

553
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,680
"We eat Laba porridge for several days."

554
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,670
"The 23rd day of the twelfth lunar month
is coming!"

555
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,480
"On the 23rd day, we have sticky
Tang'gua candy."

556
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,550
"On the 24th day, we sweep the house."

557
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,760
"On the 25th day, we make fried tofu."

558
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,840
"On the 26th day, we make lamb stew."

559
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,720
"On the 27th day,
we slaughter the chicken."

560
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,710
"On the 28th day, we ferment the dough."

561
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,920
"On the 29th day, we cook steamed buns."

562
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,920
On the 30th day, enjoy the night!"

563
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,469
"On the first day of the New Year,
we dance."

564
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,110
You should dance!

565
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,480
Look! He's shy.

566
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,230
This is heir of the Feng family
we're talking about.

567
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,719
To think he'd drink and dance
like the rest of us.

568
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,360
I'm really impressed.

569
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,480
Cheng Jun, you've put on quite a show.

570
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,030
I've got to hand it to you!

571
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,560
Your performance is even better
than Mu Xiao Man's.

572
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,469
Only by letting go of inhibitions...

573
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,830
can one live simply, freely, and happily.

574
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,230
-Indeed.
-Was it that entertaining?

575
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,310
Not only that. It was brilliant.

576
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,389
Mr. Chao, you know how to throw a party.

577
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,590
Tell me. How much did she pay you?

578
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,110
Don't ask me.

579
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,040
Ask Lady Han yourself.

580
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,640
Lady Han, tell them.

581
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,240
Say something.

582
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,150
Mr. Yu, you misunderstand.

583
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,320
I'm no longer the wayward girl...

584
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,910
who acts irresponsibly.

585
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,910
Lady Han is here to play the zither
and liven things up.

586
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,800
Play the zither?

587
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,760
That makes us Lady Han's friends, too.

588
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,160
What an honour!

589
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,480
Well, we are all ears.

590
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,280
Go on, Lady Han.

591
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,120
Come on.

592
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,550
We're all ears.

593
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,000
Come on.

594
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,120
[Yun Shang Academy]

595
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:34,950
Little brat!

596
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,790
Little brat!

597
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,070
I'm talking to you! Can't you hear me?

598
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,240
What do you want?

599
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,070
You pauper.

600
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,110
You hypocrite! You liar!

601
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,110
Show some respect.

602
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,150
Respect?

603
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,630
For what?

604
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,480
I respect others.

605
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,670
But do others respect me?

606
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,880
I have no time for this.

607
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,830
You've injured your hand.

608
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,510
But you still hit the targets.

609
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,760
Risking your life just to show off.

610
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,120
Seriously?

611
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,670
-It was you?
-That's right.

612
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,920
It was me. Didn't you know?

613
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,560
So what? Go to Master Wang
if you have the guts.

614
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:21,950
You're shameless.

615
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,390
Did you learn nothing here?

616
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,830
You're a disgrace to Yun Shang Academy!

617
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,880
You...

618
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,430
You've hit me again.

619
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,160
You've showed me up.

620
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,270
Are you happy now?

621
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,350
No one showed you up.

622
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,080
You asked for it!

623
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,320
You have no right to lecture me.

624
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,880
Let go of me!

625
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,320
Are you done?

626
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,550
I ended up like this because of him.

627
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,480
And he wants me to respect him?

628
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,400
The president has forsaken me.
Who'll respect me now?

629
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,320
All right. Knock it off.

630
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,350
If you want others to respect you,
you must first respect yourself.

631
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,160
You abused your connections with
the president to bully others...

632
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,160
and played dirty at the ceremony.

633
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,870
You expect others to respect you?

634
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,040
Can't you be a real man
and stop being so sneaky?

635
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,550
How can a man like you...

636
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,080
ever become a good official
and serve the people?

637
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,000
Look, he's insulting me.

638
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,390
Wen Bin, why don't you go back?

639
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,440
Wen Bin is right.

640
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,910
You should mend your ways.

641
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,560
You have no one to rely on but yourself.

642
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,030
All right. Stop crying.

643
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:49,910
Let's go.

644
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,920
Look at him.

645
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,910
What's up with Wen Bin?

646
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,080
Why would he come here to take a bath?
