[Episode 17]

4
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:21,950
Well, Brother Feng...

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,420
Brother Ze Xin said
tomorrow is Le Xuan's birthday.

6
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,320
But he is always upset on his birthday.

7
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,590
I want to cheer him up.

8
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:29,890
Let us get ready for it.

9
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,580
When you and Yu Le Xuan
were making money,

10
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,160
did you share it with Brother Feng?

11
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,970
You go to him when you need help.

12
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:41,100
Now, when you want to butter up
your business partner...

13
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,789
but have no money,
you come to him again.

14
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,580
What do you take him for?

15
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,460
Brother Feng is my brother!

16
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,500
But you?

17
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,850
You're lucky Le Xuan even considers
you his friend.

18
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,320
I treat him better than you do.

19
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,830
I'll show him your true colours.

20
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,710
Go ahead.

21
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,310
No wonder Yu Le Xuan asked me...

22
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,350
if I could only save either you or him,

23
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,240
who I would choose.

24
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,550
You...

25
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:06,960
Help me out.

26
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,919
Enough. Stop making this kind of joke.

27
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,740
He should be happy on his birthday.

28
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,680
Since we're celebrating his birthday

29
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,640
let's do it with a bang.

30
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,579
Sure.

31
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,350
Why don't we throw a birthday banquet?

32
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,670
Let us all have fun.

33
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,550
Sure.

34
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,600
Brother Feng
does treat Wen Bin differently.

35
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,030
Having a sworn brother is really useful.

36
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,610
Want to be our brother?

37
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,480
Behave yourself, then.

38
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,530
I'm not in the mood to join in the fun.

39
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,950
I'm used to being alone.
I don't join other people.

40
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,680
Let's go to his room.

41
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,220
You get all the guys there.

42
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:46,980
Senior,

43
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,440
we want to give him a surprise
at Yu Le House.

44
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,430
Do you have the keys?

45
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,080
Le Xuan sure made a lot of money,

46
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,020
I can't even afford a kitchen.

47

48
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:58,829

I thought we were having
a great time drinking.

Why must you take me home?
There's nothing here.

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
I want...

169
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,720
I want to think about how to use it.

170
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,000
Are you sure?

171
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,760
President, I heard it very clearly.

172
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,020
Shao Rong told Yi De...

173
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,970
they will celebrate
Le Xuan's birthday tonight.

174
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,360
[Yu Le House]

175
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,130
-Top me up!
-Come...

176
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,580
-Come, let's drink!
-Let's drink!

177
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,690
Nice one, Yu Le Xuan.

178
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,540
How dare you lie to me?

179
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,120
I shall see
what you have to say for yourself.

180
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,190
Thank you for celebrating my birthday
with me.

181
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,520
-Here's to all of you.
-Come.

182
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,790
You're all here.

183
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,520
What a joyful occasion.

184
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,570
What are you doing here?

185
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,110
What's wrong?
Am I not allowed to come here?

186
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,150
Just like you guys,

187
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,910
I'm here to drink.

188
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,170
Brother Ze Xin bought that wine.
Don't you drink it.

189
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,870
Have some respect you brat.

190
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,190
I'll teach you a lesson later.

191
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,450
Don't be so rude.

192
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,550
Today we're here
to give Le Xuan our birthday wishes.

193
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,110
Thank you for coming here, President.

194
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,170
Brother Le Xuan,

195
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,510
don't you have anything to tell me?

196
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,000
Or are you...

197
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,700
waiting for me to say it first?

198
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,230
Since everyone is here today...

199
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,650
and it's your birthday,

200
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,440
today's the perfect day
to make the decision.

201
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,200
Yun Shang Academy has been putting up
with a lowly pauper...

202
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,800
-for too long.
-What did you say?

203
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,660
It's time for him to wake up...

204
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,660
and go back where he belongs.

205
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,670
What do you think, Yu Le Xuan?

206
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,750
You're right.

207
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,380
I am a lowly pauper.

208
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,640
A few days ago,

209
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,550
there was a rumour...

210
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,740
about a student in the academy
who is masquerading as a nobleman.

211
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,010
Yes, that's me.

212
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,720
But, President,

213
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,590
as for the things that you told me to do,

214
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,430
let me tell you now,

215
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,530
I will never do it.

216
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,170
Are you sure?

217
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,840
Fine.

218
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,160
You will pay the price for fooling me.

219
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,810
Let's go.

220
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:06,850
You...

221
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,660
You... little brat,

222
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,220
you stepped on my foot.

223
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,780
My foot hurts so much right now!

224
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,900
What's that about?

225
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,190
When did I step on your foot?

226
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,560
You pushed me!

227
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,640
You...

228
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,330
Stop it. Drink up.

229
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,520
-Come. Sit down. That's right.
-Drink up.

230
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,800
-It'd be such a waste if we don't drink.
-Drink up.

231
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,730
To good luck!

232
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,900
-To heaven and earth!
-Come.

233
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,170
-That's right!
-Come.

234
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,440
-Come.
-Drink it.

235
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,720
Come, drink up.

236
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,770
You're...

237
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,360
We're here to drink wine.

238
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,020
-Come.
-Yes, let's drink wine.

239
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,200
-Come.
-Raise your glass.

240
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,460
How dare Yu Le Xuan fool me!

241
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,460
I knew something was off about him.

242
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,440
President, don't be angry.

243
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,620
I'm here. It'll be fine.

244
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,290
Who knew Yu Le Xuan would admit
to being a commoner?

245
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,320
He sure has guts.

246
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,430
Since it was his decision,

247
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,880
he shouldn't blame me.

248
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,700
You better think it through.

249
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:19,790
Don't forget,

250
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,440
we still need Yu Le Xuan's help.

251
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,330
He'll be useful
at the worshiping ceremony.

252
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,530
That's right!

253
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,300
Every year, during the worshiping
ceremony, Yu Le Xuan...

254
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,580
always ranks top three.

255
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,360
Exactly. With him at the ceremony,

256
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,010
our chances of winning
will be even greater.

257
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,680
Bing Shen.

258
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,630
Yes, President?

259
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,760
If you're any good,

260
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,860
would I need his help?

261
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,760
Think about the bigger picture.

262
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,340
The Student Council must
win the worshiping ceremony...

263
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,180
to preserve our reputation.

264
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,450
It's more important than ousting Wen Bin.

265
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,770
President... President!

266
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,450
President!

267
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,230
Don't you want to know...

268
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,120
what Han Sheng Zhi made me do?

269
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,320
It's up to you if you want to tell me.

270
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,200
I won't ask.

271
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,520
He wants me...

272
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,610
to kick you out of the academy.

273
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,360
More wine?

274
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,350
Top me up.

275
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,760
You are a good man.

276
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,980
You've chosen me over friendship
and money.

277
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,890
I will be your friend for life.

278
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,130
Cheers!

279
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,470
Cheers.

280
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,270
What did you want to do with the coupon?

281
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,540
What do I want?

282
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,390
I want you...

283
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,359
to call me your big brother.

284
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,150
What do you say?

285
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,869
Are you taking advantage of me?

286
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,910
What's the matter?
You don't want to do it?

287
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,400
I am a man of honour.
I will walk the walk.

288
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,800
Brother.

289
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,700
[From now on,]

290
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,330
[I will protect you like I would myself.]

291
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,420
[To protect you is to protect my hope.]

292
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,780
-Come!
-[My hope to fight against fate.]

293
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,360
I have to hand it to you.

294
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,070
You've revealed your identity
in front of all the students.

295
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,190
Such bravery.

296
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,430
You flatter me, Brother.

297
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,110
But this time
you broke your promise.

298
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,870
You didn't do what you had promised.

299
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,010
You should be glad
that the President is big-hearted.

300
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,610
I am very grateful
for your forgiveness, President.

301
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,560
I always treat a talented person
like Brother Le Xuan...

302
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,150
with sincerity.

303
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,840
So I hope...

304
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,190
you will abide...

305
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,670
by your duty as a member
of the Student Council.

306
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,230
Yes, the worshiping ceremony
is just around the corner.

307
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,030
You are our key player.

308
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,490
Emerge victorious
at the worshiping ceremony,

309
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,930
and you'd have redeemed yourself.

310
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,020
Is it more important
than kicking Wen Bin out?

311
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,390
Have you had breakfast?

312
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,040
-Sit down and eat with us.
-Come.

313
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,360
Thank you, President.
I shall leave if there's nothing else.

314
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,700
Sit down.

315
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,040
He's late.

316
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,400
-What happened?
-Mr Ding.

317
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,690
"As the shadow of the sword
and shooting stars drop,"

318
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,350
"the clouds arise."

319
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,470
The shooting stars described
in Yan Zhi Tui's poem...

320
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,880
refers to an astronomical
phenomenon called...

321
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,380
meteor shower.

322
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,870
According to the ephemeris
of Qin Tian Jian,

323
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,900
tomorrow night,

324
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,220
there will be
a spectacular meteor shower...

325
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,360
that has never been seen in centuries.

326
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,310
-Meteor?
-Meteor?

327
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,890
Guys, I've never seen a meteor in my life.

328
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,000
-Me neither.
-Meteor!

329
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,910
-Shall we go and see?
-Sure.

330
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,840
Have you ever seen a meteor?

331
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,010
I have not.

332
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,440
Meteor showers are rarely sighted...

333
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,150
because the time at which they appear
is unpredictable.

334
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,310
You have to find a vast land...

335
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,000
and observe all night.

336
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,500
Like the blooming of udumbara flower,

337
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,770
it is short...

338
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,400
and it can be missed easily.

339
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,330
Observe all night on a vast land?

340
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,120
But according to the rules,
we aren't allowed to stay out.

341
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,100
We won't get to see the meteors.

342
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,080
What a pity.

343
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,450
Brother Feng,

344
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,630
isn't it a shame if we don't get
to see the meteor shower of the century?

345
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,770
I think it's worth seeing.

346
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,140
Mr Ding!

347
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,000
-What's the matter?
-Feng Cheng Jun has something to say.

348
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,060
He does?

349
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,000
He has something to say?

350
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,940
Mr Ding, I think this astronomical
phenomenon is a great opportunity...

351
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,610
for the students
to learn outside the school.

352
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,660
-Brother Feng is right!
-Yes! Exactly!

353
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,630
-Yes!
-Great!

354
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,900
Mr Ding, like you said,
it's the meteor shower of the century.

355
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,980
Exactly!

356
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,200
If you don't allow us to go out,

357
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,800
it would not be reasonable.

358
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,210
Let us go, Mr Ding.

359
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,820
Are you all suggesting...

360
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,750
that you should be allowed
to spend the night out?

361
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,240
We're not going out for fun,
but to see a stellar phenomenon.

362
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,440
-Yes, Wen Bin is right!
-Even god has arranged it.

363
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,400
Please, sir.

364
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,740
-It's for...
-Oh, please.

365
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,400
He's right, sir. Let us go.

366
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,310
What is all this racket?

367
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,470
Explain yourselves!

368
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,310
Greetings, Principal Feng.

369
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,860
Mr Ding, what is happening?

370
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,040
Here's the thing.

371
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,580
Tomorrow night is the astronomical
phenomenon of the century.

372
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,080
The students would like
the academy's approval...

373
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,550
to stay out for the meteor shower.

374
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,150
Whose idea is this?

375
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,400
Students ought to focus on their studies.

376
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,190
What do they need to see meteors for?

377
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,120
Who wants to see the meteors?

378
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,250
That's right.

379
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,530
You should concentrate on your studies.

380
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,670
All of you were
making loud statement earlier on,

381
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,880
but why were you keeping quiet...

382
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,220
when Principal Feng was here?

383
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,300
We really want to see the meteors.

384
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,620
Mr Ding.

385
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,230
Come.

386
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,980
What's the matter, Principal Feng?

387
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:20,910
So...

388
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,730
So what's your opinion?

389
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,440
I think...

390
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,080
this is a great opportunity...

391
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,660
to improve
our students' cognitive ability.

392
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,490
I hope you'll approve of it.

393
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,350
Cheng Jun, if you wish to go,

394
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,780
just go.

395
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,830
Go ahead. All of you should go.

396
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,870
-Go right ahead!
-Yes, sir!

397
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,980
Let's go!

398
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,850
-Thank Principal Feng.
-Alright, go.

399
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,630
Thank you, Principal Feng!

400
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,150
We're going to see the meteors!

401
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,900
Wen Bin!

402
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,560
Want to see the meteors
at the hill tomorrow?

403
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,020
Yeah, join us.

404
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,300
Sure.

405
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,470
It's a promise.

406
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,270
Put on more clothes.

407
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,190
Alright.

408
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,140
Brother Feng!

409
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,620
That's night time.

410
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,820
-It's fine.
-Little Brother.

411
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,180
Where are you going to see the meteors?
Want to join us?

412
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,550
I'm going to Qiuming Island.

413
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,710
The view is better there.

414
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,640
How about you?
Want to come with me?

415
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,470
Qiuming Island is too far.

416
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,960
I promised Mo Xiao Huan to go
to the hill behind the academy.

417
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,420
The view over there is poor.

418
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,770
It's worse than Qiuming Island.

419
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,640
What if...

420
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,400
What if we all go to the island?

421
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,090
There are only a few boats
to Qiuming Island.

422
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,300
They can't carry us all.

423
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,060
[Everyone is going to the hill,]

424
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,940
[but you're going
to Qiuming Island alone?]

425
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,370
[Why must you be so different...]

426
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,530
[and individualistic?]

427
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,900
[What a drag.]

428
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,380
Little Brother.

429
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,660
Go on your own, then.

430
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,240
Mr Yu, I beg you.

431
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,150
Please help me one more time.
Just this once.

432
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,720
It's not that I don't want to help.

433
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,020
But you're going
to spend a night on the island...

434
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,630
with Feng Chen Jun.

435
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,930
If your brother finds out,

436
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,310
he will surely kill me.

437
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,780
Don't worry. Mr Feng is a gentleman.

438
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,490
I could spend ten days with him.

439
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,390
You're blinded by love.

440
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,770
We're not even on the same page.

441
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,830
All you want is to spend time
with Feng Cheng Jun.

442
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,450
All I'm worried about
is your brother's wrath.

443
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,490
Look. if you, Xiao Qin and I
don't say a word,

444
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,710
Mr Feng wouldn't, either.

445
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,430
How would my brother know, then?

446
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,400
You can't contain a fire with paper.

447
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,830
Miss, don't give me a hard time.

448
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,250
I only have one life.

449
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,150
Name your price. I will give you anything.

450
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,210
No. Sorry but it's beyond my power.

451
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,100
Mr Yu.

452
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,700
Mr Yu!

453
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,520
Fine. Let's go, Xiao Qin.

454
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,820
Boatman,

455
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,740
if a young man gets on your boat,

456
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,600
please don't set out immediately.

457
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,090
Stall him out.

458
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,110
Leave only when a second person comes.

459
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:20,990
Understand?

460
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,380
Must there be two people?

461
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,480
You must wait for a second person.

462
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,560
Sure, miss. Don't worry.

463
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,000
Are you sure this is the only boat...

464
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,370
that goes to Qiuming Island?

465
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,630
Yes. Not many people
go to Qiuming Island.

466
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,370
I'm the only one who goes there.

467
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,160
The other boats won't go there.

468
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,680
Great.

469
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,320
[Observation Dock]

470
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,000
-How did it go?
-Young Lady.

471
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,990
Everything's ready, don't worry.

472
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,180
Better do it than wish it done.

473
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,300
We'll do it ourselves.

474
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,140
Stack them properly.

475
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,140
Alright.

476
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,220
Have you heard of this celestial legend?

477
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,500
What's that?

478
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:06,080
Legend has it, the meteors from the sky...

479
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,500
come from the Heavenly River.
The Cowherd...

480
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,270
The Heavenly River?

481
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,530
What is that?

482
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,850
Haven't you heard of the Heavenly River?

483
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,990
The Heavenly River...

484
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,440
is the river that separates
the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl.

485
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,200
The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl?

486
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,420
Stop interrupting me.

487
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,000
Alright. Go on.

488
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,920
Legend has it,

489
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,590
the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl
were separated.

490
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,800
Her tears kept dropping
as she was missing him.

491
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,850
The tears accumulated...

492
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,010
and turned into the meteors.

493
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,740
What a beautiful legend.

494
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,610
It is said that
if a couple makes a wish...

495
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:47,070
when they see a meteor,

496
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,290
their wish will be fulfilled.

497
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,140
Make a wish together?

498
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,260
Must they be together?

499
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,460
They must be together.

500
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,610
Unfortunately,

501
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,390
the nerds at Yun Shang Academy...

502
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,190
won't be seeing the meteors
with their loved ones.

503
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,290
Instead, they're going
to the hill together.

504
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,460
Wen Bin,

505
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,970
but you're different.

506
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,790
You have a crush.

507
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,650
How can you let this opportunity
go to waste?

508
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,840
A crush?

509
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,960
Don't talk nonsense.

510
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,800
I said it wrong. I mean...

511
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,340
You are Ms Mu's crush.

512
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,600
Rather than making fun of me,

513
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,500
why don't you worry about yourself?

514
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,790
I have nothing to worry about.

515
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,860
I never worry about this kind of thing.

516
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,710
I heard Feng Cheng Jun...

517
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,430
will travel to the island alone.

518
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,830
He is the most popular
husband candidate...

519
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,520
among the noblewomen of our town.

520
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,820
I doubt no one...

521
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,120
is yearning for him.

522
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,950
My lord, this is it.

523
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,190
My lord, this house was abandoned.

524
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,300
Go inside and see.

525
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,180
Yes.

526
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,140
My lord, I've got news.

527
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,020
Where is he?

528
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,430
Someone saw him at San Shen Temple
in the Western District.

529
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,350
San Shen Temple?

530
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,850
Now that makes sense.

531
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:21,990
Get the horse ready!

532
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,870
Yes!

533
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,520
[I mustn't let these guys...]

534
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,010
[find Ke Shi Jun first.]

535
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,440
[Observation Dock]

536
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:44,690
Brother Feng.

537
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,440
Little Brother.

538
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,400
Why are you here?

539
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,540
I've thought about it.

540
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,630
Since it's the phenomenon of the century,

541
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,110
I think it's better to go somewhere...
with a better view.

542
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,050
Why the sudden change of mind?

543
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,830
It wasn't sudden at all.

544
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,550
What's the matter?

545
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,700
Don't you want me to go with you?

546
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,510
Of course I want you to come.

547
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,650
But didn't you promise the others?

548
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,450
You're breaking your promise.

549
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,550
No, it's okay.

550
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,810
I've told them.

551
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,500
Besides, they won't even miss me.

552
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:14,970
But you're alone.

553
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,860
How can I leave you alone?

554
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,140
Boatman, let's set out.

555
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,140
Sure.

556
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,780
Take a break.

557
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,080
-Are you going out?
-Yes.

558
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,100
You've worked hard.

559
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,030
Excuse me.

560
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,890
Boatman!

561
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,110
Boatman!

562
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,590
Boatman!

563
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,550
Boatman, come back!

564
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,360
Come back! I haven't got on the boat!

565
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,810
Boatman, I haven't got on the boat!

566
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,420
Come back!

567
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,880
Boat...

568
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,150
Isn't that...

569
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,680
Wen Bin?

570
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,720
Brother Feng, hurry up.

571
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,040
Where did the boat go?

572
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,460
Didn't he say he'd wait with us?

573
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,510
Why would he leave?

574
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,530
What should we do without the boat?

575
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,840
It's fine.

576
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,350
We don't know when the meteor
shower would start anyway.

577
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,930
I guess he doesn't want to wait.

578
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,710
He will pick us up tomorrow morning.

579
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,080
Why don't we go to the hilltop...

580
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,550
before it gets dark?

581
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:47,790
Come.

582
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,700
We didn't bring anything.
How do we sleep here?

583
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,350
[It must have been left behind
by Ke Shi Jun.]

584
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,060
[I can't leave any traces
to the Imperial Brigade.]

585
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,870
Boatman, I paid you the money,

586
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,470
how could you leave without me?

587
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:12,010
The girl only told me
to wait for two people.

588
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,860
I didn't know one of them was you.

589
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,160
You made a mistake!

590
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,690
Boatman, please take me to the island.

591
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,070
I'll pay you extra.

592
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,520
It doesn't matter.

593
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,230
Miss, look. The weather is changing.

594
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,590
We can't set out now.

595
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,280
It's just windy, boatman.

596
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,750
If you can take me to the island,

597
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,720
I'll pay you anything.

598
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,920
We really can't set out.
Miss, just go home already.

599
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,760
Boatman... boatman!

600
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,310
Why is no one else here?

601
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,900
Who else?

602
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,460
It's nice that no one else
is meteor gazing here.

603
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,590
Just you and me. It's quite peaceful.

604
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,750
Let's see the meteors here.

605
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,370
Isn't the view there better?

606
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,320
No, it's high and steep.

607
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,610
It's hard to get up there.

608
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,570
Are you afraid of heights?

609
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,090
Me? No way.

610
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,530
So you're looking down on me.

611
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,840
You don't think I'd make it?

612
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,300
Fine. Let's race.

613
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,500
I'll see you at the top.

614
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,760
Sure.

615
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,980
I will count to three.

616
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,239
Alright.

617
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:23,630
Ready.

618
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,840
Go there.

619
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,420
One,

620
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,570
two, three!

621
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,770
Now...

622
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,449
you finally know
the importance of medicine.

623
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,909
Sir, may I know what herbs these are?

624
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,139
Come.

625
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,240
-Astragalus,
-Astragalus.

626
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,610
-Zhi Mu,
-Zhi Mu.

627
00:34:58,810 --> 00:34:59,740
schisandra fruit,

628
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,810
white mulberry bark,
ophiopogon tuber.

629
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:02,910
-ophiopogon tuber.
-Say,

630
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,590
this is one sick patient.

631
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,370
What's his sickness?

632
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,270
Tuberculosis.

633
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,840
Tuberculosis?

634
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,780
Can it be cured?

635
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,760
It's tough.

636
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,410
It's a chronic illness.

637
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,440
He needs to be on long-term medication.

638
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,340
Thank you for your guidance.

639
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,970
If you really want to thank me,

640
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,190
come to my class often.

641
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:33,670
You won.

642
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,250
Are you sure?

643
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,600
I'm sure. Didn't you get here first?

644
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,550
Why don't you look tired at all?

645
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,280
You were right. I'm afraid of heights.

646
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,970
That's why I didn't dare to run too fast.

647
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,290
Liar.

648
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,440
I bet you let me win.

649
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,500
What's wrong?
Aren't you happy that you've won?

650
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,970
Of course I'm happy that I could beat you.

651
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,300
See? Happiness is the most important.

652
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,980
Doesn't matter if I let you win or not.

653
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,690
So, to make me happy,

654
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,070
will you let me win forever?

655
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:10,170
Well, it depends on what it is about.

656
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,440
But if I can make you happy,

657
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,600
why not?

658
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,840
You do have great taste.

659
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,210
The view here is breathtaking.

660
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,770
Luckily you insisted on coming here,

661
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,030
or we wouldn't have seen
such an amazing view.

662
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,250
That's because you let me win.

663
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:26,870
What?

664
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,200
Let's collect firewood.

665
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,580
Whose medication is this?

666
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,500
Ke Shi Jun's.

667
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,520
When I was following Commander Xu,

668
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,480
I heard them say...

669
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,660
Ke Shi Jun was spotted
around San Shen Temple.

670
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,380
When I got there,

671
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,120
he had escaped.

672
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,190
All that's left was this medication.

673
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,760
He has tuberculosis?

674
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,010
You're cleverer than you seem.

675
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,040
Do you think I'm uneducated like you?

676
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,760
I know, I know. You're the best.

677
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,470
Then do you know where one
might have these herbs prescribed?

678
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,060
Only the medical hall
in South Street Market...

679
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,050
could've prescribed all these herbs.

680
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,170
Are you planning...

681
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,080
to wait for him at the medical hall?

682
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,450
Forget about it.

683
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,440
I guess Ke Shi Jun
has left the town already.

684
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,730
He must still be here.

685
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,250
The brigade is searching
the city for him.

686
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,540
He has nowhere to run.

687
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,700
Little Brother, you're a genius.

688
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,220
I should learn from you.

689
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,760
What's so great about this?

690
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,940
You're a high-born man.

691
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,620
You could ask your servant to make fire.

692
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,960
But I'm different.

693
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,470
If I can't make fire,

694
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,880
I'll have nothing to eat.

695
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,910
After you teach me,

696
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,470
I'll handle it in the future.

697
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:00,950
In the future?

698
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,090
With you?

699
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,330
With you by my side,

700
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,890
I feel happy every day.

701
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,940
It's too early...

702
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,680
to talk about the future now.

703
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,500
Brother Feng,

704
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:22,000
you're so kind to your sworn brother.

705
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,990
I'm sure you will make a great husband.

706
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,720
Since you have faith in me,

707
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,680
I'll try my best to be a good husband.

708
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,910
I wish I were a girl.

709
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,940
Why?

710
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,520
If you were a girl,

711
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,020
we wouldn't have met.

712
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:44,650
We wouldn't even be having
this conversation.

713
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,210
I... I was afraid that
once you've found a wife,

714
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,790
you wouldn't be so nice to me.

715
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,970
That's impossible.

716
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,140
A brother is a brother. A wife is a wife.

717
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,340
There's no conflict between them.

718
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,390
Brother Feng, you've been so nice to me,

719
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,780
but I still wish
that you'll always be nice to me.

720
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,290
I'm really greedy.

721
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:10,940
No, you're not.

722
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,910
Since you're my brother,

723
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,250
it's my duty to always be nice to you.

724
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,140
One day, if I'm not nice to you,

725
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,370
it'd be my fault.

726
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,690
But I'm still worried
that once you're married,

727
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,440
you wouldn't be nice to me anymore.

728
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,090
I'm single now, aren't I?

729
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,470
Why do you think so far ahead?

730
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,830
Do I?

731
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:40,590
Brother Feng,

732
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,680
if something means a lot to you,

733
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,570
but you will never get anything out of it,

734
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,210
will you do it?

735
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,160
I will.

736
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,940
Although the result is important,

737
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,230
the process will mean a lot more.

738
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,830
I don't know what it is that means
a lot to you,

739
00:39:58,910 --> 00:39:59,950
but...

740
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,790
if it is your dream,

741
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,580
I suggest you keep going.

742
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,460
If it's something personal...

743
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,390
What will you do?

744
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,430
I think you shouldn't be too adamant.

745
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:14,110
Because many things in life
are not up to us.

746
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,480
Is that so?

747
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,940
The cloud is so thick.

748
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,730
We won't be able to see the meteors.

749
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,510
All that effort traveling here
for nothing.

750
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:30,960
It's fine.

751
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,720
It's quite fun
to have a heart-to-heart talk...

752
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,030
with you all night.

753
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,810
The process means a lot more.

754
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,130
[Brother Feng is right.]

755
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,030
[Had he known that I'm a girl
from the very beginning,]

756
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,860
[I'd never have had the chance
to spend time with him.]

757
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,280
[My feelings for him
are not going anywhere,]

758
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,800
[but I shouldn't be upset.]

759
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,420
[Just like what Brother Feng said,]

760
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,470
[the process matters, too.]
