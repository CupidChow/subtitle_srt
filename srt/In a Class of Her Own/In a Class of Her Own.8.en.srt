[Episode 8]

4
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,690
Waiter, order please.

5
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,450
What would you like, sir?

6
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,560
Can I ask you something?

7
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,920
Yesterday, was there
a bullying incident...

8
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,910
and two scholars came forward to help?

9
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,560
I'll tell you,

10
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,400
but please keep it to yourself.

11
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,090
The two scholars didn't break
the statue on purpose.

12
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,630
The bully had pushed
the smaller-sized scholar...

13
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,530
and he accidentally
crashed into the statue.

14
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,880
Our shopkeeper knew
the two bullies wouldn't pay up.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,840
So he made the scholars
bear responsibility.

16
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:04,050
Did anyone else witness
what happened yesterday?

17
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,640
Well...

18
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,600
Sorry about that, mister.

19
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,000
Thank you.

20
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,570
I shall not trouble you.

21
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,050
Hey, your book!

22
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,480
I suppose this is the price to pay
for being tied to Lei Ze Xin.

23
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,490
Now, everyone is scared of me.

24
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,320
Brother Ze Xin doesn't care about
improving his relationship with others.

25
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,240
I think it's a lost cause.

26
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,200
Actually, Lei Ao is an easy person
to understand.

27
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,120
He can be persuaded by reason,
not force.

28
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,210
Try acting pitiful in front of him,

29
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,650
appeal to his empathy.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,880
Perhaps that could soften him.

31
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,320
When he softens up,

32
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,600
you'll be able to control him.

33
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,000
Control him?

34
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,400
You're exaggerating.

35
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,240
You'll never know until you try.

36
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,400
Well, how am I supposed to act pitiful?

37
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,800
You're already looking pitiful right now.

38
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,440
But, you could be a bit more whiny
when you speak.

39
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,430
Like this.

40
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,680
Senior Lei, please help me.

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,170
That's just like a girl.

42
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,120
Yes.

43
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,680
You need to resemble a girl.

44
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,160
Why don't you give it a try?

45
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,360
I'll check your performance.

48

What's the matter?

49
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,960
Well... Wen Bin,
you've got a knack for it.

50
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,320
A knack for what? I just imitated you.

51
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,920
So Brother Ze Xin is going to
listen to me if I do that?

52
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,360
Don't worry.

53
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,720
I'm sure it'll work.

But I left when the fight broke out.

were being thrown everywhere.

that I could get into Yun Shang Academy.

She also said...

00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,550
She also asked me to introduce
some talented scholars to her.

Mr. Feng.

112
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:25,770
Sorry to intrude, Ms. Han.

113
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,090
Not at all.

114

I'm delighted to see you again.

115
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,590
Please tell me what you need.

116
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,570
I'm here because I need your help.

117
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,890
Tell me.

I'm happy to help if I can.

119
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:41,919
I heard from Ms. Xiao Qin...

120
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,810
that you were at Mingren Tavern
last night...

121
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,400
when the scuffle happened.

122
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,610
I was.

123
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:54,290
But it wasn't a scuffle
like what you think.

124
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,410
It was just two scholars
trying to uphold justice...

125
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,770
by punishing bullies.

126
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,210
Just as I thought.

127
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,480
Would it too much to ask you
to bear witness?

128
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,960
I'll be glad to.

129
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,890
What a coincidence you're here.

130
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,450
The young lady happens
to have a gift for you.

131
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,610
Give it to him, Young Lady.

132
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,800
This is for you.

133
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,570
That is a too precious gift, Ms. Han.

134
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,530
I'm afraid I can't accept.

135
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,410
It's not anything expensive.

136
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,850
It's only a pouch I made myself.

137
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:36,080
Ms. Han, the meaning of this gift
is more than what it costs.

138
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,250
I really can't accept it.

139
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:43,450
Mister, you're breaking
the young lady's heart.

140
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,350
Look at her hand.
Her fingertips are all pricked.

141
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,620
Why are you rejecting me so firmly?

142
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,980
Is it because you think
I'm not good enough for you?

143
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,370
Not at all, Ms. Han.

144
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,130
I'm devoted to my studies.

145
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,970
I have no interest in matters of love.

146
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,450
I hope you understand.

147
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,290
But, since you won't accept my gift,

148
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,320
are we still friends?

149
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,290
Of course we are.

150
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,530
I mean friends who are always in touch
and in each other's minds.

151
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,570
Mr. Li.

152
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,200
These are signatures of
two thirds of the scholars...

153
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,890
that support the notion of expelling
Wen Bin and Lei Ze Xin.

154
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,010
You got it done quickly.

155
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,920
The President is really efficient.

156
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,250
This is what the scholars want.

157
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,920
I did nothing to interfere.

158
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,210
I guess Wen Bin and Lei Ze Xin
are bound to be kicked out then.

159
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,000
The teacher is here!

160
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,760
-The teacher is here.
-He's here.

161
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,920
The test question this time
is a little tricky.

162
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,350
You can find it on your desk.

163
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,960
You may begin now.

164
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,720
Wake up.

165
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,410
Stop dozing off!

166
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,130
I'm not sleeping.

167

[Mr. Li.]

170
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,310
I found a witness that can prove...

171
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,470
that Lei Ze Xin and Wen Bin
were indeed standing up for the weak...

172
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,000
during the incident last night.

173
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,950
Feng Cheng Jun.

174
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,240
Did you think simply finding someone...

175
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,590
would save Wen Bin?

176
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,960
I'm not faking anything.

177
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,990
The witness I found is actually
your younger sister, Han Shu Min.

178
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,710
You have to be observant.

179
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,070
Pay careful attention.

180
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,350
That's how you can draw a good painting.

181
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,430
Lei Ze Xin,

182
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,070
why aren't you drawing?

183
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,230
-Senior.
-Who?

184
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,150
Very good.

185
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,030
At least you opened your eyes once
during my class.

186
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,390
Draw!

187
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,030
Continue drawing.

188
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,150
Draw.

189
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,390
Senior,

190
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,430
you did a wonderful job today.

191
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,710
Keep it up...

192
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,750
and everyone would stop
being prejudiced against us.

193
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,150
When that happens,
we'll tell them the truth.

194
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,630
They will be more understanding.

195
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,250
Brother Bin.

196
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,910
Brother Feng.

197
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,630
You missed all the classes today.

198
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,230
Did something happen at home?

199
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,630
Principal Feng wants you two
at Diligence Pavilion.

200
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,350
Principal Feng.

201
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,230
Please give us one more chance.

202
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,180
We promise to do a good job.

203
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,250
Look at Senior Lei.

204
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,360
He's turned over a new leaf.

205
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
Seeing Lei Ze Xin like this...

206
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,800
does feel a little odd.

207
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,360
Principal Feng just praised you.

208
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,710
Be serious, you two.

209
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,840
The investigation into the incident
at the tavern has concluded.

210
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,550
You two were found
to have acted out of justice.

211
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,160
The school will continue to monitor
your actions and performances.

212
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,870
During this period,

213
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,260
you will have to maintain
good grades in all subjects.

214
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,290
If you fail to achieve
satisfactory results,

215
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,170
you will still be expelled.

216
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,670
Do you understand?

217
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,910
But, how did you find out...

218
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,360
that Senior Lei and I
acted out of justice?

219
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,880
Feng Cheng Jun found you guys a witness.

220
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,600
Senior, we would've been kicked
if it's not for Brother Feng.

221
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,320
We need to thank him properly.

222
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,930
He's just a hypocrite.

223
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,610
How could you say that?

224
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,300
Junior, here's a word of advice for you.

225
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,100
People like him want to
win popular support.

226
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,850
You're just biased towards him.

227
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,090
If that's what you think,
you won't need my help.

228
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,010
Senior, please help me out.

229
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,210
Senior...

230
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Senior.

231
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,380
Brother Feng.

232
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,970
Don't you have anything to say to us?

233
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:28,920
Like what?

234
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,050
You were missing the whole day.

235
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,290
Where were you?

236
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,040
I had some personal matters
to take care of.

237
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:40,840
Are you done with them?

238
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,280
Yes, I am.

239
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,660
My matter has been taken care off too.

240
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,040
I can stay in school.

241
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,330
Is that so?

242
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,440
I'm happy for you.

243
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,720
It's too early to be happy.

244
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,920
They're going to monitor
our future performance.

245
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,680
I'm all right for now.

246
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,860
But Senior Lei may be at risk.

247
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,960
Pathological liar.

248
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,930
Don't expect me to thank you.

249
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,410
I don't do things for others to thank me.

250
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,599
[How odd.]

251
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,160
[He used to be all philosophical with us.]

252
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,319
[But now, he hardly says anything.]

253
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,190
Wen Bin.

254
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,600
I've always supported you.

255
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,640
Destroying public property.

256
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,720
And all you got is sweeping
fallen leaves in the courtyard.

257
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,240
I don't get it.

258
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,060
You're one cunning lad, Wen Bin.

259
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,850
You buttered up Feng Cheng Jun
the moment you came here.

260
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,610
And now, even Lei Ze Xin has your back.

261
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,120
I underestimated you.

262
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,680
They learned what happened
at the tavern.

263
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,480
If you have doubts about Principal Feng's
decision, go appeal to him.

264
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,840
Stop trying to label me.

265
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,480
You've got the skills, right?

266
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,890
I bet you wish to beat me up some more.

267
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,970
You can have another go at me.

268
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,880
Come on.

269
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,120
I'm standing right here. Hit me.

270
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,570
Senior, we're under probation.

271
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,970
I can't believe Lei Ze Xin chickened out.

272
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,250
Are you asking for a beating?

273
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,920
They're doing it on purpose.
Don't fall for it.

274
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,510
Okay.

275
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,760
Very well.

276
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,920
I'll wait and see how much longer
rule-breakers like you...

277
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,930
can stay tamed.

278
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,410
That arrogant...

279
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,160
Senior, you missed the morning classes.

280
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,490
You can't do that.

281
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,920
Mr. Ding's class is this afternoon.
Be there!

282
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,050
Four Books and Five Classics is boring.

283
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,290
I'm not attending.

284
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,120
That Mr. Ding knows
what he's talking about.

285
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,330
You have to go.

286
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,730
Plus, I heard he has
his own way of teaching.

287
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,850
Maybe you'd like it.

288
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,760
No thanks.

289
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,600
Fine, I'll go.

290
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,910
[Master Ke Shi, Qin Bei Chuan]

291
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,650
[Are all the teachers' manuscripts here?]

292
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,440
[The newly joined teacher
hasn't submitted his manuscript.]

293
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:11,970
You scared me!

294
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,050
Principal Feng.

295
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,560
That jar's workmanship is exquisite.

296
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,440
You have a good eye.

297
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,850
I went to great lengths to acquire it.

298
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,240
Today, Mr. Ding Ruo Yang
is having his first lesson.

299
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,600
Aren't you going to inspect?

300
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,180
There's no need.

301
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,410
There's Feng Cheng Jun
doing the inspection.

302
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,600
Filling this jar with flowers...

303
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,360
is the pressing matter.

304
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,210
Brother Feng. Feng...

305
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,010
Junior.

306
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,550
Excuse me.

307
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,960
Lei... Lei Ao.

308
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,000
Are you actually here
for Four Books and Five Classics?

309
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,320
Do you know, Wen Bin? Even Principal Feng
couldn't get him to attend classes.

310
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,640
You proved to me how so much
could change in a short time.

311
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,970
Pardon me, pardon me.

312
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,010
Come on.

313
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,480
Come on, we're going to be late.

314
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,770
Oh dear, we're late.

315
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,640
Senior, you agreed to behave
in front of Mr. Ding. Now, get up!

316
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:08,210
I'll naturally get up
if his teaching is good.

317
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,330
Hey.

318
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:10,770
The teacher is here!

319
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,680
-Teacher is here.
-He's here. Come on.

320
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,450
Greet the teacher.

321
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,410
Sit.

322
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,530
I'm Ding Ruo Yang.

323
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,360
I teach the Five Classicals at Yun Shang.

324
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,650
We'll begin the lesson.

325
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,760
Sir.

326
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,000
Sir, I have a question to ask.

327
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,170
What does this good brother
wish to know? Ask away.

328
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,610
You flatter me, sir.

329
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,160
No matter how eager I look,
I wouldn't dare call myself your brother.

330
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,280
I'd like to know
how you grade this subject.

331
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,640
Can you tell us?

332
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,320
I'll tell you. Sit.

333
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,760
In my class,

334
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,360
if you fail five times,

335
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,720
you lose your spot at the imperial exam.

336
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,490
So, it all depends on you.

337
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,120
I hope everyone...

338
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,000
can fill this jar up...

339
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,590
with your sincerity.

340
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,290
Based on the amount
of sincerity you put in,

341
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,200
I will decide whether or not to pass you.

342
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,570
Let's start with you.

343
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,640
[He's openly asking for money?
How could he?]

344
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,560
[Nothing but a greedy man.]

345
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,840
[He can't be the one who left the note.]

346
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:18,960
Principal Feng.

347
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,170
Did you see my precious jar?

348
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,810
Mr. Ding took it.

349
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,840
What? He took it?

350
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,200
Is the school his house?

351
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,290
He's simply taking things.

352
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,890
He didn't just take it,
he's basically a robber.

353
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,270
Did he rob something?

354
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,240
He's accepting bribes from his class.

355
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,730
How dare he accept bribes
from the class?

356
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,020
That's unacceptable!

357
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,930
Trying to make easy money
at Yun Shang Academy?

358
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,890
I will not let that happen!

359
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,980
That's right.

360
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,580
-He must be punished!
-Wait...

361
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,120
Do you think he can really
make easy money here?

362
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,140
I'm so touched.

363
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,290
You guys must have thought
this was a treasure bowl.

364
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,090
In my eyes,

365
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,520
this is a magic bowl.

366
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,760
Magic bowl?

367
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,470
What's a magic bowl?

368
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,810
Who knows?

369
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,480
Incredible!

370
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,890
It's still coming.

371
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,930
-Amazing!
-That's incredible!

372
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,720
Mr. Ding is amazing!

373
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,600
Amazing!

374
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,040
It's magic!

375
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,050
This is brilliant!

376
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,800
Yes, it is.

377
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,400
Amazing...

378
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,650
I want to know how to do it.

379
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,810
What's happening?

380
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,170
What is it?

381
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,640
That amazing!

382
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,210
-It appeared out of nowhere!
-Here.

383
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:12,610
Try it!

384
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,990
Sir.

385
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,680
Please stop.

386
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,430
Trying to stand out again.

387
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,890
What is it you want?

388
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,840
Please stop doing such tricks
and waste our time.

389
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:31,770
What?

390
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,530
Don't you guys think it's fun?

391
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,210
-It is.
-It's fun!

392
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,850
If fun is what you guys wanted,

393
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,370
you could just hire a magician.

394
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,850
That would be more exciting.

395
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,290
But this is a classroom.

396
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,840
There is a sentence in "The Analects",

397
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,200
"Be flexible in learning."

398
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,400
It means a person lacking in knowledge...

399
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,060
easily finds himself confined
within narrow walls.

400
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,040
They become stubborn.

401
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,680
Hence why we must never cease
inquiring knowledge.

402
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,200
Learn the truths with an
alert and adaptable mind.

403
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,640
Why?

404
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,270
Because all of you have been
chosen and paid by Yun.

405
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,350
You are scholars of Yun Shang Academy.

406
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,110
You are able to learn...

407
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:29,110
because the people have toiled
and worked hard...

408
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,590
to give you the opportunity.

409
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:34,670
That is why you must study hard
and put in the effort...

410
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,320
in order to repay them.

411
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,520
I urge you...

412
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,160
to at least be deserving
of the food you eat.

413
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,260
Study well.

414
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,000
For today's lesson,

415
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,760
I'd like to commend one student.

416
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,370
He did well.

417
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,840
-He passed.
-Feng Cheng Jun.

418
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,690
Why did you commend someone
who complained about the lesson?

419
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,820
Because he is the only one in the class...

420
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,020
who raised an objection
regarding the weird teaching.

421
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,470
Life's wisdom lies not in the answers.

422
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,840
It lies within the questions.

423
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,210
There is only so much information
I can teach you.

424
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,740
I can even say it's negligible.

425
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,640
But only those who can question...

426
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,080
have the ability to
solve problems by himself.

427
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,180
If you have any objections
regarding my views,

428
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,930
you are free to approach me.

429
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,250
This term,

430
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,400
I'll be looking forward to butting heads
with you guys.

431
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,330
As for the rest of you,

432
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,220
you have all failed.

433
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,000
All failed?

434
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,680
Based on what?

435
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,010
Mr. Ding.

436
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,330
Principal Feng.

437
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,930
Where did you learn that trick from?

438
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,210
Wait, what? What trick?

439
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,360
Where are the bribes you accepted?

440
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:34,730
In the jar.

441
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,690
And the jar?

442
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,760
Due to teaching needs,

443
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,760
I broke it.

444
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
It's broken?

445
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,720
My apologies.

446
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,160
I haven't yet learned...

447
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,560
the way to fix it.

448
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,920
The precious, expensive jar...

449
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,390
is broken?

450
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,870
You can't expect results
without any effort.

451
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,890
It's broken...

452
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,900
Broken.

453
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,540
My jar.

454
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,640
Broken.

455
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,440
Principal Feng!

456
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,410
Students.

457
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,320
For this weekly exam,

458
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,880
the requirement is to get a top grade.

459
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,990
Anything else will be deemed a fail.

460
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,370
I hope everyone gives it their best.

461
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,610
All right.

462
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,210
Class dismissed.

463
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,570
Senior.

464
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,810
We must practice hard.

465
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,490
We are still under probation.

466
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,880
We already failed Mr. Ding's subject.

467
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,200
We can't fail another.

468
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,390
What a brother.

469
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,370
This stupid flute is my Achilles heel.

470
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,540
It's been two years.

471
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,710
I can still only play that one tune.

472
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,680
Don't worry. You have my help.

473
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,680
See?

474
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,440
I can make some sounds
if I blow harder.

475
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,920
That's not right.

476
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:26,190
Other people seem to play it effortlessly.

477
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,480
Of course it looks effortless
when you play it enough.

478
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,430
That's true.

479
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,840
Let's work on getting it to sound...

480
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,390
-and work on the tune later.
-Okay.

481
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,230
Why are you shaking your head?

482
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,040
If you don't know how to play,
why not ask Mr. Zhao?

483
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,990
Senior is at odds with Mr. Zhao.

484
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,310
He'll never teach us.

485
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,270
Mr. Zhao is not so petty.

486
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,150
I'm sure he'd teach you if you asked him.

487
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,990
I don't need advice from you.

488
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,990
Brother Feng, why not you teach us?

489
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,990
I can play, but I don't know how to teach.

490
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,390
Come back here, Junior.

491
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,470
He's a pretentious prick.

492
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
No use asking him.

493
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,660
-Let's continue, Senior.
-Come on.

494
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,800
Oh my gosh!

495
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,000
This has got to be music of Hades!

496
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,510
How am I supposed to sleep?

497
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,960
It's like the shrieks of demons.
I think...

498
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,550
What is this?

499
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,800
You guys are scholars of Yun Shang!

500
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,510
You can't endure this little thing?

501
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,590
Go back to bed!

502
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,840
-But...
-Right now!

503
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,000
Gosh, that sounds horrible.

504
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,880
Like a pig being slaughtered.

505
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,670
Can I help you guys?

506
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,430
Brother Cheng Jun.

507
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,310
Please do something...

508
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,230
and save your fellow classmates from hell.

509
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,830
Did something bad happen?

510
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,590
If you don't stop Wen Bin and Lei Ze Xin,

511
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,750
their noise pollution
is going to kill us all.

512
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,680
Yi De.

513
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,350
Cheng Jun.

514
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,430
Look, among all the students,

515
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,630
your flute playing is the best.

516
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,880
And as you well know, Lei Ao...

517
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,830
has never gotten along with Mr. Zhao.

518
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:56,390
If you think he would ask
Mr. Zhao for help,

519
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,710
you should dismiss that idea.

520
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,590
But if he and Wen Bin...

521
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,510
are going to practise
like that every night,

522
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,150
I can't say if they'd become experts,

523
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,470
but we, unfortunately,
probably wouldn't last...

524
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,190
until the day they did.

525
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:12,790
So we're asking you to
lend us a helping hand.

526
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:13,949
Please rise.

527
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,429
You're not holding it right.
It won't sound.

528
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,110
This is the correct way.

529
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:41,270
Didn't you say you won't teach me?

530
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,230
Actually,

531
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,280
I've been thinking about what you said.

532
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:47,530
What I said?

533
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:51,469
You said, "Require much
from oneself and little from others."

534
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,989
"Don't force what
you don't like onto others."

535
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,350
I realised I did force my opinions
on you a lot.

536
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,430
That's why I decided...

537
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,270
not to be involved in your matters.

538
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,260
Is that wrong too?

539
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:07,790
I... I didn't mean to totally
shut you down.

540
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,590
It's true that I don't like it...

541
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,710
when you force your opinions
onto others,

542
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:17,150
but I do admire how you're sincere
and just in your actions.

543
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,990
Not to forget your many talents.

544
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,120
But as a person,

545
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,400
you're hard to read
because of your moodiness.

546
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,110
I think you're the one who's moody.

547
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,550
Are you teaching me the flute or not?

548
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,630
Come.

549
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:50,040
[Be educated]

550
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,520
My goodness.

551
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,920
Wen Bin.

552
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,750
You're amazing!

553
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,350
How did you do that?

554
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,270
Right, you should teach us.

555
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,150
I am not qualified.

556
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,390
You should ask Brother Feng to teach you.

557
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:10,910
Well, please enlighten us,
Brother Cheng Jun.

558
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,270
-Please.
-Please.

559
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,560
Dear brothers.

560
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,390
I'm afraid I can't teach
such a big group.

561
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,790
Come on now, Feng Cheng Jun.

562
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,310
We've been classmates since young.

563
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,590
You're always top in every subject.

564
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,230
I know that too well.

565
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,360
-That's right.
-You flatter me, Brother Zhao Hui.

566
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,550
If you guys really wanted to learn,

567
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,320
why not go directly to Mr. Zhao?

568
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,020
-Well...
-You have no sense of brotherhood.

569
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,520
You bunch of pricks are annoying me!

570
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,760
-Get lost!
-Senior.

571
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,470
-Sorry about that.
-It's okay.

572
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,920
An intellectual shall not burden others.

573
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,510
Okay, let us go.

574
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,310
We'll take our leave.

575
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,390
All right, let's go.

576
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:15,390
Why were you able to teach me
but not them?

577
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,760
You're different from them.
