[Episode 28]

4
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:24,750
Mr Ding.

5
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,590
I imitated Mr Ding's handwriting
to get you to come out.

6
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,440
What do you want?

7
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,080
Do you have the ledger?

8
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,880
I hope you can give it to me.

9
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,840
I will handle it impartially,

10
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,600
and handover the ledger
to Master Wang.

11
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,340
First of all, I must determine
the authenticity of the ledger.

12
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,000
You always said the people are poor,

13
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,479
and you want to help the people.

14
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,560
Why are you hesitating now?

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,920
Is it because you don't know
how to handle...

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,660
your relationship with
Feng Cheng Jun?

17
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,560
What do you mean?

18
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,760
You have seen the ledger
so you should know.

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,840
The amount embezzled by
Governor Feng is not small.

20
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,640
Look, I am doing this for you.

21
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,800
If I can find out that
the ledger is with you,

22
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,360
I can definitely trace the
corrupted officials on the ledger.

23
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,840
If you give me the ledger,

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,040
you are passing the risk to me.

25
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,960
If they find you,
just tell them the ledger is with me.

26
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,360
They dare not touch me.

27
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,480
I will handover the ledger
to Master Wang.

28
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,400
Even if you don't trust me,
don't you trust Master Wang?

29
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,960
Did you see a small and thin boy?

30
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,940
I think I have seen him over there.

31
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,079
-Thank you.
-You are welcome.

32
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,920
Good, I am just in time.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,240
What are you doing here?

34
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,720
I heard the God of this San Shen Temple
grants all your wishes.

35
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,400
I purposely came here
to burn some incense sticks.

36
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,120
I wish to pray to God for...

37
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
goodness to be met with good recompense
and evil with evil recompense.

38
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,920
So, those bad guys need to be careful.

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,920
Yu Le Xuan,

40
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,200
this is what I am doing now.

41
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,640
Please do not interfere.

42
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,520
That might not be possible.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,560
His business is my business.

44
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,760
Wen Bin, you must keep
an eye on important items,

45
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,000
and give it to people whom you trust.

46
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,570
Looks like he is not a good fighter.

47
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,480
Let's go.

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,840
Do you think you can get away so easily?

49
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,480
Wen Bin.

50
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,840
Yu Le Xuan.

51
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,880
Where did both of them go?

52
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,800
-Who did this?
-Let me tell you.

53
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,200
Luckily, Cheng Jun brought us
to the San Shen Temple in time,

54
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,480
otherwise, I can't imagine
what would happen.

55
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,540
I am sorry I failed
to protect you guys.

56
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,560
It's my fault,

57
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,240
and I lost the ledger.

58
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,960
That's enough.

59
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,960
Stop blaming yourselves.

60
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,480
Who would expect Han Sheng Zhi
to come with a bunch of thugs.

61
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,360
Han Sheng Zhi and Lin Bing Shen
are two unscrupulous scoundrels.

62
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,600
We spoke to him,

63
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,000
he denied everything.

64
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,600
He was injured too.

65
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,880
You have no evidence.

66
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,920
You will only make the situation worse.

67
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,800
Han Sheng Zhi is cunning.

68
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,400
But I heard him said that...

69
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,520
"Do you think you can
get away so easily?"

70
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,400
And then the thugs arrived.

71
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,000
Why is he injured too?
This is too real.

72
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,680
As the President of Yun Shang Academy,

73
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,000
he instigated others to beat
his classmates.

74
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,680
If he is proven guilty,

75
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,210
-he will be punished.
-Yes.

76
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,690
Defeat Han Sheng Zhi.

77
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,720
Don't get too agitated,
Brother Xiao Huan.

78
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Not to get agitated?

79
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,680
If it's really him
who hurt Wen Bin and you,

80
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,320
then, he is not qualified
to be the President.

81
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Everyone,

82
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,480
in fact,

83
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,080
Xiao Huan is right.

84
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,320
If the council can gather
half of the stewards,

85
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,560
and hold a meeting,

86
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,000
maybe we can change the President?

87
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,120
-You can be the leader.
-No, no, no.

88
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,080
Cheng Jun must not be the leader.

89
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,560
He isn't a member of the council.

90
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,680
The lead...

91
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,080
should be Brother Le Xuan.

92
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,160
It's true.

93
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,320
He is popular.

94
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,520
He will succeed.

95
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,159
How come you are injured too?

96
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,120
What happened?

97
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,080
The scholars said that...

98
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,350
you got people to beat up
Wen Bin and Yu Le Xuan,

99
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,360
and took the ledger?

100
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,640
Who are they?

101
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,360
Why?

102
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,720
You don't believe me?

103
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,520
It'd better not be you.

104
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,960
That guy is as good as I am.

105
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,720
I was lucky I managed
to kick him in the chest.

106
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,360
He must be badly injured.

107
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,800
There may be bruises.

108
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,280
Are you suspecting anyone?

109
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
I saw his eyes today,

110
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,240
he looks like Mr Li.

111
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,040
Li Hu?

112
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,200
-Where is Mr Li?
-He is taking his bath.

113
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,560
Lei Ze Xin, you are
bathing at this hour?

114
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,140
I just finished
my martial arts practice.

115
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,720
Don't practise till so late next time.

116
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,520
It's not good for your body.

117
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,800
Yes.

118
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,200
Mr Li, do you usually
take your bath so late?

119
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,520
I have been reviewing the scholar's
nobility marks the entire day,

120
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,200
that's why I am late.

121
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,880
I must go back earlier.

122
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,360
How is it?

123
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,600
It's strange.

124
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,200
He is not injured.

125
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,080
Go back and rest.

126
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,880
You look pale.

127
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,560
Is it because of the ledger?

128
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,560
Cheng Jun said he'll find evidence
to prove his father's innocence.

129
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
The ledger is gone now.

130
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,760
He can say anything he wants.

131
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,240
It's not easy on Feng Cheng Jun
the last few days.

132
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,760
Maybe this is an ideal result.

133
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
How is your injury?

134
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,410
You helped me with
my medication before,

135
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,120
now it's my turn to help you.

136
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,800
You are so considerate suddenly,
I am not used to this.

137
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,880
Are you happy?

138
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,240
What do you really want to say?

139
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,520
Have you decided?

140
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,660
This is my first time as a leader,

141
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,160
I don't have to please anyone.

142
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,360
Shouldn't you be happy for me?

143
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,680
You should be proud of me.

144
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,080
Unless you are afraid that
Han Sheng Zhi will seek revenge?

145
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,560
Then you must protect me.

146
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,780
Let's change your medication.

147
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,200
The oral defense session begins.

148
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,400
First of all, I would like to clarify,

149
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,760
the charges by Yu Le Xuan against me,

150
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,360
I deny all of them.

151
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,280
As the President,

152
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,560
to solve a case that's
related to the academy,

153
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,160
and to provide the
evidence to the authority,

154
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,200
this is not wrong.

155
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,760
Furthermore, it was
chaotic at that time.

156
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,480
I did not make a move and
I have been dissuading them,

157
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,720
but Wen Bin and Yu Le Xuan
were not cooperating.

158
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,320
They caused the misunderstanding.

159
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,240
Liar.

160
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,980
Getting a gang of thugs
to beat your classmates,

161
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,640
how dare you take such action?

162
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,920
You are not fit to be a scholar
in Yun Shang Academy,

163
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,560
and not fit to be our President.

164
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,040
Where is your evidence?

165
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,280
Not to mention,

166
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,440
Brother Le Xuan,

167
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,680
I am afraid you are
not qualified to impeach me.

168
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,920
Yu Le Xuan is born in Western District.

169
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,080
In order to be an aristocrat,

170
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,280
he bought a fake identity.

171
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,560
Fake identity?

172
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
Fellow scholars,

173
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,280
there is nothing to discuss.

174
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,520
We knew about Le Xuan's identity.

175
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,480
Yes,

176
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,120
the most important thing in
Yun Shang is the academic result.

177
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,920
It's the same for
nobles and commoners.

178
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,960
He didn't just forge his identity.

179
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,680
As a scholar of Yun Shang Academy,

180
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,800
it is all right to conduct business.

181
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,160
However, to specialise in
cheating and kidnapping,

182
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,280
that is not appropriate.

183
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,560
He is a business prodigy,

184
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,250
he can make money out of anything.

185
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,000
God is punishing Yu Le Xuan.

186
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Which camp are you in?

187
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,800
Shut up.

188
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,000
What I mean is,

189
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,640
God will protect Yu Le Xuan.

190
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,520
I think Yu Le Xuan is a capable man.

191
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,440
He can earn so much money.
Right?

192
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,160
-Yes.
-And...

193
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,560
-And?
-And what?

194
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,680
Sheng Zhi.

195
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,720
According to The State Code of Yun,

196
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,800
an illegitimate child is
not allowed into Yun Shang Academy.

197
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,720
An illegitimate child?

198
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,720
Oh dear,

199
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,600
is he born out of wedlock?

200
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,960
Yu Le Xuan,
do you care to explain?

201
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,880
That is nonsense, Han Sheng Zhi.

202
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,860
You think you can say anything
just because you are rich and powerful?

203
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,240
Mind you, you must be
responsible for what you said.

204
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,120
Yes.

205
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,520
-Yes.
-He shouldn't say that.

206
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,840
An illegitimate child is
not allowed in an academy,

207
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,320
especially Yun Shang Academy.

208
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,600
Yu Le Xuan, this is too much.

209
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,480
What do you think
Yun Shang Academy is?

210
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,480
Principal Feng, please expel
Yu Le Xuan from Yun Shang Academy.

211
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,680
-I support.
-I support too.

212
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,600
To be friends with an illegitimate child
is our greatest shame.

213
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,130
-Brother Cheng Jun.
-How could you?

214
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,400
-This is too much.
-Expel the illegitimate child!

215
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,280
-Expel him.
-Han Sheng Zhi,

216
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,800
you are too much.

217
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,120
I am only stating the facts.

218
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,040
[Reflect]

219
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,480
Principal Feng,

220
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,400
this is a crucial moment.

221
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,160
You must say something.

222
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
The oral defense session today
will end here.

223
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,360
Go back and prepare your facts.

224
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,080
In the next oral defense session,

225
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,920
we will look into the
issue of Yu Le Xuan first,

226
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,280
before we discuss other matters.

227
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,360
Dismiss.

228
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,080
Yu Le Xuan, you are a troublemaker.

229
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,800
He disguised himself as a noble.

230
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,320
He is also a crooked businessman,

231
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,040
and he is an illegitimate son too.

232
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,840
It's a disgrace to the
Four Gentlemen of Yun Shang.

233
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,400
It's a disgrace to Yun Shang Academy.

234
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,440
What should I tell Master Wang?

235
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,000
Look at Principal Feng,

236
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,680
something interesting must have
happened in the academy?

237
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,400
Master Wang,

238
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,080
it's a small matter that
I am solving now.

239
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,840
Is this a small matter?

240
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,160
Here you go.

241
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,680
Here you go.

242
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,480
Come here.

243
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,560
-What is this?
-Take a look.

244
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,160
I didn't expect him to be like this.

245
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,080
President, you did great.

246
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,720
I think we overdid it this time.

247
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,680
He did it to us first,

248
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,280
he deserves it.

249
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,080
Sometimes, when one
pretends for too long,

250
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,720
he tends to forget his true identity.

251
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,560
Forgetting it
doesn't change the truth.

252
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,080
Yes, he is too much.

253
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,560
He lied to us for so long.

254
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,240
He is a liar.

255
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,080
He shouldn't be in Yun Shang Academy.

256
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,360
-Shut up!
-Let's go.

257
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,680
Let's go.

258
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,440
It's all right.

259
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,760
I am a liar,

260
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,240
I deserve to be punished.

261
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,359
And,

262
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,400
I am more convinced of my choice now.

263
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,120
At least you guys are
still with me, right?

264
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,640
Don't hold back if you are sad,

265
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,200
if you want to drink or cry,
we'll be with you.

266
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,400
Let go of me,

267
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,280
or else I will beat you too.

268
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,120
Don't be impulsive,
you won't get anything out of it.

269
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,560
This...

270
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,520
Go away!

271
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,640
Master Wang.

272
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,520
As the Principal of Yun Shang Academy.

273
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,840
I didn't check
my student's background.

274
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,320
I'll accept your punishment.

275
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,800
Master Wang,

276
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,960
Yu Le Xuan is a
star performer in the academy.

277
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,320
He excels in both academic
and physical education.

278
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,200
But his identity,

279
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,320
it matters.

280
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,480
According to the rules,

281
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,760
Yu Le Xuan should be
expelled from the academy.

282
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,440
But I would like to know,

283
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,690
how would the legendary team of
the academy...

284
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,040
deal with this situation?

285
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,600
Master Wang,

286
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,080
do you mean we should let
Yu Le Xuan stay on in the academy?

287
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,200
Let Feng Cheng Jun,
Wen Bin and Lei Ze Xin,

288
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,200
produce their evidence.

289
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,320
That would be very difficult.

290
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
Don't worry.

291
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,760
Those kids are able to handle it well.

292
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,400
It's good to be young,

293
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,680
they can do anything they want.

294
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,720
Goodbye, Master Wang.

295
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,520
Master Wang said
it's good to be young,

296
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,640
what does he mean by that?

297
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,280
He wants to keep Yu Le Xuan,

298
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,560
or expel him from the academy?

299
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,440
I don't know.

300
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,880
But if Yu Le Xuan was
born out of wedlock,

301
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,560
according to the State Code of Yun,

302
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,160
he can't stay.

303
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,440
If Master Wang wants
to keep Yu Le Xuan,

304
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,880
what should we do?

305
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,200
Principal Feng,

306
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,160
Master Wang has his plans.

307
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,560
What is on Master Wang's mind?

308
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,480
It's true, we still can't find him.

309
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,320
Lu Zhao Rong, where did you search?

310
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,120
I went to where I should be looking.

311
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,520
What should we do now?

312
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,000
You guys haven't found
Yu Le Xuan yet??

313
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,680
We have discussed,

314
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,560
do you think he will
do something extreme?

315
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,560
Shut up!

316
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,960
You shouldn't assume.

317
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,880
Rest assured,

318
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,760
Yu Le Xuan is not that weak.

319
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,560
I believe he is mentally prepared,

320
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,680
but he needs time to get through it.

321
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,560
I know a few more places.

322
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,640
I'll go look for him.

323
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,320
You should stay here and
fight for his rights to stay.

324
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,440
-All right.
-I'll go out to look for him.

325
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,160
-Have a look.
-No.

326
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,320
Wen Bin.

327
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,080
They are too much.

328
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,720
People gather around you
when you have value.

329
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,720
When you are of no use to them,
they will leave you.

330
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,520
The most hurtful thing
on earth is people's sentiments.

331
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,560
Don't be sad, let's continue.

332
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,080
I don't believe these people can ignore
their relationship as school mates.

333
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,200
-Give us some.
-We'll try.

334
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,240
Give me.

335
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,200
-Give me.
-Here you go.

336
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,080
-No, no.
-Take it.

337
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,120
-Please help.
-Please take a look.

338
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,120
Mr Feng.

339
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,400
-Mr Feng.
-Mr Chao, how is it?

340
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,840
Let me take a sip of water first.

341
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,440
Mr Feng,

342
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,640
Yu Le Xuan is more complicated
than I thought.

343
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,040
Please, I want to know everything.

344
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,440
Have a seat while we talk.

345
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,120
Please sign this.

346
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,260
-Help Yu Le Xuan.
-No.

347
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,920
Sign the petition, help Yu Le Xuan.

348
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,920
Are you joking?

349
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,000
Yu Le Xuan lied to everyone,

350
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,400
he used every means to
cheat people of their money.

351
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,280
He should be expelled from
the academy a long time ago.

352
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,880
He paid for your drinks.

353
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,880
My drinks?

354
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,160
His money is only good
for buying wine.

355
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,160
-Please sign the petition.
-No.

356
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,720
Help me sign this.

357
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,360
Yu Le Xuan is a good student.

358
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,840
No, go away.

359
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,880
Let's go.

360
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,440
Let's go.

361
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,320
Help...

362
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,760
Don't follow me around,
I am not a child.

363
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,080
Nobody is following you,

364
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,280
you are thinking too much.

365
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,480
You should go back.
I want to be alone.

366
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm scared you can't take it,
and end up disturbing the ladies.

367
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,560
I am not that free.

368
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,720
Don't worry.

369
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,240
Don't you know me very well?

370
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,920
It's because I know you so well,

371
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,940
so I know you are not your normal self.

372
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,400
That's why I am worried.

373
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,800
If I fall into the river,

374
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,120
how would you rescue me?

375
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,800
Fine,

376
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,480
nobody can solve my problem.

377
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,280
Furthermore, it's about my identity,

378
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,280
it's a fact that I can't change.

379
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,120
Before this, you always
solved problems for others.

380
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,400
Now, when you need help,

381
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,480
I am not able to help you.

382
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,560
I wish Feng Cheng Jun
and Junior are here.

383
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,640
At least,

384
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,960
they can cheer you up.

385
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,120
Fine,

386
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,240
you can follow me alone.

387
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,000
I can't handle it if
there are too many of you.

388
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,200
It's a sin to have so many people
worried for me.

389
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,240
Let's go.

390
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,920
Have a look, thank you.

391
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,840
Have a look.

392
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,880
Thank you.

393
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,760
Wen Bin,

394
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,960
everyone knows what you are doing.

395
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,680
It's late now.

396
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,240
Go get some rest.

397
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,400
I am willing to do anything
as long as Yu Le Xuan can stay.

398
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,440
Looks like you don't want
to leave the academy anymore.

399
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,360
The four of us have
been through a lot,

400
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,480
we can't be separated.

401
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,100
As long as they are here,
I'll be here.

402
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,360
Don't worry, I won't let you down.

403
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,600
I trust you.

404
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,840
This incident may
seem like a hard blow,

405
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,760
it's actually a test for all of you.

406
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,280
Work hard and do your best.

407
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,040
Looks like you still
have your conscience.

408
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,760
Are you buying me drinks?

409
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,000
Sometimes it's good to have a change.

410
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,320
I didn't expect that...

411
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,200
you will take the initiative to
find someone to drink with you.

412
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,540
It's my first time
I feel like drinking,

413
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,280
and my first time
buying for my friends.

414
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,200
He is really drunk.

415
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,480
This is disgusting.

416
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,560
Let's go.

417
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,400
I am glad to.

418
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,200
Have a look.

419
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,440
Have a look.

420
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,280
Wen Bin, not that
I don't want to sign,

421
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,840
but I can't sign.

422
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,680
A word of advice, stay out of this.

423
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,200
No, take a look.

424
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,400
Wen Bin,

425
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,200
don't waste your effort.

426
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,560
I have checked around in the academy.

427
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,840
Han Sheng Zhi said that...

428
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,800
no one is allowed
to defend Yu Le Xuan.

429
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,680
The scholars are
protecting themselves.

430
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,280
They have been Yu Le Xuan's schoolmates
for such a long time,

431
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,240
they shouldn't just sit and watch.

432
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,400
When you spend
a long time with someone,

433
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,520
you'll not necessarily
be close to each other.

434
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,480
Give it up.

435
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,440
This thing about Yu Le Xuan is final.

436
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,640
Your effort is going down the drain.

437
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,720
-Why waste your energy?
-I am not giving up.

438
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,760
Yu Le Xuan didn't do anything wrong,

439
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,120
I believe there's hope
in everything we do.

440
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,880
If we deny a person's effort
because of his identity,

441
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,440
that would be too superficial.

442
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,240
Is that all we learnt in
Yun Shang Academy?

443
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,640
There are things
we should and shouldn't do.

444
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,760
How many amongst us,

445
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,080
really understand what we are doing?

446
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,880
Brother Wen Bin, you are right.

447
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,480
We have no rights,

448
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,720
to deny a person of his good qualities.

449
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,680
and we can't destroy a person's future
because of his background.

450
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,920
I am willing to support Yu Le Xuan.

451
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,840
Thank you.

452
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,920
Thank you.

453
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,920
Thank you, everyone.

454
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,840
Thank you for listening to me,

455
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,800
I can see there are people who
don't simply judge in Yun Shang.

456
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,160
Don't drink too much.

457
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,880
Have you forgotten your lesson?

458
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,080
Ze Xin, you care so much for
Feng Cheng Jun.

459
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,600
It looks like his money is not wasted.

460
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,400
When he drinks too much,

461
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,440
he'll create trouble.

462
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,320
I know the reason you hate me.

463
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,000
Really?

464
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,320
I don't know what happened
in the previous generation,

465
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,240
I am trying to find the truth.

466
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,200
I hope you can
put aside your prejudices,

467
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,320
to find the truth with me.

468
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,040
You are disgusting.

469
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,640
If I haven't put aside my prejudices,

470
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,960
I wouldn't be sitting here
drinking with you.

471
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,280
Great.

472
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,560
However,

473
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,360
if my brother's death...

474
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,760
is related to your father,

475
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,920
I won't hesitate to take action.

476
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,320
Don't worry.

477
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,720
If that's the case,

478
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,680
I'll also treat it fairly.

479
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,920
I hope you will remember
what you have said today.

480
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,120
Come, come,

481
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,360
cheers to justice and friendship.

482
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,680
Cheers.

483
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,040
Brother Le Xuan, same to you.

484
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,170
Let bygones be bygones.

485
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,120
Don't think about things
that can't be changed.

486
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,200
Don't let them affect you.

487
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,800
You are who you are,

488
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,360
the one and only Yu Le Xuan.

489
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,000
You...

490
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,760
Are you still the same person
I hated so much?

491
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,760
Of course, I am still the same.

492
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,400
And we are family,

493
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,780
we can't afford to lose anyone.

494
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,880
He is really drunk, drink up.

495
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,120
I like Feng Cheng Jun
when he is drunk.

496
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,400
He is more approachable.

[Interrogation Hall]

498
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,320
Han Sheng Zhi has a lot of supporters.

499
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,720
After all, he is the President
for so many years.

500
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,600
Yes.

501
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,500
A lot of them are being
forced to do so.

502
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,040
They dare not offend him.

503
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,360
I am content with your support,

504
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,320
thank you.

505
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,120
Master Wang has arrived.

506
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,960
Master Wang.

507
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,920
Stand at ease.

508
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,880
This way, Master Wang.

509
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,560
Don't be too restrained,

510
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,440
I am here as an observer.

511
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,760
The decision...

512
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,480
will be made by all of you.

513
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
I hope you will be true to yourself...

514
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,960
to make the right decision.

515
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,040
Let's begin.

516
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,720
Feng Cheng Jun,

517
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,800
how many supporters
does Yu Le Xuan have?

518
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,240
Only a few signatures?

519
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,520
I think,

520
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,480
this debate is unnecessary.

521
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,360
Dear Masters and fellow scholars,

522
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,560
I am incapable,

523
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,880
the outcome has been decided.

524
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,920
Don't waste your time on me.

525
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,600
I will leave Yun Shang Academy now.

526
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,120
You can't leave now.

527
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,360
It has been decided,

528
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,360
I am tired.

529
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,260
I have stayed under the disguise
for so many years.

530
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,520
Now,

531
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,400
it's time to come out,

532
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,200
and be me again.

533
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,220
I have already said,
you can't leave now.

534
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,360
If you leave,
you are being irresponsible.

535
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,280
Are you still drunk?

536
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,340
The final result is not out yet.

537
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,720
When the debate is over,

538
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,400
if everyone wants you to leave,

539
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,800
you can leave then.

540
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,120
During the debate,

541
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,080
if more than 80% of
student representatives...

542
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,480
agree to forgive Yu Le Xuan,

543
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,719
Yu Le Xuan can stay.

544
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,360
Let me start by saying,

545
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,000
what kind of person
Yu Le Xuan is to me.

546
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,600
I am listening.

547
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,520
Yu Le Xuan doesn't go home at all,

548
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,520
he is an unfilial son
who abandons his parents.

549
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,280
-That's right.
-He is an unfilial son.

550
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,400
It's a disgrace.

551
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,760
But have you thought about it,

552
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,560
what's the reason for
Yu Le Xuan to act in such a way?

553
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
It's you.
