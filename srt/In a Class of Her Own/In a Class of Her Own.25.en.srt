[In A Class of Her Own]

[Episode 25]

4
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,640
I've got everyone involved.

5
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,070
No one could've predicted...

6
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,600
such thing would happen.

7
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:33,080
Thanks to Master Wang's brilliance.

8
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,140
We've got a chance to clear our name.

9
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,840
But we have just two days.

10
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,960
Master Wang is making it difficult for us.

11
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,250
Brother.

12
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:46,960
I'll go after him.

13
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,570
Why are you stopping me?

14
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,490
Don't that contemptible bunch
deserve to be taught a lesson?

15
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,050
True.

16
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,530
I never thought there would
be someone I'd like to beat up.

17
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,420
Still, it's fun to watch a fight.

18
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,910
That's the most interesting
thing in the world.

19
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,720
According to Master Wang,

20
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,480
if they fail to find evidence...

21
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,970
to prove Wen Bin's innocence,

22
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,610
Wen Bin would be expelled,

23
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,000
while those three, including
Feng Cheng Jun will be severely punished .

24
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,530
Good.

25
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,720
I suppose I don't have to
tell you what to do next.

26
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,970
I read between the lines, President.

27
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,560
Those fools...

28
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,840
won't get away this time.

29
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,280
Who did that?

30
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,090
Who are you calling fools?

31
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,250
Are you so convinced that
we are going to lose?

32
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,560
You guys are happy if we lose.

33
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,450
You don't have to take it
to such extreme, don't you think?

34
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,860
Why? Have you resorted
to desperate measures?

35
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,430
Or are you here to beg for mercy?

36
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,970
Don't think that I don't know
this is all your conspiracy.

37
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,640
You have such rich imagination.

38
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,560
Have you started to have
wild imaginations...

39
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,410
because you've spent too much time
with Wen Bin?

40
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,720
Lei Ze Xin, do you really
want to be expelled?

41
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,280
We'll talk about it after our fight.

42
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,480
Ze Xin, we still have
to find out the truth.

43
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,560
Don't act rashly.

44
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,560
Let go.

45
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:42,690
Let go now.

46
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,170
Why are you looking at me
like that, Brother Wen Bin?

47
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,450
Brother Feng, you look...

48
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,970
really handsome in the official's uniform.

49
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,130
Why are you looking at me like that?

50
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,010
I certainly look less charming beside you.

51
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,810
Well, of course.

52
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,010
You're certainly self-assured.

53
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,240
Let's go to Yu Le House.

54
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,810
They must be waiting there.

55
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,970
Brother Ze Xin?

56
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,970
Brother Ze Xin, although we're serving
as temporary Investigating Censor,

57
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,600
we need to adhere to the dress code.

58
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,600
You're dressed inappropriately.

59
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,760
I'm not listening to you.

60
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,730
We're peers.

61
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,640
I'm wrapped up like a dumpling.

62
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,810
I don't understand why
anyone would wear this.

63
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,760
That's enough. Let's get to business.

64
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,360
Have you found any clues?

65
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,600
Yu Le Xuan and I scouted around the
South Street early this morning.

66
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,810
We've checked with all medical halls,
medicine shops in South Street.

67
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,090
No one sells and buys lingzhi powder.

68
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,570
Compared to Brother Le Xuan,

69
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,880
Brother Ze Xin looks more appealing.

70
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,920
You three know nothing.

71
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,290
Let me ask you, what can you find out...

72
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,290
dressing like this?

73
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,970
This is called a camouflage.

74
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,880
Undercover investigator, get it?

75
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,810
Makes sense.

76
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,850
Who would have thought that
Lord Feng would make mistake?

77
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,690
So this undercover investigator here,

78
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,970
what have you found out?

79
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,120
[Lingzhi powder]

80
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,820
Lingzhi powder from the academy.

81
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,450
Where did you get it from?

82
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,730
I bought it.

83
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,570
There is an alley at
the end of the street.

84
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,090
Shady stuff are sold there.

85
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,320
People called that kind
of place the black market.

86
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,760
I've checked with all medical
halls and medicine shops.

87
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,760
I found nothing.

88
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,010
I hope your judgement is right.

89
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,880
It can't be wrong.

90
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,730
If all medical halls and
medicine shops don't have it,

91
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,640
that can only mean that...

92
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,600
Wen Bin hasn't got the chance...

93
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,230
to sell the powder yet.

94
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,200
That's impressive.

95
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,640
You know a lot about the black market.

96
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,810
Of course.

97
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,200
I had some business in
the black market before.

98
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,320
Of course I know a lot.

99
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,850
As the scholar of Yun Shang Academy,

100
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,570
you actually had business
in the black market.

101
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,600
How could you be an official
if you've misconducted?

102
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,480
You are poking your nose
into other's past too.

103
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,040
I only did it occasionally in the past.

104
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,040
Rest assured, Brother Cheng Jun.

105
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,160
I won't do it anymore.

106
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,040
Wait,

107
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,850
are we getting off the topic?

108
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,130
Aren't we supposed to find
the thief as soon as possible?

109
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,320
Brother Ze Xin has checked with...

110
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,480
all medical halls and
medicine shops in South Street.

111
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,730
He found nothing.

112
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,159
Is this the only jar you
found in the black market?

113
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,409
This is the only one.

114
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,010
How many jars of lingzhi powder
have the academy lost?

115
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,360
I have no idea.

116
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,400
Although the Student Council...

117
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,760
is in charge of keeping inventory of
all herbs in the academy,

118
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:55,450
I never cared about those trivial matters.

119
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,810
I don't know how many packs there were.

120
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,920
By right, lingzhi powder is a tribute,

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,320
there must be more than one jar.

122
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,250
But why did the thief only sell one jar?

123
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,440
That's not possible.

124
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,520
That's not possible.

125
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,480
Six packs of lingzhi powder
are worth a lot.

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,760
The thief is supposed to
sell it all as soon as he can.

127
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,970
How do you know there
were six packs missing?

128
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,710
I don't, it was just a lucky guess.

129
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,390
Tell me the truth!

130
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,799
President, I did it for you.

131
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,370
For me?

132
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,549
President, I... I was desperate.

133
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,440
My parents are seriously ill.

134
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,170
I'm out of money.

135
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,480
And you've stopped funding me.

136
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,190
I really had no other ways.

137
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,210
I could only resort to stealing
something from Fu Ze Hall.

138
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,840
And sell it for money to save my parents.

139
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,450
But when I was inside Fu Ze Hall,

140
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,140
I found that the drawer
was already open.

141
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,200
Of those seven packs ,

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,410
there was only one left.

143
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,370
So I took it, I didn't take others.

144
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,760
Nothing else.

145
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,680
How did Wen Bin's student badge
end up in Fu Ze Hall then?

146
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,050
I suspected that Wen Bin has stolen
the other six packs.

147
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,000
So I went to Room Two to search it.

148
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,530
I happened to see Wen Bin's badge.

149
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,970
And then, I...

150
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,130
You...

151
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,760
What did you do with yours?

152
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,760
I know that...

153
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,250
I know that lingzhi powder
is tribute, it's precious.

154
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,840
So I didn't... I didn't dare to sell it.

155
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,810
-So you do know that it's tribute!
-Sheng Xiong.

156
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,090
Sheng Xiong.

157
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,120
That's enough.

158
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,700
You moron.

159
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,370
Now that things have come to this,

160
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,970
we could only go along with it.

161
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,560
Alright.

162
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,520
These circled spots...

163
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,640
are places that sell stolen goods.

164
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,640
That's quite a few.

165
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,360
We have to capture them all at once...

166
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,730
to stop them from alerting the others.

167
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,490
We'll then get our clue.

168
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,000
Capture them all at once?

169
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,560
There are just four of us.

170
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,090
How is that possible?

171
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,730
We can ask for the authority's help.

172
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,750
[Yunzhou Southern County
Government's Office]

173
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:45,180
What positions are you two serving?

174
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,690
Master Wang has appointed
us as Investigating Censor.

175
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,930
We're investigating the
theft case of Yun Shang Academy.

176
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,800
How is the progress of your investigation?

177
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,960
We've found that...

178
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,770
stalls in an alley in South Street...

179
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,880
are selling stolen goods.

180
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,000
We would like to request your help
to catch them all.

181
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,320
Do you think people of the government's
office are good for nothing?

182
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,170
That we're so free that...

183
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,330
we have time to fool around with you?

184
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,640
My Lord, we've found evidence that...

185
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,930
one of the stall owners is selling
stolen herbs from the academy.

186
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,770
We believe that other stall owners
are likely to be involved.

187
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,400
But if we investigate them one by one,
we might alert them.

188
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,090
So we hope that you can help us
to catch them.

189
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,120
I've served my post for nearly 20 years.

190
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,320
I know better than you
on how to run an investigation.

191
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,360
You're just Investigating Censors.

192
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,920
You're not qualified
to tell me what to do.

193
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,640
So in your opinion, my Lord,

194
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,000
how should we investigate?

195
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,530
If something really is missing
in Yun Shang Academy,

196
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,120
you should first beat the drum in
front of the office to register.

197
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,000
I'll appoint someone to make
some inquiries with you.

198
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,200
And then, along with my colleagues, we'll
look into the ways to investigate this.

199
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,970
My Lord, we may be temporary
Investigating Censors,

200
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,850
but we're still the officials of Yun.

201
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,250
According to State Code of Yun,

202
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,480
Investigating Censor holds the
duty to supervise officials,

203
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,160
inspect the districts, manage
prison affairs and so on.

204
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,130
If you perform your duty, I'll
recommend you for a promotion.

205
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,920
If you fail to do so,
I'll report the truth as well.

206
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,960
My Lord.

207
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,840
I have something I need to deal with.

208
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,960
Please excuse me for a moment.

209
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,370
I'll be back soon.

210
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,130
Serve them some tea. Let's go.

211
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,440
-Yes.
-My Lord...

212
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,010
Mr. Han, you are indeed awe-inspiring...

213
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,240
and charismatic.

214
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,850
I'm flattered, my Lord.

215
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,690
I'm just an Investigating Censor.

216
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,360
It's me who should bow.

217
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,170
Mr. Han, please stop.

218
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:24,640
I wouldn't stand here today if
it wasn't for Lord Han.

219
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,390
How may I help you, Mr. Han?

220
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:34,560
Yun Shang Academy has lost a
few packs of herbs few days ago.

221
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,800
Coming here today, I would like to
know if you have any clues on that.

222
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,930
I see you're here for the missing
herbs of Yun Shang Academy as well.

223
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,000
Thank you for waiting.

224
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,810
I've made arrangements to
catch those law-breakers.

225
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,490
Please come along.

226
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,330
My Lord, we need to catch
those owners circled in...

227
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,530
Don't worry, I'll see to it.

228
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,050
It will be done.

229
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,570
Pass my order, gather the officers.

230
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,640
Yes, sir.

231
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,200
It's those booths at the front.

232
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,690
Bring those stall owners away.

233
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,760
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

234
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,320
What are you doing?

235
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,330
Destroy everything!
Smash all those stolen stuff!

236
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,400
What are you doing?

237
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,590
How is this different from a bandit?

238
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,790
Is this how your treat the people
as an official?

239
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,650
Those rascals.

240
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,290
Move.

241
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,250
At this point, just stop
adding fuel to the fire.

242
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,280
We can only blame ourselves for
the wrong judgement this time.

243
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,650
-Knock it down.
-Stall owners who aren't registered...

244
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,170
are not allowed to
operate in South Street.

245
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,850
You don't even know this, and
you claim you're an official,

246
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,730
Lord Investigating Censor.

247
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,200
You don't deserve this official attire.

248
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,410
Come here.

249
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,280
I'm just enforcing the law...

250
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,200
in an impartial way.

251
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,130
If you two have any problems with it,

252
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,370
go ahead and report it to the superior.

253
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,560
Bring them all away!

254
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,560
Move!

255
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,930
Move!

256
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,570
-Move!
-Let me go!

257
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,560
Hurry up.

258
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,690
Move!

259
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,320
I bet they never thought
things would turn out like that.

260
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,450
They are still young and inexperienced.

261
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,440
It's normal that they missed
certain details.

262
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,800
In front of the sudden
change of situation,

263
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,330
they must have felt helpless.

264
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,680
Master Wang let them went through that...

265
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:55,610
before they graduate.

266
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,920
I hope they could learn something from it.

267
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,370
I hope they never forget
what they learned from it.

268
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,330
It's all my fault.

269
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,000
I was too naive.

270
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,010
A man was acting dubiously just now.

271
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,720
Before the officers made a move,

272
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,310
[he seemed like he knew what was
going to happen and hid.]

273
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,000
I'll draw his face down now.

274
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,130
You're fine, it's just a cold.

275
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,840
Boil this medicine in water.

276
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,320
Take it twice a day.

277
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,760
Thank you, sir.

278
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:04,800
Waiter.

279
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,690
I would like to ask...

280
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,010
if you know this man?

281
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,710
Why are you looking for him?

282
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,480
I would like to buy herbs from him.

283
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,760
Sir, we have many options
of herbs in our shop too.

284
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,760
Perhaps you'll find what you need here.

285
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,970
Do you sell lingzhi powder?

286
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:30,850
No.

287
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,610
Ah Mu.

288
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,490
Brother.

289
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,640
Why did he run away?

290
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,610
-Let go of my brother. Let go.
-Brother.

291
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,040
Kids,

292
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,520
we just want to have a talk with
your brother. Don't be scared.

293
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,610
Ah Mu,

294
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,730
did you steal the herbs in the academy?

295
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,480
It was me.

296
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,520
What do you want from me?

297
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,840
You're speaking boldly
despite breaking the law.

298
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,480
Broke the law?

299
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,320
I could only blame it to being born poor.

300
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,830
My mother had been ill for a year.

301
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,610
The prices in the
medicine shop are exorbitant.

302
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,400
She had to endure the
pains while she was alive.

303
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,320
She hadn't eaten a single medicine...

304
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,730
nor seen any doctor.

305
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,090
Now that she has passed away.

306
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,550
I can't even afford a coffin.

307
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,530
Other than getting money from
selling the stuff that I stole,

308
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,490
I had no other options.

309
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,040
Don't poor people like us...

310
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,850
deserve to be treated like human beings?

311
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:11,890
Brother Bin.

312
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,520
You've been through
so much to be where you are today.

313
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,610
Are you really going to give it up?

314
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,800
I'm going to confess to Master Wang
tomorrow that I stole the lingzhi powder.

315
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,130
Brother Bin...

316
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,200
What will happen
to those three children...

317
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,130
if Ah Mu is jailed for his crime?

318
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,690
How are you different from
a murderer if you let it happen?

319
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,770
I'll take care of the
three children of course.

320
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,520
Other than clearing Wen Bin's name,

321
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,800
we need to find the lingzhi powder.

322
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:40,010
As future officials of Yun, we should
know that there is no kindness in law.

323
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,350
Ah Mu has committed a crime
so he should be punished.

324
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,010
There are many other people like
Ah Mu in Yun, who need our help.

325
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,010
I can't just stand here and
watch Brother Bin...

326
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,800
ruin his future.

327
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,770
That would be a loss to all people of Yun.

328
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,730
Do you know why Yun would
turn out like this today?

329
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,650
It's all because of people like you.

330
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,250
You claimed that...

331
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,280
you want to change people's lives in Yun.

332
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,730
But you never thought
about changing yourself.

333
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,090
You have no idea how painful it
is for a child to lose his mother.

334
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,920
Let me tell you,
sympathy can save a person.

335
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,250
But it can't save all people.

336
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,010
You're the one who doesn't get it.

337
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,440
You really have no compassion.

338
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,130
Alright.

339
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,490
You're all too impulsive.

340
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,770
Ze Xin, let me ask you.

341
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,520
Between Ah Mu confessing his crime...

342
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,850
and Wen Bin getting expelled,

343
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,890
which will you choose? Be honest.

344
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,130
I'll surrender myself
to Master Wang tomorrow.

345
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,440
That way, I won't have to worry
about those three kids...

346
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,400
nor Little Brother's future.

347
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,890
It's unacceptable to sacrifice my future,
but what about yours, Brother?

348
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,490
Enough, stop fighting.

349
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,440
Thank you for all your considerations.

350
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,200
Brother, thank you for protecting me.

351
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,850
But I don't want to involve
you all on this matter.

352
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,000
I really want to do this,
and it's something I must do.

353
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,610
I hope you all can understand.

354
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,570
As a future official of Yun,
to harm an innocent family...

355
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,440
just to secure my future,

356
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,090
I can't let it happen.

357
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,370
Brother Bin, are you
really going to do this?

358
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,480
Are you sure?

359
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,440
Fine.

360
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,650
Nothing I say will change anything
since you've made up your mind.

361
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,730
Do you have the answer now?

362
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,920
I have failed to find the thief.

363
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,370
I'm unable to prove my innocence.

364
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,280
Thank you for taking care of
me this whole time, Mr. Ding.

365
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,730
Sorry that I've bothered you.

366
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,010
Mr. Ding,

367
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,680
is it true that women are
unsuited to be officials?

368
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,890
Yes, it is.

369
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:13,890
Why?

370
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,650
Because of your sentimentality.

371
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,650
[But to harm Ah Mu's family...]

372
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,370
[for my innocence, ]

373
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,250
[I really can't do it.]

374
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,920
Are they disappointed in me?

375
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,920
What about you?

376
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,920
I'm sorry, Wen Bin.

377
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,210
Not only was I unable to help you,

378
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,000
I also stopped Feng Cheng Jun
from helping you.

379
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,730
Brother Feng is still mad at me,

380
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,520
he certainly won't come back tonight.

381
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,610
[Interrogation Hall]

382
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,400
This way, Master Wang.

383
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:02,400
Why is one person missing here?

384
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,570
Master Wang,

385
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:07,150
Feng Cheng Jun must be hiding now
because he is afraid of the punishment.

386
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,800
It seems that he has failed to find
the thief who stole those lingzhi powder.

387
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,130
Master Wang, we've found him.

388
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,490
I thought you said you didn't find him.

389
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,800
Who is it then?

390
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,770
It's me, Wen Bin.

391
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,850
Wen Bin, what are you blabbering about?

392
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,280
Scholar Wen Bin, has committed
an unpardonable sin.

393
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,490
I accept punishment, Master Wang.

394
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,160
Master Wang,

395
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,490
Wen Bin must have done it for a reason.

396
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,160
He's not that kind of person.

397
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,200
Master Wang.

398
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,520
I'm the oldest among the four of us.

399
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,090
I have an inescapable
responsibility on this.

400
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,330
I'm willing to be punished
on behalf of Wen Bin.

401
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,730
Please grant my wish.

402
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,770
I'm willing to be punished
on behalf of Wen Bin too.

403
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,250
Please grant my wish, sir.

404
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,800
Brother, Le Xuan,
stop pleading for me.

405
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,800
I'll bear the consequences of my actions.

406
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,890
None of you can bear it for me.

407
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
A nation has its law,
and a house has its rules.

408
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,520
Well said.

409
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,850
Master Wang, with all due respect,

410
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:22,610
the time is up and Wen Bin has
failed to prove his innocence.

411
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,520
He ought to be expelled.

412
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,440
Feng Cheng Jun, Lei Ze Xin, Yu Le Xuan
should be severely punished as well.

413
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,650
Wen Bin, I'm going to expel you
and turn you over to the authority.

414
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,770
Do you accept it?

415
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,610
I accept it wholeheartedly.

416
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,370
I'm willing to take the punishment.

417
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,280
Even though Feng Cheng Jun is not here,

418
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:55,280
he still needs to receive severe
punishment with Yu Le Xuan and Lei Ze Xin.

419
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,610
-Principal Feng.
-Yes.

420
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:03,850
How should I punish them?

421
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,920
I'm the one who stole the herbs.

422
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,650
The guilty one is here. Please forgive me
for being late, Master Wang.

423
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:23,800
You're the one who stole
the lingzhi powder?

424
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,760
I'm the one who stole the herbs.

425
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,680
But I don't know anything about
lingzhi powder or tribute.

426
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,560
How dare you steal from Yun Shang Academy?

427
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,160
Aren't you scared to be punished?

428
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,320
I am scared.

429
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:42,130
I've been living in fear since I stole.

430
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:46,480
Then why are you here
to surrender yourself?

431
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,280
Because of them.

432
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,520
They treated me like a human being.

433
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,890
Carry on.

434
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,490
I never dared to ask for...

435
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,250
anyone to understand our sufferings...

436
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,200
or take the blame for us.

437
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,280
But they made us
understand what dignity is.

438
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,810
[To save you and your siblings,]

439
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,610
[he's going to turn himself in tomorrow.]

440
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,650
[He's going to confess
that he's the thief.]

441
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,370
[Do you know what that means for him?]

442
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,400
[I'm unable to spare a thought for him.]

443
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,200
[He isn't doing that just for you.]

444
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,250
[It's for all the poor people who
came from the same background as him,]

445
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,890
[even if it costs him his future.]

446
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,920
They gave me hope.

447
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,610
They gave me the confidence to stay alive.

448
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,920
I want to show my siblings
that I am an honest man.

449
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,160
I want them to live their life
with determination in the future.

450
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,010
Ah Mu,

451
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,250
you're courageous.

452
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,680
Get up.

453
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,730
Since Ah Mu has confessed
about the theft,

454
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:03,370
it means Wen Bin's name has been cleared.

455
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,520
Master Wang,

456
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,090
Wen Bin lied that he was the thief.

457
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,610
He still committed the immoral act...

458
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,320
of deceiving his teachers.

459
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,770
Please hold him responsible
for that, Master Wang.

460
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,400
Master Wang,

461
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,690
Wen Bin is guilty indeed.

462
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,850
But all of us are guilty as well.

463
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,210
As the scholar of Yu Shang Academy,

464
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,920
as the future official of Yun,

465
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,920
we are enjoying the
tax paid by the people,

466
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,680
yet we turn a blind eye to
what's happening out there.

467
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,850
We are completely ignorant about
rampant methods of businessmen.

468
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:40,160
Let alone people's sufferings.

469
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:44,010
So how are we different from a murderer?

470
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,770
Cheng Jun has made a good point.

471
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,160
Principal Feng.

472
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,090
Yes.

473
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:54,160
Mr. Ding, Mr. Liu, M.r Li.

474
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,760
-Scholars must not only acquire knowledge,
-Right.

475
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,160
but also observe the world around them.

476
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,570
Pay attention to the people,

477
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:05,440
to the country.

478
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,880
I hope you can educate your
pupils based on this in future.

479
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,890
Yes, sir.

480
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,520
I pronounce that...

481
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,440
scholar Wen Bin has lied to everyone...

482
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,440
in order to protect the thief, Ah Mu.

483
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,250
He must be punished.

484
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,690
Your punishment is for you, along with
Cheng Jun, Lei Ze Xin, Yu Le Xuan...

485
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:39,280
to find out the whereabouts of the
lingzhi powder within three days.

486
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:44,850
Yes, sir.

487
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,400
-Yes.
-Thank you, Master Wang.

488
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:52,450
As the president, you've failed to
find out the truth of the case.

489
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,400
You almost accused Wen Bin wrongly.

490
00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:00,090
I'll take off 20 noble points
as your punishment.

491
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,210
Master Wang,

492
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:03,890
I've been obeying all your instructions.

493
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,850
Wen Bin is definitely guilty.

494
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,280
Please look into it, Master Wang.

495
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,370
As an Investigating Censor,

496
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,090
and the president of Yun Shang Academy,

497
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:18,920
you should look at things objectively,
adhere to fairness,

498
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,080
and consider various factors,

499
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:25,130
rather than judging indiscriminately
and thinking out of personal interest.

500
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,920
How would you become...

501
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,010
a qualified official
when you're narrow-minded like that?

502
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:45,250
Are you disappointed with how
things turned out, Master Wang?

503
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,200
very satisfied

504
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:54,770
Then why did you ask them to look
for the lingzhi powder, Master Wang?

505
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,250
They are still childish.

506
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:01,130
If Feng Cheng Jun hadn't been
able to make Ah Mu confess,

507
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,370
the consequences would be unthinkable.

508
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:09,200
Adversity is the grindstone of life.

509
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,770
Only when there is adversity
can we have expectations.

510
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:17,200
Mr. Ding, aren't you looking
forward to their performance?

511
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,360
I am indeed.

512
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,160
Why hasn't Brother Feng come back yet?

513
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,320
Is he not going to forgive me?

514
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,160
I don't believe he won't
come back to sleep tonight.

515
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,970
Maybe he has moved to the superior room.

516
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,040
Really? Did he tell you that?

517
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:51,530
He moved?

518
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,770
I couldn't wait for him to move.
At least now the room is quieter.

519
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,480
Is that true?

520
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,640
Of course not.

521
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,090
You deserve a punch in your face.

522
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,850
An apology has to be sincere.

523
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,210
I'll go to the kitchen.

524
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,610
Great idea.

525
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:10,770
Come on.

526
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,330
I don't know how to cook. Why should I go?

527
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,560
It's only sincere if we do it together.
Otherwise, the taste would be off.

528
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,880
-Come on.
-Let's go.

529
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,890
Bring him along.

530
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,130
Let's go.

531
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,010
President, I can explain. President...

532
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,090
President...

533
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,090
Get lost!

534
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,230
President, I didn't expect that
Feng Cheng Jun would make that move.

535
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,320
Shut up.

536
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,920
Just stop talking.

537
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,650
President...

538
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,730
Lin Bing Shen,

539
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,200
I hope you can live like a human being.

540
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,890
Live up to your role as a scholar.

541
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,320
Take responsibility for your actions.

542
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:25,409
I'm willing to bet
he won't ignore those dishes.

543
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,679
What does he mean by doing that?

544
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,040
Is he trying to shut us out?

545
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,239
He can't be serious.

546
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,170
He's pushing his luck.
How dare he shut us out?

547
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,820
Brother, I...

548
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,410
-Let's go.
-Wait.

549
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,040
You...

550
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,870
Brother Bin, you're good at cooking.

551
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,320
You're not angry?

552
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:12,280
You've cooked so many dishes.
Why would I be?

553
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,440
Brother Cheng Jun, I'm the one who
washed all the vegetables here.

554
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,440
You actually started eating without us.
You're awful.

555
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,410
That's right, so selfish.

556
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,720
Brother Bin, there will be no
food left if you don't sit down now.

557
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:33,790
Actually we made this specially for you
as an apology.

558
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:37,960
This should be a celebration
for you for clearing your name.

559
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,780
I have a little question.

560
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,280
Why did you close the door,
Brother Cheng Jun?

561
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,480
Would you have come in
if I hadn't closed it?

562
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,000
Now we know who is the
most cunning one among us.

563
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,890
Don't forget the investigation
hasn't ended yet.

564
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,930
I'll go along with your plan for now.

565
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,280
Teamwork is the best path to success.

566
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,610
Well said.

567
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,240
Starting today,
we, the Four Gentlemen of Yun Shang

568
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,240
will stick together
through thick and thin.

569
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,240
Here.

570
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,850
I've sincerely cooked a feast for you.

571
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,610
But you're still ignoring me
despite finishing the food.

572
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,480
You're not the one who cooked it.

573
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,520
And I didn't get to enjoy it alone.

574
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:30,930
That doesn't count.

575
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,930
Are you perhaps jealous?

576
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,560
Jealous?

577
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,610
Brother Feng, you're so petty.

578
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,200
I can always make another table
of dishes just for you...

579
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,040
after the lingzhi powder is found,
what do you say?

580
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:48,760
That's more like it.

581
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:02,040
[Ah Mu said he sold the herb to
a man named Miao Xiang Dong.]

582
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,240
[I've asked around.]

583
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,720
[He owns a warehouse in the
mountain behind Hemiao Village.]

584
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,370
[He stocked up supplies amid
the bad year to drive the price up.]

585
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,040
[He'll lead us to the lingzhi powder.]

586
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,440
[Feng Cheng Jun and I will ask
for Imperial Brigade's help.]

587
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,760
[You and Wen Bin go and keep
watch at the warehouse.]

588
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:23,880
Let's go.

589
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,720
Uncle,

590
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:34,770
look.

591
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:43,850
These packs of lingzhi powder are
of the rare and finest quality.

592
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:46,520
Your 60th birthday is
only a few days away.

593
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:49,930
I was planning to give it to you then.

594
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:53,720
But since you're here today, take it home.

595
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,410
I'm worried that...

596
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,760
if people of Yun Shang Academy
continue the investigation,

597
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,280
what would happen
if they find out about our business?

598
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,610
Things could turn complicated.

599
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,280
Don't worry, Uncle.

600
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,100
We've got the protection from
so many officials.

601
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,050
What do you know?

602
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,930
Do you know that...

603
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:22,450
the investigator is the
governor's son, Feng Cheng Jun?

604
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,920
Wait here, Wen Bin.
I'll go in and have a look.

605
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,200
Let's go together.

606
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:34,850
Who is there?

607
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,210
Uncle, I'll go and check it out.

608
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,370
Wen Bin.

609
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,000
If a fight breaks out later,
grab a chance and run.

610
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,280
Don't distract me.

611
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,200
Who are you?

612
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,000
We are scholars of Yun Shang.

613
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,280
We are serving as Investigating Censor
to investigate the lingzhi powder theft.

614
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,280
We appreciate your cooperation
in our investigation.

615
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,170
Bring two men with you.

616
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,040
Leave with the Lord through the back door.

617
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,040
Yes, sir.

618
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,880
Stop playing tricks.

619
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,480
Surrender obediently.

620
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,580
I'll personally take you
to the government office.

621
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,170
Such stupid fool.

622
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,170
Go now.

623
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,010
-Grab him!
-Be careful, Brother!

624
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,760
Grab him.

625
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,720
Grab him now!

626
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,680
-Stop there!
-Go.

627
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,680
Stop there, stop!

628
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,440
Stop there, stop!

629
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,520
Get up!

630
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,930
Get up!

631
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,720
Loser, hurry up!

632
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,650
Brother!

633
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,240
Brother!

634
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,930
I'll take care of you later.

635
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,450
-This way. Hurry!
-Brother!

636
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,560
Stop there!

637
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,450
Go after him!

638
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,330
Capture them all!

639
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,720
-Let go of me!
-Don't move!

640
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,760
Let go of me!

641
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,650
Don't move!

642
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,130
-Come here!
-Let go of me!

643
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,330
Wait.

644
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:27,890
-Shut up!
-Let me go!

645
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,690
-You've got the wrong person.
-My Lord.

646
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,090
Let go of me!

647
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:31,890
Don't move!

648
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:32,890
Let go!

649
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,240
-Stand still!
-Let go!

650
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,370
You must be Miao Xiang Dong.

651
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,240
Why are you looking for me?

652
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,560
Because you broke the law.

653
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:53,760
He was just right here.

654
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,210
Where did he go?

655
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,450
You go over there.

656
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,560
Where else can you run to now?

657
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,000
-I think he's dying.
-Yes.

658
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,370
-Help!
-Let's go, let's go.

659
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,960
Wen Bin!

660
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,650
Cheng Jun.

661
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,610
Uncle Lei,

662
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:56,000
what we're looking for is not here.

663
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,370
Then what should we do now?

664
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,690
Brother Le Xuan,

665
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,210
let's take inventory of these stocks.

666
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,480
Miao Xiang Dong,

667
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,130
if you are a law-abiding businessman,

668
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,450
you'd better come clean about
the source of these stocks.

669
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:27,050
Wen Bin.
