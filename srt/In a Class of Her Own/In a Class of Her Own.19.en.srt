00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,860
my name is Wen Xi.

176
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,430
Wen Bin is my younger brother.

177
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,450
Wen Bin... Wen Bin has fainted.

178
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,040
He has been sent to Fu Ze Hall.

179
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,520
Let's go to Fu Ze Hall.

180
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,280
Stay calm.

181
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,310
I think Wen Bin must be too tired...

182
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,990
from taking care of the three of us.

183
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,150
We're off.

184
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,640
Don't move.

185
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,170
Slowly, slowly.

186
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,190
That's how I got into
Yun Shang Academy.

187
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,190
How could your family...

188
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,840
allow you to commit such an
inexcusable offense?

189
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,710
They are guilty, too.

190
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,230
This is serious.

191
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,130
If you want to save your family,

192
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,640
from now on,

193
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,230
you must be extremely careful
in everything you do.

194
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,750
Don't ever get caught.

195
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,910
What a pity.

196
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,990
As long as you are in the academy,

197
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,590
you must live and learn
according to our schedule.

198
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,510
At the soonest opportunity,

199
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,230
I will...

200
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,380
have you expelled from the academy.

201
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
Wen Bin.

202
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,130
Wen Bin, what's wrong with you?

203
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,390
I'm fine. Mr. Ding said my constitution
is weak.

204
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,710
Weak constitution?

205
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,320
I'll take you out for
something nutritious.

206
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,630
Thank you everyone.

207
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,130
I am fine.

208
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,620
What's the matter?

209
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,600
What's the matter?

210
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,050
Don't disturb him.

211
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,160
For the time being,

212
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,910
let him be.

213
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,180
Fine, we'll listen to
Le Xuan's advice.

214
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,980
Mr. Ding, how's Wen Bin?

215
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,250
He's fine.

216
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,370
Usually when a scholar is sick,

217
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,200
he would come to Fu Ze Hall
for treatment...

218
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,590
and have his visit recorded.

219
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,280
But when Wen Bin was sick,

220
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,720
you came to him instead,

221
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,240
without any paperwork, even.

222
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,470
Yu Le Xuan,

223
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,770
a person's energy is limited.

224
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,710
Don't use it in the wrong place.

225
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,390
Your priority is to study.

226
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,810
Don't ask unnecessary questions.

227
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,100
I care about Wen Bin,

228
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,500
but you are right,

229
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,400
I'll keep that in mind.

230
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,570
Wait.

231
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,840
Here's the cold medicine.

232
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,140
Pass it to Wen Bin.

233
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,400
How do you feel? What's your diagnosis?

234
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,080
As long as it's curable,

235
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,660
I'll do anything to find the cure.

236
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,450
You guys are better off without me.

237
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,200
I'm just a burden.

238
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,210
Little Brother, it's a small matter.

239
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,600
Don't scare yourself.

240
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,660
You're an essential member of this room.

241
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,070
Are you implying there are
non-essential tenants here?

242
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,350
Everyone's essential.

243
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,870
I can't live without all of you.

244
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,190
Then take good care of yourself
and get well soon.

245
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,200
Mother, rest early.

246
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,150
It's late. Don't get too tired.

247
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,360
I am fine.

248
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,220
Sister reminded you in her letter...

249
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,960
not to get too tired.

250
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,470
Get some rest now.

251
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,440
For the past six months,

252
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,390
your sister hasn't worn any dresses.

253
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,120
When she comes back for the new year,

254
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,700
I want to make a dress for her.

255
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,120
Let her dress up...

256
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,610
like a young lady.

257
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,500
Mother, I'm sure Sister will love...

258
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,210
the dress you make.

259
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,960
Come and help me.

260
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,070
[Am I going to leave just like that?]

261
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,430
[I made a mistake while I was drunk.]

262
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,990
[Little Brother got worn out
because of me.]

263
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,710
[Lei Qi Ying,]

264
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,830
[why did you kill
Xue Ding Kun and his family?]

265
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,950
[Mr. Ding didn't report Wen Bin.]

266
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,150
[Why?]

267
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,710
[It's even more dangerous
for Wen Bin to stay.]

268
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,870
[The archery ceremony
is just around the corner.]

269
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Principal Feng.

270
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,560
Good news.

271
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,640
What good news?

272
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,680
Take a guess.

273
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,320
Guess who is hosting the
archery ceremony this year?

274
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Who?

275
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,760
It's Master Wang.

276
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,870
This is unexpected.

277
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,320
Master Wang came back from the capital...

278
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,080
just to host the archery ceremony.

279
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,120
Yun Shang Academy would be
greatly honoured by his presence.

280
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,290
Mr. Ding,

281
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,640
you don't look very happy.

282
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,720
I am thinking...

283
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,640
if Master Wang is coming to host
the archery ceremony,

284
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,520
the scholars must do their best...

285
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,920
and put their best foot forward.

286
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,670
So that we and the academy...

287
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,450
will look good.

288
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,940
You are right, Mr. Ding.

289
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,400
Master Wang is hosting
the ceremony personally.

290
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,920
I must strive for perfection.

291
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,430
I will do my best.

292
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,599
So that I could be recommended
to become a government official...

293
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,030
and serve the country for real.

294
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:19,970
Principal, are we going to town with the
format and decorations this year?

295
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,530
Master Wang takes content seriously.

296
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,130
Not the scholars' outer appearance,

297
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,040
the colourful decoration
and the deafening music.

298
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:30,750
Formality is important
during Master Wang's visit.

299
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,010
It is a sign of respect to the
Imperial Preceptor.

300
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,510
[Before the archery ceremony,]

301
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,380
[Wen Xi must leave the academy.]

302
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,660
I've prepared a pathological report
for you.

303
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,690
Apply for your leave from the principal.

304
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,280
Go home and rest.

305
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,310
Must I leave now?

306
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,530
I can't think of a better time.

307
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,340
If you stay on,

308
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,710
you must participate in
the archery ceremony.

309
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,030
You've made a deep impression
on Master Wang.

310
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,350
If you impress him further this time,

311
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,800
you will never get to leave this academy.

312
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,090
After you've gone home,

313
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,860
I'll inform Master Wang...

314
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,520
that you are very sick,

315
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,320
and you can't continue with your studies.

316
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,830
Master Wang will understand.

317
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,930
You won't be held accountable.

318
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,480
Thank you, Mr. Ding.

319
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,590
-What is this?
-What's the matter?

320
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,990
What's written on it?

321
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,010
What's written on it?

322
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,990
Let's go.

323
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,600
The archery ceremony
will be held on the eighth.

324
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,760
Master Wang will be here to host it.

325
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,720
We hope all scholars will study hard...

326
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,670
and put their best foot forward...

327
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,240
and showcase Yun Shang Academy's
school spirit.

328
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,440
As is customary,

329
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,960
we'll form teams this year.

330
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,050
The difference would be,

331
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,720
as an encouragement,

332
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,590
Principal Feng will award the
winning team with an additional reward.

333
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,760
Each team member will get
an additional 100 nobility marks,

334
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,640
and...

335
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,920
100 nobility marks.

336
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,520
1000 taels as reward money.

337
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,990
1000 taels.

338
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,680
Little Brother,

339
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,520
the upcoming archery ceremony...

340
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,440
is our chance to rack up nobility marks.

341
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,740
The announcement says...

342
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,620
each member of the winning team
will get 100 nobility marks...

343
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,300
and 1000 taels of reward money.

344
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,940
I don't even know how to shoot.

345
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,490
How are we supposed to win?

346
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,240
It's all right. We still
have time to practise.

347
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:11,240
Junior, I am good at archery.

348
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,560
I can teach you.

349
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,450
I can teach you, too.

350
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,720
Get the basics down.

351
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,740
Hard work and talent matter,

352
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,500
but determination is key.

353
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,340
I am afraid nobody wants
to form a team with me.

354
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,740
Says who? You can count me in.

355
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,550
My bet is on Wen Bin and Cheng Jun.

356
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,850
We can form a team.

357
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
Brother Zhao Hui.

358
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,690
I would like to ask...

359
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,700
if you are still looking for people?

360
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,840
Yes.

361
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,040
Don't be surprised.

362
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,480
Actually,

363
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,510
apart from God,

364
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:54,290
Wen Bin is the one I admire
the most in this academy.

365
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:57,500
I hope you don't mind having me
as a team mate.

366
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,760
Of course not.

367
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,750
What if I'm a deadweight
and make you lose?

368
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,730
-No.
-If we are afraid of losing,

369
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,450
we wouldn't be here today.

370
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:09,230
We need only one more team member.

371
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,510
Brother Zhao Hui, why don't you...

372
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,390
decide?

373
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,390
You decide.

374
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,270
You first.

375
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,430
You first.

376
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,670
-Why don't we...
-Why don't we...

377
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,210
-decide together?
-decide together?

378
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,680
Brother Ze Xin?

379
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,630
Look at him.

380
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,270
It's fine, we still have time
before the archery ceremony.

381
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,870
We'll find a suitable candidate.

382
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,830
It's important to start training now.

383
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,990
I don't think we should rush it.

384
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,150
Look at Wen Bin,

385
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,590
he looks dispirited and distracted.

386
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,950
Wen Bin needs to see the doctor.

387
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,290
I'll send for him.

388
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,410
Wait.

389
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,030
I...

390
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,230
I feel fine already.

391
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,230
But I don't know a thing about archery,

392
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,460
and I feel anxious.

393
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,750
That scoundrel Wei Zhao Hui...

394
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:09,670
has already persuaded
Feng Cheng Jun to join their team.

395
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,510
If that's his idea,

396
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,830
let him be.

397
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,290
But...

398
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,190
but we'll lose face.

399
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,660
Your reputation...

400
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,570
comes from yourself.

401
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,630
When we beat Feng Cheng Jun,

402
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,110
Wei Zhao Hui and
those newly arrived aristocrats...

403
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,440
will finally know...

404
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:32,900
who is the most powerful.

405
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,330
Good.

406
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,750
Try it.

407
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,480
Use your strength.

408
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,270
It's all right, try again.

409
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,510
I am rusty.

410
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,550
Please rest assured,

411
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,990
I'll practise harder.

412
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,190
Before the ceremony,

413
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,350
I'll definitely give you
a satisfactory result.

414
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,430
Good.

415
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,350
You are better than Wei Zhao Hui.

416
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,680
Bing Shen, your turn.

417
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
All right.

418
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,410
President, I...

419
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,600
Bing Shen,

420
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,110
don't say I didn't give you a chance.

421
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,520
Our opponent is Feng Cheng Jun.

422
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,300
I... I'm not practising anymore.

423
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Come, I'll help you.

424
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,950
Come.

425
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,390
[At the soonest opportunity,]

426
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,270
[I'll have you expelled from the academy.]

427
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,040
Hold tight.

428
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,670
[No.]

429
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,990
[I can't give
Brother Feng false hope.]

430
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,230
[I shouldn't let him be kind to me.]

431
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,060
You try it yourself.

432
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,000
Are you performing acrobatics?

433
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,130
I can't do it.

434
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,320
Everything is difficult in the beginning.

435
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,830
You just need to work harder.

436
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,770
That's easy for you to say.

437
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,430
I don't have the makings of an archer.

438
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,140
It's useless even if I train hard.

439
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,070
I should quit.

440
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:30,680
Little Brother, how can you quit
without even trying?

441
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:34,320
Have you really tried to hit the bullseye?

442
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,760
I can't do it.

443
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:43,500
How can one excel with just a few days
of practice?

444
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,840
It's no use even if I practice.

445
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:48,730
Feng Cheng Jun,

446
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,390
nobody is stopping you from
becoming a government official.

447
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,670
But Wen Bin is weak...

448
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,760
and he wasn't trained in archery.

449
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,680
Don't force him to do things
that he doesn't want to do.

450
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,870
Brother Ze Xin, Little Brother
barely has any nobility points left.

451
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,190
The ceremony is a good chance
to get nobility points.

452
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,220
Otherwise, how would he
become an official?

453
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,430
My junior has announced...

454
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,750
that he's quitting.

455
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,530
He has the right to make
his own decisions.

456
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,430
Don't force him.

457
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,550
Let's go.

458
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,230
Have you really decided?

459
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,250
Little Brother.

460
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,860
Brother Feng.

461
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,300
-Cheng Jun.
-Let's hope he's alright.

462
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,950
-Brother Feng.
-Quick!

463
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:52,870
Are you all right?

464
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,030
Don't move. You might sprain your arm.

465
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,810
Let's go.

466
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,890
Slowly.

467
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,030
You are badly injured.
Why don't you go to Fu Ze Hall?

468
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,690
I'm afraid to tell Principal Feng.

469
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,550
He'll forbid me to participate.

470
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,430
You're still thinking about the ceremony?

471
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,190
It takes a hundred days to heal.

472
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,630
Even if you qualify,

473
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,410
you wouldn't have the strength to do it.

474
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:27,820
Wen Bin, what do you think about
Brother Cheng Jun's injury?

475
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,690
I am afraid our team...

476
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,880
Cheng Jun, it's all right.

477
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:37,400
The ceremony is just a competition.
Participation is all that matters,

478
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,820
-don't you think so?
-Yes.

479
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:41,020
There's still time before
the archery ceremony.

480
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,390
A miracle will happen.

481
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,490
Yes, you are right.

482
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,870
You think miracles happen all the time?

483
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,030
He didn't break any bones. He is fine.

484
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,940
Some ointment and some sleep,
and he'll be fine.

485
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,710
Brother Ze Xin is right,

486
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,760
God will protect us.

487
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,390
May God bless us.

488
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,370
How did the rack collapse?

489
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:07,400
Feng Cheng Jun
must have knocked it down.

490
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,330
How unlucky for Feng Cheng Jun.

491
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,090
That's not important.

492
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,730
President, I've received confirmation...

493
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,800
that Feng Cheng Jun had injured
his right arm.

494
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,930
There's no way he could draw a bow.

495
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,050
I think we'll definitely win.

496
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,710
For old time's sake,

497
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,260
won't you help me?

498
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,610
I'm warning you,

499
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,740
if you consider me a friend,

500
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,630
you'd better step it up.

501
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,530
Bing Shen,

502
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,660
the archery ceremony is important.

503
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,010
Your foundation is poor.

504
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,010
You still have time to practise.

505
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,690
You must change your mindset
and work hard.

506
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,770
Do you understand?

507
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,890
I'll try my best.

508
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,330
Don't try. Just do it.

509
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,410
If you fail in this competition,

510
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:57,630
don't blame me for being cruel.

511
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:02,130
Don't worry, I won't let you down.

512
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,720
I've decided to use my
left hand to draw the bow.

513
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,400
My left hand has no strength.
I'm as rusty as you.

514
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,180
You want to train up your
left arm in such a short period?

515
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,170
You overestimate yourself.

516
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,790
Let us try together, Little Brother.

517
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,700
Brother Feng,

518
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,700
some things in life are not
within our control.

519
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,510
Why are you so adamant?

520
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,580
A true man will
persevere until the end.

521
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,010
You wouldn't understand
what I am going through.

522
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,230
Unless a miracle happens...

523
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,450
Or else...

524
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,260
I am going for training.
Are you coming?

525
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,760
Should I ask him to give up?

526
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,330
-Just let him think about it.
-Cheng Jun.

527
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,000
Young Master Feng, Cheng Jun.

528
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,960
You mustn't practise anymore.

529
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,680
Let me have a look.

530
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,310
Your injury is serious.

531
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,630
Can you take part in the competition?

532
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,650
Don't worry, Principal Feng,

533
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,910
I'll recover after a few days' rest.

534
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,710
Recover?

535
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,380
Such injury takes
a hundred days to heal.

536
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,350
Look at your injury.

537
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,790
You need at least
a year and a half to recuperate.

538
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:57,450
You should go home
at once and rest.

539
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:00,400
I'll prepare a sedan chair
for you right away.

540
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,370
You can no longer stay in the academy.

541
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,240
If anything happens to you,

542
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,850
what would I tell Lord Feng?

543
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,540
Don't worry, Principal.

544
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,460
I won't go home
before the end of semester.

545
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,150
Young Master Feng!

546
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:21,090
Look at him, he's so stubborn.

547
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,810
You can aim very well, President.

548
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,960
Feng Cheng Jun is
drawing his bow and arrow again.

549
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,130
Is this good news or bad news?

550
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,890
Didn't he injure his right arm?

551
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,170
How could he shoot?

552
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,300
With his left hand.

553
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,180
Left hand?

554
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,220
He wants to beat us
with his left hand?

555
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,860
In his dreams.

556
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,670
This is called bragging.

557
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,010
Brother Cheng Jun,

558
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,000
you did it.

559
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,760
You hit the bullseye.

560
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,640
Thank you, God.

561
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,950
Brother Cheng Jun,

562
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,760
you efforts have paid off.

563
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,280
Keep practising.

564
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,290
You have great strength.

565
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,570
Good.

566
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,650
He's over there.

567
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,900
Good shot.

568
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,360
Keep it up.

569
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,640
Wen Bin.

570
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,330
Wen Bin.

571
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,760
Stop playing with water.

572
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,030
I have something to tell you.
Come with me.

573
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,690
Let's go.

574
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,420
They are all connected.

575
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,360
Take a look.

576
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,000
Wen Bin is here.

577
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,560
Cheng Jun, show Wen Bin your skills.

578
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,880
Come on.

579
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,500
Good.

580
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,199
Well?

581
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,980
I told you a miracle would happen.

582
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,199
Brother Cheng Jun,

583
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,239
I admire you.

584
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Well?

585
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,800
Ze Xin.

586
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Take this.

587
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,150
Come on, Wen Bin.

588
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,680
Cheng Jun's left hand has
no strength, just like yours.

589
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,590
But with training,

590
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,920
he can now hit the bullseye.

591
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,140
You have no excuse to quit.

592
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,000
Yes, Brother Zhao Rong is right.

593
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,320
Wen Bin, as long as you practise,

594
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,880
you'll find a way.

595
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,560
God will protect you.

596
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,160
Little Brother,
we don't expect you to win,

597
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,780
but we want you to embrace
the challenge.

598
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Take it.

599
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,280
Come,

600
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,600
take a shot.

601
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,540
Wen Bin.

602
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,670
I can't do it.

603
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:59,320
Wen Bin, you bemoan the disparity
between the rich and the poor...

604
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,080
and the inequality between men
and women.

605
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,400
Do you only know how to complain?

606
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,860
We can't choose our origin,

607
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,390
but we can choose our future...

608
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,700
and the roads that we take.

609
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,960
Master Wang has high hopes for you.

610
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,460
You've made our school a better place.

611
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,380
Why don't you keep it up?

612
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,270
Reach for your dreams,

613
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,840
make the world a fairer place.

614
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,820
You are not a coward, Little Brother.

615
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,800
Life is like a bow and arrow,

616
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,700
once you draw it, there's no turning back.

617
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,670
You must persevere until the end.

618
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,640
No one can help you.

619
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,040
Only you can help yourself.

620
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,430
Think about it.

621
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:01,850
Junior,

622
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,710
he called you a coward.

623
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,720
You must fight back.

624
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,770
Don't let him look down on you.

625
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:13,880
You must prove all the naysayers wrong.

626
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:18,890
Even if you hit a dead end,

627
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,580
don't lose your faith.

628
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,720
Besides, I've got your back.

629
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,360
I won't take leave.

630
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,890
I won't leave the academy.
