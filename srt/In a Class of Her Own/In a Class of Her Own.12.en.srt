[Episode 12]

4
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,100
Each of these dialogue novels...

5
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,900
has a distinctive style,
handwriting and viewpoint.

6
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,930
So what exactly is going on?

7
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,729
Principal Feng,

8
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,650
It was me who wrote the blue book.

9
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,970
Feng Chen Jun, even you would write
such garbage.

10
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,060
You've brought shame upon the academy.
You ought to be be punished severely.

11
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,570
Cheng Jun,

12
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,250
did you really write the blue book?

13
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,979
Yes.

14
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,259
No wonder.

15
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,280
It is aspiring,

16
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,620
full of talents.

17
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,510
[Cognition]

18
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,650
A feast to the eyes!

19
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,690
Good job!

20
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,210
Principal Feng, I wrote the black book.

21
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,020
So Lei Ze Xin...

22
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,310
is a man versed in literature
and martial arts.

23
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,740
Good. Good job. Great job.

24
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,130
As for Lei Ze Xin's work,

25
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,750
it is staunch,

26
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,490
inspiring,

27
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,020
chivalrous and tender-hearted.

28
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:55,260
As for the last one,

29
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,620
it must have been written by Wen Bin.

30
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,930
Did you really write this?

31
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,540
Yes.

32
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,450
Principal Feng.

33
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,100
These students have violated the rules.

34
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,360
The Student Council beseeches you
to punish them.

35
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,900
You don't have to remind me.

36
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,050
I know what to do.

37
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,410
Go back to your class!

38
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,060
Yes.

39
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,180

[Awareness]

41
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,620
Well that was a dramatic turn.

42
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,490
In a blink of an eye, we've gone
from underground to being in public.

43
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,230
Our top priority now
is to transcribe the part...

44
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,690
that was confiscated.

45
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,050
That should be easy for you.

46
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,850
The book market
has been sluggish recently,

47
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,160
but I have an idea...

48
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,770
which can increase the sales
of the dialogue novels.

49
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,950
Do you want to know?

50
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,930
Just tell me already.
Don't beat around the bush.

51
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,290
If Mu Xiao Man could write a letter
to promote it,

52
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,660
I'm sure many men would read it.

53
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,720
You're right.

54
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,440
But you have to do it on your own...

55
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,780
because Mu Xiao Man will only help you.

56
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,170
Owing her a favour
is the last thing I want.

57
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,180
Who owes whom doesn't matter.

58
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,570
What matters is talent.

59
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,500
The thing is...

60
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,050
we can make money with talent.

61
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,850
It's just a promotional letter.

62
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,620
That's nothing to Mu Xiao Man.

63
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,570
I will go with you.

64
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,690
Sister, happy birthday.
May all your dreams come true.

65
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,570
You're getting better at making fun of me.

66
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,500
But thank you for your wishes.

67
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,280
You're so beautiful and talented.

68
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,600
I'm worried that once
the embroidered ball is cast,

69
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,230
all the men will fight tooth
and nail for it.

70
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,570
I hope no one will get hurt.

71
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,620
I will only throw my embroidered ball
to one person.

72
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,940
But I don't know if he will take it...

73
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,090
or if he will be able to.

74
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,350
You think too much.

75
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,510
If he ever turns you down,

76
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,409
he is definitely not a man.

77
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,250
Sister,

78
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,670
Mr. Han was handing out gifts to everyone
just now.

79
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,570
Even the servant in the kitchen
received a great reward.

80
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,740
Mr. Han is really generous.

81
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,620
Mr. Han.

82
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,460
Mr. Han.

83
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,530
Thank you, Mr. Han.

84
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,850
Xiao Man, this is the gift
that you've wanted the most.

85
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,690
It's so beautiful!

Mr. Han, you have such a good memory.

97
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,500
Unfortunately,

98
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,690
I don't remember it anymore.

[Diligence Pavilion]

100
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,690
Principal Feng talked to me for so long,
on an open day, no less.

101
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,620
I bet the dialogue novel
must be very entertaining.

102
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,160
Even he enjoys reading dialogue novels.

103
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,450
There's surely money in it.

104
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,570
How much can I make with it?

105
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,020
This is bad.

106
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,000
I promised Le Xuan to meet Ms. Mu
with him,

107
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,740
I'm going to be late.

108
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,230
I hope she's not angry.

109
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,770
Otherwise we won't get her letter.

110
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,150
Without the letter,

111
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,170
we won't get to make money!

112
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,060
Mister, this way please.

113
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,540
Such a sweet-talker.

114
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,090
President, isn't that Yu Le Xuan?

115
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,560
I knew it,

116
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,180
you are really here.

117
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,770
Brother Le Xuan, you always were
a party animal.

118
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,950
I enjoy watching the shows.

119
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,840
Not to mention Ms. Mu's annual
embroidered ball show.

120
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,860
I wonder if she will throw
the embroidered ball this year.

121
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,160
And most of all, who will get it?

122
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,760
As long as I am here,

123
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,540
even if she really throws it,

124
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,420
no one would dare to take it.

125
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,010
What if someone takes it?

126
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,530
Well then, just wait and see.

127
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,429
Why hasn't she come out yet?

128
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,280
-Yeah.
-She's the prettiest lady in Yunzhou.

129
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,900
She's not someone whom you can see
whenever you want.

130
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,240
Who said she's the prettiest?

131
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,990
I wonder who'll get
the embroidered ball.

132
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,390
Who'd have the cheek?

133
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,390
-Yeah, not when you're here.
-Like a fairy.

134
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,310
There's no way Cai Yun House has a fairy.

135
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,280
Exactly!

136
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,340
You will know after you see her.

137
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,090
Mr. Wen is not here.
I will not perform today.

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,600
Sister, there are so many people here.
You can't do this.

139
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,580
Exactly.

140
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,100
Go ahead!

141
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,240
She's here.

142
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,580
Ms. Mu is here.

143
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,340
She's here.

144
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,980
-She's so beautiful.
-She is!

145
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,140
-Mr. Wen is here.
-He's here.

146
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,310
Great!

147
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,070
-She threw the embroidered ball.
-Great.

148
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,170
Mu Xiao Man finally threw
the embroidered ball.

149
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,500
-Why did he throw the ball away?
-What is he doing?

150
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,410
Why did he throw it away?

151
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,680
That's bad luck.

152
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,660
That's...

153
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,940
He just threw it away.

154
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,220
What is happening?

155
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,240
That's bad luck!

156
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,280
This is the first time it's happened.

157
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,990
Does he hate Mu Xiao Man that much?

158
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,220
-You're right!
-He tossed it just like that!

159
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,480
Sister.

160
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,240
Sister, ignore him. Let's get out of here.

161
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,920
He took it but he threw it away.

162
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,860
What is wrong with him? That's too much.

163
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,300
Ms. Xiao Man is so unlucky.

164
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,190
Exactly. What would Ms. Xiao Man do?

165
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,490
She will never get married.

166
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,950
You ought to think properly.

167
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,130
How dare you!

168
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,870
Why did he throw the ball away
after taking it?

169
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,310
Don't pick it up, then. Jeez.

170
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,160
You mustn't pick up the embroidered ball.

171
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,510
Or you'll get bad luck!

172
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,390
That's right!

173
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,950
Who will marry her now?

174
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,730
The embroidered ball has been dropped.

175
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,690
Actually, it slipped. I couldn't catch it.

176
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,250
-He picked it up!
-He picked it back up.

177
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,260
I got it.

178
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,690
Such a good match.

179
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,550
So nice.

180
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,430
President... Calm down.

181
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,170
It's a good thing.

182
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,840
Lin Bing Shen, take President away.

183
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,050
President, calm down.

184
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,860
Mister, you weren't here earlier.

185
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,550
I thought you would not come.

186
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,160
That would've put me on the spot.

187
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,420
Mister, why didn't you come earlier today?

188
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,860
Principal Feng was asking me
about the novel.

189
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,550
-Did he scold you?
-No!

190
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,660
He asked me about the story of the novel.

191
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,250
Ms. Mu,

192
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,130
could you write a letter
to promote the dialogue novel?

193
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,900
It will be even more popular.

194
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,410
Do you mean this?

195
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,720
Mister, sister has prepared this
long time ago.

196
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,180
She's been carrying it with her,
waiting for you to come.

197
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,280
Mister, if you hadn't come,

198
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,260
all the sisters in Cai Yun House
would have hated you.

199
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,430
You have no idea...

200
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,810
how much she's been suffering,
longing for you.

201
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,730
There are so many rules in the academy.

202
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,460
I got into a big trouble today as well.

203
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,760
Mister, no matter
what happens in the future,

204
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,370
we'll face it together. Don't be scared.

205
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,220
That's very thoughtful of you, Ms. Mu.

206
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,180
But I'm a struggling student with no hope
of a bright future.

207
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,200
I'm afraid I will let you down.

208
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,280
Mister, don't worry about me.

209
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,780
What I mean is...

210
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,720
I am a worthless man.
I'm used to living my life freely.

211
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,100
I'm afraid I will hurt you
without realising it.

212
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,100
I can't face you like this.

213
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,340
There's no "you" or "me" now, only "us".

214
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,820
You have no idea what I'm thinking.

215
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,420
[Ke Shi Jun,]

216
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,180
[you have six hours
to surrender yourself.]

217
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,980
[He's really hiding here.]

218
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,900
Ke Shi Jun.

219
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,890
-You've got the wrong guy.
-You're the one.

220
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,380
Let's take a trip
to the government's office.

221
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,460
If you wish to live,

222
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,380
tell me the truth about what happened
18 years ago.

223
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,820
I... I was merely a survivor.

224
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,660
I wanted nothing but to live.

225
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,940
Back then,

226
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,820
it was Commander Mu
who told me to leave immediately.

227
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,040
That's how I survived.

228
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,940
You'd better tell me
what happened back then.

229
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,240
Alright.

230
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,220
Alright.

231
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,580
I've jotted down everything
that happened 18 years ago.

232
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,980
I'll show it to you now.

233
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,820
I'll show it to you now.

234
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,140
Everything is written in this notebook.

235
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,900
Take your time.

236
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,180
How dare you lie to me!

237
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,980
You sniveling bastard.

238
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,900
Why are you back so early?

239
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,740
What happened?

240
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,660
You don't look so well.

241
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,460
I say...

242
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,340
Every second of a momentary pleasure
is priceless.

243
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,460
Even if you're willing to come back,

244
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,580
how could Mu Xiao Man let you leave?

245
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,880
Since when have you become
the general of Imperial Brigade?

246
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,240
Are you interrogating me?

247
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,780
Of course not.

248
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,820
I'm just feeling happy for both of you.

249
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,780
I just hope to see the two of you
tie the knot soon.

250
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,460
Stop making fun of me.

251
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,020
You already caught her embroidered ball.

252
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,100
What? Are you shy now?

253
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,140
You got too caught up in the show.
Now you think it's real.

254
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,500
Now you're confusing me.

255
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,980
Everybody saw you catching the ball.

256
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,040
Why the change of heart?

257
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,220
It's so hard to figure out
what you're thinking.

258
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,500
Figure it out yourself.
I'll go back and write the novel.

259
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,740
Come here and write.

260
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,870
It's quiet here.

261
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,700
If you don't disturb me,
I will write here.

262
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,380
I won't.

263
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,920
Brother Ze Xin, what happened to you?

264
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,780
Read your book.
It's none of your business.

265
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,620
It's none of your business,
do you hear me?

266
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,180
Since we live under the same roof,
we're friends.

267
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,700
We are not friends.

268
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,820
We will never be friends.

269
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,460
Don't talk so much when you're sick.

270
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,900
Wait for me.

271
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,100
I think you're having a fever.

272
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,260
Take it away.

273
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,900
What is wrong with you?

274
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,100
I'll put it here.

275
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,520
The news I heard can't be wrong.

276
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,780
Mu Xiao Man threw it casually,

277
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,820
Brother Wen Bin stuck out his hand,

278
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,340
and the embroidered ball
fell into his grasp.

279
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,380
Brother Wen Bin is definitely skilled
in such things.

280
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,480
-He surprised me.
-As expected from Wen Bin. He's amazing.

281
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,860
Dear God,

282
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,180
I have to use my wisdom to perform
in-depth analysis on Brother Wen Bin.

283
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,140
Brother Zi Feng, you've gone overboard.

284
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,280
That's just a rumour,
we shouldn't believe it.

285
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,280
Someone must be jealous
of Wen Bin's writing skills,

286
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,660
hence he's spreading rumours.

287
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
You must be right.

288
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,940
I met the president this morning.

289
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,500
He looked terrible.

290
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,180
I tried talking to him
but he completely ignored me.

291
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,980
That's right.

292
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,320
If this is true, we'll be in trouble.

293
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,800
Will he ever wear that pair
of shoes again?

294
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,640
You're right. That makes sense.

295
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,340
I think we should verify it
with Brother Wen Bin.

296
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,580
-Yes.
-We definitely need to verify it.

297
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,680
I admire Wen Bin even more now.

298
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,860
You admire him?

299
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,140
Then just go ahead.

300
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,820
What are you doing?

301
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,520
I've told you,

302
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,460
you should mind your posture,
standing or sitting.

303
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,580
As students of Yun Shang Academy,

304
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,500
you should be studying.

305
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,840
Instead, you act like ruffians,

306
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,880
making noise and having a frenzy.

307
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
-How inapt!
-Yes.

308
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,060
Go now.

309
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,920
-Let's go.
-Come on.

310
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,220
Mo Xiao Huan,

311
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,780
come back.

312
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,460
Whose embroidered ball did Wen Bin catch?

313
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,900
Haven't you heard about it?

314
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,860
Mu Xiao Man from Cai Yun House.

315
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,860
Nonsense!

316
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,000
I'll tell your grandpa if you lie.

317
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,300
No, I didn't!

318
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,380
Besides, my grandpa
doesn't like embroidered ball.

319
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,620
"At this moment,"

320
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,300
"the girl suddenly..."

321
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,180
Haven't you heard? He's here.

322
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,420
That's him.

323
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,060
He caught the embroidered ball.

324
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,660
I could catch Mu Xiao Man's
embroidered ball.

325
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,900
Did you see that?
That's Wen Bin. Let me tell you.

326
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,300
That's him. He's coming.

327
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,700
That's him.

328
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,180
He caught the embroidered ball.

329
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,060
Brother Wen Bin, is that true?

330
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,160
Wen Bin, you're amazing!

331
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,140
-Amazing!
-Go back to class.

332
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,060
Brother Wen Bin, tell me what happened.

333
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,540
Why didn't you tell me about it?

334
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,820
Why didn't you take me with you?
I could have cheered for you, Wen Bin.

335
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,920
Are you done talking?

336
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,460
It's all day with you.

337
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,640
We want to hear the story firsthand.

338
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,940
Then rumours will be dispelled.

339
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,840
That's right.

340
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,660
That's right.
We want to hear the firsthand story.

341
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,920
All of you have got the firsthand story.
Happy now?

342
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,220
That's it?

343
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,780
No one has seen you last night.

344
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,900
Where did you go?

345
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,100
Let's go.

346
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,540
Wen Bin.

347
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,680
-Are you bored?
-We are.

348
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,020
-Is it so interesting?
-It is.

349
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,440
-Just tell us. Tell us.
-Yes.

350
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,040
-Tell us.
-Come on.

351
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,080
Knock it off!

352
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,600
The teacher has arrived!

353
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,600
-The teacher is here.
-The teacher is here.

354
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,860
Go.

355
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,020
Brother Feng, why...

356
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,100
Why didn't you ask me anything?

357
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,340
Study first.

358
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,700
Would it kill you to not
get yourself hurt?

359
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,380
Don't forget that you're just a human.

360
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,700
Let's talk business.

361
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,860
-How about Ke Shi Jun?
-It's rather complicated.

362
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,420
He has an interesting background.

363
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,520
Your wound is quite serious.

364
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,900
Why don't you let the academy physician
check on it?

365
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,540
I'm fine.

366
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,740
Tell me what you think.

367
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,860
Ke Shi Jun is a tough guy.

368
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,380
He even tried to kill you.

369
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,620
Ke Shi Jun was hiding in Lin Village,

370
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,620
but the authorities never caught him.

371
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,000
The more I look into it,
the stranger it seems.

372
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,380
You're right.

373
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,300
Even you could find him,

374
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,900
let alone the authorities.

375
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,140
The Interrogation Hall's records...

376
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,400
stated that Ke Shi Jun
was living in Lin Village.

377
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,500
That would've been 18 years ago.

378
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,740
But...

379
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,380
he is still in Lin Village now.

380
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,820
-Could it be that...
-You're right.

381
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,060
Someone tampered with the handbook...

382
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,420
to lure us into finding him.

383
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,780
Who could that be?

384
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,800
There's a skilled fighter
among the teachers.

385
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,660
I had fought with him
before the school started.

386
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,100
On his waist,

387
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,660
there was a token
like the ones our teachers have.

388
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,580
Could he be...

389
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,580
Mr. Liu Qian Yi?

390
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,340
It's not him.

391
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,840
I know his fighting style well.

392
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,760
But besides him,

393
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,460
there's no one else in this academy
who can fight.

394
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,620
Experts tend to hide their light
under a bushel.

395
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,060
That leaves Mr. Li Hu.

396
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,540
Wen Bin.

397
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,780
What happened between you and Mu Xiao Man?

398
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,600
You've heard it all.

399
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,740
[What do you mean by that?]

400
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,700
The academy can do
whatever it wants to me.

401
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,880
That's all. I've said everything.

402
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,460
You've done it this time.

403
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,120
Not only did you catch
the embroidered ball,

404
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,820
you've made us all proud.

405
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,780
Now your name will go down in history.

406
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,400
Perhaps I should kowtow to you?

407
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,900
Mr. Li, I'll be frank with you.

408
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,100
I'm still puzzled.

409
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,120
[I don't know how the embroidered ball
ended up in my hand.]

410
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,740
You don't know?
Couldn't you react in time?

411
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,620
Wen Bin, oh, Wen Bin.

412
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,620
I think you're getting better
at making excuses now.

413
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,220
But let me tell you, you can't
just talk your way out of everything.

414
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,800
You were in the public and many people
were looking at you.

415
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,900
I heard you even strode proudly
onto the stage.

416
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,100
A student catching an embroidered
ball in Cai Yun House...

417
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,540
What will other people
will think of our academy?

418
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,900
Do you think you've brought honour to us?

419
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,040
Mr. Li, if I could give the ball to you,
I would.

420
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,780
Why... Why give it to me?

421
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,420
Why would I want it?

422
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,920
Are you out of mind?
Do you want to leave this place?

423
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,700
Do you want to get kicked out?

424
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,260
I was wrong, Mr. Li.

425
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,920
I was clueless then.

426
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,400
[I thought I was just catching a ball.
Then I realised...]

427
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,360
-what it meant,
-Well?

428
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,740
so I threw it away.

429
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,660
But after I threw it away,
I had to pick it back up.

430
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,700
Do you even understand my pain?

431
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,300
I can't say I do.

432
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,580
But why are you in pain?

433
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,400
-Who's eavesdropping out there?
-Split!

434
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,920
Nosing around instead of studying.

435
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,500
Do you want to get expelled?

436
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,180
The same goes for you.

437
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,980
Why did I have to catch
that embroidered ball?

438
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,220
Just do whatever you want to me.

439
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,860
What else can I do?

440
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,380
I can't escape my miserable life.

441
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,820
-Amazing, amazing!
-Wen Bin!

442
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,640
It's not too late to ask
for my forgiveness.

443
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,780
Why should I? I didn't violate
any academy rule.

444
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,780
You ungrateful brat.

445
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,800
How dare you steal his girl?

446
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,000
You think you can steal
his embroidered ball?

447
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,120
I had no control over it.

448
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,040
I threw the ball away
but you didn't take it.

449
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,840
You should thank me instead of blaming me.

450
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,830
You...

451
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,100
He has a point.

452
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,820
President, what do you want to say?

453
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,900
Wen Bin,

454
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,600
you know what you did.

455
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
He's in trouble again.

456
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,220
Outside, I have no power over you.

457
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,460
But in Yun Shang Academy,

458
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,880
you have to conform to the rules
and behave yourself.

459
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,020
Do you understand?

460
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,640
Did you hear that?

461
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,300
Watch yourselves.

462
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,860
Who asked you?

463
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,660
Sister.

464
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,980
Xiao Qing, how long has it been?

465
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,580
You've been having a cold and sneezing
for the past few days.

466
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,020
Here.

467
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,780
Drink this medicine.

468
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,400
Leave it on the table.

469
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,860
No way, Sister.
You have to take care of your health.

470
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,900
You haven't been eating or drinking.
You can't hold up forever.

471
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,440
If Mr. Wen comes and sees your pale face,

472
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,020
he will be upset.

473
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,160
Pale?

474
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,320
Do I look that weak and pale?

475
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,600
No.

476
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,940
Sister, you should take care of yourself.

477
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,180
If you take good care of yourself,
you'll look like a fairy.

478
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,900
No matter how pretty I am,
Mr. Wen will never notice me.

479
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,960
The academy's open day is in two days.

480
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,180
I believe Mr. Wen will come and see you.

481
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,540
Why do you think the day never goes away?

482
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,580
Sister, that's because time passes slowly
when you miss someone.

483
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,240
Both of you are really articulate.

484
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,120
Staying with me will be a waste.

485
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,940
You should become a storyteller.

486
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,680
Storyteller?

487
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,940
It will not be as popular
as Mr. Wen's dialogue novel.

488
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,060
Speaking of which...

489
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,920
Yes, I can still read his novel
even though I can't see him.

490
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,420
Mr. Wen must have completed
his new dialogue novel by now.

491
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,620
Mr. Chao.

492
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,140
Mr. Chao!

493
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,420
Mr. Chao!

494
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,940
-Where is he?
-Coming!

495
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,780
You're finally here.

496
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,780
Your dialogue novel almost killed me!

497
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,100
-I...
-Your...

498
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,040
Did it sell out?

499
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,820
Sold out? They were snatched up.

500
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
You should've seen it.

501
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,720
I was pushed,

502
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,080
kicked in the buttocks twice,

503
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,500
and disfigured.

504
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,420
You have to pay me
for the medical expenses.

505
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,200
I knew it would be popular this time,

506
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,540
but I didn't expect it...

507
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,460
to be so well-received.

508
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,060
This is so exciting.

509
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,600
Figure something out, will you?

510
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,580
Otherwise, my bookstore will be demolished
by fans of the novel.

511
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,040
That's easy.

512
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,720
Mr. Chao, why don't you
charge a deposit,

513
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,260
and collect the outstanding payment
upon delivery?

514
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,340
Isn't this a good idea?

515
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,620
Amazing!

516
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,620
You're so clever.

517
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,600
I'd be surprised if you don't become rich.

518
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,080
But Ms. Mu's promotional letter
has been a great help.

519
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,100
Not only was she a great help,

520
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,980
she's also the perfect partner for you.

521
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,800
I knew from the start this novel
would sell like hot cakes.

522
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,720
Sell...

523
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,300
Sell!

524
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,360
Exactly.

525
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,320
When Wen Bin and Ms. Mu work together,

526
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,700
they make a formidable duo.

527
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,380
Everything just works.

528
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,480
You two will make good fortune together.

529
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,200
Don't forget me at the top.

530
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,460
Not again. Cut it out.

531
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,660
By the way,

532
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,100
Ms. Mu hasn't received her copy yet.

533
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,600
Mr. Bai, you should send it to her.

534
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,460
Ms. Mu must be waiting eagerly.

535
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,940
You do it.

536
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,220
Forgive my bluntness,

537
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,020
but you're being inconsiderate.

538
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,640
-But...
-But what? Take it.

539
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,760
I have something else to do.
Send it over yourself.

540
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,520
By the way, come to school early.......

541
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,220
or someone will teach you a lesson.

How about some premium Pu-er tea?

Are you alright?

550

Mister, how's the tea?

551
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,380
Refreshing.

552
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,219
Then we should take our time
and enjoy it today.

553
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,620
In fact, today is not
the academy's open day.

I just came to send you

Since you're here, why not sit down
and have a cup of tea?

557
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,460
Are you avoiding me?

558
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,159
Since you caught my embroidered ball,

559
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,540
we should have this talk a long time ago.

560

I have so much to tell you.

561

Don't you have anything to tell me?

562

I do.

563
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,900
I'll tell you the truth.

564
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,180
My hands are tied.

565
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,200
I might not have time

Actually,

I really hope I can see you more often.

I've failed you last time.

I feel sorry for you.

I've been feeling guilty towards Ms. Han.

That's why I'm helping her this time.

627

Ms. Han longs for Feng Cheng Jun...

00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,660
the same way Ms. Mu longs for you.
