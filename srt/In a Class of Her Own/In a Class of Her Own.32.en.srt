[Episode 32]

4
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,640
-President.
-President.

5
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,760
What're you doing here?

6
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,800
Everyone cares about you.

7
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,680
We're here to check on you.

8
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:38,280
Thank you for the effort.

9
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,030
President, do you still remember
what happened last night?

10
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,880
Last night?

11
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,490
You were drunk last night.

12
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,120
You fought with a few gangsters.

13
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,880
Fortunately we found out about it in time.

14
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,509
Your injuries were attended by Wen Bin.

15
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,560
How does that look to you?

16
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,200
Wen Bin?

17
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,840
He is not a kind person.

18
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,270
How could you say that?

19
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,320
No doubt we had a history,

20
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,590
but we are still schoolmates.

21
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,190
President.

22
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,280
When we are not around,

23
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,000
please don't drink so much.

24
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,950
Sheng Zhi, ever since you left school,

25
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,480
many things in Student Council...

26
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,720
await you to handle.

27
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,670
Yes.

28
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,680
See? This house was not tidied up
for the past few days.

29
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,590
It is messy.

30
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,840
-Let's tidy it up.
-Yes, let's get some water.

31
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,030
This is how a president should be.

32
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,829
Yu Le Xuan.

33
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,470
I don't need your sympathy.

34
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,640
What are you saying?

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,079
Don't throw a wet blanket
on our fiery passion.

36
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,200
Let me be frank.

37
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,950
This is what the person
you loathe the most said to me.

38
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,160
Yu Le Xuan.

39
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,160
Do you hate me?

40
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,040
Sometimes, you can be impulsive.

41
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,690
I do have some comments
on some of your words and actions.

42
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,030
However, I still admire you...

43
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,560
for many reasons.

44
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,590
You don't want others
to call you a coward.

45
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,590
But being strong...

46
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,800
is not about proving yourself to others.

47
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,590
Instead,
it's having the ability to endure.

48
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,590
I hope that you can let go of
personal grievances...

49
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,310
and be a president who is fair and just.

50
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,200
Only when Yun Shang Academy
is great as a whole,

51
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,640
you can be the strongest of all.

52
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,510
Being strong is not all about
being stronger than someone.

53
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,640
Sheng Zhi.

54
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,440
If you need help,

55
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,750
just let us know.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,800
Yes, President.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,160
Just let us know if you need help.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,950
I've always remembered that you
used to provide me financial support.

59
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,200
Yes.

60
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,670
President, we are ever ready.

61
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,510
We have to go.

62
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,480
Brother Le Xuan, when can I get my pay?

63
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,829
I will pay you tomorrow.

64
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,709
Bing Shen.

65
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,829
Le Xuan has done a big favor for you.

66
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,150
-You should treat him.
-Exactly.

67
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,710
He doesn't have enough money.

68
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,760
Dinner is on me tonight.

69
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,830
The same restaurant.

70
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,350
Brother Zi Ming is always generous.

71
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,520
Come here.

72
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,360
What's wrong?

73
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,790
I feel that Feng Cheng Jun...

74
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,440
-is getting more and more...
-More and more what?

75
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,670
He is getting on my nerves.

76
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,909
Just close your eyes or
look into the other direction.

77
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,080
By the way, it's none of your business.

78
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:57,960
Don't make trouble.

79
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,710
No more. It's so tiring.

80
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,630
I really can't take it anymore.

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It is so tiring.

82
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,360
Wen Bin.

83
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,710
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

84
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,590
Wen Bin, are you okay?

85
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,560
I am okay.

86
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,080
Come with me. I need to talk with you.

87
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,960
Let's go.

88
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,840
Wen Bin, come along.

89
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,080
Let's go.

90
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,280
-This is what I need to tell you.
-They...

91
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,110
Do you know...

92
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,230
I think Principal Feng...

93
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,350
is going to do Cheng Jun
some favors again.

94
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,360
I think the same.

95
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:39,990
I guess,

96
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,909
it's about the competition
which will be held soon.

97
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,630
The competition?

98
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,790
President, is your hand getting better?

99
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,909
Yes, thank you for asking.

100
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,520
Principal Feng.

101
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,190
What is it about?

102
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,230
We are going to have a competition soon.

103
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,870
-I bring all of you here..
-Competition?

104
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,000
to discuss about
the competition in detail.

105
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,320
Competition? What is that?

106
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,670
Participants will be divided
into groups in two by drawing lots.

107
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,150
Within a specific area,

108
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,390
they have to find out
a map which has been torn into two.

109
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,480
The location of the drum
is written on the map.

110
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,320
The first person to find it wins.

111
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,040
It's a stamina challenge.

112
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,840
I can't take part in it.

113
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,909
No doubt Wen Bin is at disadvantage when
it comes to stamina challenge.

114
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,000
The winner of the competition...

115
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,880
will be rewarded with
100 character points.

116
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,840
And 1,000 mace.

117
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,110
Furthermore, the winner
doesn't have to sit for exam...

118
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,600
to attend the imperial exam.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,350
Feng Cheng Jun,

120
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,760
the chance is hard to come by.

121
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,670
I'm in.

122
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,360
Little Brother,
it is a hill-climbing competition.

123
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,030
I don't think you can do it.

124
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,550
It's not all about stamina.

125
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,520
Wisdom is needed in searching for the map.

126
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,960
If I found the map before others,

127
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,110
I stand a chance to win.

128
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,320
Exactly.

129
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,560
I have faith in Wen Bin's capability.

130
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,340
If he receives training
for a period of time,

131
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,420
he will have a breakthrough for sure.

132
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,510
For this competition,

133
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,720
only 20 selected students will be
eligible to take part after taking tests.

134
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,190
Principal Feng has recommended
Feng Cheng Jun...

135
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,630
to enter it directly.

136
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,680
Wen Bin, if you are confident,

137
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,910
I shall save you a place.

138
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,840
I hope both of you can form a group.

139
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,800
Who told you to force yourself so hard?

140
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,840
Now you can't walk anymore, can you?

141
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,030
Come up.

142
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,710
You only ran for a while
and you are already exhausted.

143
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,180
You can't take part in the competition.

144
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,480
Fortunately the grouping
will be done by drawing lots.

145
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,560
If we're in a group,
you'd blame everything on me.

146
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,630
You decided to participate
because of the money, right?

147
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,190
If I win, I shall give you the reward.

148
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,350
I want to win on my own.

149
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,710
You told me to believe in miracle.

150
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,320
I still believe in miracle.

151
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,390
Are both of you interested
in the competition?

152
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,789
Of course.

153
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,080
We have passed the test
conducted by the President.

154
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,429
I am better than both of you.

155
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,280
I didn't have to take the test.

156
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,040
One who whines
in pain after some running...

157
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,750
can't win the competition.

158
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,230
Junior.

159
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,510
You are not allowed to join.

160
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,200
You sound exactly like Brother Feng.

161
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,350
Even the tone is the same.

162
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,310
I am joining no matter what.
No one can stop me.

163
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,230
Yeah.

164
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,640
Brother Feng and the senior.

165
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,870
Don't stop him from joining
the competition.

166
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,120
That's right.

167
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,750
I hereby announce,

168
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,280
those who have passed the test...

169
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,310
will be distributed into groups
by drawing lots.

170
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,750
The maps are hidden in these six areas.

171
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,720
We shall draw the lot...

172
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,280
to decide the team members
for area number one.

173
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,840
There will be six students overall.

174
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,310
The first team.

175
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,480
Feng Cheng Jun and Lei Ze Xin.

176
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,550
They are in the same group.

177
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,950
This group is unbeatable.

178
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,390
The second team.

179
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,510
Yu Le Xuan and Mo Xiao Huan.

180
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,280
The third team.

181
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,600
Wen Bin and Han Sheng Zhi.

182
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,630
That is a strong combination.

183
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,870
I will do my best.

184
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,480
Stick to your spirit during
the archery ceremony.

185
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,480
This is what happens when someone joins
the competition without taking the test.

186
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,070
Now,

187
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,190
the members for area number two.

188
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,750
-I can't do it.
-They are not that fast.

189
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,040
I need to stop.

190
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,120
-I can't do it.
-All the best, Wen Bin.

191
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,190
Hurry up!

192
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,990
It's okay. Yu Le Xuan is the slowest.

193
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,550
-Wait for us!
-Both of you...

194
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,520
I can't do it anymore.

195
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,510
I can't do it anymore.

196
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,990
Feng Cheng Jun is so fast.

197
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,630
I lost track of him in a blink of an eye.

198
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,920
You are so weak,

199
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,240
yet you want to take part.

200
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,760
You are asking for trouble.

201
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,280
Asking for trouble?

202
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,880
Even Wen Bin can take part, why can't I?

203
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,680
You're dragging me down with you.

204
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,070
If Wen Bin can do it,

205
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,240
I can do it too.

206
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,520
Wen Bin.

207
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,160
If you are this slow...

208
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,040
during the competition,
I won't wait for you.

209
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,720
I will focus on finding my map.

210
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,840
Then, we'll meet and
look for the other half of the map.

211
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,800
Fine, you can just ignore me.

212
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,480
Then you're not a team.

213
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,360
As we are in the same team,

214
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,990
the more capable person should go first.

215
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,750
It's to save time. Am I right?

216
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,920
You are talking
as if your stamina is good.

217
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,190
I am...

218
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,920
confident in myself.

219
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,750
Just compete to find
out which of you is faster.

220
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,230
Brother Le Xuan,
why are you inciting them?

221
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,110
Let's go.

222
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,040
Let's go.

223
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,630
Le Xuan, let's go.

224
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,990
Mr. Ding.

225
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,390
Principal Feng.

226
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,600
Where are you going?

227
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,520
I don't have any classes
in the coming two days.

228
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,750
I'm going home.

229
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,480
I am not carrying many things.
You don't have to send me off.

230
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,600
Hold on.

231
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,550
Mr. Ding,

232
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,430
you are so irresponsible.

233
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,760
The competition is just around the corner.

234
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,840
As the teacher of the Five Classics,

235
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,630
how can you go home without worries?

236
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,160
No.

237
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,640
Principal Feng, think about it.

238
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,910
Mr. Li is in charge of the competition.

239
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,840
I serve no purpose.

240
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,070
My presence is not important.

241
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,550
See you next time.

242
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,280
Why are you so irresponsible?

243
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,950
No wonder you are demoted.

244
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,110
Guys, the president's treating you drinks.

245
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,680
He has bought honey water for everyone.

246
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,350
-Thanks, President.
-Thanks, President.

247
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,240
-Thank you, President.
-Come on.

248
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,040
Thank you, President.

249
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,040
The President is getting
more and more caring.

250
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,480
Here, it's for you.

251
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,950
-Here.
-It's so tasty.

252
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:42,990
One more.

253
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:43,870
Sure.

254
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,840
Thank you.

255
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:48,840
Thank you.

256
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,920
Wen Bin is spineless.

257
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,120
I don't agree with the bed arrangement.

258
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,510
I refuse to sleep with people
who drank honey water.

259
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,120
What kind of reason is that?

260
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,670
Junior.

261
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,800
You drank the most.

262
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:06,870
Yes.

263
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,160
Senior, be a bigger person.

264
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,600
Junior.

265
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,030
How could you accuse me of being
narrow-minded because of him?

266
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,160
Senior, only people who are petty...

267
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,520
will lower themselves
to the same level as me.

268
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,590
I will cook delicious food
for you tomorrow, okay?

269
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,390
Senior.

270
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,040
Yeah.

271
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,310
Brother Ze Xin
should look at the big picture.

272
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,190
I plan to stay up and read.

273
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,070
Please suit yourselves.

274
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,430
No way.

275
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,550
I shall keep you company.

276
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,120
You reckless people.

277
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,310
You won't have the energy to climb up the
hill if you stay up late.

278
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,960
Just go to bed.

279
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,320
I shall have the whole bed to myself.

280
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,920
I will sleep horizontally,

281
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,510
and roll on the bed.

282
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,680
I haven't seen him.

283
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,990
-Sorry to disturb.
-I am sorry.

284
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,190
Slow down.

285
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,240
Hi, I would like to ask about someone.

286
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,080
Have you seen him before?

287
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,960
No.

288
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,790
You haven't seen him?

289
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,670
No.

290
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,040
Mister, please take a...

291
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,870
Brother Qin.

292
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,400
Brother Ding.

293
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,510
It's you.

294
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,800
When did you come back?

295
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,040
After receiving your letter,

296
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,160
I came back the next day.

297
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:52,750
It's as expected.

298
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,160
The Government
has stopped chasing after me.

299
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,630
Why didn't you come and see me?

300
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,600
Look at you.

301
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,800
I almost couldn't recognize you.

302
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:04,870
I am back...

303
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,480
to do the right thing...

304
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,360
before things got escalated.

305
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,950
Therefore, I'm disguising myself.

306
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,750
Please forgive me.

307
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,080
Don't say that.

308
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,390
I am glad that you are back.

309
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:17,790
By the way,

310
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:22,160
regarding Mr. Xue,
what exactly happened back then?

311
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,310
-This is not the right place to talk.
-Okay.

312
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,190
Let's go.

313
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,310
It is time!

314
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:49,920
Area number one.

315
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,720
[Competition]

316
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,070
Ready.

317
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,190
Go!

318
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,310
-All the best!
-All the best!

319
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:04,230
-All the best!
-Run!

320
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,230
Wen Bin, all the best!

321
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:09,430
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

322
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,670
-Wen Bin, run!
-Go!

323
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,430
Wait for the result at the academy.

324
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,400
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

325
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,430
Let's go back and wait.

326
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,040
They surely have good news.

327
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,240
They will win.

328
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:23,870
And...

329
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,280
how did the memorial to the throne
become a banned book?

330
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,070
I still remember that before I left,

331
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,870
I placed the memorial...

332
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,280
in a safe.

333
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
I locked...

334
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,800
and even sealed it.

335
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,280
It was guarded by Li Hu,
Ke Shi Jun, me...

336
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,240
and two other people.

337
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,390
Before we departed,

338
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,810
I had a recurrence of an old illness.

339
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,990
Li Hu sent me to the medical hall.

340
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,160
I am unsure...

341
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,750
what happened after that.

342
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,720
If that is the case,

343
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Li Hu, Ke Shi Jun...

344
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,840
and the other two people
are the prime suspects.

345
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,520
Li Hu and Ke Shi Jun are on the run.

346
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,599
And Li Hu...

347
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,760
lived in the Li Village.

348
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,400
That's why I came here to look for him.

349
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,520
I am also here to investigate on someone.

350
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,550
He said that he was born
in the Lee Village.

351
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,440
However, in the Northern District,

352
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,720
there is not a Lee Village.

353
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,240
Isn't that Li Hu?

354
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,000
Li Hu?

355
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,190
Li Hu?

356
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,360
[If Li Hu...]

357
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
[is not the murderer
who murdered my teacher,]

358
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,480
he must be aiming to seek revenge.

359
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:43,000
He should seek revenge against
Feng Ji Chang and Han Zheng Liang.

360
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,400
Why did he hide in Yun Shang Academy?

361
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,790
It's you.

362
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,750
Li Hu!

363
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,520
Your true identity is Li Hu.

364
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,600
You were Mr. Xue's student.

365
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,430
Now I know...

366
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,950
why did you put Feng Cheng Jun,
Han Sheng Zhi and Lei Ze Xin...

367
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,760
in the groups of area number one.

368
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,590
Yes.

369
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,070
I did something to put the
three of them in their groups.

370
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,120
They will gather soon.

371
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,000
Ding Ruo Yang.

372
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,720
My respected teacher
looked highly upon you.

373
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,480
However, you have never
bothered to avenge him.

374
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,550
You are not seeking revenge.

375
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,590
You are hurting the innocent.

376
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,550
Innocent?

377
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,400
Wasn't my teacher innocent?

378
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,760
Weren't my brothers
who were killed innocent?

379
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,150
It has been so many years.

380
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,320
I have always hoped that the government
would clear my teacher's name.

381
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,360
However, it has fallen on the deaf ears.

382
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,280
Hence, I have to investigate into
the matter on my own.

383
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,760
Now I have found the truth.

384
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,920
The murderers were Han Zheng Liang,

385
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,480
Feng Ji Chang and Lei Qi Ying.

386
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,310
Therefore, they have to pay their debt.

387
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,840
What did you do to the lads?

388
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,030
I didn't do anything.

389
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,600
They are in a coma.

390
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,150
However, I have dug a hole.

391
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,670
It would be an easy death.

392
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,430
Thank goodness.

393
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,720
Ding Ruo Yang.

394
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,560
If you don't intend to seek revenge,

395
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,040
please don't stop me.

396
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,120
Brother Li Hu.

397
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,150
It was not as simple as you thought.

398
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,150
We have to further investigate it.

399
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,240
It's not too late now.

400
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,800
Please stop before things get out of hand.

401
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,520
What else is there to investigate?

402
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,670
Isn't it clear enough?

403
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,670
Han Zheng Liang and Feng Ji
Chang colluded with each other.

404
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,790
Governor Feng Ji Chang
gave instructions...

405
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,950
to kill my teacher and his family.

406
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,910
They didn't even spare
the life of the unborn baby.

407
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,480
Ding Ruo Yang, if you don't plan to
seek revenge, you can leave now!

408
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,880
It is not like what you thought.

409
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,640
I met Qin Bei Chuan.

410
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,950
After all these years, Qin Bei Chuan...

411
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,950
has been investigating the matter.

412
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,230
He couldn't find any evidence...

413
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,840
to prove that Feng Ji Chang
is involved in this.

414
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,950
Brother Li Hu.

415
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,000
Mr. Xue looked highly upon you back then.

416
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,070
Since it's justice you want,

417
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,670
you have to know how to
tell right and wrong apart.

418
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,000
Don't create another tragedy.

419
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,600
Feng Cheng Jun is an outstanding student.

420
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,680
Do you really want to hurt him?

421
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,000
I want to hurt him?

422
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,000
What about my teacher's matter then?

423
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,080
Are you saying that he
and his family deserved it?

424
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:15,950
Fine.

425
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,950
I believe in Brother Bei Chuan.

426
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,240
I choose to trust him.

427
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,400
But Han Zheng Liang and Lei Qi
Ying were the murderers, right?

428
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,350
Lei Qi Ying was not the murderer.

429
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,760
He was!

430
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,830
He executed my teacher
and his family secretly!

431
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,640
Mr. Xue's family is still alive!

432
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,160
Lei Qi Ying let them go.

433
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,110
Don't repay kindness with enmity.

434
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,720
Wen Bin is Mr. Xue's child!

435
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,720
What did you say?

436
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,070
Mrs. Xue and her children are still alive?

437
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,760
I have met Mr. Xue's family.

438
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,680
I can prove that...

439
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,110
Wen Bin is Mr. Xue's child.

440
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,400
Is that true?

441
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,640
Mr. Ding.

442
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,270
Are you speaking the truth?

443
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,520
Yes.

444
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,150
It is a long story.

445
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,240
I shall tell you when we have time.

446
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:11,950
Wen Bin.

447
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,600
Are you really the child of
my respected teacher, Xue Ding Kun?

448
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,400
What happened to my family?

449
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,880
Why didn't my mother tell me anything?

450
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,400
We have got the news.

451
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,870
-How did it go?
-We have got the news.

452
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,280
We have got the news.

453
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,480
Feng Cheng Jun and Lei Ze Xin?

454
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,640
Han Sheng Zhi and Wen Bin?

455
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,150
No.

456
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,840
How is that possible?

457
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,520
You have never expected
these two to be the winners.

458
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,080
-How could that be?
-Yeah.

459
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,280
-Who are them?
-Who are them?

460
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,640
Liu Xiao Tong and Zhu Yong Jia.

461
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,670
-How is that possible?
-How is that possible?

462
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,790
Are you okay?

463
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,110
Slow down.

464
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,350
Put him down.

465
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,160
Watch out for your head.

466
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,640
What happened?

467
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,150
Why did I pass out?

468
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,040
It's one of the obstacles...

469
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,010
designated by the teachers
in this competition.

470
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:24,400
It is to test your vigilance
when you are carrying out your duty.

471
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,400
It is proven that
all of you are very careless.

472
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,600
That's so wicked.

473
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,320
[Interrogation Hall]

474
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,600
That was what happened.

475
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
Your surname is Xue.

476
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,720
Your father was my teacher,

477
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:52,880
Xue Ding Kun.

478
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,720
So my surname is Xue.

479
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,950
My father was a great person.

480
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:02,990
Wen Bin.

481
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,950
You are as ambitious as your father.

482
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,310
I believe that he...

483
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,310
would be very happy...

484
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,430
for having an outstanding child like you.

485
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,360
But...

486
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,430
why did my mother hide it from us?

487
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,920
Your mother had to conceal her identity...

488
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,670
in order to hide away from the murderers.

489
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,430
The more you and your brother know,
the more dangerous you'll be.

490
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,350
Therefore, for the time being,

491
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:41,360
don't tell your mother that you've
learned about your background.

492
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,240
Don't make her worry.

493
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,640
Yes, Wen Bin.

494
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,360
It was very complicated.

495
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,480
You must not tell others
about your background.

496
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,880
I have to find out the truth
behind my father's demise.

497
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,550
Wen Bin.

498
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,600
I hope you can focus on studies.

499
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,240
You can plan on it
after you have graduated.

500
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,430
Take the long view.

501
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,190
Aim for the right thing.

502
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,790
Also, Mr. Li Hu,

503
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:09,520
we have to do this slowly.

504
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,870
Wen Bin.

505
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,320
Remember,

506
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,400
you have to be extra careful.

507
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,720
Don't let anyone know about
your background.

508
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,470
After you have graduated,

509
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,320
I will assist you to investigate
the matter.

510
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,760
Let me show you something.

511
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,160
[Respected teacher,
Xue Ding Kun's memorial tablet]

512
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,480
Mr. Li.

513
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,150
You are such a sentimental person.

514
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,150
Every night,

515
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,400
I come here to visit my teacher.

516
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,670
I didn't know that
after joining the school,

517
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,800
I have been seeing my father every day.

518
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,670
He has been here with me.

519
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,200
Wen Bin.

520
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,720
Kowtow to your father.

521
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,280
He is awake.

522
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,880
Lie down.

523
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,070
Mr. Ding.

524
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,030
He is the masked man.

525
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
I know.

526
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,640
So does Wen Bin.

527
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,080
You have to keep it a secret for Mr. Li.

528
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,160
Why?

529
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,430
Lei Ze Xin.

530
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,480
My name is Li Hu.

531
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,600
I was a close friend of you brother,
Lei Ze Xun.

532
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,520
Li Hu?

533
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,790
You are one of the three people
who escaped from the misfortune.

534
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,310
I am wanted by the government.

535
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,600
I can't show up...

536
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,550
but I have been investigating this.

537
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,310
I have collected some clues
for you to continue the investigation.

538
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,310
Why did you snatch my note book?

539
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,030
Don't we share the same goal?

540
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,360
Lei Ze Xin.

541
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,190
Trust Mr. Li.

542
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,150
You lost in the competition.

543
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,840
What makes you think you can still...

544
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,270
organize a gathering?

545
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,440
Father.

546
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,240
I have made peace with
Feng Cheng Jun and the others.

547
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,270
We are getting closer day by day.

548
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,760
I wish to deepen the bond with them.

549
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,070
Father.

550
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,600
Brother is right.

551
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,600
You should support him.

552
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,030
Yes, he is right.

553
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,190
But why is he inviting...

554
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,000
Mu Xiao Man?

555
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,790
He has lost his mind.

556
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,350
Father.

557
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,240
Mu Xiao Man is the best
musical courtesan in Yun.

558
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,840
Inviting her...

559
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,150
is nothing more than public affair.

560
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,240
Father, just trust that
he is a man of integrity.

561
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,910
I hope so.

562
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,310
Why do you look so sad?

563
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,270
Are you bullied by someone?

564
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,650
No one has the guts to bully me
as you are here.

565
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,270
I studied for a long time.

566
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,430
Hence, my eyes get tired.

567
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,480
Don't work too hard.

568
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,190
You should rest when you are tired.

569
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,880
Thank you, Senior.

570
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,880
Why do you thank me?

571
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,910
Thanks to Mr. Lei too.

572
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,160
You.

573
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,640
Stop meddling between me and my father.

574
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,870
By the way, the president invited us
to his house for a gathering.

575
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,750
Do you know that?

576
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,030
I am not going.

577
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,560
Finally, we get along with each other.

578
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,120
Don't be petty.

579
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,550
I just can't be generous
when I deal with the Han family.

580
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,720
Don't stand on ceremony.

581
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,190
I hope all of you can have fun.

582
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,640
Here.

583
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,910
-Great!
-Great!

584
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,550
What a nice song. Cheers!

585
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,710
Thank you for the compliment.

586
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,600
It's an honor to perform for all of you.

587
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,360
Brother Cheng Jun.

588
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,070
Cheers.

589
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,440
Here.

590
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,600
To be honest, I have another reason...

591
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,030
to hold this gathering.

592
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,240
It has been some time since
Shu Min met you.

593
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,920
She has been missing you.

594
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,310
She has prepared some dishes.

595
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,030
You should gather with her.

596
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,030
I shall learn from Brother Le Xuan
on conducting business.

597
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,270
Mr. Feng.

598
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,840
-Here, Bing Shen.
-Brother Cheng Jun, all the best.

599
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,120
Here, Brother Sheng Xiong.

600
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,870
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

601
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,710
Mister, we shall not stand
here any longer.

602
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,240
Let's join the rest.

603
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,350
Make sure you enjoy yourself
to the fullest.

604
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,230
Sure.

605
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,670
Such a fine wine.

606
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,920
Wen Bin.

607
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,920
Cheers.

608
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,040
Come on.

609
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,070
Wen Bin.

610
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,430
Please make sure Xiao Man
will live happily.

611
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,070
From now on,

612
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,760
I can only wish both of you
abundance of happiness.

613
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,870
If you really like Ms. Mu,

614
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,190
you should muster the courage
to pursue her.

615
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,720
Ms. Mu, cheers.

616
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,720
Don't regret what you said.

617
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:59,000
Xiao Man smiled at me?

618
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,070
When you change,

619
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,760
people around you
will treat you differently.

620
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,230
Come on!

621
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,920
Let's have a toast.

622
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,600
Here, please try it.

623
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:29,989
Xiao Qin.

624
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:31,960
-You may leave now.
-Okay.

625
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,510
Ms. Han.

626
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,510
Mr. Feng.

627
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,270
Now we are alone.

628
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,989
If you have anything to tell me,
please say it.

629
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,120
Please be honest with me.

630
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:00,440
I hope that you can forgive me.

631
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,200
Mr. Feng.

632
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,360
Are you not willing to be with me?

633
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,270
I really appreciate
your hard work and changes.

634
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:24,120
I also really admire your talent.

635
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,600
However, marriage is not child's play.

636
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,470
I can't...

637
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,200
go against my will.

638
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:39,880
I also can't cheat on your feelings.

639
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,640
Therefore, I wish to call off
the engagement.

640
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,470
Got it.

641
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,440
I am sorry.

642
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,470
It's my fault.

643
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,120
Thank you for being honest with me.

644
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,640
I am sorry to have disturbed you.

645
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,030
You should get back to the gathering.

646
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,440
I shall take my leave then.

647
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,600
-Drink more!
-Wen Bin, no more.

648
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,470
-Stop drinking.
-I am tipsy. I should stop.

649
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,390
-You can drink.
-Le Xuan, help.

650
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,430
-You're not drunk.
-Stop drinking.

651
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,710
-Mo Xiao Huan!
-You are drunk.

652
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,880
-Mo Xiao Huan!
-You have had too much, Wen Bin!

653
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,320
-I am drunk.
-Am I the best?

654
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,760
-You are.
-Stop drinking.

655
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,720
-Stop drinking.
-Enough.

656
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,030
-Got it.
-Finally you are here. Where did you go?

657
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,230
Why is he so drunk?

658
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,710
It could be because you were

659
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,800
Fill the cup.

660
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,760
I'll take him back.

661
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,880
Drink more.

662
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,840
Let's go.

663
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,800
You are drunk, Wen Bin.

664
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,840
-One more.
-Here.

665
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,080
-Slow down.
-Mo Xiao Huan, let's continue drinking.

666
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,030
Let's continue drinking.

667
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,640
Young Lady, where is Mr. Feng?

668
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,120
Xiao Qin, here you are.

669
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,510
Young Lady.

670
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,840
What's wrong?

671
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,270
It's very delicious.

672
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,710
-Young Lady
-It's very tasty.

673
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,830
This...

674
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,640
[Han Manor]

675
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,230
Brother Feng.

676
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,400
Who am I?

677
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,920
Why did this happen?

678
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,160
Can you tell me?

679
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,510
I understand your pain.

680
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:15,880
Don't worry.

681
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,120
Everything is solved.

682
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,230
I won't make you upset anymore.

683
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,640
Solved?

684
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,160
How did you solve it?

685
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,790
I have made it clear to Han Shu Min.

686
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Not this.

687
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,230
I want to know the truth.

688
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,880
Truth? About what?

689
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,120
The truth is...

690
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,160
It's the truth about me.

691
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,550
No matter what happens,

692
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,600
I will face it with you.

693
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,200
Xiao Man.

694
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,440
Mr. Han.

695
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,550
You hosted a party,
inviting Wen Bin and the others.

696
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,600
It was just a show, wasn't it?

697
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,000
No.

698
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,990
I sincerely invited them for a gathering.

699
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:12,790
But of course,

700
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,960
I also wish to show you that
we have made peace with each other.

701
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,680
You have become more interesting.

702
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,750
Why are you following me?

703
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,750
I...

704
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,270
I am going to get changed.

705
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,600
Please stay here.

706
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,510
Sure.

707
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:42,870
Please.

708
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,200
You haven't found Ke Shi Jun, have you?

709
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,190
Please forgive me.

710
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,790
Ever since he sustained injuries,

711
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,270
he has never made appearance.

712
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,510
I couldn't find out anything about him.

713
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,200
On the contrary, the short man in black...

714
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,510
has been distributing
name lists, note books...

715
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,990
and contents of
the Book of Ten Thousand Words.

716
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,320
I intended to make use of
the man in black...

717
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,470
to lure Ke Shi Jun.

718
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,160
Judging from the current situation,

719
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,880
they are not a gang.

720
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,510
Why don't we accuse him
of a few more murders...

721
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,960
to lure him out?

722
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,310
Also,

723
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,640
the people in the list...

724
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,680
should be eliminated.

725
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:48,830
Noted.

726
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,720
Hold on.

727
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,990
There are many people in the front yard.

728
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,710
Leave from the back.

729
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,550
Yes.
