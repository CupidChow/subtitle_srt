[Episode 24]

4
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:46,270
What's the matter with Wen Bin?

5
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,640
Why is he taking a bath here?

6
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,110
Mr Ding.

7
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,550
Why are you here?

8
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,080
I...

9
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,870
You're taking a bath here?

10
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,079
Are you serious?

11
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,310
Wen Bin,

12
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,530
what are you thinking, taking a bath here?

13
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,190
Well,

14
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,230
I fell down due to the
slippery road after rain.

15
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,380
I came here to clean up my messy self
to avoid others' teasing.

16
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,950
This is unacceptable.

17
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,590
Is this a place for bathing?

18
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,600
Get back to your room.

19
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,270
Go to Ming Lun Hall.

20
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,060
Thank you, Mr Ding.

21
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,440
Go now.

22
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,440
Are you feeling better?

23
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,170
I made a new medicine for you.

24
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,720
Mr Ding.

25
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,440
Was this from you?

26
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,040
Ke Shi Jun, Qin Bei Chuan.

27
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,640
Where did you get this?

28
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,980
Didn't you leave it for me?

29
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,170
No, I didn't.

30
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,560
Oh, no.

31
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,840
Someone knew who you are.

32
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,320
And he must be a teacher in the Academy.

33
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,310
Why do you think so?

34
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,850
I fought him before.

35
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,060
He was carrying a teacher's tag.

36
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,210
The only teacher in the
Academy who knows martial arts...

37
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,120
is Mr Liu.

38
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
No.

39
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,180
It couldn't be my master.

40
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,170
Senior.

41
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,340
Ze Xin is fine now.

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Mr Ding is treating him.

43
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,100
Don't worry.

44
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,230
You can be at ease,

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,150
Ze Xin's staying with
Feng Cheng Jun and Wen Bin.

46
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,970
Because of their high aspirations,

47
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,940
he has improved a lot.

48
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,970
Judging from his performances today,

49
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,870
he has changed indeed.

50
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:30,930
In the future,

51
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,820
I'm still counting on you
to look after him.

52
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,159
Of course, I'll keep an eye on him.

53
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,470
In that case,

54
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,810
it's almost impossible
for us to find Ke Shi Jun.

55
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,360
I'm to blame for my negligence.

56
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,580
Leave that masked man to me.

57
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,770
You stay out of it.

58
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,659
Yes, Sir.

59
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,400
You look happy, Brother Feng.

60
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,630
What's the good news?

61
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,440
It's true that something
interesting happened today.

62
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,560
During your wine party?

63
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,270
Could you have met a woman there?

64
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,790
I met Ms Han Shu Min.

65
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,160
But this is nothing romantic.

66
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,080
She went there...

67
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,660
No wonder you're joyful as a fluffy
cloud and droplets dancing in the rain.

68
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,060
Little Brother, don't make fun of me.

69
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,520
I told you, I won't be engaged in a
relationship before I become an official.

70
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,620
That's very thoughtful of you.

71
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,090
You nurture your affection before that,

72
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,310
and she'll be with you
after you become an official.

73
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,090
It seems like you are an expert
in romantic relationships.

74
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,560
So, when I meet a woman I like,

75
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,020
I'm counting on you to help me.

76
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,140
You're such a womaniser.

77
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,790
Lady Han loves you deeply.

78
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,750
Yet, you're thinking about
meeting another woman.

79
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,980
Do you think Ms Han Shu Min and I...

80
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,980
are so close that we will be in love?

81
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,580
Everyone with eyes can tell...

82
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,040
that she loves you a lot
and you're not rejecting her.

83
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,510
What is this if it's not
a romantic relationship?

84
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,350
You think I fancy Ms Han Shu Min?

85
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,190
Do you think I like her?

86
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,400
Why are you asking me?

87
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm going to sleep.

88
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,820
You look too happy, don't you?

89
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,260
I am quite happy.

90
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,950
During the party,
I performed for everyone.

91
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,280
All of them liked it.

92
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,830
So, I want you to watch it too.

93
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,550
Little kid, don't be gluttonous.

94
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,070
New Year comes after the Laba Festival.

95
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,070
After you had some Laba Congee,

96
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,920
it'll suddenly become the 23rd.

97
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,070
On 23rd, have malt sugar candy.

98
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,710
On 24th, clean up the house.

99
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,790
On 25th, fry tofu.

100
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,590
On 26th, make stewed mutton.

101
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,550
On 27th, eat some chicken.

102
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,700
On 28th...

103
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,900
-Ferment the dough.
-Ferment the dough.

104
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,840
On 29th, steam the buns.

105
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,350
On 30th, have fun throughout the night.

106
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,080
-On the first day of the new year...
-Twist your body.

107
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,420
Twist your body.

108
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,390
So, are you happy now?

109
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,960
More or less so.

110
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,180
I wonder why you got upset every day.

111
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,550
Just go and sleep.

112
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,780
Let's sleep.

113
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:50,960
You sleep first.

114
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,470
[Feng Cheng Jun was
smiling all the time just now.]

115
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,300
[Turned out he wanted to cheer me up.]

116
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,070
[So that I will be happy.]

117
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,230
Mr Ding, did you ask for me?

118
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,880
Come here.

119
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,750
I've been thinking about this.

120
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,810
You still need to leave the school.

121
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,970
Why did you go back on your word?

122
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,090
Master Wang wants to
learn about your background.

123
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,190
Why did he want to know
about my background?

124
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,000
Who am I to arouse his interest?

125
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,560
This is because...

126
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,760
he thinks very highly of you.

127
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,230
He wishes to know more about you.

128
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,560
The holidays are coming in a few days.
You may return home and visit your family.

129
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,020
After that,

130
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,340
don't come back anymore.

131
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,920
I will handle the rest.

132
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,740
You may leave now.

133
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,170
Yes, Sir.

134
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,960
[Wen Xi,]

135
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,150
[don't feel bad for yourself.]

136
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,560
[You can go back to
becoming a lady after you left.]

137
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,390
[Then, you and Brother Feng...]

138
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,950
Why are the two of you together?

139
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,090
Brother Le Xuan wants my calligraphy.

140
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,970
You're deceived.

141
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,570
He must be wanting to sell it.

142
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,270
I do wonder...

143
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,910
how much is
Brother Cheng Jun's calligraphy worth.

144
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,040
Let's go.

145
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,220
What? Can't I read?

146
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,200
Brother Ze Xin, you finally came back!

147
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,760
Did you think I died?

148
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,380
If you don't come back by today,

149
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,780
we would really think that you have died.

150
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,090
You're asking for a beating. Stay there.

151
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,590
Do you dare to compete with me?

152
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,740
Sure.

153
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,000
Compete in what?

154
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,890
What else?

155
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,050
The only thing he can do best is drinking.

156
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,080
I can't drink.

157
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,570
Your victory has no honour
if you drink with him...

158
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,180
who has a low tolerance to alcohol.

159
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,120
Little Brother,

160
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,480
you're always siding with the outsider.

161
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,010
What outsider? There's no outsider here.

162
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,860
Exactly.

163
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,340
We're buddies.

164
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,640
Little Brother,

165
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,280
we got in the first place together.

166
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,790
No matter what, you must
drink with me tonight.

167
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,350
He'll take care of it.

168
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,020
Of course.

169
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,340
As we're buddies.

170
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,060
But you can't force us to drink more.

171
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,740
I don't care about you,

172
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,930
as long as I can have my drink.
So, are you going or not?

173
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,250
Brother Feng, let's join him.

174
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,360
Okay.

175
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,590
My son.

176
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,700
-Sir, I'm begging you.
-Darling.

177
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,980
My son.

178
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,040
May I know what happened?

179
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,410
These are despicable commoners.

180
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,050
They didn't pay their debt
for a very long time.

181
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,330
So, they have to be taken
to do hard labour.

182
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,960
Brother Feng.

183
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,040
Little Brother,

184
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,900
when we become government officials,

185
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,700
we must change this.

186
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,530
Little Brother, let's toast.

187
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,790
I'll just take a sip.

188
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,890
I don't care.

189
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,620
Do you really have to sigh
over so little dishes?

190
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,580
This time,

191
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,120
I have suffered a huge loss.

192
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,650
Even Le Xuan would sustain losses
in business?

193
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,480
Everything is unpredictable.

194
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,970
My goods aren't selling.

195
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,300
Why?

196
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,060
The locust plague has
affected this year's harvests.

197
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,330
The people have no extra
money to do new year shopping.

198
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,520
They don't even have enough
to eat and wear.

199
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,170
Life is hard.

200
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,230
Wine is the only comfort.

201
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,040
That's right. Let's drink.

202
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,100
[Fu Ze Hall]

203
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,760
I can finally go home to my family.

204
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,660
-Yeah.
-Here.

205
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,200
Thanks. Thank you, President.

206
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,400
Your food.

207
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,480
Forget it.

208
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,880
Zi Ming,

209
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,810
get someone to take these to Bing Shen.

210
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,770
Everything must be returned to the school.

211
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,240
Why are you standing there?

212
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,360
Come in.

213
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,380
You're collecting herbs
so early in the morning?

214
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,480
Mr Yu has registered these herbs.

215
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,600
Collecting them in the morning with
the crowd may make me return home late.

216
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,790
Come on.

217
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,520
Enough.

218
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,040
Take what belongs to you and leave.

219
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,000
President.

220
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,760
It was all my fault.

221
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,040
Thanks for your reminder.

222
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,590
Did we forget to apologise to Wen Bin?

223
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,110
President, but...

224
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,790
A man must keep his words.

225
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,120
Apologise when we should.

226
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,760
But, President,

227
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,840
I should be the one apologising to him.

228
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,760
Don't force yourself to do it.

229
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,520
If you want to make things easier for me,

230
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,040
please do something...

231
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,460
so that Feng Cheng Jun
and Wen Bin would listen to me.

232
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,090
That's impossible.

233
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,100
Both of them won't yell to others.

234
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,380
Unless you did something...

235
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,350
that would impress them.

236
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,080
He's right.

237
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,040
Brother Feng.

238
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,400
Little Brother. Here.

239
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,569
These are...

240
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,890
Why are the things from superior rooms
the same as mine?

241
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,109
The Academy's quite fair on this.

242
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,170
You can have all these.

243
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,560
For me?

244
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,599
But not the money.

245
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,819
You do know me well.

246
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,349
I'll have these things then.

247
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,560
Little Brother.

248
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,550
Look.

249
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,130
Is this enough?

250
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,540
Is it for me?

251
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,910
Is it enough?

252
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,720
I can't carry all of these.

253
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,230
If you can't carry the things from others,

254
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,910
take only mine.

255
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,280
Here, Little Brother.

256
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,470
Hold them.

257
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,970
How dare you put yours atop mine.

258
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,810
Get in line.

259
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,760
Only the two of you would have
such eagerness to give things away.

260
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,640
Funny.

261
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,670
I think I'd join too.

262
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,770
Take them.

263
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,240
Just take all of them.

264
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,390
Or "Three Kingdoms War"
will start in this room.

265
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,910
Okay, I'll take them all.

266
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,660
Wen Bin, you're loaded with stuff.

267
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,790
Come on, slowly.

268
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,840
Slowly and gently.

269
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,020
There are more.

270
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,430
Look, we also have some for you.

271
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,250
Some of our schoolmates from
common and regular dorms...

272
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,920
took the herbs especially for you,

273
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,630
as you have a sick family member.

274
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,410
I have enough herbs.

275
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,650
Well, Brother Wen Bin,

276
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,310
it's stated in the school rules that
the herbs are for the needy students,

277
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:41,930
and not for sale.

278
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,590
We took them for you.

279
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,540
Just take them.

280
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,260
-Thanks.
-Wen Bin.

281
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,920
You're really popular.

282
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,710
Little Brother,

283
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,030
you can open a medical hall now.

284
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,550
This is great.

285
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,770
The students gave Wen Bin all the herbs.

286
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,830
I'm really glad to see this.

287
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,620
If Master Wang...

288
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,390
learnt that the students
get along so well,

289
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,000
he must be delighted.

290
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,890
Principal Feng has
done well in educating them.

291
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,120
Not at all.

292
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,280
Mr Ding,

293
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,570
how shall I tell Master
Wang regarding this?

294
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,120
Aren't we overreacting...

295
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,990
if we report such a trivial matter?

296
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:34,870
Mr Liu,

297
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,650
many drops make a shower.

298
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,250
Don't you know that?

299
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,080
We lost in the archery ceremony.

300
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,180
As promised,

301
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,280
we're here to apologise to Wen Bin.

302
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,480
It's okay. You don't have to do that.

303
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,250
A real man is true to his word.

304
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,220
I'll do what I have said.

305
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,850
Please accept our apologies.

306
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,420
Yeah, count me in.

307
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,910
-We're sorry.
-Please don't.

308
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,270
Okay, I've accepted it.

309
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,600
This is the food the academy
gave to students in superior rooms.

310
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,940
They don't care about it.

311
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,100
And we're going to throw it away.

312
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,860
Didn't Wen Bin mention...

313
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,470
that all the food came from
people's hard work?

314
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,130
Instead of wasting them,

315
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,600
why not give them to Wen Bin?

316
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,960
Wen Bin, feel free to take them all.

317
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,020
They will be enough
for your family for months.

318
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,650
Are you done?

319
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:05,320
You don't want us to help Wen Bin?

320
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,430
Do you have a death wish?

321
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,310
Brother Ze Xin.

322
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,660
Stop it.

323
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,530
I will take all these.

324
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,060
We have gone too far.

325
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,070
Since he took our food,

326
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,600
-it means that he accepted our help.
-That's right, President.

327
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,920
You looked awesome.

328
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,640
-I felt really good.
-Shut up!

329
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,560
Don't you think I'll easily
forgive you for your despicability.

330
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,350
President, I...

331
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,190
This is a large amount of food.

332
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,400
Le Xuan,

333
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,910
carry all these to my room, please.

334
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,540
Sure.

335
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:56,970
Little Brother,

336
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,940
where's your dignity?

337
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,970
Brother Feng,

338
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,420
do you also think that I've lost the
integrity of a scholar by receiving these?

339
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,480
But, look.

340
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,410
These foods can support
the poor for several days.

341
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,580
And I've been studying
medicine all the while I'm here.

342
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,490
With these herbs,

343
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,870
I can help those who are poor
and sick in the Western District.

344
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,690
Wen Bin, you're always full of surprises.

345
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:28,630
Interesting.

346
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,360
Little Brother,

347
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,720
I don't know anything,

348
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,440
but I can help carry these.

349
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,720
Let's go.

350
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,150
This vicious thing.

351
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,260
Sir, it's okay.

352
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,270
This is the medicine
to treat colds and flu.

353
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,680
Take it regularly.

354
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,590
Thank you.

355
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,580
You're welcome.

356
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,880
For you.

357
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,560
What's wrong with him?

358
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,860
He's brooding over the fact
that he was bullied by a dog.

359
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,960
Are you asking for a beating?

360
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,920
Knock it off.
Let's head to the next village.

361

Mother.

362
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,650
There you are. Massage my shoulder.

363
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,190
Mother, Sister's coming back, isn't she?

364
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:03,340
I hear she's giving out medicine at
the Western District with some scholars.

365
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,310
I supposed she'll be home soon.

366
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,600
Looks like she's doing really
well in Yun Shang Academy.

367
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,280
People are calling your sister
and the three other scholars...

368
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,670
the Four Gentlemen of Yun Shang.

369
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,860
The Four Gentlemen of Yun Shang?

370
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,160
Principal Feng,

371
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,280
Yunzhou citizens have elected
the Four Gentlemen of Yun Shang...

372
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,010
from among the students.

373
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,400
Congratulations.

374
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,310
It's all thanks to your blessings,
Master Wang.

375
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,730
You have taught and guided them properly.

376
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,440
Don't be humble, Principal Feng.

377
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,680
I always knew what you've
done for Yun Shang Academy.

378
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,240
And I've been keeping it in my mind.

379
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,310
Principal Feng,

380
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:47,610
looks like you're now one step closer
to your final goal.

381
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,420
Principal Feng,

382
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,610
stick to your faith,

383
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,330
and bring the spirit of Yun Shang Academy
to a great height.

384
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,400

Let me take you home.

387
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,090
No, it's okay.

388
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,100
We finally get to be with our families.

389
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,220
You should go home now.

390

Brother Ze Xin.

391
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,090
Stop drinking. You should
spend more time with your family.

00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,450
Be a good boy and listen to him.

393
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,300
Look, he's being naughty again.

394
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,420

00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,030
you're a good boy too
when you be more decent.

You're no better than me.

397
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,710
Be a decent man.

400

As for Brother Feng...

401
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,950
You're a good boy when you
make friends with other students.

402
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:51,050
This is a difficult task
for Brother Cheng Jun.

403

I'll try it.

404
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,800
Little Brother, what about you?

405
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:54,980
Me?

406
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,080
I have always been a good boy.

No, you're not.

What are you doing?

415
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,640
You should go home too.

00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,020
Don't you want to have
a drink with me tonight?

417
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,920
Brother, your family's waiting for you.

418

No?

419
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,310
I don't need you to drink with me.

420
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,920
Goodbye then. Take care.

421

You too.

422
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,010
I'm really envious of your close
friendship with the three of them.

423
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,500
But it must be hard for you
to act like a man all the time.

424
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,460
I'm already an expert in that.

425
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,000
No one ever suspected me.

426
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,880
What about the food in the academy?

427
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:11,770
Great, of course.

428
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,190
We have meat every day.

429
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,480
I can even have a man's portion.

430
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,630
Now I've gained some weight
after half a year.

431

Don't eat too much.

433
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,500
What if no one wants to marry you
because you're fat?

434
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,920
You can't keep staying at home too.

435
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,430
Here, take a look.

436
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,260
New clothes?

437
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:39,810
Sister,

438

in order to make the new clothes for you,

439
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,240

Try on.

441
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,030
This must cost a lot.

442
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,760
You should've bought
supplement for Wen Bin.

443

444

don't worry about me.

445

I've been recovering...

446
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,110
since I took the remedies you made.

447
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,620
Sell it away.

448
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,480

-Yes.
-Are you sure?

-I'll wear it myself.
-No.

452

I left it at school.

506
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,030
Change into a man's clothes
and come to school with me.

507
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,140
What happened?

508
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,370
I'll tell you on the road.

509
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,620
Take this.

510
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,260
-Thank you, Mr Ding.
-Hurry up.

511
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,050
-Okay.
-I'll be waiting. Hurry up.

512
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:53,340
On the night the thief
broke into Fu Ze Hall,

513
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,690
he left the student tag there.

514
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,670
Someone saw you entered the hall.

515
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,270
Now that you don't have your student tag,

516
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,560
you might face some trouble.

517
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,920
In case they want to take
it back after I left school,

518
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,540
I put it in a noticeable place.

519
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,679
Calm down.

520
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,040
I believe you.

521
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,659
I'm taking you back...

522
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,120
to keep the people from
the school from finding out...

523
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,730
who you are if they send someone
to your house.

524
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,780
It is a crime of deceit.

525
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,969
Thank you, Mr Ding.

526
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,020
-Why are you all here?
-Principal Feng.

527
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,659
Wen Bin's here.

528
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,449
Let's get started.

529
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,739
Wen Bin,

530
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,389
where's your student tag?

531
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,060
I left it in the dorm, it's gone missing.

532
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,760
I suppose this is the one?

533
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:56,230
Wen Bin,

534
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,470
is that your student tag?

535
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,120
Yes, it is.

536
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,290
We found your student tag...

537
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,140
at the place where we
lost the lingzhi powder.

538
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,450
Can you explain it?

539
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,960
I have no idea.

540
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,400
Please do me justice.

541
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,520
Such an unconvincing explanation.

542
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,520
Come on.

543
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,170
Wen Bin must have been framed.

544
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,190
Then tell us who framed him.

545
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,430
Could the person be practising magic...

546
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,380
that he was able to make things disappear
without anyone noticing?

547
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,100
And transferred Wen Bin's student tag...

548
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,180
to Fu Ze Hall secretly?

549
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,120
What a joke.

550
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,070
What did you say?

551
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,000
You accused me of theft
because of a student tag?

552
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,100
That's also an unconvincing excuse.

553
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,030
Exactly.

554
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,300
We can't prove that Wen Bin is innocent,

555
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,440
but you can't prove that
he stole it either.

556
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,500
So, you aren't convinced
by the physical evidence.

557
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,300
But we have a witness.

558
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,320
Wen Bin,

559
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,380
did you go to Fu Ze Hall alone...

560
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,960
on midnight of the day you went home?

561
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,580
[Mr Yu has registered these herbs.]

562
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,240
[Collecting them in the morning with
the crowd may make me return home late.]

563
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,000
Wen Bin,

564
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,120
stop making excuses.

565
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,210
The guard saw you when he was patrolling.

566
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,270
Feng Cheng Jun was at the door too.

567
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,340
Cheng Jun,

568
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,400
is that true?

569
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,460
I did see Wen Bin coming out
from Fu Ze Hall that midnight.

570
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,870
But I believe Wen Bin.

571
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,160
The herbs he took were registered.

572
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,360
He wasn't stealing.

573
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,420
Your words can't prove
Wen Bin's innocence.

574
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,730
You're close friends and
everybody knows that.

575
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,920
Exactly.

576
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,640
Wen Bin,

577
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,950
where did you keep those herbs?

578
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,770
-I brought them home.
-Easy.

579
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,880
We may take a look at Wen Bin's home.

580
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,860
The truth will come to light.

581
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,660
The Principal's right.

582
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,000
In order to clear Wen Bin's name,

583
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,570
we have to visit his house.

584
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,620
No way.

585
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:01,530
Why not?

586
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,160
Are you afraid of being found out?

587
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,260
I... I sold it already.

588
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,380
You can punish me however you like.

589
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,390
Wen Bin,

590
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,860
when are you telling the truth?

591
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,760
I don't get you.

592
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,040
Little Brother.

593
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,040
Master Wang's here!

594
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,720
Master Wang.

595
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,280
Skip the formalities.

596
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,080
I can't help but wonder...

597
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,680
how much money did Wen Bin get...

598
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,770
from our tribute.

599
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,430
Wen Bin,

600
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:48,200
say that again in front of Master Wang.

601
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,970
Did you steal it?

602
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,040
If you lie to us,

603
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,030
you're being very disrespectful.

604
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,630
I don't even know how the powder
looks like.

605
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,120
Then, why did you admit...

606
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,880
that you stole it?

607
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:07,800
I didn't want to make my mother worry
when all of you go to my house.

608
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,040
That's why I...

609
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,850
So, he's a filial son.

610
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:14,990
Master Wang,

611
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,070
all evidence implicated
that Wen Bin did it,

612
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,540
but there are many questionable points.

613
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,700
Please do him justice.

614
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,960
Wen Bin was with us
after he left school.

615
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,940
He wouldn't have time to sell the powder.

616
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:29,540
Who knows if Wen Bin has gotten
help from others?

617
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,960
If someone's helping him,

618
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,220
then that'd be me.

619
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:33,650
Cheng Jun,

620
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,220
don't say things out of pique.

621
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,020
Brother Feng, how could you...

622
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,120
Little Brother,

623
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,590
birds of a feather flock together.

624
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,870
If you're a thief, then,

625
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,340
I'm not a good and honest person either.

626
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,940
Since Feng Cheng Jun said that,

627
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,210
well, count me in too.

628
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,800
Me, as well.

629
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,500
What do you think, President?

630
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,470
I think that it's only appropriate
if we bring this to the court.

631
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,300
No, not at all.

632
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,660
If we let the court handle this,

633
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,330
everybody would know that
either one of our students is a thief,

634
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:13,760
or Yun Shang has falsely
accused a student of stealing.

635
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:18,180
Yun Shang would be the
country's laughing stock.

636
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,080
So, we should settle this quietly.

637
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,690
You need to find out the truth yourselves.

638
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:26,970
Yes, Sir.

639
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,510
Yes, Sir.

640
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,800
-Han Sheng Zhi.
-Yes.

641
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,060
You don't have sufficient
evidence to prove...

642
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,150
that Wen Bin is the thief.

643
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,920
I'll talk to the governor and appoint
you as the supervisor tomorrow.

644
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:45,650
Find a stronger evidence
that's favourable to you...

645
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,010
and make Wen Bin admit it willingly.

646
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,450
Yes, Sir.

647
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,830
I'm not siding with anyone.

648
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,640
The four of you will be
given a chance as well.

649
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:00,960
Find the clues to prove your innocence.

650
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,800
Yes, Sir.

651
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,360
Yun Shang Academy reopens in two days.

652
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,440
Keep this in mind, you only have two days.

653
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:12,330
If you fail to find evidence...

654
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,500
that can clear Wen Bin's name,

655
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,800
I will expel Wen Bin,

656
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,650
and punish you for protecting the culprit.

657
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:20,930
But of course,

658
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:24,070
if you found out the person
who framed Wen Bin,

659
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:27,330
I will punish him severely.
