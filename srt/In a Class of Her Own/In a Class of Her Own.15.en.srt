4
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,510
Stand right there!

5
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,880
Stand right there!

6
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,720
-Stand right there!
-Hurry!

7
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,830
Sir, look.

8
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,780
Follow him.

9
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,020
Stand right there.

10
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,860
Greetings, Deputy Commander.

11
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,240
Commander Xu.

12
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,860
It's late at night.

13
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,340
What are you doing here?

14
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,320
Under Han Bie Jia's order,
we're hunting down the rebels...

15
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,240
who distributed
the Book of Ten Thousand Words.

16
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,850
It's been tough for you.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,820
My lord, he is...

18
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
This is my son, Ze Xin.

19
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,720
Commander Xu,
since you're on official business,

20
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,450
you should get to it first.

21
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,120
Yes.

22
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,480
It's so late at night.

23
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:47,110
What are you doing here...

24
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,740
instead of staying in the academy?

25
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,840
You're ruining your own future.

26
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,900
Please stop telling others
that you're my father.

27
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,160
-You disgraceful bastard!
-That's none of your concern.

28
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,940
Since you were little,

29
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,150
you've been following
in your brother's footsteps.

30
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,020
Look at you now.

31
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,800
You're nothing like him.

32
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,820
My brother is no longer your son.

33
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:22,520
You severed ties with him...

34
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,950
and left him for dead.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,160
Is that what a father should do?

36
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,760
So don't mention him in front of me.

37
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,380
You're unworthy of it.

38
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,540
Wen Bin, what's the matter?

39
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,730
Tired?

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,900
Brother Feng.

41
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,400
You were so cool at today's policy forum.

42
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,350
Have a good rest.

43
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,200
Stay away from Han Sheng Zhi.

44
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,230
Don't mess with him
since he's your nemesis.

45
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,210
I'm very pleased to hear that...

46
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,170
since you didn't call him
my love rival instead.

47
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,550
Why are you laughing?

48
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,320
Han Sheng Zhi is my nemesis.

49
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,600
But it's silly of him to think of me
as his love rival.

50
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,080
You know it's not true.

51
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,240
Still, we won today at the policy forum
thanks to you.

52
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,430
Win or lose, justice will always prevail.

53
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,280
Look.

54
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,640
You have the gift of the gab.

55
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,770
A gentleman.

56
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,440
Nice voice.

57
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,100
A distinguished-looking man
with a sense of propriety.

58
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,720
You have all the advantages
but are never arrogant.

59
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,910
Modest and polite.

60
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,050
Gentle and graceful...

61
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,360
with unrivaled talent.

62
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,620
A loyal patriot.

63
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,700
A truly gifted man.

64
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,640
Knock it off.
I know you're good with words.

65
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,120
But that's not the way to use them.

66
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,460
Instead of giving praise,
you're exaggerating.

67
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,480
Brother Feng.

68
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,820
Being overly humble makes you pompous.

69
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,220
Fine, I admit that I'm very outstanding.
Happy now?

70
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,260
That's the way.

71
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,730
I really...

72
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,530
What?

73
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,280
Admire you.

74
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,060
Go to bed.

75
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:42,150
Feng Cheng Jun's got the gift of the gab.

76
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,950
It's not that I didn't do my best.

77
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,520
I just wasn't prepared.

78
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,110
President, forgive me.

79
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,610
It's alright.

80
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,409
Although we lost the right to punishment,

81
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,600
we still have the right to supervise
and maintain the order.

82
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,630
Sheng Zhi.

83
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,880
The students are watching
how we manage the Student Council.

84
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,660
Just be careful...

85
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,580
throughout this period of time.

86
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,860
Sheng Xiong is right.

87
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,120
You must vent your spleen.

88
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,080
But do it when the time is right.

89
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,480
Commander Xu, we've searched the houses
in the Southern District.

90
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,470
There's still no trace of Ke Shi Jun.

91
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,159
He isn't in the Western District...

92
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,909
or the Southern District.

93
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,650
Take our men to the Northern District.

94
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,990
-I'll search in the Eastern District.
-Yes.

95
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,570
Head General.

96
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,370
Commander Xu.

97
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,240
You should be patrolling
in Southern District at this hour.

98
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,780
My lord, I'll return
to the Southern District at once.

99
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,200
You scumbag!

100
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,000
How dare you leave your post?

101
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,240
Get lost!

102
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,440
Yes, my lord.

103
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,640
Commander Xu.

104
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,640
Why didn't you tell the Head General
the things that Lord Bie Jia said?

105
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,920
We can't let Gu Zhe Yuan
claim credit for this.

106
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,830
I'll remember...

107
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,409
this slap on my face.

108
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,750
But we'll only patrol the Eastern District
three days from now.

109
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,440
What if Ke Shi Jun escapes?

110
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,720
Send some of our men
dressed in plain clothes...

111
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,840
to guard the intersections
in the Eastern District.

112
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,850
We'll make our move three days
from now.

113
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,000
Yes.

114
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,280
Let me do it.

115
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,680
It's fine. I can do it.

116
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,790
I want you to spend more time
on your studies.

117
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,760
Alright then.

118
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,450
What's the matter?

119
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,620
Wen Bin.

120
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,850
I still think...

121
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:46,040
you should get things straight
with Ms. Mu Xiao Man.

122
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,040
Running away doesn't actually
solve the problem.

123
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,320
I told her.

124
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,480
Perhaps, she doesn't understand.

125
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,800
You didn't get things straight
with Lady Han as well, didn't you?

126
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,120
Do you have feelings for Lady Han?

127
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,170
Why would you say that?

128
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,000
Well.

129
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:13,800
It's my gut feeling.

130
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,150
Your gut feeling?

131
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,410
Liking someone is a special feeling.

132
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,760
It just feels right
and brings two people closer.

133
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,970
Feelings are too ambiguous.

134
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,760
How could it be?

135
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,260
When you like someone,

136
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,690
all the feelings he makes you feel...

137
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,180
are beyond comparison.

138
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,480
Also, he'll become different
because of that.

139
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,680
I think...

140
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,330
that's how Lady Han feels about you.

141
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,120
Wen Bin.

142
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,880
Are you a love expert?

143
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:51,080
Don't you have the slightest bit
of feeling for...

144
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,720
You should know, right?

145
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,050
What kind of girls do you like?

146
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,020
I like someone...

147
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,120
who can share weal and woe with me.

148
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,530
That's a lot to ask.

149
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,250
Is it? I don't think so.

150
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,040
You share weal and woe with me.

151
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,640
Whether it's in a relationship
or a friendship,

152
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,070
that's what we need.

153
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,240
Brother Feng,
you finally found that feeling?

154
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,850
What kind of feeling?

155
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,860
-The feeling of sweeping the floor.
-The feeling of sweeping the floor?

156
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,000
Young Lady!

157
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,760
Young Lady!

158
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,440
Young Lady!

159
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,640
How is it, Xiao Qin?

160
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,890
Any news from Mr. Feng?

161
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,040
Yes.

162
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,150
-He's now a popular figure in the academy.
-Tell me about it.

163
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,480
I heard there was a policy forum
at Yun Shang Academy.

164
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,920
Mr. Feng made a big hit!

165
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,360
He swept the scholars off their feet.

166
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,130
Mr. Feng is so awesome.

167
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,490
But his opponent was our young master.

168
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,530
If so, my brother must be so embarrassed.

169
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,880
Young Lady, don't laugh about it.

170
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,710
You're starting to side
with the outsiders now.

171
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,900
Are you making fun of me? Watch out.

172
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,370
-I'll beat you.
-I'm honest.

173
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,970
-Young Lady.
-Siding with outsiders?

174
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,540
Xiao Qin, you're getting out of hand.

175
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,300
-Come here! I'll beat...
-Young Lady, stop!

176
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,980
I should put it this way.

177
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,740
You have good taste.

178
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,030
President.

179
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,790
This is a letter for Wen Bin.

180
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,480
It was from Ms. Mu.

181
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,140
[Dear Mr. Wen.]

182
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,000
[I heard you were humiliated
by Han Sheng Zhi.]

183
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,080
[I feel really bad about it.]

184
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,710
[As for us,]

185
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,510
[I have it all figured out now.]

186
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,560
[Just focus on your studies.]

187
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,420
[We will make plans again
after you take up an official post.]

188
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,590
[I'll focus on singing and dancing...]

189
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,370
[and I won't let you down
at the worshiping ceremony.]

190
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,140
[Take care.]

191
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,830
[Be careful of the bad guys.]

192
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,960
[From, Xiao Man.]

193
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,320
Yesterday's policy forum was awesome.

194
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,840
But you two were shooting
your mouths off.

195
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,320
I applauded for you...

196
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,830
but I feared for you at the same time.

197
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,800
Le Xuan was on the president's side
yesterday.

198
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,120
But you still won, right?

199
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,390
That's right.

200
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,020
It has only been a few days.

201
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,760
My junior seems
to be all over that guy now.

202
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,600
That's because you missed out...

203
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,680
on a spectacular policy forum.

204
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,520
A policy forum?

205
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,260
That's right.

206
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,360
You would have loved
Feng Cheng Jun and Wen Bin's speech.

207
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,600
I never expected him
to say things like that.

208
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,700
The story about the policy forum is over.

209
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,300
Let's talk about you.

210
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,360
You were gone for a few days.

211
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,750
How did it go?

212
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,750
Ke Shi Jun...

213
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,600
is indeed in cahoots with authorities.

214
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,920
We were right about it.

215
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,430
Things are getting more
and more complicated.

216
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,270
What's your plan?

217
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,600
-We'll start with the Imperial Brigade.
-That's a good idea.

218
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,500
But...

219
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,740
you need to stay for now.

220
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,960
Catch up on all the lessons
that you missed out.

221
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,720
After you take up an official post,
you'll have plenty of chance...

222
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,480
to spy on the Imperial Brigade.

223
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,160
I'll make time to catch up
with the lessons in these two days.

224
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,940
[Feng Cheng Jun's essay]

225
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,290
Feng Cheng Jun is full of original ideas.

226
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,190
Master Wang.

227
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,760
Do you realise...

228
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,790
that Feng Cheng Jun's views...

229
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,950
are very similar to those
of Xue Ding Kun back in the day?

230
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,510
How many people...

231
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,400
do you think will support
Feng Cheng Jun's idea?

232
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,990
I dare not say.

233
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,040
But the scholars' ideas these days
are very different from those of the past.

234
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,350
Most of the scholars...

235
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,370
agree with Feng Cheng Jun’s opinion.

236
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,590
Wen Bin’s idea...

237
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,760
is exactly the same
as Feng Cheng Jun's.

238
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,960
That's right.

239
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,190
That explains why Feng Cheng Jun...

240
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,950
recommended Wen Bin
for the second-round examination.

241
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,800
It turns out that they both
share a common philosophy.

242
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,430
That's really hard to come by.

243
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,090
Wen Bin has such extraordinary insights.

244
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,820
I don't believe that he is just a child
of some commoners.

245
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,280
Mr. Ding.

246
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,400
Please help me run a background check
on Wen Bin.

247
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,990
Alright.

248
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,990
Such a groundbreaking thesis...

249
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,680
should be shown to His Majesty.

250
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,880
Master Wang,
I'm afraid that's inappropriate.

251
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,960
You said that the scholars' ideas
are very different from those of the past.

252
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,070
So is His Majesty's.

253
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:27,930
Go on.

254
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,970
Those who made such remarks back then...

255
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,720
must still be on the run.

256
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,260
But the officials are no longer...

257
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,300
hot on their tails.

258
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,860
You're right, Master Wang.

259
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,450
Don't worry, Mr. Ding.

260
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,980
I won't put my students at risk.

261

-Ever since the policy forum,
-Feeling better?

316

Wen Bin often praises Feng Cheng Jun.

Feng Cheng Jun is not bad.

318

But Wen Bin is overreacting.

-That's right.
-Feeling better?

320

-Much better.
-But Wen Bin adores him.

I'd like to ask you something.

328
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:37,590
Why isn't Wen Bin's family background
recorded in the register?

329
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,350
I almost forgot about this.

330

Wen Bin directly proceeded
to the second-round examination.

00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,290
It was under
Master Wang's recommendation...

333
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,510
that Wen Bin was enrolled in the academy.

334
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,870
So...

335
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,250
there are no records.

336
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,740
That explains why I couldn't find it.

337
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,580
Besides talking and eating...

338
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,910
our mouths are meant to be used
to ask questions.

339
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,590
You're right, Principal Feng.

340
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,990
What does Wen Bin's matter
have to do with you?

341
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,790
Nothing.

342
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,920
But it's related to Master Wang.

343
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,880
Master Wang sent me here to ask about it.

344
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,960
What?

345
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,700
Master Wang wants to know about it?

346
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,220
Did Wen Bin's speech
at the policy forum...

347
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,480
offend Master Wang so much...

348
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,000
that he wants his family dead?

349
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,310
Master Wang knows
that you care for Wen Bin.

350
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,150
Mr. Ding, this is no joke!

351
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,830
Listen to me.

352
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,000
About Feng Cheng Jun and Wen Bin's views
at the policy forum,

353
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,430
Master Wang...

354
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,490
What is it? Tell me.

355
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,510
really likes it.

356
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,920
That's why he sent me here
to find out more about Wen Bin.

357
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,320
Look, Mr. Ding.

358
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,560
Can you not beat around the bush
when you speak?

359
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,240
The suspense is killing me, you know that?

360
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,710
-My heart...
-You didn't give me a chance to speak.

361
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,100
Jeez.

362
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,150
Mr. Ding.

363
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,750
You must let Master Wang know...

364
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,260
that I do things...

365
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,260
-by the book...
-That's right.

366
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,160
-and I take things seriously.
-That's right.

367
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,150
Although there is no registration,

368
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,190
I have a record of it.

369
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,910
You recorded it?

370
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,780
I'll get it. Wait for me.

371
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,500
Please take a look.

372
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,550
"Wen Bin."

373
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,310
"Had a father who died
when he was little."

374
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,070
"Takes after his mother's surname, Wen."

375
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,520
"Lives in the Western District."

376
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,160
"Stays in the closest village
to San Shen Temple."

377
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,200
Is that all?

378
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,580
Yes.

379
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,140
I wrote down exactly
as what Wen Bin told me.

380
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,650
What's the matter?

381
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,310
Is there a problem?

382
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,790
Not at all.

383
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,640
It's all good.

384
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,450
I can't lift my arms.

385
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,630
Easy.

386
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,600
Give me a rub.

387
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,740
My legs are numb now.

388
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,310
I can't lift my arms.

389
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,050
Let me help you.

390
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,590
How am I going to eat?

391
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,820
-Careful, it's hot.
-Easy.

392
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,220
What are you doing?

393
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,760
What are you doing?

394
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,920
I've never seen a grownup
that needs to be fed.

395
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,170
This will be an eye-opener, then.

396
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,900
What are you talking about?

397
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,180
See for yourself.

398
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,670
Let me do it.

399
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,600
He's my junior.

400
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,380
I'll feed him.

401
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,230
Open your mouth.

402
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,550
Cheng Jun.

403
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,030
Don't be upset.

404
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,920
-Drink up.
-Why don't...

405
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,320
you feed me?

406
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,870
You need to blow on it. It's hot.

407
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,810
Take a look.

408
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,350
Excuse me.

409
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:58,190
May I know if there's a family here
by the last name Wen?

410
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,180
That family over there.

411
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,470
Alright. Thank you.

412
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,820
[Mr. Song Xue.]

413
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,020
[Ding Kun, you're back.]

414
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,300
[Do you feel tired?]

415
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,380
[No.]

416
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,680
[Let's go.]

417
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,360
Come over.

418
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,270
What's the meaning of this?

419
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,150
Sleep this way from now on.

420
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,010
You can sleep however you want.

421
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,210
Why did you arrange Wen Bin's that way?

422
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,770
Because I like it. Why do you care?

423
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,280
Here. Sleep by my side.

424
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,830
Did you ask him before doing that?

425
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,470
Any objections?

426
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,430
I'm fine either way.

427
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,990
I disagree.

428
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,030
I call the shots here.

429
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,870
You're in no position to disagree.

430
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,620
Why are you so domineering?

431
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,040
That's how I am.

432
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,560
How do I sleep with your feet facing me?

433
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,110
That's your problem.

434
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,360
Ze Xin, you should go to bed now.

435
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
Brother Feng.

436
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,470
How about this?

437
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,470
How about this?

438
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,660
[Why did Ze Xin make such arrangement
all of a sudden?]

439
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,240
[Is he being suspicious of me?]

440
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,730
[Your proposition will have a real impact
on the people...]

441
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,450
[and gain the support of the officials.]

442
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,200
[Please allow Mr. Xu Ruo Yang to join.]

443
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,840
[I'll surely follow you...]

444
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,550
[and never give up.]

445
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,120
[Xue Ding Kun’s family members have been
secretly executed by his subordinates.]

446
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,320
[Who told you to do that?]

447
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,300
[Who?]

448
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,590
[I acted under your order.]

449
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,430
[You scoundrel!
When did I give such an order?]

450
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,320
[Does Wen Bin know
about these past incidents?]

451
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,910
[I can't just go up to him and ask him.]

452
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,360
I don't think Wen Bin would do that.

453
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
Let's go.

454
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,720
Yi De, Zi Feng.

455
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,960
Come over.

456
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,560
Have you noticed?

457
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,800
Whenever Feng Cheng Jun
and Wen Bin are together,

458
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Lei Ze Xin would get upset.

459
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,130
That's right.

460
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,400
I feel upset too.

461
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,480
Why would you be?

462
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,670
Look at Wen Bin.

463
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,120
Though born to humble parents,

464
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,240
he's wormed his way
into the aristocratic circle.

465
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,530
It's not fair.

466
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,440
I'm a nobleman too.

467
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,980
Why didn't Wen Bin do that with me?

468
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,320
Is your father a governor?

469
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,080
No, he isn't.

470
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,270
That explains it.

471
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,200
Do you really think that Wen Bin
is sucking up to Feng Cheng Jun?

472
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,800
It's hard to say.

473
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,630
Whatever it is,

474
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,800
we'll leave it to God to decide.

475
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,150
But speaking of which,

476
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,030
do you notice this is making the rounds
among the scholars lately?

477
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,180
That's right.

478
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,160
That's right.

479
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,230
We should talk to Wen Bin about it.

480
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,800
People are talking behind his back.

481
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,240
This is bad for him.

482
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,360
We should tell Wen Bin
to be more careful...

483
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,000
and stay away from Feng Cheng Jun, right?

484
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,350
What's that noise?

485
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,760
I'm sorry.

486
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,360
Is this the way?

487
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,920
But my hand is shaking. It's...

488
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,280
-Pack up and leave at once!
-Ze Xin!

489
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,960
Lei Ze Xin, what's the matter with you?

490
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,520
Ze Xin, what's the matter?

491
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,960
Wen Bin.

492
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,000
Didn't I warn you to stay away from him?
You just wouldn't listen.

493
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,320
Look. You're in trouble now.

494
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,840
What could possibly happen?

495
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,510
Please get things straight.

496
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,360
Now that things have come to this,

497
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,910
I'll just cut to the chase.

498
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,360
What ulterior motive do you have
getting so close to my junior?

499
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,760
An ulterior motive?

500
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,240
What ulterior motive?

501
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,800
Ze Xin, isn't it normal for friends
to be close?

502
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,680
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

503
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,150
I've always treated Wen Bin
as my little brother.

504
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,920
What's wrong if I'm nice to him?

505
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,200
You treat Wen Bin as your brother?

506
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,640
Who's going to believe that?

507
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,830
Lei Ze Xin.

508
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,510
What are you trying to say?

509
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,460
Wen Bin.

510
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,510
Don't let him fool you.

511
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,000
He likes you.

512
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,280
He likes the way you look up to him.

513
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,000
It makes him feel important.
Don't you get it?

514
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,030
Why would you think that way?

515
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,270
Nonsense.

516
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,000
It's not what I think.

517
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,180
Everyone is talking about you now.

518
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,200
They said you're sucking up to him
and being a hanger-on.

519
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,230
Guys, come on in.

520
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,480
Don't get so upset.

521
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,990
Don't get so upset.

522
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,280
We're just doing this for his own good.

523
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,200
Come on in and get things straight.

524
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,760
Go on and tell them.

525
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,400
Wen Bin, we know
that both of you are close.

526
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,440
But you're a commoner
while he's an aristocrat.

527
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,160
You guys should be careful.

528
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,960
Don't give people grounds for gossip.

529
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,280
It's not Wen Bin.

530
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,600
It's... It's just not Wen Bin.

531
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,200
Alright. Calm down.

532
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,960
We know. Calm down.

533
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,810
Wen Bin, for your own sake,

534
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,370
you should just be more careful.

535
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,570
That's right. Be careful.

536
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,010
A lackey?

537
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,750
Interesting.

538
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,710
Cheng Jun.

539
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,320
Brother Feng!

540
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,820
Brother Feng!

541
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,660
Openly forming cliques,

542
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,710
even challenging
the president's authority?

543
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,900
We must find a way
to teach them a lesson.

544
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:47,230
Feng Cheng Jun started the policy forum
because Wen Bin was punished.

545
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,960
The forum was about the academy rules
and Yun's education policy.

546
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,320
This isn't about one person.

547
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,040
If you want to bring down Feng Cheng Jun,

548
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,840
you can hold a policy forum, too.

549
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,920
I...

550
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,600
If you're capable of that,

551
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,560
the president will surely be pleased.

552
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,560
I'll cheer for you, too.

553
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,880
A man attitude determines
how his life will be.

554
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,430
Yu Le Xuan.

555
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,720
All you need to know
is where you ought to sit.

556
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,080
Of course, I'm sitting
next to the president.

557
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,160
But since it's a competition,

558
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,160
we have to play by the rules.

559
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,200
Just talking alone isn't going
to change who the winner is.

560
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,860
-What do you mean by that?
-Brother Feng!

561
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,830
What's the matter?

562
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,510
You left in such a hurry.

563
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,260
Don't go.

564
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,390
What are you trying to do?

565
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,110
Someone said that I'm forming cliques.

566
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,870
But that's not true.

567
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,150
Wen Bin and I are like-minded friends.

568
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,350
We fight for our dreams.

569
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:57,310
Since you want to know
my relationship with Wen Bin,

570
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,120
I'll give you an explanation now.

571
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,120
Brother Feng.

572
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,280
Ignore them.

573
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,800
They can say whatever they want.

574
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,310
Let's go back.

575
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,310
Come with me.

576
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,080
Cheng Jun!

577
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,390
Where to?

578
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,800
Let's follow them.

579
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,960
Let's go.

580
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,850
-Brother Feng, what are you doing?
-Wen Bin.

581
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,030
Today, we officially
become sworn brothers...

582
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,520
before the sage Confucius.

583
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,260
Brothers?

584
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,110
Sworn brothers?

585
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,740
Feng Cheng Jun.

586
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,480
You're the son of a wealthy nobleman.

587
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,360
Becoming sworn brothers isn't a decision
to be made by yourself.

588
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,720
Does your father approve of it?

589
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,520
What about the academy?

590
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:54,120
Monarchs, fathers, sons, nobles,
commoners, that's the order of society.

591
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:57,450
If you do this, you'll disrupt
the status quo.

592
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,680
That's right.

593
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:03,000
It's not appropriate for us
to become sworn brothers.

594
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,670
Do you think...

595
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,890
-I don't deserve to be your brother?
-No, it's not that.

596
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,030
I just think that I...

597
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,400
You're out of my league.

598
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,520
Things are indeed different
when you are dorm mates.

599
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,639
Wen Bin is of a higher status now.

600
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,690
What are you talking about?

601
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,909
Given Wen Bin's talent,

602
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:23,670
-he should rise to the top!
-That's enough.

603
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,139
-Let's see you do it.
-Alright.

604
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:28,270
-You might fall to death!
-Xiao Huan, alright now.

605
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,889
Today,

606
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,670
I'd like you to be our witness.

607
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,400
Wen Bin and I...

608
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,110
shall become sworn brothers
before the sage, Confucius.

609
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,960
Wen Bin, get on your knees.

610
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,889
I want to join too!

611
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,460
-Get back! Don't mess around.
-I'm not!

612
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,620
Zhao Hui, pull him away.

613
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:56,170
-No foolery in front of Confucius!
-No! I want to join them!

614
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,720
Let's go.

615
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,280
The sage Confucius.

616
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,570
I, Feng Cheng Jun, and Wen Bin
will officially become sworn brothers.

617
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:05,920
From now on,
we shall share weal and woe together.

618
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,320
[I'm a girl.]

619
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,050
[How can I be your brother?]

620
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,130
Wen Bin.

621
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,470
Take the oath.

622
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,870
Confucius the sage,

623
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,630
today, I, Wen Bin,
and Feng Cheng Jun shall become brothers.

624
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:22,310
From now on,
we shall share weal and woe together.

625
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,500
How can Wen Bin become brothers
with this prick?

626
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:34,050
After this, no one will call Wen Bin
a hanger-on.

627
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,920
If you're jealous,

628
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,420
you can ask Wen Bin to be your brother
once they are done.

629
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,140
You and Wen Bin are brothers.

630
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,260
If so, you and Feng Cheng Jun
will indirectly become brothers, too.

631
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,400
How wonderful!

632
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,640
I'd never be brothers with Feng Cheng Jun.

633
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,240
Thank you for being our witness.

634
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,000
Wen Bin and I are brothers now.

635
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,280
I hope all of you will stop
making scandalous gossip.

636
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,620
I see.

637
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:08,320
-But Wen Bin seems upset.
-I'm not.

638
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,420
Brother Feng, I'm so happy.

639
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,890
Look at Wen Bin.

640
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,810
We've underestimated Wen Bin.

641
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,040
That's right, President.

642
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,500
It's so unbelievable.

643
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,840
They share the same dormitory.

644
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,160
It's fine if Feng Cheng Jun
stick up for him.

645
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,690
They ended up being sworn brothers now.

646
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,200
It looks like he's really good
at forming cliques, huh?

647
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,200
Find a way...

648
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,200
to kick him out of the academy.

649
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,870
Sheng Zhi.

650
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,710
If we do that,

651
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,640
they might think the Student Council
is taking revenge due to the policy forum.

652
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,160
It might affect our reputation.

653
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,590
It's unacceptable.

654
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,170
I know...

655
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,650
just the perfect candidate.

656
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,730
This is bad.

657
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,120
A gentleman makes money
through honest means.

658
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,200
Since I took Wen Bin's advice,
my income has taken a nosedive.

659
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,150
[Yu Le Xuan!]

660
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,960
It's day time now.

661
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,700
Why did you lock the door?

662
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,120
I was reading banned books.

663
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,550
You know what I mean.

664
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,400
Alright now.
The president is looking for you.

665
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,200
Come with me to Room One of Upper Dorm.

666
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,280
President, to what do I owe this honor?

667
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,680
You seem to be having a good time lately.

668
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,150
What have you been up to?

669
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,590
I've just been finding ways
to make some extra money.

670
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,790
President, if there's anything,
just give the order.

671
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,710
Given your capability,

672
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,110
making extra money
should be the least of your concern.

673
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,620
Le Xuan.

674
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,770
For you,

675
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:26,460
a righteous noble status
is what matters most.

676
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,570
What do you say?

677
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,610
I'm truly grateful to you
for looking out for me.

678
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,770
I always wanted to find a chance
to return the favor.

679
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,010
Status is more important than money.

680
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,520
You can't get anything done even if
you spend a lot on building connections.

681
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,930
I can help you put things right
once and for all.

682
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,310
Don't you want that?

683
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,320
I'm willing to serve you.

684
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,320
But at the moment,

685
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,240
there's nothing much I can do.

686
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,200
You should know that I'm fair
in meting out rewards and punishments,

687
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,800
and I'm a man of my word.

688
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,520
Wen Bin is getting way out line.

689
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,070
Help me get him expelled.

690
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,960
For someone of your status,
getting a student expelled...

691
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,600
should be a piece of cake.

692
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,250
Why would you ever need my help?

693
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,240
Before Wen Bin and Feng Cheng Jun
became sworn brothers,

694
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,400
getting Wen Bin expelled was a breeze.

695
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,960
But since he and Feng Cheng Jun
are sworn brothers now,

696
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:34,030
I don't want to get into a conflict
with Feng Cheng Jun and his family.

697
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,270
The way I see it,

698
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,360
you're most cunning and resourceful.

699
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,000
You're the best person...

700
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,860
for this.

701
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:48,490
Wen Bin's scholarship at Yun Shang Academy
is all he's got.

702
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,200
Wouldn't it be cruel to kick him out?

703
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,390
President.

704
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,750
Are you sure...

705
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:57,150
-you want to be so cruel to him?
-Yu Le Xuan!

706
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:13,550
You have no say in the matter.

707
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,310
Tell me.

708
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,820
What will happen if your identity
as a fake nobleman...

709
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,830
is exposed?

710
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:29,120
You'll become the number one hypocrite
at Yun Shang Academy.

711
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,230
How will you be punished?

712
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:35,710
You'd better think about it.

713
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,400
President, you've misunderstood.

714
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,120
It's not that I'm not willing to do it.

715
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,140
But we need to wait
for the perfect opportunity...

716
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,560
before we strike.

717
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,960
Leverage the strength of others
to secure victory.

718
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,190
I know...

719
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,360
I can count on you.
