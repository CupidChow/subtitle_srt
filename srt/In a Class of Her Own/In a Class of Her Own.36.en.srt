4
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,430
Finally, they got it through.

5
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,680
-Look at them.
-Look at them.

6
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,910
Is that Wen Bin?

7
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,789
-It's him!
-Wen Bin.

8
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,550
-Wen Bin!
-You are back!

9
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,920
Wen Bin, finally, you are back.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,270
We miss you so much!

11
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,240
The four of you...

12
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,680
are finally back.

13
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,789
We can stop worrying.

14
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,680
That's right.

15
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:38,660
We should thank God for the blessing.

16
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,600
Yes.

17
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,550
You should thank us too.

18
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,750
Thank you for your help.

19
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,830
I will never forget...

20
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,000
your kindness.

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
What are you saying, Wen Bin?

22
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,000
You are certainly an affectionate fellow.

23
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,720
Of course we are willing to help you out.

24
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,080
-He is right.
-Yes.

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,630
This time,

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,910
all of you have made
Yun Shang Academy proud.

27
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,240
Wen Bin.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,800
Well done.

29
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,080
Let's go.

30
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,000
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

31
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,150
-Let's go.
-You must have suffered.

32
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,039
Let's go.

33
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,550
Look at you.

34
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,579
What are you doing here?

35
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,180
I am sorry.

36
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,540
For the sake of justice,

37
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,460
I have to do that.

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,650
Leave.

39
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,940
I am left with nothing.

40
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,940
Stop drinking.

41
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,980
You are not left with nothing.

42
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,220
I am here for you.

43
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,780
Sheng Zhi.

44
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,780
Please pull yourself together.

45
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,940
Didn't you promise...

46
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,340
to give me a home?

47
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,980
You promised that you would protect me.

48
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,100
I believe in it.

49
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,860
I trust you.

50
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,579
You are not a coward.

Who are you going to give as a present?

63
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,900
Stop talking nonsense. Give it back to me.

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,350
-Give me back.
-Who is that?

-Tell me.
-Give it to me.

67
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,380
Nothing.

68
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,060
There is something for sure.

69
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,320
Wen Bin,
this is a present from your senior.

70
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,380
For real?

71
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,580
Are you digging your own grave?

72
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,780
I am not.

73
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,180
It's quite beautiful.

74
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,540
Thank you, Senior.

75
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,900
You are welcome.

76
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,380
Look.

77
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,780
I wonder...

78
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,660
if you have the chance to use it.

79
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,420
Of course.

80
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,260
When Brother Bin has graduated,

81
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,620
he would definitely look handsome...

82
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,660
when he uses this delicate fan.

83
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,900
Brother Ze Xin,
thank you for the present.

84
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,460
It's not for you.

85
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,660
Fine, I talked too much.

86
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,700
If that's the case,

87
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,340
should I give a fan to you?

88
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,420
Why?

89
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,300
It's to thank him for saving my life.

90
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,659
Brother Ze Xin.

91
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,700
Don't mention it again.

92
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,659
We are a family.

93
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,540
Senior, you are so petty.

94
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,659
You want to thank him
for saving your life,

95
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,140
yet you only plan to buy a fan for him.

96
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,100
Brother Bin.

97
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,860
Ze Xin.

98
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,690
From what I see,
both of them are a family.

99
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,860
Am I right?

100
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,140
I think the same.

101
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,500
Junior, you are bias towards him.

102
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,640
Senior, I am just kidding.

103
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,340
You hardly thank anyone.

104
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,180
Saying thank you is already
the best gift for Brother Feng.

105
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,060
I...

106
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,580
How about this, Ze Xin?

107
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,620
Let's not disturb Wen Bin
and Brother Cheng Jun.

108
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,860
-We shall leave now.
-Let's go.

109
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,660
No.

110
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,460
You...

111
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,540
Shu?

112
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,940
The name of that girl...

113
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,940
contains "Shu".

114
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,700
You have fallen in love with someone.

115
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,580
Wen Bin.

116
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,220
If you were a girl,

117
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,700
would you like a hair pin like this?

118
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,900
I am not a girl. How do I know?

119
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,780
Well...

120
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,620
Brother Cheng Jun.

121
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,980
What do you think?

122
00:06:58,659 --> 00:06:59,659
I think...

123
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,020
if that girl likes you too,

124
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,060
no matter what the present is,

125
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,020
she would like it.

126
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
Brother Feng is right.

127
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,740
Brother Cheng Jun is indeed experienced.

128
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,860
Didn't you say not to disturb them?
Let's go.

129
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,070
Le Xuan has fallen in love with someone.

130
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:21,980
That's great.

131
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,220
I had a shock.

132
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,540
I thought "Wen" is carved on the fan.

133
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,900
What are you thinking?

134
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,140
Why is there just one blanket?

135
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,380
We went out a few days ago, right?

136
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,620
The blankets were wet. I washed them.

137
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,660
They are not dried yet.

138
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,660
Sleep on your own bed.

139
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,740
I shall sleep here.

140
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,620
Wen Bin will sleep on my previous spot.

141
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,700
Brother Bin hasn't agreed with it.

142
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,860
Go back to your bed.

143
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,620
I am tired. I don't feel like moving.

144
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,980
What are you doing?

145
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,140
We are fighting for a spot.

146
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,340
I am guarding my dominion.

147
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,460
Well,

148
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,860
I shall sleep here.

149
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,419
Both of you should sleep horizontally.

150
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,820
Otherwise, I shall sleep outside.

151
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,540
Why are you still here?

152
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,060
I have to go.

153
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,750
Lei Ze Xin, the class will start soon.

154
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,080
Why are you taking a stroll?

155
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,940
I don't feel like attending the class.

156
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,860
You shall go by yourself.

157
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,460
Why?

158
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,080
I don't want to see Feng Cheng Jun.

159
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,620
I feel troubled when I see him.

160
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,300
Lei Ze Xin.

161
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,820
Are you wussing out?

162
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,100
What are you saying?

163
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,780
I have strong urge to beat
Feng Cheng Jun up.

164
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,260
If you ever beat Feng Cheng Jun,

165
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,180
your junior will get heart broken.

166
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,100
That's why.

167
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,180
I hide away because
I can't afford to beat him.

168
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,860
I don't want to attend
the same class with them.

169
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,740
That's interesting.

170
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,260
By the way,

171
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,780
I am going home tonight.

172
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,020
Please keep a close eye on them.

173
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Even if I can watch them
for a period of time,

174
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,000
I can't be watching them
for the rest of their life.

175
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,940
Why don't you...

176
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,060
just follow the flow?

177
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,780
What are you thinking?

178
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,250
I told you to protect them!

179
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,100
You...

180
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,460
Brother Feng,
if you won't stop doing this,

181
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,180
how can we study at ease?

182
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,860
I understand that.

183
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,740
However,

184
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,380
I can't control myself.

185
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,100
I feel as if my soul has been stolen.

186
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,220
If you do it again,

187
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,860
I will ignore you.

188
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,960
I...

189
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,420
I will try my best to control.

190
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,900
You should not just do your best,

191
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,100
you have to control yourself.

192
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,180
If your performance is good,

193
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,780
I will reward you.

194
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,260
Okay, I promise.

195
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,980
My sleepiness is gone out of a sudden.

196
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,620
I shall continue studying.

197
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,660
I don't feel sleepy too.

198
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,860
Let's study together.

199
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,900
Okay.

200
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,420
I can't sleep...

201
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,900
but I can't be staying up
for the whole night.

202
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,740
What should I do?

203
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,860
I have an idea.

204
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,420
Why are you so perverted?

205
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,900
There is a leaf on your hair.

206
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,180
I just want to remove it.

207
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,780
How is that being pervert?

208
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,740
Just go to sleep.

209
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,580
What are you doing?

210
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,580
You should sleep like this.

211
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,700
No, I will be running out of breath.

212
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,420
How about...

213
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,420
you sleep further away?

214
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,500
-Come and have a look.
-Come and have a look.

215
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,060
Now you see my face.

216
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,060
You are so pretty.
Why are you hiding behind the veil?

217
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,260
Both of you,

218
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,220
this way please.

219
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,460
Which do you think is better?

220
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,500
As long as you like it, it is good.

221
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,300
Don't regret.

222
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,700
See if you like anything else,

223
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,820
I shall buy it for you.

224
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,220
Are you loaded?

225
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,460
We are not buying vegetables.

226
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,700
One is enough.

227
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,820
You just want to get one
yet you are looking at many.

228
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,900
I don't want you to spend too much on me.

229
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,160
How about this?

230
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,620
Let's choose the one that
you like the most.

231
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,500
We shall pay and leave.

232
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,220
This one.

233
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,980
Mr. Wang, how is it?

234
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,980
Mr. Chao.

235
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,140
Mr. Feng.

236
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,420
What a coincidence.

237
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,020
Mr. Chao, are you here to buy something?

238
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,380
I am here to check out the market price.

239
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:28,980
This one.

240
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,920
I want all of these.

241
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,460
Mr. Feng is generous.

242
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,340
I don't want it now.

243
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,820
If you dare to buy all of them,
I will throw them away.

244
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,460
You spent such a long time to choose,

245
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,660
but you didn't buy anything.

246
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,460
What a waste of time.

247
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,420
That's how girls shop.

248
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,300
You don't know that?

249
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,020
When I went to shop with Brother Bin,

250
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,540
he's not this troublesome.

251
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,380
You may leave and find your Brother Bin.

252
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
I wanted to buy something
for my beloved girl...

253
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,310
but she got angry at me.
What mistake did I make?

254
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,220
Where is the hairpin that I want?

255
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,859
The boss got angry because you ran away.

256
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,500
You didn't buy the one that I want?

257
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,339
How can you do that?

258
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,900
How can you blame it on me?
You ran away first!

259
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,540
Fine.

260
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,200
Let's go back to the shop
and buy the hairpin.

261
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,060
Brother Bin is more reasonable.

262
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:25,660
Fine.

263
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,270
You may leave
and find your Brother Bin now.

264
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,100
Brother Bin is always the better.

265
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,220
I like Brother Bin more.

266
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,780
You just want to badmouth me.

267
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,340
Stop using Brother Bin's name.

268
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,100
Alright.

269
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,780
Make up your mind.

270
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,900
Do you want it?

271
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,420
Tell me what you want.

272
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,540
Do you want it?

273
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,780
I want your heart.

274
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,580
I am not Wen Bin.

275
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,020
I am Xue Wen Xi.

276
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,220
Wen Xi.

277
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,700
You have endured many hardships.

278
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,300
I won't let you suffer anymore.

279
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,180
You better behave well.

280
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,500
Don't think that you can trick me.

281
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,100
You have to withstand the test.

282
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,580
I have never been scared of test.

283
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,140
You are being unreasonable...

284
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,580
and you talk so much.

285
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,660
Are you going to behave like this
for the rest of your life?

286
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,700
Yes.

287
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,900
So what?

288
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,220
What else can I do?

289
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,100
I shall put up with it.

290
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,940
I am hungry.

291
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,780
What do you want to eat?

292
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,220
I shall leave it to you.

293
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,260
Okay.

294
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,980
I shall get you some delicious food.

295
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,340
Sit here and wait for me.

296
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,940
Didn't you say that...

297
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,780
if I perform well today,

298
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,820
you will reward me?

299
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,620
Give it to me.

300
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,860
Are you going back on your own words?

301
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,540
A real man never goes back on his words.

302
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,780
[Stop running!]

303
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,060
[What are you doing?]

304
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,660
[Stop messing around!]

305
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,620
[Stop running!]

306
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,100
Both of you are so annoying.

307
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,260
You are together now because of me.

308
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,100
Raise your cup.

309
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,700
Let's cheers to...

310
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,220
those who have passed
the Imperial Examination.

311
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,540
Today is a good day.

312
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,140
Please suit yourself.

313
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,900
-Let's eat.
-Here.

314
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,780
Wen Bin.

315
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,940
I am so reluctant...

316
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,780
to send you off.

317
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,420
You shouldn't feel reluctant.

318
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,140
I have made up my mind.

319
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,590
Once I am graduated,

320
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,260
Wen Bin will become my God.

321
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,860
I shall follow Wen Bin anywhere he goes.

322
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,740
Sure.

323
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,620
Principal Feng,
thank you for your hard work.

324
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,060
Wen Bin, Brother Cheng Jun.

325
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,220
Students of Yun Shang Academy...

326
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,620
put our family aside
and treat each other fairly.

327
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,060
Both of you contributed the most.

328
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,300
You are admirable.

329
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,260
-Yes.
-I admire you too.

330
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,580
If you ask me,

331
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,940
I am the one who admire them the most.

332
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,140
If it weren't for Wen Bin and Cheng Jun,

333
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,460
I think I will never graduate.

334
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,660
Congratulations, Zhao Rong,
on your graduation.

335
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,100
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

336
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,580
-Congratulations!
-Cheers!

337
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,100
-Congratulations!
-Cheers!

338
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,060
Congratulations!

339
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,900
Master.

340
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,500
Thank you.

341
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,820
Ze Xin.

342
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,980
Finally, you have graduated.

343
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,740
Good job.

344
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,020
Cheers.

345
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,700
Principal Feng.

346
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,980
There is another good news.

347
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,820
Don't get overly agitated
after listening the good news.

348
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,260
Sure. Please say it.

349
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,540
Master Wang is going to invite you...

350
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,860
to join the imperial court.

351
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,780
I am grateful for his invitation.

352
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,060
Finally, my dream of many years...

353
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,020
comes true.

354
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,980
However, I have aged.

355
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,460
I don't feel like joining
the imperial court.

356
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,700
I better stay in school...

357
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,500
and have fun with these students...

358
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,140
who are young and cheerful.

359
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,220
That way, I would look young.

360
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,460
I...

361
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,340
I want to keep growing.

362
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,780
Growing?

363
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,860
Yes.

364
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,020
It's growing.

365
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,520
As long as I am living,

366
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,820
I have to keep growing.

367
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,620
Your mindset...

368
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,140
is worth learning...

369
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,940
and reflecting.

370
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,280
Thank you for teaching me.

371
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,500
You are overly humble.

372
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,420
Mr. Ding.

373
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,220
I heard that...

374
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,780
you are going to join
the imperial court again.

375
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,540
Yes.

376
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,820
After leaving here,

377
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,740
I will promote the studying culture
in Yun Shang Academy...

378
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,940
to all the corners of the State of Yun.

379
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,180
Great.

380
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,800
Thank you for your hard work.

381
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,700
I knew that you didn't have enough.

382
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,950
Why aren't you keeping
Feng Cheng Jun company?

383
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,700
Master Wang wants him
to join the state government...

384
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,580
to investigate
Governor Feng's bribery case.

385
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,740
I was too impulsive back then.

386
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,820
I put him in trouble.

387
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,220
Don't say that.

388
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,400
The innocent man
knows that he is innocent.

389
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,760
Brother Feng won't blame you.

390
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,540
Is this guy...

391
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,060
going to follow you around...

392
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,220
like a bug?

393
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,540
I can't do anything.

394
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,060
I think...

395
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,260
he is quite a good fit
to be a government official.

396
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,540
It would be a waste if he follows you...

397
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,580
to the remote areas.

398
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,060
Don't worry.

399
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,500
Master Wang said...

400
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,020
the Emperor would give him a year...

401
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,060
to get familiar
with the conditions of people.

402
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,740
The imperial court will assign
some important tasks to him a year later.

403
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,780
That sounds promising.

404
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,340
If Brother Feng knows that
you care about him,

405
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,360
he would feel happy.

406
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,940
You can't be thinking
for Feng Cheng Jun only.

407
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,940
I am your senior.

408
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,020
You should treat me better.

409
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,740
Why are you staring at me?

410
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,220
Thank you, Senior.

411
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,400
Thank you for caring about me,

412
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,740
helping me,

413
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,340
and protecting me.

414
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,780
You are not completely heartless.

415
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,820
Senior, you are brave.

416
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,820
If you didn't take the risk to distribute
Book of Ten Thousand Words,

417
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:54,290
my dad's name wouldn't be clear
in such a short period of time.

418
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,460
Your kindness...

419
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,580
will never be forgotten.

420
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,340
Mr. Xue's...

421
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,980
and my brother's...

422
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,380
names are cleared...

423
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,700
because we worked hard together.

424
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,060
I didn't do anything though.

425
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,220
Mr. Xue.

426
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,100
Brother.

427
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,340
Wen Bin is strong.

428
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,740
He is brave.

429
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,180
He put in a lot of effort...

430
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,260
to fulfill your last wish.

431
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,660
If you are up there,

432
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,260
please bless him with happiness...

433
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,480
and safety.

434
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,140
Can't you be strong?

435
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,900
Same goes to you.

436
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,900
Don't judge me.

437
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,420
I am happy.

438
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,780
So am I.

439
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,020
This is the first and last time.

440
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,380
We shall not cry again.

441
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,100
Also,

442
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,940
if Feng Cheng Jun
bullies you in the future,

443
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,060
let me know.

444
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,020
I will seek revenge for you.

445
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,060
Also,

446
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,500
bear it in mind.

447
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,540
I am always your family.

448
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:43,980
I'll bare it in mind.

449
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,620
-Great!
-Great!

450
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,090
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

451
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,980
I shall stop drinking.

452
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,380
Why are you worrying?

453
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,540
No way...

454
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,780
you are worrying about the school rules.

455
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,940
Brother Bin should drink less.

456
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,140
You.

457
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,620
Whenever we drink,

458
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,460
you would say something sarcastically.

459
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,180
I am so sick of it.

460
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,540
You are right.

461
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,620
We are going to part ways soon.

462
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,820
Today,

463
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,660
we shall drink until we are dropped.

464
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,260
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

465
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,260
I shall drink on behalf of Brother Bin.

466
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,880
That's right. Girls should drink less.

467
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,820
I didn't expect that...

468
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,460
the first person who got drunk...

469
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,260
is Lei Ze Xin who has the best tolerance.

470
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,580
Yes, I am drunk.

471
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,980
It seems that Brother Ze Xin is drunk.

472
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,500
What is so funny?

473
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,020
You don't have to do that
even if I am drunk.

474
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,220
Are you making a death wish?

475
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,460
When do you plan to tell me the truth?

476
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,580
What does that mean?

477
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,540
To be honest,

478
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,060
in order to hide Wen Bin's real identity,

479
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,860
I have put in quite a lot of effort.

480
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,340
Hide my identity?

481
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,740
I have had too much.

482
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,540
I've started to have drunk talk.

483
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,940
It seems that both of you are drunk.

484
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,540
No one cares if they are drunk.

485
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,940
You better make it clear!

486
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,200
You first.

487
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,260
Don't get me involved in it.

488
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,220
Forget it.

489
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,580
Some things are meant to be vague.

490
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,260
I need to know how they found out.

491
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,060
What if...

492
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,860
Both of you must make it clear.

493
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,980
How did you find out?

494
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,900
What does that mean?

495
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,540
Well, the husband submits to the wife.

496
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,740
Brother Le Xuan.

497
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,300
Stop pretending!

498
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,380
Wake up!

499
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,180
Make it clear!

500
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,780
[One year later]

501
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,460
You shall be in charge
of this part moving forward.

502
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,620
Yes, my lord.

503
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,500
Be careful.

504
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,100
My lord.

505
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,580
Take a look.

506
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,980
-It is so cute.
-Yes.

507
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,220
Be careful.

508
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,780
Let's go.

509
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,660
My lord, have some tea.

510
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,860
You don't have to bow.

511
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,180
Wen Bin.

512
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,780
I have heard a lot about you.

513
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,180
It's said that you love your people...

514
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,700
and you manage this place well.

515
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,220
I am just doing my best.

516
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,740
I take the suffering of the people
as my own suffering.

517
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,220
I take the happiness of the people
as my own happiness.

518
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,420
Great.

519
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,940
You shall get back to work.

520
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,900
Mr. Ding.

521
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,460
Don't you think that...

522
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,220
Wen Bin has changed a lot?

523
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,740
Not only he has grown taller,

524
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,500
his voice has also become coarse.

525
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,500
Master Wang.

526
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,180
I have been hiding something from you.

527
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,660
Please forgive me, Master Wang.

528
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,660
Xue Ding Kun's son and daughter
have grown up.

529
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,860
Now, he can rest in peace.

530
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,280
Both of his son and daughter
are extraordinary.

531
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,180
Some things are exceptions.

532
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,340
You don't have to explain everything.

533
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,020
You are wise.

534
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,220
I was racking my brain...

535
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,620
how to deal with Wen Bin and Wen Xi.

536
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,860
I didn't expect that you would settle
the matter in such a short period.

537
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,140
I have always wanted...

538
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,060
to tell you Wen Xi's real identity...

539
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,220
but...

540
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,100
I didn't have the chance.

541
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,820
I didn't expect that you would...

542
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,100
It's still the same.

543
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,060
Those things that I shouldn't know,

544
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,500
you can just keep them from me.

545
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,860
Yes.

546
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,860
Since the first time...

547
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,540
I saw that pair of familiar eyes,

548
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,140
I knew that they are his children.

549
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,380
Mr. Ding, you couldn't tell?

550
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,870
I am not good at recognizing people.

551
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:40,320
[Yun Shang Girl Academy]

552
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,180
Is this the registry?

553
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,380
Everyone.

554
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,540
Please queue up.

555
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,840
Let me have your household register.

556
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,060
I will pass you the number plate.

557
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,420
Alright.

558
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,220
-Be patient. Come one by one.
-Be patient.

559
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,940
Queue up.

560
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,300
It's yours.

561
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,220
Girls, please queue up.

562
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,100
Don't rush. Register properly.

563
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,340
You can't register here.

564
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,540
If you want to study,

565
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,460
you have to go to the school for boys
at the other end of the street.

566
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,360
-Got it?
-Thank you.

567
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,920
-Go now. Hurry.
-Thank you.

568
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,900
Thank you for coming, Governor Feng.

569
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,540
Please excuse me for not
going out to meet you.

570
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,340
Mr. Chao, you are overly polite.

571
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,179
This way please.

572
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,139
Come.

573
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,820
What do you think?

574
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,219
Do you like this place?

575
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,179
This beautiful lady...

576
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:32,540
is so familiar.

577
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,260
Have we met before?

578
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,420
Mr. Chao.

579
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:42,980
Wen Bin?

580
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,100
I am Wen Bin.

581
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,620
It's understandable.

582
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,820
[Mr. Chao.]

583
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,070
I am coming.

584
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,300
I don't get it.

585
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,300
Mr. Feng.

586
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:09,820
Ms. Han.

587
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,620
Ms. Han.

588
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,220
You are...

589
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,700
You are Wen Bin?

590
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,300
My name is Xue Wen Xi.

591
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,740
I see.

592
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:31,060
Thank you for your study tips, Sister Xi.

593
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,180
The school for ladies...

594
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,900
has officially started operating
because of you.

595
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,220
Where is the old Wen Bin?

596
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,940
My name is Xue Wen Bin.

597
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,860
Yun Shang Academy
is situated at the place where sun sets.

598
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,420
No.

599
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,820
It is situated at the place
where sun rises.

600
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:56,980
Both of us are right.

601
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,660
What are they doing?
