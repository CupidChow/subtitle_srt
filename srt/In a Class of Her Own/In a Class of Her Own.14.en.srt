4
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:24,840
Stop!

5
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,170
Let go of that boy immediately!

6
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,690
Did you have to yell?

7
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:33,090
Let him go.

8
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:35,650
Do it.

9
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,970
What are you all doing?

10
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,130
What are we doing?

11
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,070
I should ask you what you're doing.

12
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,930
-Me?
-Yes, you.

13
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,289
We're here to investigate the problem.

14
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,830
Let's not jump to conclusions.

15
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,360
Guys, calm down.

16
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,940
What's the matter?

17
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,360
-You explain.
-See...

18
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,370
Someone told me...

19
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,490
that Feng Cheng Jun is bullying you.

20
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,960
So I brought the gang
to come and investigate.

21
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,490
Not to investigate.

22
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,790
We are here to save poor Wen Bin.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,930
-Yes, we are.
-Okay, we're saving him.

24
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,230
That is preposterous.

25
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,210
Wait, what made you guys think so?

26
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,250
Don't be scared.

27
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:21,079
Just tell us what's going on.

28
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,880
-We'll handle it for you.
-But...

29
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,970
-Right.
-Brother Feng did not bully me.

30
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,170
What do you mean he didn't?

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,550
I saw you getting chased out
from the dorm.

32
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,329
Chased out from the dorm?

33
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,880
Wen Bin, you weren't
at the dorm yesterday?

34
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,810
You're mistaken, Brother Zhao Hui.

35
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,060
I wasn't chased out
and I'm not being scared.

36
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,940
It's okay to tell us the truth, Wen Bin.

37
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,310
You're clearly scared.

38
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,380
Every time I see you with Feng Cheng Jun,

39
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,130
you're always shivering in fear...

40
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,800
like a girl being bullied.

41
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,180
-Yes.
-That's right.

42
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,940
You noticed?

43
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,460
-There, it's out in the open now.
-It's okay.

44
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,370
That's the look.
You're obviously being bullied.

45
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,410
-Yes.
-We'll help you.

46
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,610
It's not like that.

47
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,329
You guys are mistaken. He and...

48
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,250
Brother Feng and I...

49
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,890
Brother Feng and I are good buddies.

50
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,960
Good... Good buddies?

51
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,110
What does that mean?

52
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,490
Doesn't look like it.

53
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,370
No.

54
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,570
I've been watching you two
for several days.

55
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,570
They're not close at all.

56
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,079
-Yes.
-I bet they're pretending.

57
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,890
Actually, we're playing a game.

58
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,920
Game?

59
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:22,970
Playing?

60
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,410
Yes, that's right.

61
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,590
I'm trying to see his reaction
when I avoid him.

62
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,690
It's research for the content
of the next dialogue novel...

63
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,290
for our dialogue novel group.

64
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,930
What? You two are...

65
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,450
-No.
-What is that?

66
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,410
No?

67
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,860
What no?

68
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:39,930
Brother Bin.

69
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,079
You're not purposely avoiding me.

70
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,250
Tell me.

71
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,720
Is something bothering you?

72
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,610
I must have been cursed.

73
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,410
Cursed?

74
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,960
-What curse?
-Cursed?

75
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,320
That's not a problem, Wen Bin.

76
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,330
What are you doing?

77
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,950
What's he doing?

78
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,209
Wen Bin.

79
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,290
Right about now.

80
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,810
Do you feel a tiny bit better?

81
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,590
-Better?
-Does he look better to you?

82
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,530
How would you feel if I stuck
a talisman on you?

83
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,980
Sorry about that.

84
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,090
Scram!

85
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,190
We're leaving.

86
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,920
-Sorry.
-Sorry, Wen Bin. Are you okay?

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,500
Are you sure you're okay?

88
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,340
That's enough! You're making it not okay.

89
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,810
My bad.

90
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,170
Come on!

91
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:46,970
Brother Bin.

92
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,290
What is up with those guys?

93
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,490
I have something to do, Brother Feng.
I'll tell you next time.

94
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,850
Are you going out again?

95
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,600
Today is a no outing day.

96
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,590
It's an emergency.

97
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,510
It will be fine. I'll scale the back wall.

98
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,830
No one would know.

99
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,450
Are you looking for Mu Xiao Man again?

100
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,740
I'm not!

101
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,850
It's an emergency. I need to go!

102
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,200
Brother Bin!

103
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,850
Your brother's fever is not dissipating.

104
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,990
I'm really worried.

105
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,870
I have the prescription.

106
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,880
I just need the money to buy the medicine.

107
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,860
Oh, here you go.

108
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,610
You're skinnier than
the last time I saw you.

109
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,060
The food in the school should be good.

110
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,020
Is someone bullying you?
Stealing your food?

111
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,250
No such thing.

112
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,610
If you can't even take care of yourself,

113
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,000
what else can you do well?

114
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,010
You always underestimate me, Mother.

115
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,130
You know what?

116
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,409
The dialogue novel I'm currently writing
is selling well.

117
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,730
Can't you praise me a little?

118
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,450
I'm...

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,400
What's the use of praising?

120
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,630
Did Wen Bin really sneak out?

121
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,920
How should we punish a scholar...

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,520
who broke the school rules?

123
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,520
Report to the Interrogation Hall.

124
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,830
That's a ten-point deduction.

125
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,830
And?

126
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,950
That's all.

127
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,190
We have to be strict,

128
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,830
for the scholars to take it seriously.

129
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,940
The current school rules
are like a little lock.

130
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,810
It keeps gentlemen in check,

131
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,100
but not troublemakers.

132
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,230
It's nothing more than a little itch
for the stubborn scholars.

133
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,659
It has no effect.

134
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,700
Hence, we need to run a tight ship.

135
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,620
Otherwise, the school rules
are nothing but words on paper.

136
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,090
I'm doing well in the academy.

137
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,720
Nobody suspected anything of my identity.

138
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,840
Don't worry.

139
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,240
I'll make sure nothing bad
happens to me...

140
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,120
while I study and make a living.

141
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,640
I will not trouble the family.

142
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,280
Instead, I'm increasing its income.

143
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,730
So, all you have to do...

144
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,450
is hum a tune while you count the money.
Sounds good?

145
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,950
Hum a tune and count money?

146
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,370
Don't come and see me
if you don't put on some weight.

147
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,330
Don't worry.

148
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,700
Next time, you'll see me all chubby
to deliver money.

149
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,500
All you have to do is count it happily.

150
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,490
Making money isn't everything.

151
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,250
Safety comes first.

152
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,240
Okay?

153
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,130
Okay.

154
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,360
It's getting late. I need to go.

155
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,000
Tell little brother to take care.

156
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:30,880
You take care.

157
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,090
Go on.

158
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:50,810
President.

159
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,409
President.

160
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,530
I saw Wen Bin. He's back.

161
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,670
Who's there?

162
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,700
Going to hide, are you?

163
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,250
I saw you.

164
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,130
Come out!

165
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,159
Wen Bin!

166
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,860
Wen Bin.

167
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,610
Where did you run off to?

168
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,610
The President has been eyeing you.

169
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,950
Be honest. Don't be stubborn.

170
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,570
Wen Bin.

171
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,060
You snuck out of the school
when it's prohibited.

172
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,940
What crime did you commit out there?

173
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,420
It's personal.

174
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,100
Personal, is it?

175
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,710
You probably went to Cai Yun House...

176
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,320
Yun Shang Academy has always prioritised
the Five Virtues.

177
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,130
But lately,

178
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,050
some people have damaged
the school's reputation...

179
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,460
and caused shame to its students.

180
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,650
That's right.

181
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,650
Such harmful bugs should be removed.

182
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,970
Wen Bin, why exactly did you openly
break school rules?

183
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,370
The rules are not child's play.

184
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,300
If you can't give us a valid reason,

185
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,620
and other scholars think
they can do the same,

186
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,140
what happens then?

187
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:42,970
Speak up.

188
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,290
Do you not have an answer
or you don't want to answer?

189
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,160
Look at me!

190
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,510
Have I wronged you?

191
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,060
Wen Bin, oh, Wen Bin.

192
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,560
The Student Council has been
keeping tabs...

193
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,640
on your unruly behaviour and misconduct.

194
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,690
You weren't punished because
we hoped you'd change your ways.

195
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,010
Yet, you remain stubborn.

196
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,010
Don't blame the rulebook
for not showing mercy.

197
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,810
I accept punishment
for breaking the rules.

198
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,130
But I do not accept
you labelling me as unruly.

199
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,430
Do with me as you wish. I'll take it.

200
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,810
I see.

201
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,290
You've got guts.

202
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,750
Listen up.

203
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,250
I'm punishing you today...

204
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,290
not because I'm targetting you.

205
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,250
It's to protect Yun Shang Academy's
fair rules and regulations...

206
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,050
as well as the reputation
of its scholars, understand?

207
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:42,970
-Yes.
-Understood.

208
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,090
Condemnation needs no pretext.

209
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,170
What did you say?

210
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,170
Who's condemning you?

211
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
Explain!

212
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,870
You know it, everybody does.

213
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,750
You!

214
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,650
Fine.

215
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,390
Wen Bin.

216
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,410
Today,

217
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,700
on record,

218
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,080
I will discipline you
on behalf of the Student Council.

219
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,810
Off record,

220
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,610
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

221
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,690
You need to know what rules are.

222
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,750
You like scaling walls, no?

223
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,170
You'll stand on the wall
as much as you like.

224
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,370
President.

225
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,610
President!

226
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,470
Just keep your mouth shut.

227
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,690
Okay, fine.

228
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,530
Look, everyone.

229
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,860
Stubbornness.

230
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,930
This is what he gets for pissing off
the president.

231
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,610
Move.

232
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,100
Long time coming.

233
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,250
Mr. Li.

234
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,570
Don't you think Wen Bin's punishment
is a little excessive?

235
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,290
-The president made him stand there.
-Yes.

236
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,060
It's not the first time Wen Bin
broke the rules.

237
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,000
-Right.
-If the Interrogation Hall has a say,

238
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,130
-it will be a painful solution.
-Painful...

239
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,720
Painful solution?

240
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,370
Sheng Zhi.

241
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,740
It's been an hour.

242
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,780
That brat, Wen Bin.

243
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,650
He's a tough one.

244
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,580
He hasn't moved from the spot.

245
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,970
I want to see how much longer
he can stand here.

246
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,000
Did you guys do what I instructed?

247
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,570
Every 15 minutes, we told him
to apologize to you.

248
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,040
He's either playing dumb
or lost his hearing.

249
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,240
There is no reaction.

250
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,570
I worry that...

251
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,680
if time drags on and something happened,

252
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,800
you'd get into trouble.

253
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,290
After all, all eyes are watching.

254
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,970
Is that a joke?

255
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,260
My purpose is for everyone to see.

256
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,930
I, Han Sheng Zhi, am upholding justice...

257
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,960
by punishing him accordingly.

258
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,640
He's not fazed. Why should I be?

259
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,690
Besides,

260
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,850
if I show any leniency now,

261
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:54,000
it'd only make him more brazen
in the future.

262
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,930
-Morning, Brother Zhao Rong.
-Brother Zhao Rong.

263
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,170
Good morning. Come here, Cheng Jun.

264
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,510
Finally. I've looked everywhere for you.

265
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,600
-Why?
-Listen.

266
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,880
Wen Bin and the president...

267
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,550
Wen Bin? What's happened to him?

268
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,670
Keep it down!

269
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,430
Come, follow me.

270
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,860
He's still standing.

271
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,800
It should stop.

272
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,190
He's at his limit.

273
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,440
Wen Bin!

274
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,050
Why do you always choose the hard road?

275
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,600
-Just say you're sorry.
-That's right.

276
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,010
You're playing into their hand
by being stubborn.

277
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,450
Can't you see that?

278
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,690
No.

279
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,980
Brother Wen Bin.

280
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,250
Do you want to die up there?

281
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,130
Right.

282
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,790
Quick, help get Wen Bin down!

283
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,810
Quickly!

284
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,690
Stop!

285
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,950
Hey...

286
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,050
Has he apologised?

287
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,720
Even if Wen Bin had done wrong,
he doesn't deserve death.

288
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,770
Is the Student Council trying to kill him?

289
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,210
That's right. What do you guys want?

290
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,040
School rules are like military commands.

291
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,870
Promises must be kept
and action must be resolute.

292
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,490
Whatever happens,
I'll take responsibility.

293
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,170
Let him go.

294
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,320
No way.

295
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,970
Who do you think you are?

296
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,890
Right, the president didn't say so.

297
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,130
I dare you to touch him.

298
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,430
How is he?

299
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,010
-Are you okay?
-Wen Bin?

300
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,010
Wen Bin.

301
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,580
Brother Feng.

302
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,650
I knew you'd come.

303
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,050
Go get the doctor!

304
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,890
-Quick, someone get the doctor.
-I'm fine.

305
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,290
I just need to rest.

306
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,720
Feng Cheng Jun.

307
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:34,050
You are openly defying
the Student Council's authority.

308
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,810
Wen Bin did break the rules.

309
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,770
It's fine to punish, but not torture him.

310
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,180
He is wrong,

311
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,770
but he committed no crime. Okay?

312
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,740
I made him stand on the wall
and that's killing him?

313
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,860
Moreover, we prepared safety precautions,
didn't we?

314
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,830
Which part of it is torture?

315
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,190
-Right.
-The only one to blame is Wen Bin himself.

316
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,930
Everyone, stop bickering.

317
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,530
Give me the water. Come on.

318
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,450
Quickly.

319
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,330
The job of the Student Council...

320
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,870
is to get the scholar
to willingly admit their mistake.

321
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,780
Not by force, understand?

322
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,380
And we have done nothing
but enforcing school rules.

323
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,310
Stop twisting the facts, Feng Cheng Jun.

324
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,190
Okay.

325
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,260
We're going to tell Mr. Li.

326
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,370
Go ahead.

327
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,810
I'd like to see...

328
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,970
whose side Mr. Li is on.

329
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,050
What's up?

330
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,820
I could smell fire burning
from miles away.

331
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,290
You should've told Mr. Li sooner.

332
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,370
Now that Wen Bin is in this sorry state,

333
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,090
going to see him
is only asking for a rebuff.

334
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,760
Indeed.

335
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,620
I'd like to see...

336
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,340
who's stupid enough
to ask for a rebuff.

337
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,250
Something the president can handle himself
doesn't have to involve the higher-ups.

338
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,230
That's right.

339
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,790
You should just take Wen Bin back
to recuperate.

340
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,720
If anything worse happened,

341
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,050
it'd be real trouble.

342
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,890
What do you say, President?

343
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,810
Next time, I won't be so lenient.

344
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,380
Of course, President.

345
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,170
Wen Bin.

346
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,700
You heard that?

347
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,420
You won't get away so easily
if you do it again.

348
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,410
-Take him.
-Quick, he needs rest.

349
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,380
Here.

350
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,990
I'll get the doctor.

351
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,810
I'm really okay, Brother Feng.

352
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,310
Why did you have to sneak out?

353
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,250
You can't even tell me?

354
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,369
You took a big risk.

355
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,730
Was it to see Ms. Mu?

356
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,330
Stop asking, Brother Feng.

357
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,830
I'd tell you if I could.

358
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,530
What exactly are you hiding?

359
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:45,510
Seems that you don't think
I'm someone trustworthy.

360
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,430
Brother Feng, I'd tell you everything
one day.

361
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,830
Trust me on that.

362
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,230
Are you okay?

363
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,450
Thank you for coming to my aid,
Mr. Le Xuan.

364
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,130
I didn't come to your aid.

365
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,770
I came to save your life.

366
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,250
What? You still don't trust me?

367
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,410
Why did you stop me from going to Mr. Li?

368
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,870
The Student Council punished
a rule-breaking scholar.

369
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,870
They are given the authority
by the school.

370
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,210
Mr. Li would not want to get involved.

371
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,970
But if he's the one
to mete out punishment,

372
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,920
your life really would be at stake.

373
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,650
What do you mean?

374
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,920
A painful solution.
Your derriere would be whipped open.

375
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,320
Luckily, Lu Zhao Rong told me in time.

376
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
Otherwise,

377
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:33,770
Brother Cheng Jun,

378
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:36,290
your good intention
would've caused more harm.

379
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,330
Wen Bin.

380
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,420
You have to be more careful
from now on.

381
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,950
You can't break any more rules.

382
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,620
There's that.

383
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,130
I shall take my leave.

384
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,850
After that incident, it's likely
that Wen Bin will...

385
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,590
have an even worse time.

386
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,750
That was obviously personal.

387
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,960
The president couldn't win
Ms. Mu's heart,

388
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,140
so he took it out on Wen Bin.

389
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,780
-Watch what you say.
-Despicable!

390
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,740
Keep it down.

391
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,590
You'd be marked too
if the president heard you.

392
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,650
The president seems to be almighty.

393
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,370
He can punish whoever he wants.

394
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,030
Isn't that scary?

395
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,900
That's abuse of power.

396
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,110
He will be punished by the heavens.

397
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,070
That's enough, guys.

398
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,310
The president...

399
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,710
He's just...

400
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,200
Mo Xiao Huan, Lu Zhao Rong.

401
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,390
President wants to see you.

402
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,190
What does President want?

403
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,070
Why is a repeat student feeling scared?

404
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,180
I'm not scared.

405
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,330
I'll back you up. Come.

406
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,490
Sure, you're my firepower!

407
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,600
-Come on.
-Let's go.

408
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,000
They're in trouble.

409
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,070
Brother Cheng Jun.

410
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,080
Bad news. Lu Zhao Rong and Mo Xiao huan
were summoned by President.

411
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,710
President?

412
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,490
Why did he summon them?

413
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,910
Because of Wen Bin of course.

414
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:03,030
President found out that Lu Zhao Rong
secretly informed you.

415
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,590
Mo Xiao Huan helped you save Wen Bin
in front of everyone.

416
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,270
They can't tell right from wrong.

417
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,410
They must be in trouble.
I'm going to them.

418
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,500
-No, don't.
-Wen Bin.

419
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,660
You can't go.

420
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,950
President is still mad at you.

421
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,700
-He might find an excuse to torment you.
-Yes.

422
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,220
They're in trouble because of me.

423
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,940
Brother Bin.

424
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,990
This is no longer about just you.

425
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:30,870
Lu Zhao Rong.

426
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,760
President.

427
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,390
As a member of the Student Council,

428
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,400
you've defended Wen Bin against my rulings
time and time again.

429
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,910
Is Wen Bin that deserving
of your admiration?

430
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,600
-No, I...
-Wen Bin fully deserves our admiration.

431
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,660
Shut your mouth.
It's not your turn to talk.

432
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,610
Yes, okay.

433
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,700
No problem.

434
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,020
Don't talk so much.

435
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,050
Keep quiet.

436
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,050
See, President.

437
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,400
Choosing to punish Wen Bin like that,
who's a frail kid,

438
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,220
might backfire on the Student Council...

439
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,050
if anything bad happened to him.

440
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,130
Don't you think so?

441
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,070
So you’re saying...

442
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,490
you did it for my sake?

443
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,390
Yes.

444
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,030
I should thank you then.

445
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,370
No, you don't have to.

446
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,910
As per the Student Council's decision,

447
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,990
for disclosing the council's
classified information,

448
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,990
Lu Zhao Rong will admit his wrongdoing
before the whole school.

449
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:17,490
President.

450
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,060
Please reconsider, President.

451
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,700
Apologise in front of the whole school?

452
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,070
That's the biggest blemish
a Yun Shang scholar could have.

453
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,390
I've been a part of the council
for so long.

454
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,570
Even if I didn't accomplish much,
I served hard.

455
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,630
Please reconsider.

456
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,350
It'd ruin my chance at the imperial exam.

457
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,230
That would depend
on your future performance.

458
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,440
Why are you cowering?

459
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,340
We should learn from Wen Bin.

460
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,380
Don't ever submit
to a selfish coward like him!

461
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,940
Who is the selfish coward?

462
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,010
You!

463
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,650
-Shut it!
-Thirty beatings!

464
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,190
-Thirty points off nobility marks.
-Hey!

465
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,900
-No, don't!
-What are you doing?

466
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,090
Help!

467
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,040
Stop hitting him!

468
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,700
-Let's talk it through.
-Help!

469
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,910
-President.
-Stop it!

470
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,150
-Help me!
-President!

471
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,430
What's going on?

472
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,870
-Principal Feng is here.
-Help!

473
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,950
Principal Feng.

474
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:07,880
Principal Feng!

475
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:09,770
Look!

476
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,700
My grandpa would be heartbroken.

477
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,290
Alright, now.

478
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,570
Your hand is all swollen.

479
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,470
It is!

480
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,380
I said keep quiet.

481
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,200
How will he hold the pen?

482
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,080
Principal Feng.

483
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,460
He broke the rules...

484
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,990
and refused to admit his wrong.

485
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,930
More like you abused your power
for personal agenda.

486
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:29,990
Feng Cheng Jun.

487
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,180
Time and time again,

488
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,050
you had challenged the Student Council.

489
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,250
We have yet to decide
what to do with you.

490
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,910
Now, you're challenging authority again.

491
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,570
I will not go easy on you.

492
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,830
Is Cheng Jun going to be punished too?

493
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,870
Principal Feng.

494
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,590
Nothing can be accomplished
without standards.

495
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:48,670
Yes.

496
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,980
We do need standards.

497
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,680
But for this matter,

498
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,340
shouldn't it be deliberated further?

499
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,350
Principal Feng.

500
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,340
The president's decision is not
representative of the scholars' interest.

501
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,810
This contains the signatures of
Yang Yi De, Wen Zi Feng and Wei Zhao Hui.

502
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:17,630
Looks like many scholars are unhappy
with the Student Council.

503
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,710
Feng Cheng Jun.

504
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,070
You didn't waste any time
gathering up the scholars...

505
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,510
to challenge the Council.

506
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,100
How devious of you.

507
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,070
Come.

508
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,750
Let me talk to you two.

509
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,550
Don't you start!

510
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,710
Regarding this matter...

511
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,380
I've discussed it with Mr. Li
and Mr. Ding.

512
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,650
The fact is, there are some students
who have qualms...

513
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,170
about the Student Council.

514
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,780
If this continues,

515
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,960
it will negatively impact
the academic atmosphere at Yun Shang.

516
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,320
The rules you speak of are important.

517
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,910
The changes Cheng Jun suggested
are also timely.

518
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:04,610
What about this?

519
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,160
We will organise a policy forum tonight.

520
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,860
The scholar representatives
will vote for what they want.

521
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,320
-But...
-That student, Lu...

522
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,960
Here, Zhao Rong.

523
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,000
Yes, the punishment
for him and Mo Xiao Huan...

524
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,690
will be revoked.

525
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,560
-Thank you, Principal Feng!
-Thank you, Principal!

526
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,440
That's all.

527
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,840
Principal Feng...

528
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,960
It's settled.

529
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
I dare you to hit me again.

530
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,740
-Principal Feng!
-Get lost!

531
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,040
Principal Feng!

532
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,700
What is a policy forum?

533
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,960
Let me summarise.

534
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,520
Going through the Yunzhou Minutes,

535
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,540
many scholars do not fully agree
with Yun Shang Academy's rules.

536
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,080
For the sake of fairness,

537
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,930
a policy forum will be organised.

538
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,310
The challengers and defenders
will have an academic debate.

539
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,210
Then, scholar representatives
will cast their votes...

540
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,330
based on their arguments...

541
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,350
to decide whether or not
to amend the rules.

542
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,020
Finally, the forum records
will be submitted to Master Wang.

543
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,540
Good, we must make good use
of this opportunity.

544
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,510
We cannot let the Student Council
abuse their power.

545
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,600
Looks like collecting so many
scholars' signatures worked.

546
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,300
I'm here, President.
What can I do for you?

547
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,860
Get prepared.

548
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,660
You'll join me
at the policy forum tonight.

549
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,080
Me?

550
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:56,490
Why?

551
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,320
You don't want to?

552
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,550
It's a rare chance to show off.

553
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,120
It's my honor.

554
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,050
Good.

555
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,740
We'll be competing with Feng Cheng Jun.

556
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,760
It all comes down to that mouth of yours.

557
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,680
You can only win.

558
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,520
I won't accept failure.

559
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,020
I will do my best.

560
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,120
Who are we sending to do the debate?

561
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,510
Isn't that obvious?

562
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,560
Brother Cheng Jun.

563
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,600
Please do it.

564
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,880
-Please do it, Brother Cheng Jun.
-Please.

565
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,810
This happened because of me.

566
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I'll take part too.

567
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,690
The Student Council's actions
are not supported by the majority.

568
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:46,410
Thus, we suggest the council's
authority to punish be rescinded.

569
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,250
Are you saying to abolish
the Student Council?

570
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,130
No.

571
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,370
I mean, the Council can carry out
its role as supervisors.

572
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:59,270
Are you trying to overturn the rules
set by our predecessors?

573
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,180
Times have changed.

574
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,070
Why hold on to things that don't work?

575
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,510
Nothing can be accomplished
without standards.

576
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,640
You people are blatantly
rejecting authority.

577
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,320
Isn't it because you have things to hide?

578
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,000
Don't try to be opportunistic
and amend age-old rules.

579
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,280
Heed my advice.

580
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,680
It's better to follow the rules
and live honestly.

581
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,940
President is wise!

582
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,050
Yes, we should follow rules
that are beneficial.

583
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,160
But presently, the Council's rules have
failed to create a conducive atmosphere.

584
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,100
There are no priorities,
no clear rights, anything goes.

585
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,920
That's pedantic and misdirection.

586
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,200
Brother Cheng Jun is right.

587
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,860
-Yes!
-That's right.

588
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,540
That's funny, Brother Cheng Jun.

589
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,390
The rules were set by predecessors
over 20 years ago.

590
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:58,810
They helped countless scholars
build a life of virtue and wisdom.

591
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,420
Without rules,

592
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,210
it's like a road with no direction.

593
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,680
The Council's original goal is for
the good of everyone, is it not?

594
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,440
Xun Zi said,

595
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,670
"The fair folks are at no fault,
the biased are the ones in the dark."

596
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:13,150
The Council was set up
not to bind us in a cage...

597
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,870
at the mercy of selfish agenda.

598
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,050
-Yes.
-That's right.

599
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,680
Why isn't anyone talking?

600
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:32,010
Let's hear from you, Mr. Li.

601
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:34,540
Feng Cheng Jun.

602
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,240
According to you,

603
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,380
the school rules are unfair and unjust?

604
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,910
I didn't ask you to say that.

605
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,340
I believe that if anyone breaks the rules,

606
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,970
the punishment should be meted out
on a case by case basis.

607
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,210
It shouldn't be one-size-fits-all.

608
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,530
I think you're the one with an agenda.

609
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:53,120
You're trying to amend the rules
for the sole benefit of Wen Bin.

610
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,280
I believe that good rules beget obedience.

611
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,640
While bad rules beget submission.

612
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,040
Feng Cheng Jun!

613
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,240
You better be sure whether or not...

614
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,360
you have what it takes
to challenge the rules.

615
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,280
You need to walk the talk.

616
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,600
Wen Bin.

617
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,760
You broke the rules numerous times...

618
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,600
and the Council punished you accordingly.

619
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,030
Did you not deserve it?

620
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,360
Answer frankly.

621
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:19,370
I did.

622
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,170
Feng Cheng Jun.

623
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,580
You heard that.

624
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,870
He deserved it,
but have you all ever wondered...

625
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,800
He comes from a poor family.

626
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,820
Without interfering with his studies,

627
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:34,110
he works hard to help his family
but was punished for it.

628
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,090
Is that reasonable?

629
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,430
-No...
-We are from all walks of life.

630
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,750
Our circumstances differ.

631
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,560
Hence, it's difficult to obey
the current school rules.

632
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,870
-Yes.
-That's right.

633
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,060
Brother Cheng Jun is right.

634
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,550
I agree it's time to amend the rules.

635
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,480
-Agreed.
-It's time for a change.

636
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,360
-Amend it.
-Yes.

637
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,320
-It's necessary.
-Yes.

638
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,480
My wish is to be able...

639
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,080
to go back more often
to visit my ailing parents.

640
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,170
The main goal of Yun Shang is to nurture
future officials.

641
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,980
The rest are secondary.

642
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,250
I agree with Yu Le Xuan.

643
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,450
I think...

644
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,410
that becoming officials
isn't the only end goal.

645
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,710
Each has their own ambition.

646
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,940
Even if Yun Shang scholars
do not become officials,

647
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,390
they are equipped with the knowledge
to give back to the people.

648
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,870
Each has their own ambition?

649
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:20,750
Of course.

650
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:21,980
Principal Feng,

651
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,570
I have no interest
in becoming an official.

652
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,960
Nonsense!

653
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,960
Why did you come to Yun Shang then?

654
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,910
I came to study the Book of Changes.

655
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,420
Learning the secrets of heaven
and earth and everything in between.

656
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,230
And then share my knowledge with all.

657
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,960
Oh dear.

658
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,180
That boy's lost his mind.

659
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,960
I, too, am not interested.

660
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,980
Another one lost his mind.

661
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,920
My reason for coming here...

662
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,750
is to befriend someone like Wen Bin,

663
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,320
who shares similar dreams and ideas.

664
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,720
With that, in the long arduous road ahead,

665
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,440
I won't have to walk it alone.

666
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,590
Makes sense.

667
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,770
What Brother Cheng Jun said
touched me deeply.

668
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,020
My dream is to become a painter.

669
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,590
I will paint stories of the heart
and the beauty of the world.

670
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,170
-That's great.
-Very good.

671
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,920
To be honest,

672
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,850
if my father hadn't pushed me,

673
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,000
I would be a merchant out there
doing business.

674
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:13,010
I'd like to ask Brother Cheng Jun.

675
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,300
How should the school
keep scholars in check then?

676
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,180
Get rid of unhelpful punishment.

677
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,470
It's time for a change.

678
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,290
Teach students according
to their aptitude.

679
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,060
What Brother Cheng Jun said
is excellent.

680
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,720
-Yes.
-I feel like I should clap for him.

681
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,140
Yes, I can totally relate
with Brother Cheng Jun.

682
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,410
-Me too.
-Who doesn't?

683
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:31,290
Me too.

684
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,940
That's right.

685
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,440
Show yourself.

686
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,810
You're surrounded.

687
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,750
Catch him alive!

688
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,080
After him!

689
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,389
Feng Cheng Jun not only wants
to amend the rules,

690
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:53,030
but also change the school's
academic system.

691
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:55,320
That's utter nonsense!

692
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,980
What's beneficial for scholars
benefits future pillars.

693
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,220
It's good for the country.

694
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,220
What's wrong with that?

695
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,580
Feng Cheng Jun is very brave
to utter those words.

696
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,620
Feng Cheng Jun.

697
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,470
Do you have more details to add?

698
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,450
The school appointed scholars
to run the Student Council.

699
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,120
Because you believe in equality
and scholars' self-assessment.

700
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,240
I think, if that's the case,

701
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,240
nobles and commoners,
men and women...

702
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,370
should all have access to education.

703
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,410
Ridiculous!

704
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,930
Now you want women to study?

705
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,570
You're insulting the academy.

706
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,050
-Wishful thinking!
-Tell me, President.

707
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:33,400
Both men and women live on this earth.

708
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,640
Why should we be born different?

709
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,600
One can know more or less,
but humans start out the same.

710
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,190
Putting it simply, do you all...

711
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,030
want your future wives
to be knowledgable...

712
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,390
or clueless and dumb?

713
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,330
He went too far.

714
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,610
What Wen Bin just said...

715
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:46,250
Do not record it.

716
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,590
Principal Feng.

717
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,440
The scholars are debating.

718
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,160
We should let them do it freely.

719
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,110
Only then will it be meaningful
and worth pondering over.

720
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,070
Master Wang won't reprimand you for it.

721
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,470
Can we really do that?

722
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,480
If you don't put what Wen Bin said
on record,

723
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,160
that's just deceiving others.

724
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,550
Fine, record it.

725
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,820
What Wen Bin said is reasonable.

726
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,380
My grandmother had wanted
to study since young.

727
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,310
If my grandmother had gone to school,

728
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,880
perhaps my father would've achieved
something greater.

729
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:18,540
If they had used
aptitude-based teaching sooner,

730
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,950
Brother Zi Feng and I
wouldn't still be sitting for exams.

731
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,860
Thinking about it makes me bitter.

732
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,170
We all want a set of rules...

733
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,090
that we are proud to adhere to.

734
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,600
Rules that help us
become useful citizens,

735
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:32,290
to repay our teachers and country
for guiding us.

736
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,990
That is also the original intention
and objective of a scholar.

737
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,780
Do not let yourself, your family
and your country down.

738
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,280
-That's right!
-You said it well!

739
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,160
-Very good!
-You said it well.

740
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,040
Indeed!

741
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,810
Good job!

742
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,260
He's right.

743
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,160
-It makes total sense.
-Yes.

744
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:55,620
Stop!

745
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,120
Stop!

746
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,370
-Stop!
-Quick!

747
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,900
Look, sir.

748
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,860
Follow him.

749
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,050
Stop right there.
