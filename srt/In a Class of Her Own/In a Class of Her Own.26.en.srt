[Episode 26]

4
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,480
Junior.

5
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:44,400
[A young and pretty lady.]

6
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,479
[Why do you like these things?
You're like a girl.]

7
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,360
[Brother Ze Xin, you're no fun.]

8
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,880
[Brother Ze Xin, do me the favour please.]

9
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,760
Junior.

10
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,320
Well...

11
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,310
Junior, don't get the wrong idea.

12
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,840
I planned to use rescue breathing on you.

13
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,190
Fortunately, you woke up in time.

14
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,730
Or it'd be awkward
since both of us are men.

15
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,660
Well...

16
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,800
Luckily, I regained consciousness.

17
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,360
You scared me to death.

18
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,800
You saved me again.

19
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,500
Thank you very much.

20
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,810
Forget it.

21
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,960
Find a place where you can get changed.

22
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,070
But where are the thugs?

23
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:34,740
I finished them off.

24
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,000
Awesome.

25
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,760
Are you all right?

26
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,829
Hey,

27
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,670
I'm still having panic fear
thinking about it.

28
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,079
If something happened to you,

29
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,600
what should I say to them?

30
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,080
Don't do this anymore.

31
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,310
I know you're very nice to me.

32
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,260
It... it's cold here.

33
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,320
Let's get out of here.

34
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,640
Let's go.

35
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,750
Come on.

36
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,320
The Lingzhi powder
isn't among these goods.

37
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,330
Looks like they have other warehouses.

38
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,280
Also,

39
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,330
Head General Gu...

40
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,490
and Lord Tian rushed here in time.

41
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,370
Someone must have informed them.

42
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,450
I don't care where they're hiding it.

43
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,010
We must find it.

44
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:45,970
We sure will.

45
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,860
Now we have a pair of drowned rats.

46
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,030
What happened?

47
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,170
Wen Bin fell into the water, he almost...

48
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,370
But nothing happened.
It's freezing.

49
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,660
Get us some clothes.

50
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,010
Did you fall into the water?
Are you all right?

51
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,330
I swallowed some water. That's it.

52
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,290
I found some old clothes in the warehouse.

53
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,530
Change into these.

54
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,490
Junior,

55
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,640
it's cold out here.

56
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,440
Find a cabin and get changed there.

57
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,610
Go now.

58
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,130
Where are you going?

59
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,970
To give him a hand.

60
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,409
He doesn't need help to get changed.

61
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,610
Stay here. We need to talk.

62
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,730
Why are you staring at me?

63
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,930
Are you scared?

64
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,530
Are you guilty of something?

65
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,050
You're asking for it.

66
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,800
I thought you want to talk to me.

67
00:05:58,890 --> 00:05:59,690
I forgot.

68
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,090
Mr Wen Bin, Ze Xin,

69
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,690
have some ginger soup.

70
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,690
Warm yourselves up.

71
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,090
I'll drink it.

72
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,250
Thank you, Lord Lei, for your help.

73
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,450
Mr Lei, we shall take our leave.

74
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,330
Take care.

75
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,160
What does it feel like choking on water?

76
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,770
Try it for yourself.

77
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,050
How did you save him?

78
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,290
Rescue breathing?

79
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,170
-No.
-No.

80
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,130
He's blessed.

81
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,770
He woke up before I tried to rescue him.

82
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,409
Brother Wen Bin,

83
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,570
don't be so reckless in the future.

84
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,330
Act after we've come to an arrangement.

85
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,370
Okay.

86
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,130
Do you still feel cold?

87
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,610
I can keep you warm too.

88
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,250
No need. No need.

89
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,490
Three men hugging each other
may fall down.

90
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,410
Walk properly.

91
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,210
It's been a while.

92
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,810
-Long time no see.
-Long time no see.

93
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,810
Wen Bin, it's been a long while.

94
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:15,930
I've missed you.

95
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,090
Wen Bin,

96
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,610
your clothes...

97
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,690
It's a long story.
I'll tell you later.

98
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,990
-Okay.
-Wen Bin, you have no idea...

99
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,240
how much we missed you.

100
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,330
All of you,

101
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,290
it's only been a few days. Come on.

102
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,970
Yeah, that's a little too much.

103
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,450
Although it's only been a few days,

104
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,770
the incident of theft...

105
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,610
made it feel like a long time.

106
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,570
The four of you have
made Yun Shang Academy...

107
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,090
shine even brighter.

108
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,050
Now,

109
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,010
the poor citizens have
had a change of mind...

110
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,210
-about us.
-Exactly.

111
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,730
And it's all thanks to the four of you.

112
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,610
Bring us along next time.

113
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,050
Yeah. I knew...

114
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,370
Wen Bin is the best.

115
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,650
I have a suggestion.

116
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,850
We can form groups from different dorms,

117
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,090
and go together.

118
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,400
Good idea.

119
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,530
You're our role models from now on.

120
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,410
In that case,

121
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,570
Brother Cheng Jun and Wen Bin...

122
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,050
are going to become the President.

123
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,370
I don't think there's
anything wrong about it.

124
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,170
How is Han Sheng Zhi like as President?

125
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,970
Everyone knows in their
hearts what he has done.

126
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,210
I don't know about the noble
students who live in the superior dorm.

127
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,410
But we in the regular and common dorms...

128
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,730
think that Wen Bin will
make a good school president.

129
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,320
Brother Zhao Rong's right.

130
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,530
Most of the students...

131
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,320
are actually aware of
what's happening here.

132
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,850
Take this incident for example.

133
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:39,530
The President has wronged Wen Bin.

134
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:41,450
What a disappointment.

135
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,450
Yeah, being fair matters most.

136
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,250
As that's all that counts.

137
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,010
It's true that the President
prejudiced against me.

138
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
But he's right sometimes too.

139
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,730
We shouldn't generalise.

140
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,090
Wen Bin, that's some magnanimity.

141
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,050
How admirable.

142
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,610
That's really admirable.

143
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,930
-Let's go.
-Get inside.

144
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,290
-Come on.
-Grab something to eat.

145
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,970
You never bring good news.

146
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:13,850
Get out.

147
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,810
You really... oh dear...

148
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,130
You... you can't simply
say things like this.

149
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,090
You made the President angry.

150
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,650
Go away. Hurry up.

151
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,210
Wait.

152
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,570
I finally have the money
for my parent's treatment.

153
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,130
Thank you, President, thank you.

154
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,330
Wen Bin and Feng Cheng Jun,

155
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:42,810
what did they say?

156
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,250
Well...

157
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:47,850
I...

158
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,290
You'd better tell us what they said,

159
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,650
in full detail.

160
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,290
Hurry up.

161
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,410
I... I haven't finished my story.

162
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,530
Spit it out then.

163
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,570
Then, Wen Bin...

164
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,090
Wen Bin said...

165
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,210
that compared to any of them,

166
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,810
the President is better at
handling student affairs.

167
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,410
The President's targetting him...

168
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,130
as they have personal grudges.

169
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,370
It shouldn't be discussed together.

170
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,690
And Feng Cheng Jun agreed.

171
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,010
Sheng Zhi.

172
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,410
Look, it's not that bad.

173
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,850
At least Wen Bin was being fair.

174
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,850
Exactly.

175
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,090
Fair?

176
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,330
He was just putting up a show.

177
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,290
You don't have to target them anymore.

178
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,090
We just have to...

179
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,810
keep our end up.

180
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,290
So, are you asking me...

181
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,490
to give in to Wen Bin
and Feng Cheng Jun?

182
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,690
Sheng Zhi, don't lose your cool.

183
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,050
-I mean...
-You're the one losing it!

184
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,410
Since Feng Cheng Jun and Wen Bin
entered Yun Shang Academy,

185
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,890
everything changed!

186
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,410
Didn't you notice that?

187
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,770
Are you thickhead?

188
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,930
But, well,

189
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,290
you've changed too.

190
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,930
You actually defended them.

191
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,330
Don't forget.

192
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,330
You're also part of the Han family.

193
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,050
Han Zheng Liang, my father,
as well as your uncle,

194
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,930
is the leader of the family,

195
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,650
instead of the governor, Feng Ji Chang!

196
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:35,930
In the future,

197
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,490
I'm the one who's going to
be the leader of noble families,

198
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,810
not Feng Cheng Jun.

199
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,450
Sheng Xiong,

200
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,450
our generation...

201
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,450
must do better than our old men.

202
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,570
We can't let the Han family down.

203
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,930
President, don't be angry.

204
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,050
And you.

205
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,370
Me?

206
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:21,890
I know...

207
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:23,930
that your father...

208
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,250
told you to obey my words.

209
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,450
But your heart has wavered.

210
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,570
I...

211
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,370
Zi Ming,

212
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,730
make a better judgement.

213
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,290
Think of your career
as a government official.

214
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,290
How can you walk the path?

215
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,770
You know Gu Da Chao?

216
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,690
I recognise him.

217
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,690
He is no ordinary person.

218
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,770
Miao Xiang Dong sent three
bodyguards to escort him.

219
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,090
He must be somebody.

220
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,730
I'll go find out.

221
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,330
Stop acting recklessly.

222
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,090
Or you'd alert the enemy again.

223
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:06,970
From now on,

224
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,930
we need to play safe.

225
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,570
I'm good at fishing for information.

226
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,770
You guys should sit tight...

227
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,970
and wait for my news.

228
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,920
Sure.

229
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,450
We'll wait until we hear from you.

230
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,850
It's getting late.

231
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,570
Let's get to bed. You must be tired.

232
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:28,490
Why don't the four of us
spend the night together?

233
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,690
-No.
-No!

234
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,490
What are you doing?

235
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:47,010
Mr Ding, who are you
looking for here at this hour?

236
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,370
I have something to ask Lei Ze Xin.

237
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,250
Get back to your room.

238
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,130
On the last day of martial arts practice,

239
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,930
which is the day you fought that man...

240
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,970
I've tracked down where all
teachers had been on that day.

241
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,330
I couldn't find proof...

242
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,090
that Mr Li Hu was in the school.

243
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,810
Other than that,
no one else is suspicious.

244
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,250
I have suspected him before too.

245
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,490
I even tested him.

246
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,410
But he can't fight.

247
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,040
I wonder what that person wants.

248
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,730
You have to be careful.

249
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,050
As for Mr Li Hu,

250
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,210
I'll handle it.

251
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,490
What's on your mind?
You look glum.

252
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,810
After I fell into the
water and passed out,

253
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,290
I felt like I saw you guys.

254
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,170
I feared that I'd die just like that,

255
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,450
making my mother, my sister and
everybody...

256
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,850
and you sad.

257
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,690
That's why you have to be more careful.

258
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,290
If I died today,

259
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,290
what would you do?

260
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,090
Don't say such negative things.

261
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,490
I mean, if.

262
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,250
I don't want to answer your question.

263
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,410
You have to.

264
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,610
I refuse.

265
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,400
If something bad happened to you,

266
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:45,930
I...

267
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,850
I'll take care of your
mother and sister...

268
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,010
for the rest of my life.

269
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,010
You'll take care of my sister forever?

270
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,330
Are you going to marry her?

271
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,650
Why are you...

272
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,290
How can you interpret my words like that?

273
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,250
What did you mean, then?

274
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,490
My explanation is pointless.

275
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,290
Since you want me to marry your sister,

276
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,410
I'll marry her.

277
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:23,890
I was just joking.

278
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,250
You're alive and kicking.

279
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:27,930
Let's go to sleep.

280
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,890
What's with that expression?

281
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,690
Are you all right?

282
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,490
Yeah.

283
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,970
You're weird.

284
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,370
No, I'm not.

285
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:47,850
Are you sure you're all right?

286
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,130
Yes.

287
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:28,130
Brother Ze Xin,

288
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:29,810
thanks for today.

289
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,410
No.

290
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,050
It was my fault.

291
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,210
I failed to protect you.

292
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:37,970
You've suffered.

293
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,570
Brother Ze Xin, don't say that.

294
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,530
Having faced death in the face,

295
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,330
I realised that life
and family are so precious.

296
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,290
From now on,

297
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,930
we must cherish our families.

298
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:50,770
I will.

299
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,770
Is Lord Lei your father?

300
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,690
My family has suffered
a lot of misfortunes.

301
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,210
You won't understand it.

302
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,250
You're father and son, after all.

303
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,570
I can tell that he cares about you.

304
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,130
But you seem to be
keeping him at a distance.

305
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,370
The love between
father and son is precious.

306
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,210
It's a wonderful thing to have a father.

307
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,330
My father passed away
when I was very young.

308
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,730
So, cherish your father.

309
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,250
Rest early.

310
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,610
[Brother,]

311
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,250
[your unfulfilled wish...]

312
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,090
[is being realised by a lady
step by step now.]

313
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,370
[You have to bless her.]

314
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,050
[Keep her away from harm.]

315
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,050
Why am I sleeping here?

316
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,330
We'll sleep like this from now on.

317
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,810
I thought you don't like
sleeping next to Brother Feng?

318
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,210
That was in the past.

319
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,250
Brother Ze Xin,

320
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,730
we've been sleeping
like that for half a year.

321
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,410
I can't get used to sudden changes.

322
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,810
Me, too.

323
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,050
I have been sleeping alone all this while.

324
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,570
Then, you guys moved here...

325
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,250
and forced me to sleep with you.

326
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,090
If I can live with it,

327
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,610
why can't you?

328
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,890
You'll get used to it.

329
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,490
I have the final say.

330
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,490
To take a pulse,
you need these three fingers.

331
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,610
Like this.

332
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,010
At this position.

333
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,770
-Use these three fingers.
-Lei Ze Xin came to medical class.

334
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,530
-Feel the pulse here.
-Seriously?

335
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,530
-Ze Xin?
-It's a miracle.

336
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,170
I always thought you have a good physique.

337
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,770
It's perfect for learning medicine.

338
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,450
Find yourself a seat.

339
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,330
That seat is fine too.

340
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,290
Wrong position.

341
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,170
Like this.

342
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,530
Put your fingers here.

343
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,540
Brother Ze Xin,
what's the matter with you lately?

344
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,090
You're being clingy to Brother Wen Bin.

345
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,770
Junior almost died.

346
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,970
From now on, I'll follow him
like a shadow to protect him.

347
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,570
Good job.

348
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,290
It takes a calm mind to take a pulse.

349
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,490
You can't be fidgety.

350
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,490
Let me take a look.

351
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,130
Wen Bin,

352
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,050
you have a bodyguard now?

353
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,490
You have a problem with that?

354
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,010
What's he doing?

355
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,130
Come here.

356
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,530
Gu Da Chao is Miao Xiang Dong...

357
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,530
as well as Gu Zhe Yuan's uncle.

358
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,170
While Gu Zhe Yuan...

359
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,730
is Gu Zi Ming's father.

360
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,050
So,

361
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,130
Gu Da Chao is a big shot.

362
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,570
So it seems...

363
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,230
that Gu Zhe Yuan's been covering up
Gu Da Chao and Miao Xiang Dong's crime.

364
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,120
Useless! Good-for nothing!

365
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,850
Uncle, what brings you here?

366
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,690
You know what you've done.

367
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,570
If it weren't for your negligence,

368
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,960
I wouldn't lose so many goods!

369
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,320
Uncle, please forgive me.

370
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,610
-Uncle.
-Get lost!

371
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,370
Do you even want to drag me in?

372
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:51,970
Listen,

373
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:55,010
go and take the blame now!

374
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:01,710
When I saw Gu Da Chao in the mountain,
he was holding a box.

375
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,400
That should be the Lingzhi powder.

376
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,650
Then,

377
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,010
the powder is probably
in Gu Da Chao's house.

378
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,970
His house is surrounded by high walls,

379
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,690
and strictly guarded.

380
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,330
It's almost impossible to sneak in.

381
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,610
However,

382
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,770
we may get a chance today.

383
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,690
Can't you finish your words in one go?

384
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:30,690
My bad.

385
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,850
I got thirsty from all the talking.

386
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,370
Gu Da Chao is holding
his 60th birthday celebration tonight.

387
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,760
They will be receiving a lot of visitors.

388
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,600
We can sneak in.

389
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,450
Okay, let's do it this way.

390
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,450
Brother Le Xuan, Brother Ze Xin
and I will slip in.

391
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,050
Brother Wen Bin, you wait for us outside.

392
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,290
But...

393
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,610
We'll split up when we get in.

394
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,330
If any of us finds the Lingzhi powder...

395
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,810
or evidence of Gu Da Chao's guilt,

396
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:57,770
even if we were found,

397
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,690
we can throw it over the wall.

398
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,650
Brother Wen Bin,

399
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,130
when you get the evidence,

400
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,410
go to Master Wang immediately.

401
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:04,930
Then,

402
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,210
he'll have no choice...

403
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,250
but to let us go.

404
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,370
Junior,

405
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,110
you have the hardest task.

406
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:20,330
I'm quite a famous merchant
at South Street.

407
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:23,870
I can get into Gu Da Chao's
house easily as a guest.

408
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,040
But the two of you
need to find another way.

409
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,610
What's that for?

410
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,130
We'll climb the wall.

411
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,490
Let's go to Gu Da Chao's house now.

412
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,490
You may go first.

413
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,810
I need to talk to Ze Xin privately.

414
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,850
We'll be waiting outside.

415
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:42,730
-Okay.
-Let's go.

416
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,330
What are you doing?

417
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,130
What is it?

418
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,530
How much longer are you
going to keep it from me?

419
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,250
What? What am I hiding from you?

420
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,210
I wonder what's going on in your mind.

421
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,450
Lei Ze Xin,

422
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,720
we've gone way back.

423
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,050
I can tell at a glance when you're lying.

424
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,650
I've been thinking about...

425
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,770
the scene when you were saving Wen Bin.

426
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:20,970
Rescue breathing?

427
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,610
Stop laughing.

428
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,730
He woke up before I could
give him any breath.

429
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:25,610
Is that true?

430
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,370
Of course. Why should I lie?

431
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,210
Listen, Yu Le Xuan,

432
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,330
this is not funny.

433
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:33,850
Lei Ze Xin,

434
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,640
I'll buy that.

435
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,890
But you're overprotective of Wen Bin.

436
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,770
This will arouse suspicion.

437
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,250
I...

438
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,130
Did I?

439
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,680
Suspicion on what?

440
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,530
Wen Bin is my junior.

441
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,170
Is it wrong for me to care for him?

442
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,170
Wen Bin has always carried
himself in his own manner.

443
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:57,010
He's been doing very well
since he started school.

444
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,730
Do you agree?

445
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:03,010
So, don't do unnecessary things.

446
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,610
In case it turns out to be worse.

447
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,690
Let nature take its course,

448
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:07,770
like nothing changes.

449
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,090
Fine.

450
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,290
You're saying weird things.

451
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,850
How did they find out about me?

452
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,530
All walls have ears.

453
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,010
It's just a matter of time
for them to find it out.

454
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,810
Don't worry, Uncle.

455
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,490
They've shown themselves,
but we're in the dark.

456
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,460
Since you're having a party,

457
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:44,010
let's also have a trap party.

458
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,210
It's been a while.

459
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,050
Three gifts from the Zhang's.

460
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,370
Congratulations.

461
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,450
Who may you be?

462
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,610
I'm Yu Le Xuan of Yu Le House.

463
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,890
Let me see.

464
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,050
This way please, Mr Yu.

465
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,650
I'll draw them away.

466
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,810
You play it by ear.

467
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:27,970
Be careful.

468
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,250
-Who's there? Get him!
-Stay there!

469
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,490
Happy birthday, Mr Gu.

470
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,770
Help yourselves.

471
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,250
Please entertain yourselves.

472
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,810
-Thanks, Mr Gu.
-Drink more.

473
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,330
Thanks for coming.

474
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,690
-Enjoy yourselves.
-Sure.

475
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,090
Okay.

476
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,370
-Help yourselves.
-Have fun.

477
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,490
Enjoy yourselves.

478
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:20,930
What's going on?

479
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,250
What's wrong?

480
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:23,810
Calm down.

481
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,680
My servant told me...

482
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,450
that some thieves have
broken in through my backyard.

483
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,450
That's why I notified the officials.

484
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,770
Please be seated.

485
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:38,370
The show I prepared is going to start.

486
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,050
Here, please be seated.

487
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,010
Please sit, don't stand on ceremony.

488
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,810
Come on, my lords.

489
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,130
-Mr Yu.
-Please.

490
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,370
Everybody, I would like you to meet him.

491
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,890
Mr Yu is not only good at doing business,

492
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,130
he's also a learned person.

493
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:00,730
He's a scholar at Yun Shang Academy.

494
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:01,610
I propose...

495
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,330
that we drink to Mr Yu.

496
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,770
Sure. Here you go.

497
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:07,810
Here you go.

498
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:08,850
-Here.
-Cheers.

499
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,690
Mr Yu, here, to you.

500
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,050
What a talented young man.

501
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:12,970
Mr Yu.

502
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,050
Mr Yu is really young.

503
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,210
Mr Yu, cheers.

504
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,650
Mr Yu, cheers.

505
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,050
Have a drink, Mr Yu.

506
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,050
Mr Yu, Mr Yu.

507
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,520
-Cheers.
-Here we go.

508
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,410
Halt!

509
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:00,730
Stay there!

510
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:02,570
Halt!

511
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:08,850
Run!

512
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,210
After them!

513
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:29,730
Hurry up!

514
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,010
Quick.

515
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,330
Break the door.

516
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,130
Hurry up.

517
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:45,930
Hit it harder.

518
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:06,530
Brother Wen Bin?

519
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,050
Brother Wen Bin?

520
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,090
[Search in every nook and cranny.]

521
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,800
Hurry up and hide.

522
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,090
[You two, that way.]

523
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,730
Stop staring.

524
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,210
Come on.

525
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,290
[Search carefully.]

526
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,090
[You guys, follow me.]

527
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,050
Get in.

528
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:03,810
Who's there?

529
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,170
What are you doing here sneakily?

530
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,100
Who are you calling sneaky?

531
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,010
I think you're the one with bad intention.

532
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:11,890
Cut the crap.

533
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,690
Tell us.

534
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,490
What are you doing in here for so long?

535
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:16,810
Why didn't you open the door?

536
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,090
I was getting changed.

537
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,930
Why? Should I announce that to the public?

538
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,730
Leave now or I'm going to shout.

539
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,490
I'm sorry, Miss.

540
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,530
We're after a thief.

541
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,590
I won't let you off if you
don't give me an explanation.

542
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,170
You're the leader, aren't you?

543
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,090
Take me to Mr Gu.

544
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:50,890
You can't get the thief,

545
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,410
and now you're bullying a lady.

546
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,490
I want him to do me justice.

547
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,690
Sir, let's not waste anymore time.

548
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:00,370
Let's go.

549
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,490
Stay there.

550
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,530
Come out.

551
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,890
Brother Wen Bin, you were really fierce.

552
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,970
Then stay there.

553
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,290
I want to get out,

554
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,970
but my legs are numb, I can't move.

555
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,970
Get your head out first.

556
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:30,650
Come.

557
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,330
Stay there.

558
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,530
My lord.

559
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:48,370
Where's the thief?

560
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,330
We couldn't find him.

561
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,890
No one was in the backyard?

562
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,930
There was a courtesan getting
changed in the ware room.

563
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:56,810
A courtesan?

564
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,610
I'll take a look.

565
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,490
My lord,

566
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,330
she doesn't seem decent.

567
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:03,610
Stupid.

568
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,290
Is there a decent courtesan?

569
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,530
You're right, Sir.

570
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,970
This is the Lingzhi powder
that we've been looking for.

571
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,360
[My lord, she's in this room.]

572
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,800
What should we do?

573
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:23,770
Hide.

574
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,210
We can't let them see you like this.

575
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:26,690
I have an idea.

576
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:49,650
Who's there?

577
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:50,890
This...

578
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,090
My lord.

579
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,930
It was a courtesan just now.

580
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,570
You've got some nerve,

581
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,170
for stealing here.

582
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:00,530
Lord Gu,

583
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,170
this tribute belongs to Yun Shang Academy,

584
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,970
but it was found inside
Gu Da Chao's ware room.

585
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,930
Are you sure you want to defend him?

586
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:10,409
Nonsense.

587
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,730
You must be trying to frame him.

588
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,650
Since you're a scholar
of Yun Shang Academy,

589
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,050
leave it there,

590
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,730
and I will show you leniency.

591
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,050
I'm taking it to Master Wang.

592
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,210
He'll handle this impartially.

593
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,449
Don't give me excuses.

594
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:25,730
-Guard!
-Yes, Sir.

595
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:26,690
Arrest him!

596
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,409
Go!

597
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,920
I've got the thing.

598
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:34,810
-After him.
-Halt!

599
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:08,570
Stay there.

600
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,410
You look familiar.

601
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:19,410
I'm a courtesan you invited.

602
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,930
Lower your hand.

603
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,250
Put it down!

604
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,330
You...

605
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,450
You're...

606
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,410
Be careful, Master.

607
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,370
Be careful.

608
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,610
-Master.
-Guard!

609
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:36,850
Help! Help!

610
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:37,810
Are you all right, Master?

611
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,010
Watch out.

612
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,770
-Master.
-Are you all right?

613
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:46,890
It's me.

614
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:56,690
Such unparalleled beauty.

615
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,730
This is not the time for a joke.

616
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:03,170
That's very smart of you to think of this.

617
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,330
Awesome.

618
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,010
That's for sure.

619
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:07,890
I found the powder.

620
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,770
Seriously?

621
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:10,650
Mission accomplished.

622
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,290
Give me the outerwear.

623
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:13,610
Find a chance to escape.

624
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:14,610
Hurry up.

625
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:16,850
Be careful.

626
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,610
Okay. Go now.

627
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,010
Master, there he is!

628
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,690
-Go after him now!
-Okay.

629
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:31,570
Go!

630
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,570
Did you see that lady?

631
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,410
Yeah, she's so likeable.

632
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,770
So, we've got another one.

633
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,250
Take them both to the court.

634
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:05,810
Yes, Sir.

635
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:06,970
[Hang on.]

636
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,770
One of us got away, right?

637
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,170
So, it's true.

638
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:26,330
And he had the Lingzhi powder, right?

639
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,450
You unscrupulous people.

640
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,410
How dare you hide the tribute.

641
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:35,170
Besides hiding tribute,

642
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,210
they're also going to be charged with...

643
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,250
the crime of illegal
imprisonment of scholars.

644
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,850
Oh my.
No wonder you sound so familiar.

645
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,810
Aren't you Mr Yu?

646
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,130
So, this is friendly fire.

647
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,930
We mistook our friends for the enemy.

648
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:58,050
-You're...
-You have good eyesight, Mr Gu.

649
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:58,930
Great.

650
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:00,890
Let me introduce you...

651
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,930
to my fellow classmate,

652
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:06,130
a Yun Shang scholar, Lei Ze Xin.

653
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,720
I see. I see.

654
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:14,360
I've always loved...
to be friends with scholars.

655
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:16,890
Let go of him now.

656
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,410
I'm really sorry.

657
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,850
If that's everything,

658
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:22,970
we'll get out of your hair.

659
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,570
-Yes, please.
-One moment.

660
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:28,050
Why, Lord Gu? You want to
have breakfast with us?

661
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,930
If we don't get back now,

662
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,530
will the person who got away...

663
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,290
hand the tribute straight to Master Wang?

664
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:39,650
I supposed you also want to find out...

665
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:42,690
why the tributes are here, don't you?

666
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:45,770
That's right.

667
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,170
I think there's a need...

668
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,170
to give both of you...

669
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,410
a nice explanation.

670
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,570
I rented the ware room in the backyard...

671
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:58,330
to my nephew,
Miao Xiang Dong to do business.

672
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,050
Little did I know...

673
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,970
that he'd be doing such a thing.

674
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,730
It's my fault for not educating him well.

675
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,890
Don't worry.

676
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,610
I'll be stricter with him.

677
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:12,530
I definitely will.

678
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,850
So, misters,
