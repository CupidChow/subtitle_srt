[Episode 27]

4
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,250
Brother Feng.

5
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,130
Brother Ze Xin and Le Xuan...

6
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,210
Where are you going?

7
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,270
Nowhere...

8
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,370
We've obtained the evidence.

9
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,370
Gu Da Chao won't do anything to them.

10
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,050
That's great.

11
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,050
What's the matter?

12
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,700
Your lips are injured?

13
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,560
Not me, you're injured.

14
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,450
I'm not.

15
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,890
Rouge stained your lips.

16
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,449
Really?

17
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,490
Is there any left?

18
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,060
A little.

19
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,770
Where?

20
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,730
Here.

21
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,760
Are you two eating something secretly?

22
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,329
No, his lips are stained with rouge.

23
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,770
Rouge?

24
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,170
What is there to be shocked about?

25
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,370
Did Gu Da Chao do anything to you?

26
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,090
Those ignorant idiots!

27
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,930
Once they heard we have evidence,

28
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,450
they were scared to death.

29
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,180
They couldn't wait to chase us away.

30
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,220
Why are you standing there?

31
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,210
I'm going in for a hot cup of tea.

32
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,200
Let's go.

33
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:19,970
Let's go!

34
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,170
Beautiful, right?

35
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,170
What is?

36
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,190
I meant Wen Bin.

37
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,490
How can a man be beautiful?

38
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,970
I mean, when he was dressed as a girl.

39
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,450
Yes, he is beautiful.

40
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,079
Almost like a real girl?

41
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,920
Like fard congealed her skin is tender,

42
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,610
her fingers like soft blades of reed.

43
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,250
Like larva white her neck is slender,

44
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,010
her teeth like rows of melon seed.

45
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,960
You're smart, aren't you?

46
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,740
You've memorised the Book of Poems.

47
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,670
Of course.

48
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,410
This is learning.

49
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,370
You'll understand if you have
enough experience.

50
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,690
Brother Feng.

51
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,050
Does this paragraph...

52
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,370
reminds you of anything?

53
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,769
For example,

54
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,180
like Wen Bin turning into a fairy?

55
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,980
I'll wear it again if you like it.

56
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,250
What? Must you go to the borders
when reading Cai Wei?

57
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,370
I noticed...

58
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,090
that you've became more eloquent...

59
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,480
after disguising as a girl.

60
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,170
Uncle.

61
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,750
Don't worry.

62
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,770
We've pushed all responsibility
on Miao Xiang Tong.

63
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,960
Magistrate Tian has agreed to help.

64
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,830
But till then,

65
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,880
we can't hide things here.

66
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,420
It's gone.

67
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,600
It's gone!

68
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,560
Uncle.

69
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,000
What happened?

70
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,910
This time...

71
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,450
we might not be able to save ourselves!

72
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,610
[It's clear that...]

73
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,730
[Feng Ji Chang's name was
written in the ledger.]

74
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,660
[Feng Ji Chang]

75
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,290
[But he is Brother Feng's father.]

76
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,500
[What should I do?]

77
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,300
Why are you hugging your blanket?

78
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,650
Hurry to sleep, Brother Feng.

79
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,170
I'll make your bed.

80
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,430
Just leave it there. I'll do it myself.

81
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,530
I'll do it myself.

82
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,080
What's the matter with you two?

83
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,810
Aren't you tired with all
the work done today?

84
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,570
You guys go ahead and sleep.
I want to read.

85
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,970
You must not be pleased with my rules.

86
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,280
Why don't we do this?

87
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,460
Wen Bin.

88
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,210
You'll sleep at your usual spot.

89
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,970
If you want to stay there,
I'm sleeping first.

90
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,170
Brother Ze Xin.

91
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,200
What is it?

92
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,390
Let's sleep as it is.

93
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,960
Why all the fuss then?

94
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,060
Don't worry, we'll stay like this.

95
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,370
What is happening right now?

96
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,180
Everyone's distancing from me?

97
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,320
Then...

98
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,780
Then that'll be it.

99
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,670
Did you sprain your neck?

100
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:12,910
No.

101
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,530
You sprained your neck?

102
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,050
I'll rub it for you.

103
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,560
No need!

104
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,030
No need.

105
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,289
[Did he discover Wen Bin's identity?]

106
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,970
Why did you keep those ledgers?

107
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,690
Are you thinking of threatening
me with them?

108
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,770
My conscience is clear, Lord Han!

109
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,290
I swear!

110
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,770
I'll never betray you!

111
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,400
That ledger is merely a record...

112
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,660
of all transactions with the Gu family.

113
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,340
But I made changes.

114
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:04,210
The money I've given you are all
written under Feng Ji Chang's name.

115
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,390
That's smart.

116
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,370
But...

117
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,210
Our cronies' names...

118
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,950
are all in the records.

119
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,140
What did you say?

120
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,790
I...

121
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,590
Look at what you've done!

122
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,930
I really want to kill you!

123
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,290
Please calm down, my lord!

124
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,170
Please!

125
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,650
Please calm down!

126
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,170
My lord.

127
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,060
From what I see,

128
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,410
things might not be as serious
as you think.

129
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,880
Think about it.

130
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,210
Feng Ji Chang's name is in the ledger.

131
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,010
His son wouldn't turn him in.

132
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,290
Not mentioning wreaking havoc
around the place.

133
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,720
No matter what,

134
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,280
I'm telling you right now.

135
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,720
Hurry and recover the ledger!

136
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,370
Do you hear me?

137
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,370
- I heard you!
- If you can't recover it,

138
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,770
don't you dare come back.

139
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,700
- Yes, sir!
- If anything were to happen,

140
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,910
you'll answer to it!

141
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,010
And remember.

142
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,410
You told me that...

143
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,850
my men are recorded in the ledger too.

144
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:13,130
If anyone of them met with any problems,

145
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,810
you'll pay me back with your life!

146
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,280
You heard me?

147
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,310
Yes.

148
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,350
Get out.

149
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,280
Get out!

150
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,610
Yes, I'll do that!

151
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,820
This thing was kept in a secret drawer
in the store room?

152
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,920
Yes, Master Wang.

153
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,300
Was there anything else in
the secret drawer?

154
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,090
Master Wang.

155
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,970
I only saw this.

156
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,450
I was right about you guys.

157
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,550
Now that you've found the Lingzhi powder,

158
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,720
you'll have to focus on your studies now.

159
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,260
I'm waiting to see how you'll perform in
the imperial examination.

160
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,960
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

161
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,950
No matter what it takes,

162
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,300
recover the ledger for me.

163
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,370
Yes, Father.

164
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,800
I'll get it back.

165
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,740
"There she is gathering kudzu! A day
without her is like three months."

166
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,750
"There she is gathering artemisia! A day
without her is like three seasons."

167
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,990
"There she is gathering mugwort! A day
without her is like three years."

168
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,850
How would you interpret the poem?

169
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,090
"Cai Ge is a lovelorn poem.

170
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,210
Kudzu for weaving,

171
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,370
artemisia for worshipping,

172
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,810
and mugwort for medicine.

173
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,890
What's wrong with you, Brother Feng?

174
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,510
I'm fine.

175
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,130
I'm placing the book back.

176
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,470
Help me take that book then.

177
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:49,970
Which one?

178
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:51,970
This one?

179
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,970
Feng Cheng Jun seems afraid of Wen Bin.

180
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,330
It's all because of Wen Bin
disguising as a girl.

181
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,450
Don't worry.

182
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,960
Just because of that?

183
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,870
What else did you think?

184
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,880
Rest assured.

185
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,640
He'll be fine after a few days.

186
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,330
But...

187
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,210
Wen Bin did look stunning,

188
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,850
like a fairy's manifestation.

189
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,740
Such a pity that you didn't see it.

190
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,330
Only Feng Cheng Jun and I saw him.

191
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,330
What a pity.

192
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,490
Stop your nonsense.

193
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,470
So Lei Ze Xin has things that he
won't comment on?

194
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,710
Interesting.

195
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,370
What about this?

196
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,290
Why don't you ask Wen Bin out...

197
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,090
and make things clear with him...

198
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,120
if you're still worried?

199
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,950
Fussing over a small issue...

200
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,140
Brother Feng!

201
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,570
Brother Feng!

202
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,150
How do I look?

203
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,450
[Feng Ji Chang's name showed up a lot.]

204
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,010
[How can someone as upright
as Brother Feng...]

205
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:29,250
[have such a corrupted official
who conspired...]

206
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,930
[with Gu Da Chao as his father?]

207
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,650
Wen Bin!

208
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,560
Come here!

209
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,200
Just who I wanted to see.

210
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,360
Your senior has a serious question
for you.

211
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,850
Go ahead.

212
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,810
We're brothers.

213
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,730
Why can't we be straightforward?

214
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,730
Ask him.

215
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,790
Wen Bin, do you sense something weird...

216
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,110
going on with Feng Cheng Jun these days?

217
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,440
You guys think so too?

218
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,000
Did he say anything?

219
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,070
He's not talking to me.

220
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,410
What's with Brother Feng?

221
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,170
Why can't he be straight with us?
He's acting like a girl.

222
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,250
What do you think?

223
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,220
I wanted to ask you that.

224
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,880
I don't know.

225
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,340
You have to ask Feng Cheng Jun.

226
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,900
Brother Bin.

227
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,210
What's the matter?

228
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,450
I'm fine.

229
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,810
Are you alright?

230
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,140
I have something urgent.

231
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,800
Urgent again?

232
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,470
You have something urgent every day.

233
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,569
Can you use a different excuse?

234
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,410
I'm tired of that already.

235
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,630
Why don't you tell me what
the urgency is about?

236
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,520
Nothing.

237
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,900
So you're hiding from me?

238
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,010
No!

239
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:24,050
You're lying!

240
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,130
Your ears turned red!

241
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,930
You have to come clean with me today.

242
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,210
Come clean for what?

243
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,770
Brother Ze Xin, Le Xuan and I.

244
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,130
We've noticed your change.

245
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,170
It's getting serious and you
can't run from it.

246
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,690
Hurry and tell me.

247
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,610
I...

248
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,810
Why are you smiling? Speak!

249
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,960
It's my own problem.

250
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,410
I saw your disguise as a female
entertainer that day.

251
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,760
I can't get rid of your feminine look
from my mind.

252
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,400
It's all my problem.

253
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,690
I'll sort it out.

254
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,410
[So that's what happened.]

255
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,050
[That's troublesome.]

256
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,960
Did I scare you?

257
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,980
Yes.

258
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,830
Why?

259
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,710
You were too beautiful.

260
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,760
Really?

261
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,640
I'm sorry to use the word
beautiful to a man.

262
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,860
That's right. I'm a man.

263
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,040
I feel better telling you now.

264
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,970
Don't worry, Wen Bin.

265
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,850
I'll never like you.

266
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,840
What are you talking about?

267
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,330
Didn't you say...

268
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,810
you have a twin sister?

269
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,170
-Yes.
-She looks just like you?

270
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,730
What are you thinking?

271
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,010
Match me up with your sister.

272
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,130
What?

273
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,410
How dare you?

274
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,410
I knew you're up to no good.

275
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:27,320
My unmarried sister is your cure now?

276
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,570
That's not what I mean.
I just thought...

277
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,480
Never mind.

278
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,770
It's my problem.

279
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,050
Forget what I said.

280
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,210
The famous Feng Cheng Jun also
backs out of his words.

281
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,530
Then... What do you want me to do?

282
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,530
Look at you stuttering like that.

283
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,010
You have a guilty conscience.

284
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,010
You two-faced jerk!

285
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,240
I was wrong about you!

286
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,770
So embarrassing!

287
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,400
I've asked him

288
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,160
He's sick these days.

289
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,770
That's amusing. How did he get sick?

290
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:12,890
He's been sick.

291
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,090
He just hid it well.

292
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,810
What is it? We have to cure him.

293
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:16,920
No, don't.

294
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It can't be cured.

295
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,260
He's hallucinating.

296
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,530
Is Wen Bin saying that I'm hallucinating?

297
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,570
Feng Cheng Jun is the one hallucinating.

298
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:30,950
I told you.

299
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,850
Feng Cheng Jun became like this since
he saw Wen Bin's disguise.

300
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,050
But you didn't believe me.

301
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,930
So it's fine now?

302
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,210
Only heaven would know.

303
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,940
[Why did I tell Wen Bin that?]

304
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,290
[That was rude of me.]

305
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,730
[Bath Hall]

306
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,330
What?

307
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,970
Does the Bath Hall look good to you?

308
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,010
Not bad.

309
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,210
Then I'll have a look too.

310
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,850
-Don't move!
-Sir!

311
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,660
So you like peeping at others?

312
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:37,690
No, I don't!

313
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,130
-Are you out of your mind?
-No.

314
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,410
Come with me to the Interrogation Hall.

315
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,980
-Come this way.
-Wait!

316
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,520
-Wait...
-I see you need a lesson.

317
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,920
-Let's go!
-I'm innocent!

318
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,210
-Come on!
-It hurts, sir!

319
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,370
-Come here.
-Ouch! Please be gentle, sir!

320
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,370
Here.

321
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,210
So?

322
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,730
Do you want to be honest with me?

323
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:59,930
Or do you need a flogging?

324
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,570
Honest about what?

325
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,690
I... I did nothing.

326
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,970
Let's flog you then.

327
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,010
No! I didn't peep at them bathing!

328
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,090
I was just...

329
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,550
tired from all the studying.

330
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,690
I wanted to take a break.

331
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,650
By watching your classmates bath?

332
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,850
Was stealing Lingzhi powder also
taking a break?

333
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:20,930
I'm innocent, sir.

334
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,810
I didn't do that!

335
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,530
The day before the powder was stolen,

336
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,930
I saw you passing through Fu Ze Hall
with my own eyes.

337
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,570
We'll sort out all your old and new
misdemeanours today.

338
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,530
It's the President!

339
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,210
I mean...

340
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,690
President asked me to keep an eye
on Feng Cheng Jun.

341
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,410
What are you talking about?

342
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,290
Why is Han Sheng Zhi monitoring
Feng Cheng Jun?

343
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,650
I'm just running his errand.

344
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,770
I don't know his exact motives.

345
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:54,480
He said he's looking for a ledger.

346
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,680
Sir,

347
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,590
you didn't hear this from me.

348
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,090
Search!

349
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,090
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

350
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
[Market]

351
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,970
[Why is there another man in black?]

352
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,050
No clues at all?

353
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,090
No.

354
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:14,250
There's nothing wrong with Feng Cheng Jun.

355
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,850
How can that be?

356
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,900
His father received the highest amount
of bribes in the ledger.

357
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,130
He wouldn't be so calm
if he knows about it.

358
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,320
Could it be...

359
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,000
that he doesn't know about the ledger at all?

360
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,080
President.

361
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,920
Wen Bin has been at the library
all this while.

362
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,990
And he's looking into the
State Code of Yun.

363
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,490
The State Code of Yun?

364
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,890
It records every name and title of
Yun officials.

365
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,740
Wen Bin must be using it as reference
for the ledger.

366
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,610
The ledger is with him.

367
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,370
[This is a bribery record indeed.]

368
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,050
Wen Bin!

369
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,090
What are you hiding?

370
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,420
Take it out.

371
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,740
What is it?

372
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,340
Stop your pretense.

373
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,740
A banned book.

374
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,630
I heard you kept a banned book with you.

375
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,210
As the president,

376
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,990
I have the duty to check.

377
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,020
You better hand it over.

378
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,460
Don't blame us if you don't give it up.

379
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:26,910
I don't have it.

380
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,330
I can hear you guys squabbling from
all the way outside.

381
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,450
What happened?

382
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,200
-Mr. Li.
-Mr. Li.

383
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,280
Mr. Li.

384
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,410
I heard that Wen Bin had a banned book
in his possession.

385
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,410
So I came to check.

386
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,960
Alright, I know.

387
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,130
You all can leave.
I'll have a look myself.

388
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,720
This...

389
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,480
If you think you have enough nobility
marks or you don't want to get flogged,

390
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,170
-Alright, alright!
-then leave.

391
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,750
[In office]
[Out from office]

392
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,850
[Why is his record before entering
the academy empty?]

393
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,320
[Yun Shang Academy, Li Hu's Testimonial]

394
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,130
Wen Bin!

395
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,920
Wen Bin.

396
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,060
How many times have I told you?

397
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,360
Don't cause disturbance
inside the library.

398
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,070
Alright, hurry back.

399
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,680
Let's go.

400
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,760
Yes, sir.

401
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,080
[The State Code of Yun]

402
00:26:59,030 --> 00:26:59,950
I...

403
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,640
I'll kill you!

404
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,170
Wen Bin.

405
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,090
What does Han Sheng Zhi and
those guys want from you?

406
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,420
Don't keep everything to yourself.

407
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,700
I'm here for you.

408
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,130
One more thing.

409
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,560
Why is everyone after
that booklet of yours?

410
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,600
What is it?

411
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,170
I found this at the place where the
Lingzhi powder was hidden.

412
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,050
Let's go.

413
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,290
Such important evidence should be
presented to Master Wang.

414
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,370
Let him decide.

415
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,130
What if it's a fake ledger?

416
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:16,770
Maybe Gu Da Chao placed it there to
set Brother Feng's father up?

417
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,010
A good man would be implicated.

418
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,510
Feng Ji Chang is not a good man.

419
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,240
I don't think Brother Feng's
father is corrupted.

420
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,440
All those aristocrats are not kind people.

421
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,410
Feng Ji Chang is their leader.

422
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,610
How can he be innocent?

423
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,490
Brother,

424
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,330
don't say that without evidence.

425
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,390
Evidence?

426
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,890
Back then, my brother and his mentor tried
to improve our country's education system.

427
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:40,790
Feng Ji Chang came to my house and forced
my father to break ties with my brother.

428
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,950
[Have you severed ties with Lei Ze Xun?]

429
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:51,690
[My lord.]

430
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,330
[I've obeyed your command...]

431
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:58,530
[and broke ties with that
unfilial son of mine.]

432
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,340
[I beg for your understanding, my lord.]

433
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,190
[Stand up to talk.]

434
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,970
[I hope you're telling me the truth.]

435
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,660
[Lei Qi Ying.]

436
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,380
[This is for your family's own good.]

437
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,480
[You must take a stand.]

438
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,410
[Though Lei Ze Xun has been executed,]

439
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,620
[you must not act recklessly.]

440
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,320
[You can't place his memorial tablet in
your ancestral hall.]

441
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,260
[You're the one who killed my brother.]

442
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,980
They murdered my brother after that.

443
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,530
Then my mother passed away due to grief.

444
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,860
I hate myself for being young back then.

445
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,190
I never thought you have such a sad past.

446
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,970
No wonder you're always picking
on Brother Feng.

447
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,850
Move on, Brother.

448
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,410
Let bygones be bygones.

449
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,800
My brother is still a lone ghost.

450
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,730
How can I let it go?

451
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,960
Give it to Master Wang.

452
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,550
If we can find out the truth,

453
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,720
my brother's name may be cleared.

454
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,890
You and Brother Feng are my best friends.

455
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,650
I'll never pick any sides.

456
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,980
But that ledger is problematic.

457
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,450
I'll decide after some investigation.

458
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,610
It's my mistake.

459
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:42,890
How can you retract your piece?

460
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,370
There's no going back now.

461
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,610
Come and place it here.

462
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,920
That's right.

463
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,170
I know.

464
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,620
But...

465
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,800
If I know I made a mistake...

466
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,750
and continued with it,

467
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,910
won't I make more mistakes?

468
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,930
You're talking in riddles.

469
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
Cheng Jun.

470
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,810
Speak your mind.

471
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,690
I don't believe you would...

472
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,120
play truant just to play chess with me.

473
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,560
Father,

474
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,440
do you know Gu Da Chao?

475
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,740
What do you want to say?

476
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,600
Someone said you took his bribery.

477
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,560
Do you believe it?

478
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,600
I don't.

479
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,190
But I can't persuade them.

480
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,680
Drifting in the officialdom for so long,

481
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,160
I did commit some sins.

482
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,970
But to receive bribery?

483
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,120
I don't care for that.

484
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,130
Cheng Jun.

485
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,290
The best way to break groundless
allegations...

486
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,050
is by uncovering the truth.

487
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,570
I hope that you'll stand fair and just.

488
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,530
Don't put too much consideration.

489
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,440
Investigate thoroughly.

490
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,930
Thank you, Father.

491
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,850
I'll remember that.

492
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,200
You played well.

493
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,290
But why does your tune...

494
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,820
contain bitterness?

495
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,010
Thank you for the appraisal.

496
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,570
As the Book of Rites said,

497
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:06,170
"All modulations of sound
arise from the mind."

498
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,250
"Various affections of the mind are
produced by external things."

499
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,650
Music that can project emotions...

500
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,250
are good music.

501
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,760
You've improved greatly.

502
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:19,450
You'll graduate in no time.

503
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,730
That's undeserving of me.

504
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:26,540
You're savvy like men.

505
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,410
You have a promising future.

506
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,720
But a pity.

507
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,620
My father thinks it's worthless for
women to learn such things.

508
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,510
Even if I've mastered it,

509
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,490
I have nowhere to show it.

510
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,920
Everything will change.

511
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,300
Really?

512
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,720
Aren't you changing right now?

513
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:54,850
Xiao Qing.

514
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,320
Did anything weird happen these days?

515
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:02,490
That storyteller Mr. Qin has been
coming here these few days.

516
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,060
He said he wants to visit you.

517
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,970
But strange enough,

518
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,370
he does not listen to the songs.

519
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,620
And he kept asking strange questions.

520
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,370
He never came to see me.

521
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:15,730
He did.

522
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,090
He came for a few times,

523
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,449
but I rejected him.

524
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,630
Sister!

525
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,030
A man named Qin is asking for you.

526
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,010
Go and reject him.

527
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,530
Tell him she's busy.

528
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:29,570
Xiao Jie!

529
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:31,330
Let him in.

530
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:32,330
Alright.

531
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,040
I have been travelling outside the
country all this time.

532
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:45,050
After hearing that the ladies in
Cai Yun House are talented,

533
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,370
I decided to pay respect to everyone.

534
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:48,889
I'm honoured.

535
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:52,150
As the saying goes, it's better to
travel than to read.

536
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:54,560
Mr. Qin has travelled to various places.

537
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,520
Your talents and experiences
are unrivalled.

538
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,640
That's too modest of you, Ms. Mu.

539
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:04,700
Your surname reminds me of an old friend.

540
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,640
Please don't feel offended, Ms. Mu.

541
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,690
But you actually look like my old friend.

542
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,650
And coincidentally, his surname is Mu.

543
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,480
His name is Mu Jiang.

544
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,350
How can there be such a coincidence?

545
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:40,290
May Mr. Qin introduce us?

546
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,990
A pity.

547
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,390
He offended the nobles back then.

548
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:51,130
So his family was put onto death row.

549
00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:01,000
I'm really sorry to remind you
of a sad history.

550
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:06,140
I made some inquiries and found out
that his daughter survived the tragedy.

551
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,970
After my calculation,

552
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,280
she should be of similar age as you.

553
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,510
She's the only bloodline of my friend.

554
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,940
I can't leave her alone.

555
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:19,650
You have wide connections, Ms. Mu.

556
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,230
Do inform me if you have any
information about her.

557
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,310
Rest assured, Mr. Qin.

558
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,520
You'll find her.

559
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,690
I've checked these few men.

560
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,530
They're all corrupted.

561
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:42,810
I know about the ledger.

562
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,640
That's great.

563
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,650
We won't have to hide from you then.

564
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,350
My father is not like that.

565
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,990
Someone must have framed him!

566
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,200
Who doesn't know that Governor Feng
is an upright official?

567
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,750
That's amusing.

568
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,230
Would a corrupt official show
his true colours?

569
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:02,010
The most corrupted ones hide
themselves the best.

570
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,250
Alright, enough.

571
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,070
Do you think so too, Wen Bin?

572
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,010
Brother Feng.

573
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,090
I can understand your feelings.

574
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,130
But your identity...

575
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:16,130
may have decided that you can't
look at the matter objectively.

576
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:19,090
That's also why I kept it from you.

577
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,330
You say I'm not objective?

578
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,470
Are you?

579
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:25,350
You deem my father corrupted
based solely on that ledger?

580
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,630
Are you speaking up for your father?

581
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:41,110
He who has a mind to beat his dog
will easily find his stick.

582
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,450
That's it! Stop the quarrel.

583
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,010
I'll look into it.

584
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,360
Brother Bin.

585
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:48,690
You don't believe me?

586
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:51,520
I...

587
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,850
Principal Feng.

588
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,570
I want to ask about someone.

589
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:10,300
You've selected one so quickly?

590
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,340
It's like this.

591
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,020
I've seen Mr. Li Hu's testimonial.

592
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,140
His record before his appointment
is blank.

593
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,210
Master Wang appreciates talents.

594
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,770
All those who are well-educated...

595
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,580
can attend his interview.

596
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:30,150
Li Hu was an exception
and was recruited that way.

597
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,170
Hence the empty record.

598
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,660
I see.

599
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,100
Mr. Ding.

600
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:39,460
I wanted to say that Li Hu is not
particularly outstanding at work.

601
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,840
Besides, he's not a sociable person and
doesn't have many friends.

602
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,100
He always says,

603
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,670
"This is not logical."

604
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,250
If he's in the imperial court,

605
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,130
how will he mingle with people?

606
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,370
Am I right?

607
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,250
I'm not done yet, Mr. Ding!

608
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,330
How can you leave?

609
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,530
What attitude is that?

610
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,410
No wonder you're demoted!

611
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,390
Wen Bin.

612
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:08,930
Your letter.

613
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,720
Thank you.

614
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,520
[My student, Wen Bin. Hurry to San Shen
Temple after reading the letter.]

615
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,390
[I'm waiting for you here.]

616
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,890
[I want to discuss with you
about the ledger.]

617
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,450
[Keep our meeting a secret.]

618
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,580
[Ding Ruo Yang.]

619
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,580
Wen Bin.

620
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,520
What is your decision?

621
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,020
I'll tell you later tonight.

622
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,540
You have the ledger with you.

623
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,430
I'll have to keep you by
my side these days.

624
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,800
Lei Ze Xin.

625
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,480
Mr. Ding is asking for you.

626
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,790
[Seems like Mr. Ding distracted
Brother Ze Xin deliberately...]

627
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,530
[so I could leave.]

628
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,130
Go, Brother.

629
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,290
I'll take care of myself.

630
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,330
Don't worry.

631
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,460
You asked for me, Mr. Ding?

632
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,000
I didn't.

633
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:21,290
Who told you that?

634
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,770
Who told you Mr. Ding was looking for me?

635
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,490
Lin Bing Shen told me.

636
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,740
[Ju Xian Hall]

637
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,570
Have you seen my junior?

638
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,410
Wen Bin? Wen Bin just went out.

639
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,730
Who was with him?

640
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:48,920
He was alone.

641
00:40:58,450 --> 00:40:59,610
Mr. Ding?
