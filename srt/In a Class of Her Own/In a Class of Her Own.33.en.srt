[Episode 33]

4
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:47,960
Brother Feng.

5
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,960
Did I get drunk yesterday?

6
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,440
You were dead drunk.

7
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,160
Then...

8
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,550
Did I say something to you?

9
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,440
Did I?

10
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,110
Looks like you really don't remember...

11
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,630
anything from yesterday, Brother Wen Bin.

12
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,829
Let me tell you.

13
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,280
I've rejected Han Shu Min.

14
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,190
I will not propose to her again.

15
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,440
Why?

16
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,160
It's because I have someone else I like.

17
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,390
You know her as well.

18
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,960
Who is it?

19
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,960
You really care about who I like, huh?

20
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,630
Brother Feng, you're actually
a real womanizer.

21
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,880
You discard the old
once you have something new.

22
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,520
You're really fickle.

23
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:50,800
Well done.

24
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,190
Min'er,

25
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,830
I've chosen a few fabrics...

26
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,190
to make your dress during your wedding.

27
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,030
Come and choose.

28
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,670
Let her have a look.

29
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,040
What's wrong, my dear daughter?

30
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,510
You're unhappy?

31
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,960
Min'er,

32
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,440
what happened to you?

33
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,110
Tell me.

34
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,440
Mother...

35
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,920
Tell me.

36
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,480
I can no longer be together with Mr. Feng.

37
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,000
He told me his real thoughts yesterday.

38
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,320
He won't come and propose to me anymore.

39
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,200
What did you say?

40
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,640
Feng Cheng Jun went back on his word?

41
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,950
Is that true?

42
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,640
Tell me.

43
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,790
Who does he think I am?

44
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,080
Does he think he can just marry
my daughter when he wants to,

45
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,320
and he can choose not to marry you
just because he doesn't want to?

46
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,840
-Father.
-Young Lady.

47
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,950
-Master.
-Father, please don't blame Mr. Feng.

48
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,400
If you must blame someone,
blame me for being untalented...

49
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,440
and I am unworthy of him.

50
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,640
Has he bewitched you?

51
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,030
Why are you still defending him...

52
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,750
at this moment?

53
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,230
Enough!

54
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,320
Feng Cheng Jun.

55
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,110
Why did your family refuse to propose
to us even after such a long time?

56
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,390
So, you were toying with me.

57
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,320
Fine.

58
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,350
This doesn't concern you alone.

59
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,750
It also involves the Han family.

60
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,230
It involves our dignity...

61
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,270
and honour.

62
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,230
Min'er.

63
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,830
It'll be fine.

64
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,600
As long as I am around,

65
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,950
I won't allow anyone to bully you.

66
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,680
Master.

67
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,390
Master.

68
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,200
Young Lady.

69
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,560
It's fine.

70
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,790
Who died?

71
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,480
So many people were poisoned...

72
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,510
Just who did they offend?

73
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,760
All the people who died here...

74
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,070
had conducted business
with my uncle before.

75
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,720
Could it be that...

76
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,320
his enemies came to take revenge?

77
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,230
I believe that...

78
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,720
these murders...

79
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,400
were still conducted...

80
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,950
by the person in black,
the one who sent the leaflets.

81
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,950
I've already figured it out.

82
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,550
The murderer is the person who spread
the leaflets of the banned books.

83
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,080
The local authorities will
paste his portrait...

84
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,760
on the city gate.

85
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,040
If any of you see the murderer,

86
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,350
you must immediately report him
to the local authorities.

87
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,150
Those who reported him
will be rewarded greatly.

88
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,470
If the criminal knows...

89
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,710
and takes revenge,
his revenge will be vicious.

90
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,870
Aren't you afraid? He's too cruel.

91
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,080
-Isn't that right?
-Isn't it?

92
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,920
The murderer killed so many people
in one go.

93
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,400
He's a truly evil man.

94
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,320
Let's go and take a look
at the portrait later.

95
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,000
Greetings, Mr. Special Envoy.

96
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,480
Everyone, please raise your heads.

97
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,750
Due to the continuous murders in Yunzhou,

98
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,070
the imperial court is alarmed.

99
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,110
His Majesty gave me the title of
special envoy...

100
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,480
to investigate the case.

101
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,320
Please help me.

102
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,270
-Of course.
-Of course.

103
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,960
Commander Gu, Commander Lei,
you must increase night patrol...

104
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,350
to prevent further murders.

105
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,760
Understood.

106
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,920
Sir.

107
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,150
This killer has committed many crimes
and is very cunning.

108
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,470
I wonder...

109
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,710
if we can have the imperial army
pretend to be civilians...

110
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,030
to lower the criminal's guard.

111
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,070
This way,

112
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,350
it will be easier for us
to capture the criminal.

113
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,080
Attendant Officer Han, you're right.

114
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,760
We'll go according to your plan.

115
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,710
Next, let us further discuss...

116
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,070
our views regarding the murders.

117
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:55,000
We must bring the criminal to
justice as soon as possible.

118
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,230
Lord Feng.

119
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,270
Attendant Officer Han, please speak.

120
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,080
Stop pretending to be ignorant.

121
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,640
Are you telling me you don't know
that your son...

122
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,470
refused to propose to my daughter?

123
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,110
I only learnt of this last night as well.

124
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,920
My son is ignorant.

125
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,560
Please forgive him.

126
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,920
Feng Cheng Jun thinks of us...

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,350
as nothing by doing this!

128
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,760
Attendant Officer Han, I believe that
there is a misunderstanding...

129
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,960
between my son and your daughter.

130
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,670
When it comes to the matters
of the youngsters,

131
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,910
we shouldn't interfere too much either.

132
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,790
Let's have them think
about it carefully...

133
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,630
before we discuss this, shall we?

134
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,560
But I've already announced
our family's marriage...

135
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,470
to all the aristocratic families
in Yunzhou.

136
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,240
How am I supposed to settle this matter
before the people...

137
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,390
when you've gone back on your word
like this?

138
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,910
Attendant Officer Han,

139
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,350
the fault definitely lies in my son.

140
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,000
But while it is easy to amend
a small mistake,

141
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,270
once they get married and they find...

142
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,710
it's a mistake, it will last for life.

143
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,440
They will not be able to amend it.

144
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,960
They will be unhappy for the rest
of their lives.

145
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,200
So, the most important thing
is for them...

146
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,710
to think about this carefully
before we make a decision.

147
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,470
This is our responsibility
to the youngsters...

148
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,670
and to our families.

149
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,440
What do you say, Attendant Officer Han?

150
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,960
Lord Feng,

151
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,840
are you saying my daughter
is not worthy of your son?

152
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,560
This...

153
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,640
An apology won't resolve...

154
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,030
what your family...

155
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,590
has done to mine.

156
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,120
I have suffered such humiliation,

157
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,280
and I...

158
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,910
have remembered it here.

159
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,710
In the future,

160
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,320
I will return the favour doubly to you.

161
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,710
Attendant Officer Han!

162
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,110
Attendant Officer Han!

163
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,390
That day, I saw a person walk out of...

164
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,590
Han Zheng Liang's study.

165
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,590
Then,

166
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,400
he put on night travelling clothes.

167
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,270
Are you saying that this person...

168
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,520
is related to the chain murders recently?

169
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,830
But that person is really skilled.

170
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,790
I lost him.

171
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,320
The local authorities have already
released news.

172
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,790
They said that the person
who spread the leaflets is the murderer.

173
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,920
If we let this person continue...

174
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,240
killing the innocents wilfully,

175
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,150
I'm afraid...

176
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,000
that it will not be beneficial to
redress the injustice upon us.

177
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,710
Han Zheng Liang actually found someone
to pass as me...

178
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,880
to incriminate me.

179
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,710
I must find this person.

180
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,840
Remember to be careful.

181
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,960
Sir, this is...

182
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,080
Why are you panicking?

183
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,590
If he dies,

184
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,470
his position...

185
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,710
will be yours.

186
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,350
Thank you for helping me.

187
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,960
Tonight,

188
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,230
I have ordered
all imperial army members...

189
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,880
to pretend to be civilians.

190
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,320
They will not be holding weapons.

191
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,840
It will be easy for you to take action.

192
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,320
Once you succeed,
do not drag out the fight.

193
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,030
Retreat immediately.

194
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,270
Understood.

195
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,150
The few of you lay in ambush here.

196
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,320
The few of you...

197
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,080
help Commander Lei and guard
the entrance of South Street.

198
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,640
Those remaining,

199
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,230
patrol the area carefully.

200
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,710
Also,

201
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,470
do not cause a ruckus in this.

202
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,080
You must wait for the murderer
to show himself...

203
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,400
before you capture him.

204
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,280
-Understand?
-Understood.

205
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Quick! Protect the head general!

206
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,710
Capture them!

207
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
Fire!

208
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,280
Fire!

209
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,630
Leave first. Let me handle this.

210
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,520
No!

211
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,000
Report!

212
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,600
Reporting, Commander Lei.

213
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,990
The murderer has showed up
at South Street.

214
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,270
He injured the head general...

215
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,480
and is also severely injured.

216
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,470
He's fleeing to the forest to the south.

217
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,390
Hurry up and lead the way!

218
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,270
Understood!

219
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,390
Let's go!

220
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,280
Sir, it's over there!

221
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,320
Let's go!

222
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,600
Stop!

223
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,760
Stop!

224
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,590
I will capture the murderer myself!

225
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,470
Hold me hostage.

226
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,840
-Sir!
-Don't come here!

227
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,230
Don't move!

228
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,870
Don't move! Stay away!

229
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,080
Hurry up and leave.

230
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,110
Sir, are you alright?

231
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,080
Don't let the murderer run!

232
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,080
-After him!
-Understood!

233
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,320
-Hurry up! After him!
-Understood!

234
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,200
Hurry!

235
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,080
Stop!

236
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,640
Over there! Hurry!

237
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,840
Hurry!

238
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,030
This way.

239
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
-Hurry!
-Master...

240
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,070
-After him!
-Hide here.

241
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,560
I'll lure the soldiers away.

242
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,840
Hurry!

243
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,720
Stop!

244
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,830
-He's there! After him!
-Stop!

245
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,080
After him!

246
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,320
Stop!

247
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,230
Stop!

248
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,800
Hurry!

249
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,750
After him!

250
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,800
Reporting, Commander Lei.

251
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,830
The person in black fled into
Yun Shang Academy.

252
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,680
Go back and notify the leader.

253
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,630
Yun Shang Academy
is a holy place for learning.

254
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,710
We are not to disturb it.

255
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,230
Tell him to retreat with his people.

256
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,320
Understood.

257
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,360
Hurry!

258
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,990
Brother Cheng Jun, Wen Bin,

259
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,470
the night is great tonight.

260
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,640
It'll be a waste if you just hide
in your room.

261
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,830
Come, let's go admire the moon.

262
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,960
Where is Wen Bin?

263
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,510
Brother Wen Bin said that
the moon is beautiful tonight,

264
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,110
I think he ran off to
a quiet place...

265
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,280
to admire the moon alone.

266
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,440
I think Wen Bin has to think...

267
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,920
about a lot of things tonight.

268
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,270
But I really want to know...

269
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,920
just what sort of state
you're in right now.

270
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,840
Stop teasing me.

271
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,150
Look for him and ask...

272
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,590
whether I'm teasing you.

273
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,440
I've prepared top-class snacks.

274
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,800
Let's go. We'll talk as we eat.

275
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,840
Darn it.

276
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,470
He actually has someone he likes?

277
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,190
How could he do this?

278
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,720
Forget it.

279
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,680
This isn't the time for me
to be worried about this.

280
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,710
I have to hurry up and understand
my dad's case.

281
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,760
But how am I going to investigate it?

282
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,920
Who are you?

283
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,560
Ms. Mu?

284
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,870
You...

285
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,510
He was here just now.

286
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,680
Why did he suddenly disappear?

287
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,640
Let's go. We'll check over there.

288
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,430
Gentlemen.

289
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,840
Did you two see...

290
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,190
a person in black?

291
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,310
Let's go. We'll take a look over there.

292
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,950
Who is this?

293
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,480
This...

294
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,230
Help me. We can't let those guards
discover him.

295
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,110
Come.

296
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,510
Sirs, what was that sound just now?

297
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,640
You don't have to panic.

298
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,280
I was training there.

299
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,000
That was the sound I made
when I jumped down a tree.

300
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,470
-Mr. Liu.
-Mr. Liu.

301
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,230
By the way, I have been training here,

302
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:43,110
and I didn't notice anyone suspicious.

303
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,760
You don't need to waste your time here.

304
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,590
Hurry up and investigate somewhere else.

305
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,470
What are you two doing here?

306
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,320
We're admiring the moon.

307
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,630
Don't you think the scenery here
is very beautiful?

308
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,190
You wouldn't have chosen to
train here otherwise, right?

309
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,280
Admiring the moon?

310
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,640
You'd have to choose your time
to admire the moon as well.

311
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,950
It's already late.

312
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,110
You should go back and rest.

313
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,680
Also,

314
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,950
if you go against the academy's
work and rest schedule,

315
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,310
you will have
your nobility marks deducted.

316
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,080
We'll go back later.

317
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,800
Come.

318
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,560
Here.

319
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,230
Wait here for me.

320
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,760
I'll go and get medicine for
you from Fu Ze Hall.

321
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,800
By the way,

322
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,470
don't make a single sound.

323
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,840
Here.

324
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,160
Give me the medicine box.

325
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,040
Brother Ze Xin is the criminal
wanted by the local authorities.

326
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,070
I knew about it a long time ago.

327
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,310
Break down the door!

328
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,230
What are you doing?

329
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,950
How dare you!

330
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,550
Go!

331
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,840
Hurry up and stop them!

332
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:27,990
Don't move!

333
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,950
-Don't move!
-What do you want?

334
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,750
When you go in,

335
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,430
search every corner...

336
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,920
carefully!

337
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,830
Understood!

338
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,630
[Fu Ze Hall]

339
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,470
Attendant Officer Han, are you mad?

340
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,560
Han Zheng Liang,
you have no respect for the law.

341
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,560
You're disregarding His Majesty's orders!

342
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,510
How dare you bring soldiers to
Yun Shang Academy?

343
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,800
I'm telling you,

344
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,800
I will search through
every nook and cranny...

345
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,520
of Yun Shang Academy today.

346
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,830
You're acting really domineeringly.

347
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:08,960
Aren't you afraid...

348
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,920
of Master Wang getting angry at you?

349
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,280
What a joke.

350
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,880
I came here on Master Wang's orders
to capture the murderer.

351
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,070
I am blameless.

352
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,750
The murderer has committed heinous crimes.

353
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,190
Not only did he spread forbidden books
and opinions,

354
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,590
He even injured...

355
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,480
Head General Gu Zhe Yuan of
the imperial army.

356
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,160
How dare he did this!

357
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:36,760
Right now, the criminal is hiding
in your academy.

358
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,720
If you do not let me search through
your academy today,

359
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,830
that proves that...

360
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,560
you know the criminal is hiding
in Yun Shang Academy.

361
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,470
That is a crime punishable by death.

362
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,230
There are many students in
Yun Shang Academy.

363
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,880
How are you going to be certain
who the criminal is?

364
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,630
We have been chasing after the criminal
all this while.

365
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,350
He is injured badly.

366
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,190
We'll know who the criminal is...

367
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,350
once we investigate.

368
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,430
You don't have to hold back today.

369
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,830
Let us enjoy
this beautiful scenery tonight.

370
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,030
-Cheers.
-Cheers, President.

371
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,630
-Cheers, President.
-Cheers, President.

372
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,400
Thank you for your boundless hospitality,
President.

373
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,110
As the president,

374
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,750
I will not mention the things that
has happened before.

375
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:34,230
In truth, I should have had a gathering
with all of you.

376
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,840
That's our good President!

377
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,720
Cheers!

378
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,280
Cheers!

379
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,870
Come, taste this.

380
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,720
-Wen Bin, you're late.
-Why are you so late?

381
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,680
Where is Feng Cheng Jun?

382
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,590
Wen Bin?

383
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,710
Feng Cheng Jun isn't here?
What's going on?

384
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,160
-What is it?
-Cheers, everyone!

385
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,230
Ms. Mu is in danger.

386
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,480
I don't have time to explain to you.
Come here.

387
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,560
Let's go.

388
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,350
She's inside.

389
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,110
Xiao Man.

390
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,750
Xiao Man.

391
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,830
Xiao Man, are you alright?

392
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,520
What happened?

393
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,160
I went to Fu Ze Hall to get medicine,

394
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,160
and I saw your father searching for
the murderer with soldiers in the academy.

395
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,800
He said that the murderer...

396
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,310
has been spreading the leaflets of
the forbidden books outside.

397
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,640
He said he was chasing him,
and the murderer is injured.

398
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,270
I think he's talking about Ms. Mu.

399
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,630
[Search the place carefully!]

400
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,510
[Over there!]

401
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:31,870
Search over there!

402
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,750
Understood!

403
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,800
Send two people to investigate that place.

404
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,000
Others, follow me.

405
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,070
You're the only one who can save her now.

406
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,150
Stay here.

407
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,030
Don't make a sound.

408
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,480
How dare you!

409
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,230
Mr. Han.

410
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,990
How dare you break into Yun Shang Academy.

411
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,480
We came here on
Attendant Officer Han's orders...

412
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,640
to search for the murderer.

413
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,830
[I didn't see any murderer.]

414
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,230
But you...

415
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,110
interrupted me in my studies.

416
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,480
Sir, please calm down.

417
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,590
We will leave immediately.

418
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,400
Let's go. We'll search elsewhere.

419
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,880
But what do we do now?

420
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,280
We can hide her for now,
but we can't hide here forever.

421
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,800
With how things are now,

422
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,760
you must trust me and hand her to me.

423
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,230
You love Ms. Mu,

424
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,950
and I am naturally at ease
letting you handle matters.

425
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,920
But she's too heavily injured.

426
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,350
You have to treat her immediately.

427
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,360
Don't worry.

428
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,800
Once I get back, I will treat her.

429
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,560
Alright.

430
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,920
I'll let you take care of her.

431
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,160
Be careful.

432
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,320
Go to the garden and tell Sheng Xiong
and the rest.

433
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,480
Let them know how they should
respond to the situation.

434
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,800
Alright, then I'll leave first.

435
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:06,990
Be careful.

436
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,230
We came on Attendant Officer Han's orders
to capture a murderer.

437
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,310
I hope that you can cooperate with us.

438
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,750
Now, stand still...

439
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,870
and remove your clothes.

440
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,440
Remove your clothes. We want to check
whether you're injured.

441
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,320
This is...

442
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,390
What right do you have to do that?

443
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,800
You're already going against
His Majesty's orders...

444
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,960
by entering Yun Shang Academy.

445
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,840
How preposterous!

446
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,920
If you defy the law like this,

447
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,230
God will punish you!

448
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,440
You're humiliating us if you ask us...

449
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,720
-to remove our clothes now!
-That's right!

450
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,630
Leave the academy and let me
regain my dignity! I'm not stripping!

451
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:36,200
Leave the academy and let me
regain my dignity! I won't strip!

452
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,280
Quiet!

453
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,310
You're telling me to be quiet?

454
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,440
Who gave the right to order me?

455
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,760
I'm protesting.

456
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,560
I'm protesting against your act of
disturbing the order in the academy.

457
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
I'm protesting against
your act of humiliating the students.

458
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,200
You hit him! How could you?

459
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,150
How could you hit him?

460
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,150
You're laughing?

461
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,750
Do you think you're facing death? Guards!

462
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,440
-You hit me?
-Remove his clothes!

463
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,200
-Understood!
-You're defying the law!

464
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,600
You're defying the law!

465
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,800
How dare you!

466
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,350
-Stop!
-What are you doing?

467
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,320
You even hit me!

468
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,640
Why are you still laughing?
Hit him!

469
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,880
They're beating him! Stop!

470
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,990
-Stop hitting him!
-How could you hit him?

471
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,880
-How could you do that?
-You're seriously defying the law!

472
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,800
How could you hit him? Stop!

473
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,310
-Beat him up!
-Stop!

474
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,440
Who are you?

475
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,230
Stop!

476
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,520
Stop! After him!

477
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,040
Stop! Hurry up!

478
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,630
Stop!

479
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,110
He's over there!

480
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,150
Hurry!

481
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,710
-Stop!
-After him!

482
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,640
Stop!

483
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,080
Over here.

484
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,480
Don't run!

485
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,920
Hurry!

486
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,720
You, go over there!

487
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,630
The others, follow me!

488
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,510
Understood!

489
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,750
Brother Feng, Senior.

490
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,150
Come in.

491
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,480
Hush.

492
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,230
This is...

493
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,190
My senior is the one the imperial army
wants to capture?

494
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,510
Attendant Officer Han has already
entered the academy...

495
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,600
with the imperial army.

496
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,840
The students have been captured...

497
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,680
and they were stripped to be checked.

498
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,560
Stripped?

499
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,320
Over here! Over there! Search!

500
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,590
Understood!

501
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:22,990
What are you doing?

502
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,640
Stop!

503
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,840
-Let me go!
-That is Mr. Feng's room.

504
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,630
-What are you doing?
-Are you going to trespass it too?

505
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,680
Attendant Officer Han has ordered us
to search carefully and...

506
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,630
-not allow anyone to skip being searched.
-Yes!

507
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,990
-What should we do?
-If we don't show up,

508
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,320
the three teachers will be in danger.

509
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,200
But,

510
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,480
we can't let them discover...

511
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,200
that Ze Xin is the one hunted down...

512
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,430
for spreading the leaflets.

513
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,600
Mr. Li,

514
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,199
I didn't expect that you would be
so skilled.

515
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,230
Same to you.

516
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,190
I should go.

517
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,230
You want to pretend to be
the wanted criminal?

518
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,870
No!

519
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,040
When my senior first spread
those leaflets,

520
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,520
he did it on the night of
the admission ceremony.

521
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,350
That night, you stayed in the academy
the entire time.

522
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,949
If you act so recklessly,
you'll let the cat out of the bag.

523
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,080
I should go.

524
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:37,389
-No.
-No.

525
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,909
They will strip you to search you.

526
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,110
Let me go.

527
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,150
I'm the most suitable candidate...

528
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,199
among us.

529
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,080
No!

530
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,199
We can definitely think of a better way.

531
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,280
There's no other way.

532
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,360
There's not a moment to lose.

533
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,040
These three are definitely
the criminal's accomplices.

534
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,310
Hurry up and report to
Attendant Officer Han!

535
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,190
Understood!

536
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,190
Stop fighting!

537
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,320
The criminal you're looking for...

538
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,360
is me.

539
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,160
Capture him!

540
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,240
[Room Two of Regular Dorm]

541
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,470
Brother Feng!

542
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,710
We'll go with you!

543
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,160
Brother Wen Bin,

544
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,630
prioritize the big picture.

545
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:42,990
Take him away.

546
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,360
Thank goodness.

547
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,840
Reporting.

548
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,760
Sir, I have captured the criminal!

549
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,000
Did you make a mistake?

550
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,430
It's definitely a mistake.

551
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,760
It's you?

552
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,910
It's me.

553
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,800
Attendant Officer Han,

554
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,360
it's a misunderstanding.

555
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,000
It's definitely a misunderstanding.

556
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,240
Mr. Feng is an excellent student
and has good character.

557
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,310
There's no way that he's the person
who spread rumours...

558
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,830
and kills other people.

559
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:49,710
It's a mistake.

560
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,230
It's definitely a mistake.

561
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,000
Thank you for your undeserved kindness,
Principal Feng.

562
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,280
I will be responsible for my actions.

563
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,710
It will be fine as long as
I don't drag down the academy.

564
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,360
No, you...

565
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,640
Attendant Officer Han,

566
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,280
aside from these two books...

567
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,800
and these blood-soaked clothes,

568
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,280
I can provide you with witnesses.

569
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:08,840
Witness?

570
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,520
Who?

571
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,950
On the night of the admission ceremony,

572
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,280
I went to your manor...

573
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,600
to spread the forbidden books.

574
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,040
Gu Zi Ming and Lin Bing Shen...

575
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,150
saw me.

576
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,360
They can act as witnesses.

577
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,390
Alright.

578
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,910
Guards,

579
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,960
get Lin Bing Shen and Gu Zi Ming here.

580
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,840
Understood.

581
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,320
-Sir.
-Sir.

582
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,670
Let me ask you.

583
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,790
On the night of the admission ceremony,

584
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:46,320
did you see Feng Cheng Jun appear
at Han Manor?

585
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,030
-Did you?
-You tell him.

586
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,600
You tell him.

587
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,840
Tell me!

588
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,390
Brother Bing Shen,

589
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,600
Brother Zi Ming,

590
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,950
answer truthfully.

591
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,080
That night,

592
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,760
we did seem to have seen...

593
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,470
Brother Cheng Jun.

594
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,280
Scoundrels,

595
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:18,720
-have I taught you to betray your friends?
-No.

596
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,670
Then why did you...

597
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,000
He told me to speak!

598
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,880
I...

599
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,190
Attendant Officer Han,

600
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,240
even if Feng Cheng Jun went to
your manor that night,

601
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,950
how can you prove...

602
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,630
that he's the one who spread
the banned books?

603
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:35,750
That's right.

604
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,710
We just saw Brother Cheng Jun.

605
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,240
But we didn't see him...

606
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,800
-spread the banned books.
-Shut up!

607
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,760
What is this?

608
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:52,120
We have witnesses and proof.

609
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,520
The criminal has also admitted...

610
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,200
to his crimes.

611
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,000
What else do you have to say?

612
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,560
Guards!

613
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:04,000
Imprison the criminal...

614
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,230
and have him wait for his sentence!

615
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,390
-Yes.
-No!

616
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,880
Wait!

617
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,150
Feng Cheng Jun,

618
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,590
you broke your promise of marrying Min'er,

619
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,800
and I'm really angry with you right now.

620
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:27,150
but I'm not settling a private grudge
with you.

621
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,920
It's because you violated
the country's laws.

622
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,840
You're now a wanted criminal of
the imperial court.

623
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,150
I will not spare you.

624
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,800
This time, even Feng Ji Chang or
even Wang Hao Zhen...

625
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,710
will not be able to save you.
