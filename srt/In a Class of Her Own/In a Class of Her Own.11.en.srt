[Episode 11]

4
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,820
I can't find their records
in the Diligence Pavilion.

5
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,980
There should be no records
of them in the school, either.

6
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,850
Give me some time.

7
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,770
I'll help you gather
some information outside.

8
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,260
Could it be in the Interrogation Hall?

9
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,620
The Interrogation Hall?

10
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,210
Since they are wanted criminals,

11
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,260
they must have had violated school rules.

12
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,590
Perhaps the Interrogation Hall
has their records.

13
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,850
Smart thinking.

14
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,210
So, we'll be cleaning the
Interrogation Hall tonight.

15
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,420
Hopefully this time
we can find some useful clues.

16
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,520
Great.

17
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,130
I'll accompany you.

18
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,190
Well...

19
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,170
What is it?

20
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,730
Do you have...

21
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,820
the first two volumes of
Where Love Begins?

22
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,130
Why do you want it?

23
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,010
I want to see how Wen Bin
describes me in his novel.

24
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,930
Stop wondering.

25
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,460
You didn't appear in the two volumes.

26
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,850
I just want to see.

27
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,420
Fine.

28
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,960
Don't take them outside.

29
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,410
Read them here.

30
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,650
Fine.

31
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,540
Great.

32
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,340
Look at the two of you,

33
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,100
I didn't expect this.

34
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,750
Principal Feng, this...

35
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,920
Save the explanation.

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,100
I am confiscating them.

37
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,060
Yes, confiscate them.

38
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,709
As steward of the Student Council,

39
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,420
I have confiscated these items.

40
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,260
Good job.

41
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,260
Good job.

42
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,740
You have cleaned up
the Diligence Pavilion last night.

43
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,590
Thank you, Principal Feng.

44
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,100
We're just doing our duty.

45
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,270
The locked box in the corner
has been polished.

46
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,980
Was that your duty too?

47
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,190
Yes,

48
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,400
it's our duty.

49
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,380
Nonsense!

50
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,270
The inside of the locked box
have been wiped clean.

51
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,890
Was that also your duty?

52
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,610
Inside?

53
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,930
How did you do it?

54
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,610
I think it's our duty.

55
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,190
Is that a problem?

56
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,580
It's a big problem.

57
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,210
What was inside?

58
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,260
Two dialogue novels.

59
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,100
Did you peep?

60
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,900
-No.
-Yes.

61
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,820
That's good if you didn't.

62
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,860
Was there anybody else?

63
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,270
No,

64
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,370
only the two of us.

65
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,710
Good.

66
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,980
Many among the students...

67
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,370
are secretly reading the dialogue novel.

68
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,590
I want to investigate thoroughly...

69
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,980
before I decide...

70
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,980
whether the dialogue novel
should be allowed.

71
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,140
Before I can make that decision,

72
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,100
no one is allowed to read it.

73
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,150
Do you understand?

74
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,170
Yes.

75
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,730
Good.

76
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,560
Why didn't he ask us...

77
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,820
how we managed to clean the
inside of a locked box?

78
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,770
That's a tough question.

79
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,980
Are you able to answer?

80
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,370
That Principal Feng...

81
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,050
Still waters run deep.
He's an interesting man.

I'll massage you when we go back.

84
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,030
Of course.

85
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,800
I have been massaging you
for some time.

86
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,150
I would suggest that
you do it more often.

87
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,770
You know how to enjoy life.

88
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,030
Practice makes perfect.

00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,650

Not at all. By the way,

there is a council meeting
in two days time.

98
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,240
I'll tell them,

99
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,430
I'll return the position of
steward of Regular Dorm to you.

100
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,560
There's no need.

101
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,870
Zhao Rong, you're doing great.
You should continue.

102
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,140
I insist.

103

You two have a nice chat. See you.

[This is Wen Bin's handwriting.]

105
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,050
[I hope everything is fine at home.]

106
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,770
[How are things?]

107
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,140
[I shouldn't be writing to you...]

108
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,860
[for fear of interrupting your studies.]

109
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,270
[It's been a few days,]

110
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,300
[but I must let you know situation
at home.]

111

[Medicine is getting
expensive these days.]

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,260
[The money you've sent...]

115
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,050
[is not enough.]

116
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,020
[Because of me,]

117
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,300
[Mother has been working non-stop.]

118
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,300
[Unfortunately, she fell sick.]

119
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,100
[Despite my advice, she refuses to rest.]

120
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,740
[I'm not afraid to die.]

121
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,610
[I hope you can come home...]

122
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,020
[and persuade Mother.]

123
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,850
Little Brother,

124
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,210
what's the matter?

125
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,300
Nothing.

126
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,890
[No one can persuade Mother.]

127
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,570
[The only solution is
to send money back.]

128
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,760
Feng Cheng Jun has been working
as a scribe with you.

129
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,180
You should have earned a lot.

130
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,210
The medicine at South Street
is getting expensive.

131
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,890
The money is not enough.

132
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,470
This is tough.

133
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,130
You are a man of principle.

134
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,450
You can only work as a scribe.

135
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,210
There's little money in that.

136
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,620
I don't mean to be hard on you.

137
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,620
I shall leave you alone.

138
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,900
Wait.

139
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,570
Keep writing novels.

140
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,060
That's not against
your principle, right?

141
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,470
Writing a novel is
not stealing or robbing,

142
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,590
nor is it cheating.

143
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,030
It's good honest work.

144
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,560
It's not against my principles.

145
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,860
The school won't be open at night
for another seven days.

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,880
I can only write in school now.

147
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,860
But it's too dangerous.

148
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,070
Can't you wait for seven days?

149
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,240
Is it very urgent?

150
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,250
Yes.

151
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,920
I'm not ashamed to tell you.

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,740
I need the money to save a life.

153
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,980
It should be safe to write in Room Two
of Regular Dorm at midnight.

154
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,560
About selling the novel,

155
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,210
are you still willing to help?

156
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,240
Of course.

157
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,620
I'm not only helping.

158
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,620
I can make a lot of money.

159
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:20,060
Can you pay me in advance, then?

160
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,770
I'm willing to cut down
my share later.

161
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,050
Alright.

162
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,150
You are really something,

163
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,680
I am always on the losing end.

164
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,860
There you go.

165
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,420
Here's five hundred.

166
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,210
If you complete the
novel in seven days,

167
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,320
depending on the sales,

168
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,740
I'll split the profit with you.

169
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,880
Le Xuan, thanks for your help,

170
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,860
I'll always remember you.

171
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,420
You are welcome.

172
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,540
How should I put it?

173
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,120
Sharing is caring.

174
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,620
We huddle together for warmth.

175
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,050
Thank you.

176
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,270
Slowly.

177
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,250
Easy there.

178
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,010
Slowly.

180
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,100
Brother Wen Bin.

181
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,810
What's the matter?

182
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,740
Well,

183
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,500
his head was caught in the door.

184
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,680
Brother Xiao Huan,

185
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,570
you need to be careful.

186
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,710
No,

187
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,380
it's a figure of speech.

188
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,810
He was caned in the Interrogation Hall.

189
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,180
What did he do?

190
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,450
Where Love Begins is very...

191
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,620
Softer.

192
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,180
It is too good.

193
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,800
I wanted to copy one
for my grandfather.

194
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,540
Mr. Li Hu found out about it.

195
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,010
They caned my bottom.

196
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,040
Such serious punishment for copying?

197
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,210
Us students are not supposed
to read such improper books.

198
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,980
Even copying one is so severely punished.

199
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,710
If a student writes one,

200
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,710
it'll be death penalty.

201
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,920
Surely you jest.

202
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,130
No student would dare write one.

203
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,450
Let's go.

204
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,890
Goodbye.

205
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,470
How many strokes did you get?

206
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,860
I can't remember.

207
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,810
Both of you are very energetic.

208
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,420
But your actions...

209
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,830
don't make sense.

210
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,390
Don't make fun of us, Mr. Li Hu.

211
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,200
Providing a clean working
environment for the teachers...

212
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,940
is our duty.

213
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,300
Use your time wisely.

214
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,320
Learn the things that you need to learn.

215
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,180
That's your duty.

216
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,740
You are right, Mr. Li Hu.

217
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,570
The Interrogation Hall is dusty.

218
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,100
If we don't clean it,

219
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,980
it wouldn't be sensible, either.

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,300
You are right.

221
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,150
Wait, I am a bit confused now.

222
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,250
I need to think.

223
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,680
Lei Ao, clean up quick.

224
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,390
Let Mr. Li Hu rest.

225
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,770
Is my place very dirty?

226
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,690
Alright.

227
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,630
You have four hours.

228
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,610
Alright.

229
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,740

Little Brother, it's your freedom
to write a novel.

However, freedom and equality
for all must be your priority.

You're short-sighted

00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,360
Mr. Yu.

341
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,500
Mr. Yu.

342
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,100
Ms. Mu.

343
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,500
How's the preparation coming along?

344
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,740
May I have the pleasure of helping you?

345
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,040
I wouldn't want to trouble you.

346
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,400
The embroidered ball show
of the star of Cai Yun...

347
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,880
is the dream of many high-ranking
officials and scholars.

348
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,100
I wouldn't want to miss
your splendour on stage.

349
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,680
Mr. Yu is so dashing.

350
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,980
Look at all the gifts.

351
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,240
Ms. Mu, do you see anything you like?

352
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,620
I don't know what I should buy for you.

353
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
Anything will do.

354
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,580
It's the sincerity that counts.

355
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,660
Mr. Yu is so thoughtful.

356
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,720
Satisfaction trumps sincerity.

357
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,020
May I know what your heart
desires, Ms. Mu?

358
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,920
Are you serious about this?

359
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,980
Of course.

360
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,240
Alright, please follow me.

361
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,620
We'll talk.

362
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:24,080
[Peony Pavilion]

363
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,460
I don't have any interest in antiques.

364
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,720
You coming to Cai Yun House
is a big gift for us.

365
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,460
I do have a favour to ask.

366
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,300
You wish to invite Wen Bin?

367
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,060
Yes.

368
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,140
Why?

369
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,760
Just bring him here.

370
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,340
As long as he can see me on stage,

371
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,560
I'm willing to pay any price.

372
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,740
That's not right.

373
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,840
I came to give you a gift.

374
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,500
I can't accept your money.

375
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,020
So, will you help me?

376
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,800
I'm willing to help you.

377
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,860
But...

378
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,640
I also have a small favour to ask of you.

379
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,880
Please tell me.

380
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,580
I'll do whatever I can.

381
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,980
I'll bring Wen Bin here.

382
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,060
You'll write a promotional letter
for his novel.

383
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,740
Deal.

384
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,020
[What should I buy for her?]

385
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,180
[Has she hinted to me before?]

386
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,340
[Xiao Man.]

387
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,300
[Where do you want to go?]

388
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,620
[Home.]

389
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,320
[A home that belongs to the two of us.]

390
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,660
[Will you take me there?]

391
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,760
[Of course. I'll take you
to anywhere you want.]

392
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,860
[I'll give you the happiest home.]

393
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,860
"Your tenderness and smile..."

394
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,820
"are the most precious gifts
god has ever given me."

395
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,020
"I wanted to use my undying love..."

396
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,980
"to pursue your dreams."

397
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,580
"But..."

398
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,180
Where did you get it?

399
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,360
Except Mo Xiao Huan...

400
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,420
who got caught by Mr. Li Hu that day,

401
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,860
many students are still reading it.

402
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,460
It's well written.

403
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,980
What are you doing?

404
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,980
What did you say?

405
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,300
Please calm down.

406
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,540
I heard that some students
are writing dialogue novels in secret.

407
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,140
Do you know who they are?

408
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,020
I don't know

409
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,620
don't know?!

410
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,900
Then Hurry up and investigate!

411
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,580
Tell me, is it you who wrote the novel?

412
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,560
No, it's not me.

413
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,120
-I'm not that talented...
-Is it you?

414
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,560
-No...
-Who else can it be?

415
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,700
I swear. Take a look at Room Two
of Regular Dorm.

416
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,380
Look.

417
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,060
Found it.

418
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,400
Not only are there are students
circulating dialogue novels,

419
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,900
but writing them, too,

420
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,660
tainting our school's culture.

421
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,140
Punish them then. Who are they?

422
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,300
I heard they're students
from Room Two of Regular Dorm.

423
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,140
Only Room Two of Regular Dorm?

424
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,600
We have to search every dorm.

425
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,520
Get to it.

426
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,500
Yes.

427
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,720
Bing Shen.

428
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,700
Zi Ming!

429
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,000
They're having a class...

430
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,040
and here you are doing a spot check?

431
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,360
This is not honourable.

432
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,440
Aren't spot checks supposed to be random?

433
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,000
-What are you thinking?
-No, you...

434
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,540
What?

435
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,820
Let's go.

436
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,340
-Class dismissed?
-Brother Zhao Rong.

437
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,720
-Not bad.
-Let's go.

438
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,420
Wen Bin...

439
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,000
I'm so tired after attending
a day of classes.

440
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,460
What's wrong, Brother Zhao Rong?

441
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,600
-Let's hurry back.
-Yeah.

442
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
Tell me,

443
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,940
are you hiding novels
in Room Two of Regular Dorm?

444
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,660
Don't lie to me. Tell me if you did.

445
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,900
No.

446
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,980
Are you sure?

447
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,420
That's a relief.

448
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,000
The Student Council is scouring
every dorm.

449
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,640
You could be in big trouble.

450
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,560
Since you didn't do it,
I'll leave now.

451
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,820
Alright, goodbye.

452
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,540
He's so brave.

453
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,680
He's got the nerve to emulate Mr. Bai's...

454
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,780
Where Love Begins.

455
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,620
He overestimated himself.

456
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,700
You wretched scum.

457
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,100
What are you doing here?

458
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,100
This is the wretched one.

459
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,140
Let's go.

460
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,780
You're in big trouble.

461
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,780
They found the dialogue novel?

462
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,380
Wen Bin.

463
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,900
Mr. Li wants you
in the Interrogation Hall.

464
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,100
-I'll come with you.
-Me too.

465
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,520
Two of us is enough.

466
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,960
Let's go together and shut up.

467
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,960
Why?

468
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,260
They found three dialogue novels
in our dorm.

469
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,420
Students who wrote dialogue novels,
stand on the left side.

470
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,180
Those who read the novels,
stand on the right side.

471
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,300
This is bad. A complete wipeout.

472
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,240
Principal Feng, everyone's here.

473
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,460
Please give your speech.

474
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,740
Hold on.

475
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,140
I'll be right with you.

476
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,480
Principal Feng, regarding the novel...

477
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,660
Unforgivable. Don't think you'll
get away this time.

478
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,080
Yu Le Xuan.

479
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,900
Pass me the three novels
from Room Two of Regular Dorm.
