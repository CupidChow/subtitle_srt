[Episode 3]

4
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,280
Don't you know how to knock?

5
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,520
This is my room, too.

6
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,880
Aren't you from a noble family?

7
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,320
Where's your superior room?

8
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,840
Shouldn't the new students live in
common rooms according to the rules?

9
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,720
To hell with the rules.

10
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,200
Rules are set by people.

11
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,560
What's good about common room?

12
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,280
I wish I had a superior room.

13
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,960
Look. Look at that bed.

14
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,910
Three people share a room.

15
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,650
How could a common room
be compared to a superior room?

16
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,039
And I always sprawl across the bed...

17
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,680
and snore in the middle of the night.

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,960
I certainly don't want you to suffer
like this.

19
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,440
That's good.

20
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,200
When did you become so caring?

21
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,800
After all, we're classmates.

22
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,400
Of course I wish you well.

23
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,600
I think I'll stay here.

24
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,920
Of all the common rooms, why this one?

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,280
Other rooms are all full.

26
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
Don't worry, Wen Bin.

27
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,400
I sleep like a log.

28
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,400
Neither storm nor thunder can wake me up.

29
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,560
I'm sure your bad habits won't affect me.

30
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,079
I often sleepwalk too. When I sleepwalk...

31
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,560
I attack people.

32
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,720
You're so powerful.

33
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,560
That's a big palm print
for such a small fist.

34
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,920
All the more reason for me to stay.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,840
I know a little about martial arts.

36
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,550
Although I'm no expert,

37
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,040
I can still stop you
when you lose control of yourself.

38
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,680
Other scholars may not
be able to deal with that.

39
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,920
Do you know there's
another scholar in this room?

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,830
No.

41
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,640
By all accounts, this person
is extremely scary.

42
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,310
-He's very rude.
-Really?

43
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,190
The previous tenants
were kicked out by him.

44
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,240
Then, I should live here.

45
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,480
I can defend you.

46
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,640
Can you defeat him?

47
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,840
His nickname is Lei Ao.

48
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,700
I'm capable of protecting you.

49
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,680
I don't need your protection.

50
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,280
To me, you're a noble.

51
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,000
So I think you should
stay in a superior room...

52
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,560
and stay away from
that terrible monster,

53
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,800
so that I won't get involved in trouble.

54
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,400
Wen Bin,

55
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,110
wood has to be worked,

56
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,400
swords have to be sharpened.

57
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,280
If I can't overcome such a difficulty,

58
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,560
I'll never achieve success.

59
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,240
What's so good about achieving success?

60
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,840
I'd rather live a relaxing life.

61
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,280
Young Master Feng,

62
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,160
please go to the superior room.

63
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,470
I don't want to share
a room with two people.

64
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,720
Just do me a favour.

65
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,200
Don't you like to help people?

66
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,040
I'm not afraid of Lei Ao...

67
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,440
because I want to help you.

68
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,040
You have many virtues,

69
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,760
albeit short-sighted and greedy
for small gains.

70
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,670
Since you're here,

71
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,760
you should study hard...

72
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,680
Say no more...

73
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,320
[Wine]

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,240
What are you doing?

75
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,159
You smell good.

76
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,470
Wen Bin.

77
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,990
Are you taking a shower, too?

78
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,920
Why don't you bring a towel?

79
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,540
You don't have a towel?

80
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,080
Come on, use mine.

81
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,120
Don't be shy.

82
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,120
It's okay. I'll use mine.

83
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,880
Wen Bin,

84
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,040
you'd better take a shower earlier.

85
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,450
We have an admission ceremony tonight
at the Student Council.

86
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,470
-Yes.
-Freshen up.

87
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,440
I got it.

88
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,360
Yes.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,520
Even the first day is overwhelming.

90
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:59,560
How should I survive the rest of my days?

91
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,670
What have you prepared?

92
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,120
This is good.

93
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,760
Light them up.

94
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,720
Wen Bin.

95
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,720
It's beautiful.

96
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,320
It's so beautiful.

97
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,680
Amazing.

98
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,320
Let the admission ceremony...

99
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,670
begin.

100
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:51,510
Welcome the honourable god.

101
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,200
It's time for freshmen
to present their gift.

102
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,200
Present.

103
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,680
Wait a minute.

104
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,160
What's with the long face?

105
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,840
Is presenting gifts to your seniors
asking too much?

106
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,640
Go. Next.

107
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,520
What is this?

108
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,880
This is a sincere gift from me.

109
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,480
Is this considered sincere?

110
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,750
The box looks shabby enough.

111
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,440
I'm guessing the things inside
must be shabbier.

112
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,520
I come from a poor family,

113
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
but I dare not neglect
the admission ceremony.

114
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,320
So I brought some snacks
prepared by my mother.

115
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,640
What are these?

116
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,960
They're black as coal.

117
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,760
Are there really such snacks?

118
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,200
Are these food for people?

119
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,760
More like food for pigs.

120
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,000
Why did you throw it away?
How inappropriate.

121
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,680
Apologise!

122
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,000
Apologise?

123
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,720
Apologise immediately!

124
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,160
It's an admission ceremony.

125
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,200
It's okay.

126
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,480
These can still be eaten.

127
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,680
I'll pick them up for you.

128
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,360
-Look.
-These food...

129
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,760
can feed a poor family for several days.

130
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,720
Many among the poor would kill
to have this kind of food.

131
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,400
Yet you call them food for pigs?

132
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,750
Are you implying that...

133
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,520
poor folk like us are lowlier than pigs?

134
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,360
As seniors,

135
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,320
you should be knowledgeable.

136
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,360
Which Confucian classics taught you to
discriminate against the poor...

137
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,080
and waste food?

138
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,880
He's right.

139
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,840
Yes.

140
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,850
Everything you said...

141
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,320
is right.

142
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,950
But you are just a freshman.

143
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,110
How dare you talk to
seniors in this way? I...

144
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,480
It was a sincere gift.

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,280
You shouldn't rebuke him

146
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,880
-Yes.
-That's right.

147
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,920
He's right.

148
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,440
Feng Cheng Jun, you...

149
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,360
Let go.

150
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,600
Everyone is watching here.

151
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,200
I didn't rebuke him.

152
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,520
Don't slander me.

153
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,920
You did, Senior.

154
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,240
I saw you bullying Wen Bin.

155
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,280
-Yes.
-It's too much.

156
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,680
-Yes.
-I saw it too.

157
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,720
No.

158
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,000
-President.
-President.

159
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,120
President.

160
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,240
It's an admission ceremony.

161
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,640
We just want to have fun with our juniors.

162
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,000
But Young Master Feng spoiled our mood.

163
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,990
Could it be that the Feng family...

164
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,800
don't want to obey the academy rules?

165
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,040
Freshmen should show respect to
seniors during admission ceremony.

166
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,200
And seniors should accept the respect.

167
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,920
That's the rule of the academy.

168
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,120
What's this?

169
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,280
Are you asking me to eat dirty food?

170
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,600
You...

171
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,040
Senior,

172
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,880
don't you want to try this?

173
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,840
Since it is a token of appreciation,

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,920
how can I refuse?

175
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,320
It's surprisingly delicious.

176
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,240
Try it.

177
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,200
You're in league with them?

178
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,040
It's not bad.

179
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,150
Alright. Stop fooling around.

180
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,560
Let's proceed to the next session.

181
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,600
That's the point.

182
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,880
Forget it. Let's go.

183
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,120
Let's go.

184
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,120
All right. Give it to me.

185
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,840
Just let it go.

186
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,250
Let's go.

187
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,880
As scholars of Yun Shang Academy,

188
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,720
you may become officials in the future...

189
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,670
and encounter many difficulties
along the way.

190
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,720
Now,

191
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,480
I'll appoint you as
Investigating Censors...

192
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,720
on secret missions.

193
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,800
You'll experience hardships
and bitterness in the process.

194
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,560
Your respective missions...

195
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,840
are denoted by the secret orders
that you're holding.

196
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,160
Secret orders?

197
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,440
Everyone must return to
the academy before dawn...

198
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,360
What's this?

199
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,120
and offer your quest item to God.

200
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,560
Then, you'll have to report back
at the lotus pond.

201
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,360
The one who accomplishes
the mission most perfectly...

202
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,160
will get a privilege.

203
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,560
He can make any request
to the Student Council...

204
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,760
and the Student Council will fulfill it.

205
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,960
Can it be anything?

206
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,840
With the power of the Student Council,

207
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,440
nothing is impossible.

208
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,760
What if we failed to
accomplish the mission?

209
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,880
Jump into the lotus pond naked.

210
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,400
-What a punishment.
-How interesting.

211
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,510
Read your mission...

212
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,910
and get started.

213
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,760
We must go for it.

214
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,160
Who is Mu Xiao Man?

215
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,200
The star of Cai Yun House.

216
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,320
[Every man in Yunzhou,
be it noble or humble,]

217
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,800
[old or young,]

218
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,160
[is attracted by her talent.]

219
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,200
[It is difficult for an ordinary man
to invite her for a show.]

220
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,360
My mission is to get water
from the well in Xiu Luo Hall.

221
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,360
Mine's to get a pig's head
to worship god...

222
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,560
at a butcher's house in West Village.

223
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,640
Cheng Jun, what is your mission?

224
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,120
My mission is very weird.

225
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,480
"Sneak into the Han Manor,

226
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,240
retrieve Three Unique Flowers from
Yun Duan Pavilion and offer them to god?

227
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,760
-It’s so strange.
-Hurry up.

228
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,470
I don't know what the flowers look like.

229
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,350
-How am I to find it?
-Exactly.

230
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,040
Wen Bin, what about yours?

231
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,950
Mine's inviting Mu Xiao Man...

232
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,710
to give a free performance
during the worshiping ceremony.

233
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,160
This is simple.

234
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,200
Come on, will Mu Xiao Man
come if we don't pay her?

235
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,530
Actually, the weather is not that cold.

236
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,480
It's okay to jump into the lotus pond.

237
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,630
Stop mulling over it.

238
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,010
Let's hurry and split up, okay?

239
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:15,970
Guys.

240
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,120
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

241
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,960
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

242
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,560
I think the president has it in for me.

243
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,680
Other people have it easy.

244
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,800
Just fetch some water or a pig's head.

245
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,040
Actually, their missions
are not that easy.

246
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,320
Wen Zi Feng is going to
fetch water from Xiu Luo Hall.

247
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,040
It's behind a graveyard.

248
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,080
He must have nerves of steel.

249
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,800
Yang Yi De is going to a butcher's house
in West Village, which is far.

250
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,120
It's not easy for him
to make it before dawn.

251
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
You mustn't feel discouraged.

252
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,120
Try to persuade her.

253
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,520
Perhaps she'll agree.

254
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,160
Perhaps? I must.

255
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,040
If I jump into the lotus pond,

256
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,200
I'll go mad for sure.

257
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,830
Actually, I don't know why you're so
afraid of jumping into the lotus pond.

258
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,970
For me, these punishments...

259
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,070
aren't too intimidating.

260
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,640
But if you're really scared,

261
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
I can help you.

262
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,120
How?

263
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,680
If Ms. Mu doesn't agree to come,

264
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,920
you can pay her.

265
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,400
I have no money.

266
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,200
I have.

267
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,920
How can you think of such an idea?

268
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,360
The secret order says...

269
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,680
it has to be a free performance.

270
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,270
If we pay her secretly,

271
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,190
wouldn't it be falsifying?

272
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,470
You've always been righteous.

273
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,750
How can you...

274
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,920
Sorry, I've strayed.

275
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,720
And I've almost led you astray, too.

276
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,720
Let's think of other ways.

277
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,360
Thank you anyway.

278
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
Never mind. I'll try my best.

279
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,440
Young Master Feng, I wish you success.

280
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,040
Good luck.

281
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,080
Are you sure this is plan is foolproof?

282
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,430
Don't worry.

283
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,000
Saddle up two horses...

284
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,920
and go.

285
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,040
-[Setting Han Manor on fire,]
-[Stop!]

286
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,080
-[and breaching Lady Han's room...]
-[Stop!]

287
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,120
[as the guards catch him in the act.]

288
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,960
I'd like to see Feng Cheng Jun
get out of this.

289
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,280
As for the Mu Xiao Man mission,

290
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,079
you want to test if...

291
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,800
Mu Xiao Man is willing to help Wen Bin?

292
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,119
Mu Xiao Man has always
been aloof to everyone.

293
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,400
I don't think...

294
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,000
she'll fulfill Wen Bin's request.

295
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,390
I really hope time passes faster.

296
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,880
I can't wait to see...

297
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,620
Wen Bin jumping into the lotus pond.

298
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,840
Mister, let's drink.

299
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,440
[Han Manor]

300
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,000
Young Master ordered me
to lock the door tonight...

301
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,520
so that no scholar will ​​break in
and frighten Young Lady.

302
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,280
I wonder which unlucky scholar...

303
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,960
has fallen prey to Brother's torment
this year.

304
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,920
It doesn't matter.

305
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,920
We just have to lock the door.

306
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,500
Later,

307
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,000
when Feng Cheng Jun has climbed
into the manor,

308
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,640
you'll quickly ignite the firewood
next to you.

309
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,880
Got it?

310
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,400
Okay.

311
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,960
Keep your voice down.

312
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,910
-Right.
-By the way,

313
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,480
you must see which direction
he is heading to clearly.

314
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,960
We'll lure all the guards
out of the house.

315
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,790
-Then...
-I'll buy you drinks.

316
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,240
What's with you and drinking?

317
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,640
You'll come back and put out the fire.

318
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,480
-Okay.
-Got it?

319
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,800
Someone is here.

320
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,280
Where is he?

321
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,400
I didn't expect Feng Cheng Jun
to be so skilled.

322
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,920
That bastard.

323
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,680
He even wore black.

324
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,120
He's like a thief now.

325
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,240
Light it up.

326
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,270
Come on.

327
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,070
Hurry up.

328
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,000
-Hurry...
-Let's split.

329
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,920
Hey there handsome,

330
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,120
I saw you pacing here for quite a while.

331
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,280
How may I help you?

332
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,800
I have something important to ask Ms. Mu.

333
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,480
Can you please carry my message?

334
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,840
After this song,

335
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,200

00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,640
It makes sense.

504
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,000
Stop there!

505
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,960
Stop!

506
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,240
Hurry! After him!

507
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,480
Over there!

508
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,840
Hurry!

509
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,280
Hurry!

510
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,230
Who are you?

511
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,110
I...

512
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,360
I am a freshman at Yun Shang Academy.

513
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,430
I'm a mission as part of the admission
ceremony.

514
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,240
Did you see a man in black pass by here?

515
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,080
Yes.

516
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,480
He went that way.

517
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,080
The man looked fierce and evil
with his bow and arrow.

518
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,640
He ran that way.

519
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,240
What's wrong?

520
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,440
That way. He ran that way! Hurry!

521
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,920
-Go!
-Yes!

522
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,920
After him!

523
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,060
-Hurry up.
-Wait.

524
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,000
Hurry up.

525
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,840
Well? Have you completed the mission?

526
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,370
You bet.

527
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,960
That's great. Congratulations.

528
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,240
How about you?

529
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,590
I...

530
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,050
have failed my mission.

531
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,160
The guards at the Han Manor
were very alert.

532
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,250
What are you going to tell the council?

533
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,200
Mission failed.

534
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,360
I'll accept the punishment.

535
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,840
What is the pig's head for?

536
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,080
There's even a pig's head.

537
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,600
What's up with the pig's head?

538
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,240
Who bought the pig's head?

539
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,080
Wen Bin,

540
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,080
have you accomplished your mission?

541
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,670
Ms. Mu has agreed to perform
for the ceremony.

542
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,110
What did you say?

543
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,280
Way to go, Wen Bin.

544
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,480
-Great.
-Did you hear that?

545
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,480
She actually agreed.

546
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,880
Is this a lie...

547
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,160
to get out of punishment?

548
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,480
Ms. Mu really did promise me.

549
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,480
It's true.

550
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,760
Ms. Mu promised.

551
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,560
What a surprise.

552
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,320
Mu Xia Man has never performed outside.

553
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,280
Wen Bin, you're so great!

554
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,600
Yes, Wen Bin.

555
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,520
You make us freshmen proud.

556
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,520
-Yes, Wen Bin.
-Yes.

557
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,270
-You make us proud.
-Yes, Wen Bin.

558
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,070
Wen Bin, I've underestimated you.

559
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,240
Your charisma is undeniable.

560
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,120
I take back what I said about you
looking like a woman.

561
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,440
I must ask you for some advice
when I am free.

562
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,560
President, I think Wen Bin deserves
the privilege.

563
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,960
His mission was the hardest.

564
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,320
But he did it flawlessly.

565
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,400
Yes, give it to Wen Bin!

566
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,560
Since the rules were set,

567
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,080
and everyone agrees that
Wen Bin did the best job,

568
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,440
as the leader of the Student Council,

569
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,800
you'll honour your word, right?

570
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,680
Okay.

571
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,750
Thank you, President.

572
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,480
But Young Master Feng,

573
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,800
what about your mission?

574
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,960
I'm incompetent.

575
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,070
I've failed.

576
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,680
He failed.

577
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,640
Good.

578
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:52,720
Very good. Sure enough,
you're from the Feng family.

579
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,960
Speaking so boldly even though
you've failed your mission.

580
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,960
Feng Cheng Jun,

581
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,040
do you have anything else to say?

582
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,120
I have nothing to say.

583
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,360
I'll just obey the rules.

584
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,480
Feng Cheng Jun,

585
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,920
do you know what
the lotus pond is used for?

586
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,240
It's where the helpers
wash the chamber pots.

587
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,120
Place to wash the chamber pots?

588
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,960
Wait a minute.

589
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,800
Can I use my privilege now?

590
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,600
Of course you can.

591
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,120
This is a tradition of Yun Shang Academy.

592
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,760
You can make any request...

593
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,560
and the Student Council will fulfill it.

594
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,040
I want you to let him go.

595
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,720
Spare him of the lotus pond.

596
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,110
-He's using his privilege for that?
-That's it?

597
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,320
-What a waste.
-This...

598
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,640
What a waste.

599
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,760
His hard-earned privilege.

600
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,160
Have you thought about it properly?

601
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,880
This privilege is very precious.

602
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,720
Moreover,

603
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,520
seeing him jump into the lotus pond...

604
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,040
can make everyone happy.

605
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,960
What does it matter, right?

606
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:58,990
Yes.

607
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,520
-That's it
-Just jump!

608
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,440
It's nothing.

609
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,600
I'm not the kind to owe favours.

610
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,800
He helped me just now.

611
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,040
So I'm returning the favour.

612
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,239
You're such a loyal friend.

613
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:13,630
All right.

614
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,550
That's it for the admission ceremony.

615
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,600
Dismiss.

616
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,320
Let's go, Brother Le Xian.

617
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,449
Wen Bin,

618
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,710
your effort will definitely
be rewarded someday.

619
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,239
Wen Bin, I salute you.

620
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,040
You two are truly a perfect match.

621
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,800
Even your actions are in sync.

622
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,560
How inappropriate for men
to get touchy-feely.

623
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,199
Are you sure we are all real men?

624
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,070
You are not a man?

625
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,760
Your joke is not funny at all.

626
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,520
Why are you laughing then?

627
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,640
I'm laughing at him.

628
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:15,200
You have been to President's house,

629
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,720
but you deliberately concealed it.

630
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,120
I guess...

631
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,280
you must have seen Young Lady Han already.

632
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,840
To protect her reputation,

633
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,720
you'd rather come back
and receive punishment.

634
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,240
Am I right?

635
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,920
I have no idea what you mean.

636
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,720
I know you do.

637
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,640
Wen Bin, thank you.

638
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,920
Don't mention it.

639
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,680
If it weren't for you,

640
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,080
I would have been beaten.

641
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,720
I was just returning a favour.

642
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,680
It's not your wish to enter
Yun Shang Academy.

643
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,600
If I hadn't intervened,

644
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,440
you wouldn't have been humiliated

645
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,670
Today,

646
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,880
you wasted a privilege on me.

647
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,120
I feel even more guilty.

648
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,670
Well,

649
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,400
consider it your debt.

650
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,920
This is my first time being a creditor.

651
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,960
I feel good.

652
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,480
All right.

653
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,800
I owe you a wish.

654
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,080
Do let me know what it is.

655
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,280
Any wish?

656
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,480
Yes, any wish.

657
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,070
As long as I can do it,

658
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,520
I'll try my best to grant it.

659
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,640
I want money instead.

660
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840
Keep owing me, then.

661
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,960
I want to be your creditor for life.

662
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,960
What about the interest?

663
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,000
Let me think about it.
