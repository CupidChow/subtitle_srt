[Episode 16]

4
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,600
You've misunderstood me.

5
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,440
It's not that I am not willing to do it.

6
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,120
However, it has to follow the flow...

7
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,640
and we are waiting for the right time.

8
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,160
We need to leverage against
the opponent to win.

9
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:38,210
I knew it.

10
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,380
You can do it.

11
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,640
I have been thinking about what
you said in the policy forum.

12
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,200
I agree with you but I have some doubts.

13
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
Such as?

14
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Tell me.

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,970
In order for everyone not
to worry about life necessities,

16
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,350
we have to promote education.

17
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,680
According to the saints,

18
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,079
we have to influence, correct
and change people.

19
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,100
But, ancients said, "Teach a man to fish
rather than feed him for a day."

20
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,079
From what you said,

21
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,880
people first have to be rich
in order to be educated.

22
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,320
However, to be rich,

23
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,960
people have to get education first.

24
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,780
Which should come first, fish...

25
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,980
or the teaching to fish?

26
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:35,960
You digested that well.

27
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,020
You have also learned to draw inferences.

28
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,370
I learned it from you.

29
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,710
I learned how to see things
from different perspectives.

30
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,270
To me, both of you are just pedantic.

31
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,900
Can you make money by fishing?

32
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,440
Why does a fisherman need education?
That's ridiculous.

33
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,500
That's just an example.

34
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:53,110
Please don't be so skin deep.

35
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,180
So now, both of you share the same views.

36
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,590
Sworn brothers are closer, huh?

37
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,000
I know that you are thinking for me.

38
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,440
Besides my mother and sister,

39
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,480
I am the most thankful for you.

40
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,440
No matter how nice I am,
I am just an outsider.

41
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,090
Be a bigger person.

42
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,800
Brother Feng is trying to say that...

43
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,520
he is not the kind of person
you think he is.

44
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,640
I am not being petty here.

45
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,890
I told him to stay away from you.

46
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,920
But he immediately brought you to the
Confucius Temple to become sworn brothers.

47
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,100
As if someone would snatch you away.

48
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,870
What a petty person.

49
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,240
I know that you are thinking
for my sworn brother.

50
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,230
But if you must twist the truth,

51
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,820
forgive me for not agreeing.

52
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,430
Your sworn brother?

53
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,360
Three of us are all brothers.

54
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,920
Stop mentioning about brothers
in front of me.

55
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,200
I feel disgusted when I hear the word.

56
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,240
Hey...

57
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,280
It's okay.

58
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
[Wen Xi.]

59
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,000
[Stop thinking too much.]

60
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,680
Actually, it's quite nice
to be his sworn brother.

61
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,040
At least I get to see
Brother Feng every day.

62
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,680
I have never expected
to have insomnia in my life.

63
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,800
Wen Bin, you are such a challenge.

64
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,360
Only by chasing you out of
Yun Shang Academy...

65
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,280
can I realise my goal.

66
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,980
What should I do?

67
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,200
Brother Ze Xin,
can you practise somewhere else?

68
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,640
I like practicing in the house.

69
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,190
You are affecting me.

70
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,110
You can go to Bo Lan House to read.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,630
The dorm is meant to be a quiet place.

72
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,250
Why can't I read here?

73
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,490
You are disturbing others
by practising in the room.

74
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,659
The dorm is where students
do their own thing.

75
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,159
Since you can read in the room,

76
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,920
why can't I practise martial arts?

77
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,990
Are you picking a fight with me?

78
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:50,940
I am trying to reason with you.

79
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,000
Are you saying that I am not reasonable?

80
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,200
Why are you two fighting again?

81
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,160
Today is an open day.

82
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,920
Do you guys want to take a stroll?

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,430
-No.
-No.

84
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,490
Brother Feng.

85
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,640
Well...

86
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,950
I saw new ink-stones
at the stationery store.

87
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,600
Do you want to take a look?

88
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,760
Brother Ze Xin.

89
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,000
I heard that there's some
good wine in South Street.

90
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,140
Do you want to try it?

91
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,300
-I...
-Let's go together.

92
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,890
Together?

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,880
I don't want to hang out with him.

94
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,159
Brother Bin.

95
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,690
I shall keep you company.

96
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,470
Keep him company?

97
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,280
Don't try to sweet talk.
Accompany him?

98
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,590
Enough. Stop arguing.

99
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,920
It's so boring to stay here, right?

100
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,760
I shall invite Le Xuan too.

101
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,480
I'm sure he knows a lot about ink-stones.

102
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,600
Let's go.

103
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,790
It's time to go!

104
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,960
-Hold on. Stop pushing me.
-Let's go.

105
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,980
Let's go.

106
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,640
[South Street Market]

107
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,830
Should we go to
the stationery store first...

108
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,150
to check out the ink-stones?

109
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,040
Then, we can roam and grab a bite
when hungry. What say you?

110
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,480
I think it is going to rain soon.

111
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,550
Why don't we eat something first?

112
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,030
There is nothing special
about the stationery store.

113
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,780
Those who want to go there
may go by themselves.

114
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,970
We'll go to the stationery store first.

115
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,410
I said, I am not going.

116
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,540
See?

117
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,240
What's wrong with you?

118
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,040
I have something to tell you.

119
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,000
We agreed to go
to the stationery store.

120
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,240
You can do something else
if you don't feel like joining us.

121
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,590
I agreed to taking a stroll
with Wen Bin.

122
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,790
You may go there alone if you want.

123
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,240
Why are you arguing again?

124
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,120
Hello, sirs.

125
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,560
Come and check out the beautiful
and efficacious sachets.

126
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,720
If you wear it,

127
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,200
your dream will come true for sure.

128
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,880
Let's check them out. Seems interesting.

129
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,120
-These are lucky sachets.
-Come on.

130
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,720
Each colour
represents a different meaning.

131
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,840
If you wear the sachet,

132
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,320
your dream will come true for sure.

133
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,090
Let's buy one each.

134
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,200
Only girls like things like that.

135
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,160
No one can become lucky
just by wearing a sachet.

136
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,400
We are saying the same thing.

137
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,160
Are others not allowed
to repeat what you said?

138
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,050
Yes.

139
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,000
By the way,

140
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,460
check out the golden sachet.

141
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,640
It represents money.

142
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,680
If you wear it,

143
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,720
you will earn a lot of money.

144
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,240
It's a good fit for you.

145
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,510
Grief is mapped on your face.

146
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,080
I bet you are worrying about money.

147
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,039
When have I ever worried about money?

148
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,000
That's true.

149
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,440
You are a business genius.

150
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,080
No way you would worry about money.

151
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,800
By the way, Wen Bin,

152
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,450
compared to Yun Shang Academy,

153
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,650
doesn't it feel more liberating out here?

154
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,370
Furthermore, no one would
stop you from taking jobs.

155
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,850
You don't have to worry about money too.

156
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,960
I can tell that it's tiring
living with both of them.

157
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,600
No doubt it's quite tiring.

158
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,140
They either bicker
or give the cold shoulder.

159
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,570
Both of them are nice people.

160
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,120
Why can't they live in peace?

161
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,040
Hence why I think life in Yun Shang
is not that good, right?

162
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,880
You are not aiming to become
a government official anyway.

163
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,200
Right?

164
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,920
In the beginning, I felt reluctant
to stay in Yun Shang.

165
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,400
However, I've learned a lot.

166
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,160
I was introduced to another world.

167
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,000
I think everyone is taking
good care of me.

168
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,720
So, life is not harsh on me.

169
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,880
Anyway, what did you want to tell me?

170
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,240
Nothing, I...

171
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,970
If we keep them waiting,
they will start arguing again.

172
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,210
I shall join them.

173
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,760
Boss, I want these.

174
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,480
Why are you making faces?

175
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,640
Sir, here.

176
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,050
Thank you.

177
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,040
Thank you, sir.

178
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,880
Brother Bin,
you shall decide our destination.

179
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,680
Enough, it's started to rain.
Stop arguing.

180
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,100
Let's go to Yu Le House.

181
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,480
It starts to raining out of a sudden.

182
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,460
Let's go!

183
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,280
Hurry up! Let's take shelter
from the rain.

184
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,000
Let's go home. Hurry up!

185
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,560
Put it on. You might catch a cold.

186
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,100
Come in.

187
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,280
Please hold on.

188
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,960
Here.

189
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,000
You guys should get changed.

190
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,160
Brother Cheng Jun.

191
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,240
Thank you, Brother Le Xuan.

192
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,990
Take this one.

193
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,040
We don't have clothes that fit you.

194
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,880
Please make do with this.

195
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,480
No need, I don't have to change.

196
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,820
You have to change!
Otherwise, you may fall sick.

197
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,000
Wen Bin, listen to him.

198
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,650
Pick one and get changed.

199
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,400
Okay.

200
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,880
Are you going to get changed here?

201
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,880
Where else?

202
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,970
All of us are men.

203
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Just get changed already.

204
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I...

205
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,320
Brother Bin is not used to
changing in front of others.

206
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,460
Yes.

207
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,640
If I undress in front of others,

208
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,020
I can't control myself and will go crazy.

209
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,920
How come I forgot about that?

210
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,890
You, bring him to a room.

211
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,910
Sure.

212
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,530
Has Wen Bin never changed
in front of you guys?

213
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,190
No.

214
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,250
He just said it.

215
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,390
He would go crazy.

216
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,590
How strange.

217
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,100
That's interesting.

218
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,320
The clothes are slightly bigger,

219
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,520
but you look graceful in it.

220
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,270
No one would describe a man
as graceful.

221
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,830
Brother Feng,
you are making fun of me again.

222
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,760
He speaks without thinking.

223
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,330
Don't try so hard to please others.

224
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,180
It might backfire.

225
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,870
Little Brother.

226
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,320
It fits you quite well.

227
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,280
Graceful is a nice word.

228
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,280
Don't you think...

229
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,400
Wen Bin looks like a girl...

230
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,290
dressed in those clothes?

231
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,860
Looks like a girl?

232
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,450
What girl?

233
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,690
This attire is for a man.

234
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,800
He does look like a girl.

235
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,780
Wen Bin.

236
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,480
Fortunately, you are not a girl.

237
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,600
Otherwise, these three men...

238
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,520
would kill each other for you.

239
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,440
I think I should change it back.

240
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,550
Don't do that.

241
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,250
Don't change again.
Let it be.

242
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:33,080
I was just kidding. You're too serious
to notice.

243
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,720
I want to get changed.

244
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,640
Le Xuan.

245
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,320
It seems you're in a good mood.

246
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,480
Strolling around with people
from Room Two of Regular Dorm...

247
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,800
is your happy pill, huh?

248
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,400
Win your enemy's heart
before you break him.

249
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,480
I am looking for his flaws.

250
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,560
Were you?

251
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,520
Very well.

252
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,080
Don't try to push my limit.

253
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,920
You should know that those things...

254
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,720
that I gave you are very precious
even if I didn't remind you.

255
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,840
You know how serious
the consequences can be...

256
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,560
if you ever let me down.

257
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,040
That's for sure.

258
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,680
Where is Brother Ze Xin?

259
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,600
We came back together.
Where did he go?

260
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,540
Perhaps he went out for some wine.

261
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,490
Is he angry at me?

262
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,650
It seems that you care about him.

263
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,840
Of course, he is so nice to me.

264
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,330
If I didn't care,
that'd make me heartless.

265
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,470
Here.

266
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,280
You bought it.

267
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,130
Though it is girlish,

268
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,350
it is meaningful.

269
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,350
It suits you.

270
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,130
That's why I want to give it to you.

271
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,760
What does it represent?

272
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,280
I didn't listen when he was talking.

273
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,940
Blue sachet represents power.

274
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,510
It can help you become an official.

275
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,870
-Yes.
-Isn't that your ambition?

276
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,200
Did you get it for others?

277
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,620
I bought it for you, Brother Ze Xin
and Le Xuan.

278
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,760
If you don't want to keep it,

279
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,160
you can return it to me.

280
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,240
I want it.

281
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,680
I hope you don't find it dumb.

282
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,100
No.

283
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,300
Anything from you is good.

284
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,640
With this good luck,

285
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,680
may we successfully
become government officials.

286
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,400
If I can't become a government official,

287
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,720
will our friendship end here?

288
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,760
I'm sure we'll succeed.

289
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,120
Brother Bin.

290
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,480
Did you get one for yourself?

291
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,640
What colour?

292
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,240
Is it a blue sachet too?

293
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,160
No, I got it randomly.

294
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,770
[Is there anything that matches
this blue sachet?]

295
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,960
[One that represents destiny?]

296
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,200
[Yes.]

297
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,319
[Look at this sachet.]

298
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,720
[If I can persuade Wen Bin
to willingly drop out...]

299
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,960
[and avoid being in the limelight,]

300
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,480
[I can come out with another plan.]

301
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,880
[That seems a better choice.]

302
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,200
[His wish would come true.]

303
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,480
[So does mine.]

304
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,080
[It's a win-win situation.]

305
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,800
Wen Bin.

306
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,320
Lei Ze Xin is not around.

307
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,640
You should join me for lunch.

308
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,080
Sure.

309
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,720
I want to talk to you anyway.

310
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,780
I'll be off then.

311
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,760
Le Xuan.

312
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,300
Why do you look troubled?

313
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,840
It's nothing really. It's just...

314
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,640
I have something to tell you.

315
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,150
Today, at the Council meeting,

316
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,400
I heard that Han Sheng Zhi is
trying to get you in trouble again.

317
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,440
He wants to kick you out of the school.

318
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,450
Wen Bin, you poor thing.

319
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,480
Han Sheng Zhi is a jerk.

320
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,410
How can he be so evil as the President?

321
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,760
Such a bully.

322
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,100
No way I will leave as he wishes.

323
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,500
I won't let him get his way.

324
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,680
Why are you going against him?

325
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,720
Think about it.

326
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,940
You've been facing troubles
ever since you joined Yun Shang.

327
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,310
You are being controlled.

328
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,720
You have to make money in secret.

329
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,320
Besides, you're not aiming to be appointed
as a government official.

330
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,400
It's meaningless for you to stay here.

331
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,340
You are just wasting your life.

332
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,870
If you want to leave the academy,

333
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,290
I can help you out.

334
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,980
I can ensure you leave
Yun Shang in peace...

335
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,580
without getting punished.

336
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,670
How could you say that?

337
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,250
Though I tried really hard
to leave this place before,

338
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,200
I have changed.

339
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,480
I won't bow down to snobs.

340
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,640
I won't let them make fun of me.

341
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,480
I am different from others.

342
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,880
I am not here to become an official,

343
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,280
not because I don't want to.

344
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,000
It's because I can't.

345
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,360
I can't tell you the reason...

346
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,720
but as long as I'm in Yun Shang,
I will never surrender.

347
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,280
Just like what Brother Feng said
in the policy forum.

348
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,820
We have to aspire to be someone
who can contribute to people and country.

349
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,290
Help change Yun for the better.

350
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,200
That should be our aim as a student.

351
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,320
We should not disappoint ourselves,
our family and the country.

352
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,750
Therefore, I'm staying.

353
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,850
Stop persuading me.

354
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,160
But... Don't get me wrong.

355
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,000
I am not throwing a tantrum.

356
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,440
I know that it's for my own good.

357
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:22,170
I know that you are
a kind and caring person.

358
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,930
I don't deny that you can
be weird at times.

359
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,820
I almost forgot.

360
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,610
It's for you.

361
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,760
Take it.

362
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,210
You can't say no.

363
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,780
I am waiting for you to protect me
after you become successful.

364
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,300
Eat well. I have to go.

365
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,500
[He is not in the room.]

366
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,820
[It's late.]

367
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,040
[Where did Wen Bin go?]

368
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,160
It must be here.

369
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,050
Did I drop it on the way?

370
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
On the way?

371
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,480
No way.

372
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,460
Da Shen.

373
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,040
Are you sure you dropped it here?

374
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,960
It has been so long.

375
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,080
No way you can find it.

376
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,340
I'm sure it's here.

377
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,580
It was that time.

378
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,260
Did you bring your talisman?

379
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,340
Give me a talisman.

380
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,640
I didn't bring it with me.

381
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,160
Don't scare me.

382
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,960
I am sure that we didn't see
Wen Bin here.

383
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,050
Think about it, why would
he come here late at night?

384
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,760
Look for it.

385
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,240
If that wasn't Wen Bin,
then was it a ghost?

386
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,520
Da Shen.

387
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,290
Let's go back.

388
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,230
No way.

389
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,430
I need to find that jade.

390
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,850
Hurry up, look for it.

391
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,670
Da Shen.

392
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,450
What are you doing?

393
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,450
Are you crazy?

394
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,920
Xiao Huan.

395
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,950
Da Shen, did you get a cramp or what?

396
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,530
What is it? I can't see anything.

397
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,760
Stop scaring yourself.

398
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,130
Da Shen.

399
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,670
I saw something over there...

400
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,920
What did you see?

401
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,050
You must be crazy.

402
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,180
Something's there.

403
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,720
Please spare my life!

404
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,100
Grandpa.

405
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,160
-Stop stepping on me.
-I didn't step on you.

406
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,950
Grandpa!

407
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,940
Such scaredy-cats.

408
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,350
[After what I have done,]

409
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,330
[I bet no one would dare come again.]

410
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,180
President.

411
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,340
Those who patrolled
at the store room said...

412
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,230
they heard noises coming from inside.

413
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,600
Investigate it then.

414
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,040
They claimed that
the store room is haunted.

415
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,000
No one dared to go check.

416
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,920
Ghosts don't exist.

417
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:03,890
[Who is that?]

418
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,330
No way.

419
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,360
[There's a window at the back.
I'll check it out.]

420
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,640
It's you.

421
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,920
What are you doing?

422
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,320
Why aren't you asleep?

423
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,360
Are you sleep walking?

424
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,500
President.

425
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,240
I've been having trouble sleeping lately.

426
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,800
The moon is beautiful tonight.

427
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,070
So I came out for a stroll.

428
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,670
You really know how to enjoy yourself.

429
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,200
This place is haunted.
Why are you walking around alone?

430
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,300
Did you hear any noise
coming from the store room?

431
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,530
Noise?

432
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,820
[Open the door!]

433
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,160
[Someone is here to catch you!]

434
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,350
[Who are you trying warn?]

435
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,400
[The ghost?]

436
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,790
We don't know who's in there.

437
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,290
If a human is in there,

438
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,950
he can't escape.

439
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,480
[Please take a look for us.]

440
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,170
[Stop dilly-dallying.]

441
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,600
Are you scared?

442
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,280
Why don't you go inside?

443
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,360
Help!

444
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,710
Why did you run?

445
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,580
You!

446
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Yu Le Xuan!

447
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,810
Both of you,

448
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,930
go inside and take a look.

449
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
You should go first.

450
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,210
You first. Stop talking rubbish.

451
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,530
-It's ghost!
-It's haunted!

452
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,640
Stop!

453
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,960
Both of you are rubbish.

454
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,480
Yu Le Xuan, what are you doing?

455
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,400
You get terrified so easily.

456
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,200
What if you fail to capture the ghost,

457
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,920
but cause fire to the school?

458
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,670
Who should be held liable
if we create trouble?

459
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,970
Yu Le Xuan.

460
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,280
Stop gaslighting.

461
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,280
-What is your problem?
-Give it to me.

462
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,640
Come here. Let me show you.

463
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,600
Come.

464
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,480
Let me show you.

465
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,640
See? The ghost is inside the room.

466
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,200
See? There is no shadow at all!

467
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,840
Enough.

468
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,250
All of you are useless.

469
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,210
Let's go.

470
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,870
I think I heard some noises.

471
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,120
But now it's gone.

472
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,720
Look at the leaves. They are so scary.

473
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,160
Brothers.

474
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,160
What?

475
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,600
Did you realise something?

476
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,060
Whenever we are here,

477
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,860
the feeling is the same.

478
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,820
I feel a chill on my back.

479
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,340
-Yes.
-My scalp is numb.

480
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,690
Your talisman.

481
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,640
The same thing happened last time.
I'm out of here!

482
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,560
Xiao Huan!

483
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,920
Everyone.

484
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,520
Shouldn't we help him out?

485
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,140
I think we better don't.

486
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,960
The President has sent someone there.

487
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,500
I think you are right.

488
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,070
No way.

489
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,380
Brothers.

490
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,920
I am ready to...

491
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,800
fight with him today.

492
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,120
Come with me.

493
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,000
You want to fight?

494
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,880
First get through my brothers.

495
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,070
Brothers!

496
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,240
Brother Zhao Rong.

497
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,480
Now I see you're the real brother

498
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,550
Brother Zhao Hui.

499
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,880
I'm here because my legs are numb.

500
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,120
I'll carry you.

501
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,250
Protect us, Da Shen.

502
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,840
Protect us!

503
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,280
[Did Le Xuan see me?]

504
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,040
[What should I do?]

505
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,590
[It seems that Wen Bin wants
to continue studying here.]

506
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,160
[Wen Bin.]

507
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,380
[This is not what I want.]

508
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,380
[But I have to make it clear.]

509
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,880
[Only then, you will leave.]

510
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,230
What is it?

511
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:02,650
Something seems wrong with you.

512
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,620
Is it?

513
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,610
I actually think you have something
to tell me.

514
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,320
Perhaps I can help you out.

515
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,660
I do need a favour from you.

516
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,080
That's not a problem.

517
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,390
Just tell me.

518
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:20,920
I heard that you went
ghost hunting last night.

519
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,190
Yes.

520
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,730
Did you find anything?

521
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,570
What do you think?

522
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,610
I...

523
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,830
I found that...

524
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,800
there is nothing in the store room.

525
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,440
How anti-climactic.

526
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,560
Really?

527
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,520
Of course.

528
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,480
A few members of the Council
went there too.

529
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,470
They didn't discover anything either.

530
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:48,050
But they were so terrified
they almost peed themselves.

531
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,640
If you ask me, they are the ghosts.

532
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:50,810
Cowardly ghosts.

533
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:53,150
If you ask me, you are the trouble.

534
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,230
You are the trouble-maker.

535
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,420
Who are you trying to scare?

536
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,400
-I just want to...
-Let's go.

537
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,750
Time for Mr. Ding's class.

538
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,440
You will learn a lot from him.

539
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,840
Okay. Let's go.

540
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,020
However, I have to remind you that...

541
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,520
Mr. Ding can be quite unpredictable.

542
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,600
Be careful when you answer his questions.

543
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,760
Okay.

544
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,080
[No gentleman has a petty mind.]

545
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,520
Interesting indeed.

546
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,640
How did he do that?

547
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,880
Look at the phrase.

548
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,610
What does it remind you of?

549
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,600
That's easy.

550
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,070
"No gentleman has a petty mind."

551
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,190
No true man is without cruelty.

552
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,240
Please explain to everyone.

553
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:46,110
What does the two phrases mean?

554
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,120
In order to become successful,

555
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,710
one has to be decisive.

556
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,010
He must not think like a woman.

557
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,480
He has to be strong when dealing
with matters of life and death.

558
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,240
He has to be cruel...

559
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,560
but skilled.

560
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,880
However, since ancient times,

561
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,570
it is uncommon to see...

562
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:06,210
cruel people gain success and
win the people's heart at the same time.

563
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,820
It depends on the circumstances.

564
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:10,170
Analyse the whole situation
before making decisions.

565
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:13,410
No true man is without cruelty.
That is a good saying.

566
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,480
Feng Cheng Jun.

567
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,360
What do you think?

568
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,550
"No gentleman has a petty mind."

569
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,280
It reminds me of
"No true man is without generosity."

570
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,760
They are one of the oldest couplets.

571
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,640
While most people are being cruel,

572
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,520
some people just have to stand out.

573
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,120
"No true man without generosity"?

574
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,260
It sounds so pretentious.

575
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,300
Am I right?

576
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,820
It's a good saying.

577
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,390
When I see the phrase,

578
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:51,310
I can imagine a brave and righteous man...

579
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,630
writing something on the paper.

580
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,440
The original saying is
"No true man is without cruelty."

581
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,790
Why did it become
"No true man is without generosity"?

582
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,210
People before our generation...

583
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,610
had high requirements
for sentence construction.

584
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,990
Therefore, they changed
"generosity" to "cruelty."

585
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,310
It sounds more catchy.

586
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,000
But most people do not realise
the true meaning.

587
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,630
Therefore,
"No true man is without generosity"...

588
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,400
turned into
"No true man is without cruelty".

589
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
He is good at making out
a good case for himself.

590
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:14,790
Sit down.

591
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,280
"No true man is without cruelty"...

592
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,199
has had an imperceptible influence...

593
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,920
on the principles of being human.

594
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,760
It has distorted some values as well.

595
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,920
If one is not cruel or evil,

596
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,100
is he not considered as a true man?

597
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,420
It's clear that this saying is harmful.

598
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,580
Confucius once said,

599
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,800
"Young people should be filial
to their parents at home..."

600
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,250
"and respectful to their brothers
when they are with them."

601
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,530
"They should be serious and trustworthy,"

602
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,850
"love the populace extensively and
be close to those who are humane."

603
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,840
"When all are done and
there is time for other things,"

604
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,440
"they should use it
for the study of the classics."

605
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,590
Therefore,

606
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,590
from now on,

607
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:09,090
we should forget about cruelty.

608
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,250
Remember the correct sayings.

609
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,120
"No gentleman has a petty mind",

610
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,270
"No true man is without generosity."

611
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,310
Well said!

612
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,080
["No gentleman has a petty mind".]

613
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,040
["No true man is without generosity."]

614
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,500
Come and take a look!

615
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,130
What is this? Let's take a look.

616
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,080
What is this?

617
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,240
-What is written there?
-What is going on?

618
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,200
What is wrong?

619
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,960
"An anonymous reported
to the council that..."

620
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,470
"students who come
from common families..."

621
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,450
"have bribed officials
to forge their status as a high born."

622
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,630
"The Council is conducting
an investigation on it."

623
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,210
"Those who have the information
may report to the Council."

624
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,120
Is this really true?

625
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,510
I don't think it's true.

626
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,040
Who do you think did that?

627
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,360
How would I know?

628
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,320
Brother Le Xuan.

629
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,320
Brother Le Xuan.

630
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,060
I didn't expect good news so soon.

631
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,120
Let's hear it.

632
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,400
I want to talk to President alone.

633
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,050
What is so secretive?

634
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,000
Right.

635
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,130
Leave us.

636
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,840
It's rare that Le Xuan wants
to talk to me in private.

637
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,740
Let's go.

638
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:23,850
Let's go.

639
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,300
Someone among the students
tried to pretend to be a high born.

640
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,460
Do you know who spread the news?

641
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,170
There must be a cause for an effect.

642
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,800
A cause for an effect?

643
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,800
What is the cause?

644
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,330
Some things can only be done by
the President.

645
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,520
Le Xuan,
I don't mean to criticise you...

646
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,360
but you are thinking too much.

647
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,480
Students from common families
trying to come off as high-borns.

648
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,450
It's not anything new.

649
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,050
If the hat doesn't belong to you,
why try so hard to put it on?

650
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,520
Don't you know...

651
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,530
how nicely I treat you?

652
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,790
I have always wanted to be
your best friend.

653
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,940
But you don't trust me.

654
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,320
Once Wen Bin leaves Yun Shang Academy,

655
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,600
you can have whatever you want.

656
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,840
I will fulfil all your wishes.

657
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,360
Don't worry.

658
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,800
I will make sure he leaves the school
within 10 days.

659
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,710
Sounds like you have a plan.

660
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,830
Of course.

661
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,080
All right.

662
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,150
I'll trust you for one last time.

663
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,670
If you fail again,

664
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,120
you better muster up the courage
to face your real identity.

665
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,640
I will cherish the chance.

666
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,720
Why are you drinking alone?

667
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,760
Does living in the world...

668
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:28,410
mean we can never do things that we like?

669
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:29,850
Am I right?

670
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:31,870
Yes.

671
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,210
However,

672
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,530
you can't be doing
what you don't enjoy all the time.

673
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,930
It's not something bad.

674
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,800
It's just that I don't like being coerced.

675
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,840
What's wrong?

676
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,920
What happened? Who is coercing you?

677
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,070
Is it Han Sheng Zhi?

678
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,920
Why is he forcing you? Tell me.

679
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,040
Darkness under the light.

680
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,390
What's wrong?

681
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,890
Do you realise that you are
becoming really weird?

682
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,760
What happened? Tell me.

683
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,240
Even if the sky is falling,
I will protect you.

684
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,250
Do you really think that you are almighty?

685
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,680
I will protect my own life.

686
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,300
Some people...

687
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,370
can see their future,

688
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,160
but they usually neglect things
that happen around them.

689
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,880
Some people understand others well...

690
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,490
but don't understand themselves.

691
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,870
Don't mock others.

692
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,680
Can't you talk properly?

693
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,460
Ze Xin, let me ask you.

694
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,380
If between Wen Bin and I,
only one could live,

695
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,480
who would you choose?

696
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,010
Why did you ask such question?

697
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,650
What life and death?

698
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,180
Both of you are living fine.

699
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,500
Why must I choose one?

700
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,080
Wen Bin has a special power, right?

701
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,030
When he first joined us,

702
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,350
everyone looked down on him.

703
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:58,390
However, as time passed,

704
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,280
everyone started to acknowledge him.

705
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,920
Do I sense jealousy from you?

706
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,520
Come, let's drink up.

707
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,800
Even if you are right,

708
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,180
it is not anything bad.

709
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,480
Let's drink.

710
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,240
What day is it?

711
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,870
-It's the seventh day of the month.
-The seventh?

712
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,130
No wonder he wasn't in a good mood.

713
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,440
Tomorrow is his birthday.

714
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,480
Birthday?

715
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,590
Whose birthday?

716
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:48,650
Yu Le Xuan.

717
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,110
It's his birthday?

718
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,110
Why is he upset before his birthday?

719
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,720
Is it because he feels reluctant to
spend money to host a party?

720
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,910
But judging from Le Xuan's personality,

721
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,650
I bet his birthday party would be lively.

722
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,070
I'm sure he'll invite me.

723
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,220
I have to get ready.

724
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,860
Stop making assumptions.

725
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,580
He hates celebrating his birthday.

726
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,360
Before his birthday,

727
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,190
he would get extremely grumpy.

728
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,940
So stay out of his way.

729
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,560
Everyone loves celebrating birthdays.

730
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,280
I love birthday celebrations.

731
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,930
Every year,

732
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,640
my mother would cook me
delicious birthday noodles.

733
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,450
There is always a huge sunny side-up egg

734
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,980
Not to forget my favourite braised pork!

735
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,020
It's the best!

736
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,710
He disowned his family a long time ago.

737
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,800
Therefore,

738
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,210
no one would cook birthday noodles...

739
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:48,050
sunny side-up eggs and braised pork for him.

740
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,550
Furthermore,

741
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,280
no one remembers his birthday
besides me.

742
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,660
I see.

743
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:55,910
Brother Ze Xin.

744
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,610
Do you know what Le Xuan likes?

745
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,540
Is there anything he craves?

746
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,300
Recently,

747
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,440
I think he's been eyeing
a house in the city.

748
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,500
You can consider it.

749
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,280
Is there anything else?

750
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,600
For example, some knick-knacks?

751
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,480
If he wants knick-knacks,
he can afford it himself.

752
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,000
Aren't you his friend?

753
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,140
Just tell me!

754
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,640
How about this?

755
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,200
Give Le Xuan the money
you made from selling books.

756
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,420
He will be happy for sure.

757
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,540
Maybe I'll sell you.

758
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,910
Do it if you can.

759
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,190
I have no comment.

760
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,400
Just give me a glass of wine
when I am sold.

761
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,870
Go sleep, you.

762
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,600
Brother Feng.

763
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,160
Brother Ze Xin told me that
tomorrow is Le Xuan's birthday.

764
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,010
But he is always in a bad mood
during his birthday.

765
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:47,370
I want to cheer him up.

766
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,780
Let's plan something for him.
