[Episode 18]

4
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:48,030
Have you made a wish?

5
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,450
I hear that wishing upon a shooting
star makes your wish come true.

6
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,600
Brother Wen Bin, why are
you behaving like a girl?

7
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,050
It's such nonsense.

8
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,240
Do you really believe it?

9
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,600
It costs nothing to make a wish.

10
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,280
Hurry up, make a wish now.

11
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,270
[I know this is too much to hope for,]

12
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,590
[but I still wish I can be
with Feng Cheng Jun...]

13
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,110
[forever and ever.]

14
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,090
What did you wish for?

15
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,210
Tell me yours first.

16
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,340
I made a wish...

17
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,680
that might never come true.

18
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,730
I wonder if the shooting star
could turn the impossible to possible.

19
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,090
What about you?

20
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,420
I wished for...

21
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,680
all your unfulfilled wishes to come true.

22
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,210
Then your wish must come true.

23
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,310
Brother Wen Bin, why aren't you moving?
You don't want to leave?

24
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,690
It would be so nice if I
could live on this island.

25
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,370
What's so special about this island?

26
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,440
There isn't any shelter
from the wind and rain.

27
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:53,920
Is it because you're feeling stressed...

28
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,680
over the upcoming exam,
so you don't want to leave?

29
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,850
Yes.

30
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,250
Brother Feng, help me with
studies when we go back.

31
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,420
Don't worry, I've got you covered.

32
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:05,970
Let's go.

33
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,470
Careful.

34
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,390
There is another box here.

35
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,050
Wen Bin,

36
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,570
that's so despicable of you.

37
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,370
Lady Han, why are you here?

38
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,730
Why I am here?

39
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,390
You know full well about it, don't you?

40
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,980
Brother Wen Bin, what's going on?

41
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,150
I don't know.

42
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,680
-Lady...
-Wen Bin,

43
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,500
I've seen too many people like you.

44
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,960
It's understandable that...

45
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,690
a student from a poor family like you...

46
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,490
become a social climber.

47
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,330
But you can't do such
dishonourable thing...

48
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,330
just because of that.

49
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,120
Lady Han, how could you say that?

50
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,700
What have Brother Wen Bin
done to offend you?

51
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,310
You...

52
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,590
You were supposed to
go to the island alone.

53
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,570
Just to watch shooting stars
on the island with you,

54
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,570
I even arranged a boatman for us.

55
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,180
He got in the way somehow.

56
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,420
I don't believe that...

57
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,060
you messed up my plan unknowingly.

58
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,650
Wen Bin,

59
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,490
my brother constantly picked on you...

60
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,860
because of Mu Xiao Man.

61
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,130
And I offended you verbally.

62
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,750
You can hate me for that.

63
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,860
But...

64
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,270
you can't just ruin my efforts
because of that.

65
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,760
Lady Han, you've misunderstood.

66
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,280
Stop explaining, I don't want to listen.

67
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,450
I advise you to remember your identity.

68
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,720
Even though you're a scholar of Yun Shang,

69
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,770
even though you're
sworn brother of Mr Feng,

70
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,490
you are still people of the lowest class.

71
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,950
-Lady...
-You can't stay in Yun Shang forever.

72
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,200
Yun Shang can't possibly be your shelter.

73
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,430
You'll need to leave one day.

74
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,250
You and us are not in the same boat.

75
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,050
Lady Han, how could you say that?

76
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,730
Maybe it was a misunderstanding.

77
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,520
Besides, even if Brother Wen Bin
hadn't come,

78
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,300
for Lady Han's reputation,

79
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,300
I would never go to the
island alone with you.

80
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,990
Yes.

81
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,170
Yes.

82
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,990
Feng Cheng Jun,

83
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,520
I can't believe that at the end,
you think that...

84
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,650
I'm just a woman who doesn't
care about her reputation.

85
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,760
Lady Han.

86
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,900
Have you been waiting here all night?

87
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,210
Yes.

88
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,790
I'll take you to the clinic.

89
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,210
Wen Bin, don't you come with us.

90
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,760
I don't want to see you.

91
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,870
Wen Bin, go back first.

92
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,159
I'll handle this.

93
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,490
Doctor, how is she?

94
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,130
She's fine. She just caught a cold.

95
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,490
I've prescribed her some medicine.

96
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,740
She should be fine...

97
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,730
after she takes the medicine
and get a good night's sleep.

98
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,160
Thank you, doctor.

99
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,370
Let's go.

100
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,480
Mr Feng.

101
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,850
Mr Feng, don't leave me.

102
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,270
How was your night, Brother Wen Bin?

103
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,290
What's wrong?

104
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,540
Did you get bullied?

105
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,130
Why do you look unhappy?

106
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,550
What's wrong? Tell me.

107
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,450
No matter how hard I try,

108
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,740
some things just don't work out.

109
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,660
I might as well let it go.

110
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,340
You've always been optimistic.

111
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,410
Why would you say something
so dispirited suddenly?

112
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,840
Such as background,

113
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,930
such as the disparity
between family status,

114
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,370
I can't change those
no matter how hard I try,

115
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,410
can I?

116
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,160
Why can't you change it?

117
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,550
Look at you and Feng Cheng Jun,

118
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,550
you two came from totally
different backgrounds.

119
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,350
Yet you two still...

120
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,040
became brothers, haven't you?

121
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,640
Isn't that a change?

122
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,750
It's a change.

123
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,070
But that's the end of it.

124
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,990
We can't take another step forward.

125
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:45,890
[Looks like I did the
right thing this time.]

126
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,930
[Wen Bin do have a secret
crush on Feng Cheng Jun.]

127
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,580
I just felt that the wonders
in the sky last night...

128
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,690
was so magnificent.

129
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,920
Why am I talking nonsense?

130
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,550
So...

131
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,450
did you make a wish last night?

132
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,210
I took your words. I made a wish.

133
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,020
But I feel that that wish
would never come true.

134
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,050
Right.

135
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,560
It's just a legend.

136
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,120
Miracle doesn't always happen.

137
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,830
Wen Bin...

138
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,950
I must be out of my mind.

139
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,470
Even if Feng Cheng Jun likes Wen Bin too,

140
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,940
it's impossible for them to be together.

141
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,790
I won't get involved
in it again next time.

142
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,270
Lady Han, are you feeling better?

143
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,850
Have you been staying here?

144
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,390
Yes, I've informed your family...

145
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,420
to set their mind at ease.

146
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,460
Someone will come later
to take care of you.

147
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,850
I have acted rashly just now.

148
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,730
Please forgive me.

149
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,580
I still want to make it clear to you.

150
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,210
I'm flattered...

151
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,930
that you like me.

152
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,050
But you and I are different people.

153
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,170
I hope that Lady Han could
stop wasting your time on me.

154
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,360
Feng Cheng Jun!

155
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,450
Why are you rejecting me?

156
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,490
We come from the same family background,
we're about the same age.

157
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,050
I might not be the most beautiful girl,

158
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,730
but I'm not ugly.

159
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,770
You said we are different people.

160
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,210
Tell me then,
what can I do to make us the same?

161
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,510
Lady Han,

162
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,940
for my marriage,

163
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,370
I don't care about family
background and looks.

164
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,970
What I look for in my marriage
is mutual understanding...

165
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,970
and someone like-minded with me.

166
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,370
Like a couple, like best friends.

167
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,420
She should have an independent character.

168
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,260
I'm not telling you these...

169
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,050
to ask you to change yourself for me.

170
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,750
About yesterday,

171
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,390
I would like to apologise to you
on behalf of Brother Wen Bin.

172
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,860
He made a mistake,

173
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,300
but it wasn't all his fault.

174
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,110
It was because of my
lack of consideration.

175
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,470
I should've made it clear to you earlier.

176
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,320
Please forgive me, Lady Han.

177
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,490
Mr Feng,

178
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,400
you keep rejecting me.

179
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,040
Is it because you already have
someone you like?

180
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,830
Young Lady.

181
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,490
Young Lady.

182
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,710
Young Lady, what happened to you?

183
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,870
Are you all right?

184
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,490
Are you all right?

185
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,670
-Since Miss Xiao Qin has returned,
-Young Lady...

186
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,870
then I shall leave now.

187
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,030
Young Lady,

188
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,470
aren't you supposed to spend
time with Mr Feng on the island?

189
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,920
Why are you here in the clinic?

190
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,470
Young Lady.

191
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,610
Xiao Qin,

192
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,890
starting today,

193
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,310
I will become a woman with
independent character.

194
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,910
Independent character?

195
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,390
What is an independent character?

196
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,740
Brother Feng.

197
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,530
How is Lady Han?

198
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,570
Her fever is gone.
She should be fine now.

199
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,870
Brother Feng, don't blame me.

200
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,190
I didn't know she would wait
for all night on the shore.

201
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,640
Brother Wen Bin, tell me honestly.

202
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,190
Did you really not know?

203
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,240
Are you suspecting me, Brother Feng?

204
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,960
That's not what I meant.

205
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,880
That's exactly what you meant.

206
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,490
You are suspecting me.

207
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,810
Yes, a little bit.

208
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,550
I'll stop suspecting you
once you explain it.

209
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,740
The reason you would suspect me...

210
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,000
must be because
you believe Lady Han's words.

211
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,110
That I would do anything to
cling to the powerful and rich.

212
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,520
Of course not.

213
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,000
Don't worry, Brother Feng.

214
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,350
I might come from a poor family,

215
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,070
but I would never do anything
that is against my conscience...

216
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,970
for my own personal gain.

217
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,170
Of course, I know that.

218
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,590
And I know that she's gone too far.

219
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,050
But...

220
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,430
she waited a whole night out there,
and she had a fever.

221
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,910
That's why she was talking nonsense.

222
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,310
Don't take it to the heart.

223
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,190
Brother Feng, are you apologising
on behalf of Lady Han?

224
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,790
In what identity
are you apologising to me on her behalf?

225
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,790
Brother Wen Bin, you're overthinking this.

226
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,710
I know that you have
prejudice against her...

227
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,030
because of Mu Xiao Man.

228
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,820
But I'll take care of
what happened between us.

229
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,420
Just stay out of this.

230
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,920
You are right.

231
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,690
Don't force your beliefs on others.

232
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:55,100
What I told you before applies to me now.

233
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,920
Brother Feng, I won't pry into
your business anymore.

234
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,900
Brother Wen Bin, you
misunderstood me again.

235
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,190
I didn't.

236
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,730
I did cross the line.

237
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,320
Young Lady, you must
pull yourself together.

238
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,070
Wen Bin and Mu Xiao Man will gloat
seeing you like this.

239
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,100
Young Lady.

240
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,090
Young Lady.

241
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,530
It's exhausting to be in love.

242
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,670
It's like...

243
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,030
a journey full of uncertainties.

244
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,030
Nothing works no matter what you do.

245
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,760
Young Lady, I heard that there is...

246
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,720
a storyteller from Gui
at Mu Lai Bookstore.

247
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,910
He's said to be picky with
the identity of his listeners.

248
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,950
Only those of noble class and
influential officials are allowed in.

249
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,160
I also heard that...

250
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,070
the stories he tells are even
better than the dialogue novel.

251
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,430
Let's go together.

252
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,990
Maybe...

253
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,640
it could help you forget
all your problems.

254
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,380
Where is Brother Wen Bin?

255
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,750
I don't know. I haven't seen him all day.

256
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,490
You're back.

257
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,490
What's wrong?

258
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,760
I'm going to bed.

259
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,250
Did you guys have a fight?

260
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,210
No.

261
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,750
Here, Lady Han.

262
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,910
This way, please.

263
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:15,970
There are so many people.

264
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:19,150
No matter who you are,

265
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,869
you can never forget
once you hear Mr Qin's tales.

266
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,710
You've come to the right place today.

Please have a seat.

Enjoy your food and drinks.

are classmates and best friends.

They study together for three years.

278

They admire each other's literary talent.

See, I told you so.

Goodbye, Brother Cheng Jun. Let's go.

302

Forget it.

303
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,270
He's such a boring guy, he doesn't
even want to join us for a drink.

304
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,340
He has no spirit of friendship,

305
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,420
if he keeps acting like this.

306
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,810
He always rejected our invitation.

307
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,000
Forget about him. Let's enjoy our night.

308
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,650
Isn't it less fun if Wen Bin doesn't come?

309
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,350
Why doesn't he like to drink?

310
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,040

That's right.

I think...

318
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,950
Brother Cheng Jun must be worried
that we would get Wen Bin drunk.

319

334
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,530
[I don't care about family
background and looks.]

335
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,850
[She should have an
independent character.]

336
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,830
You are so knowledgable.

337
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,310
May I become your pupil?

338
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,770
Mr Qin,

339
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,610
Lady Han is the
daughter of the Han family.

340
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,250
Lady Han, is that really
what you wish for?

341
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,210
Are you saying yes?

342
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,170
Please sit down first.

343
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,880
I'll only sit down after you agree.

344
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,810
To become my pupil,

345
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:50,970
I have three conditions.

346
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,440
It's fine for me even if
you have 30 conditions.

347
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,770
But I can only learn from you,

348
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,850
I can't be a storyteller like you.

349
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,810
Of course, you're a lady.

350
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,290
Besides, no lady becomes a storyteller.

351
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,490
Why can't lady be a storyteller?

352
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,690
I want to be a storyteller.

353
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,010
Even if I could only
tell stories in the room.

354
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,370
I just want to prove that...

355
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,450
anything a man can do,

356
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,730
a woman can do it too.

357
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,610
In fact, a woman can do it even better.

358
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:22,050
This is the custom of Yun.

359
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,970
Sometimes,

360
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,470
it's even more deeply rooted than the law.

361
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,730
Some people with noble aspirations
want to change this stereotype,

362
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,420
though they have to pay the price...

363
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,330
with their lives.

364
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,650
But if we are clear that
certain things are wrong,

365
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,170
of course, we need to change it.

366
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,900
Mr Qin, you and our Young Lady...

367
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,760
are destined to be teacher and student.

368
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,180
If only Young Lady has met you sooner.

369
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,970
Sir, tell us your conditions first.

370
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,490
All right.

371
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,300
My first condition is...

372
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,620
I only take the lady of a noble family
as my pupil.

373
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,990
Second,

374
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,680
you're not allowed to
tell anyone about me.

375
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:08,670
Third,

376
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,070
you have to be willing to endure hardship.

377
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,260
You can't give up halfway.

378
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,110
Hold this.

379
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,750
You are the best teacher
I could ever ask for.

380
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,290
-Here we go.
-Cheers.

381
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,570
Stop drinking for a bit. At least
clink your cup against ours first.

382
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,780
Good wine, good wine.

383
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,810
Seriously, Brother Cheng Jun,

384
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,050
what's the point of you being here...

385
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,370
if you are not going to drink?

386
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,730
Xiao Huan,

387
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,570
it's a pity that...

388
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,130
Brother Cheng Jun...

389
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,450
doesn't understand the
pleasure of drinking.

390
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,270
About drinking, listen to me.

391
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:51,250
Do you not know that
life is full of joy and sorrow?

392
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,630
It's bittersweet.

393
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:56,690
You can only understand the true
meaning of your life after drinking.

394
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:00,170
To seek the authentic
feelings from deep inside.

395
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,060
Listen to him.

396
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,560
Say something you don't dare
to say when you're sober.

397
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,010
True.

398
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,220
-Cheers.
-Let's all get drunk tonight.

399
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,230
Sure.

400
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,370
-Let's get drunk.
-Here.

401
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,010
Everyone, cheers.

402
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,670
You can tell us all your problems.

403
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,250
We are all classmates here.

404
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,680
You can share it with us.

405
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,370
I don't have any problems. It's just
that I don't hold my liquor very well.

406
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,950
I'd better not drink.

407
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,730
Brother Wen Bin,

408
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,200
don't drink too much.

409
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,710
Wen Bin,

410
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,330
is something bothering you?

411
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,400
Nothing is bothering me.

412
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,080
I just want to drink.

413
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:35,890
It doesn't feel that way.

414
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,450
Seeing him drinking like this,

415
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,770
something must've been bothering him.

416
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,910
If something is bothering you,

417
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,670
you can tell us.

418
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,210
-We can give you some advice.
-That's right.

419
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,170
Don't keep it all inside.

420
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,290
That's right.

421
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,180
Wen Bin, you are using alcohol...

422
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,890
to suppress your agony.

423
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,640
Brother Wen Bin, you drank too much.

424
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,810
Stop drinking.

425
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,340
I'm fine.

426
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,450
Don't worry.

427
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,650
I just want to get drunk tonight.

428
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,080
Let me tell you.

429
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,410
He'll spill it out once
he has a few more drinks.

430
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,410
Fine.

431
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,990
If you want to get drunk,
I'll drink with you.

432
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:41,450
Good, that's the real man.

433
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,170
Brother Cheng Jun, good for you.

434
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,340
Enjoy wine and songs while we can,
for life is short.

435
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,970
Let's all get drunk tonight.

436
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,530
Drink your wine.

437
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,490
Here.

438
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,140
Cheers.

439
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,390
Brother Zhao Rong,

440
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,280
if I'm not mistaken,

441
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,300
are they competing to
see who can drink more?

442
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,330
Yes.

443
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,350
Something is bothering him too.

444
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,410
Slow down, slow down.

445
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,680
-Cheng Jun.
-Look at him.

446
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,760
[Mingren Tavern]

447
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,530
Hold him.

448
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,730
-Slow down.
-I want to drink more.

449
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,970
Sit here.

450
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,130
Goodbye, Sir. Do come again.

451
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,530
Eat meat and drink wine...

452
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,050
-while God remains in the heart.
-Sit tight.

453
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,580
-Remains in the heart.
-Fellow brothers.

454
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,450
Let's go back together.

455
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,570
Fellow brothers,

456
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:46,930
I need to sit here for a while.

457
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,580
You guys go back first.

458
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,540
You're not going?

459
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,850
Goodbye, Feng Cheng Jun.

460
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,880
Slow down.

461
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,450
-Let's go.
-Good for you.

462
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,080
-Goodbye.
-Watch where you're going.

463
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,880
-Watch it.
-Are you all right?

464
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,170
Wait for me.

465
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,730
They are all drunk.

466
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,640
Aren't you drunk too?

467
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,720
-No, I'm not.
-All right, it's getting late.

468
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,950
Let's go now.

469
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,240
Watch out.

470
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,300
-Let's go.
-I need to sit down.

471
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,120
-Sit down.
-Fine.

472
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,430
Don't sit here.

473
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,590
It's fine.

474
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,940
Hold on to it then. Hold on tight.

475
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,760
Hold on tight.

476
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,700
Brother Feng, you've been
a disciplined person.

477
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,460
How are you drunk?

478
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,340
I'm not drunk. I can still drink.

479
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,330
Brother Wen Bin,

480
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,460
you look so frail,

481
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,300
how did you hold your liquor well?

482
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,570
Brother Feng,

483
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,260
do I look like a woman to you?

484
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,860
Look carefully.

485
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,500
You do.

486
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,720
But you're my brother.

487
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,420
Don't be afraid of what others would say.

488
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,640
Being pretty is not your fault, right?

489
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,310
Why aren't you talking?

490
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,300
Are you still angry about
what happened with Lady Han?

491
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,770
That's just a misunderstanding.
Is this necessary?

492
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,400
You look like a woman.

493
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,960
But don't think like a woman.

494
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,950
Who says that a woman's
not better than a man?

495
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,880
Looks like it's not that easy
to ask for gender equality.

496
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,890
This secular mindset is
just like a mountain.

497
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,570
Brother Feng, is this really...

498
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,180
how you look at women?

499
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,280
No.

500
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,310
I think you're right.

501
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,880
I don't like it...

502
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,360
when Lady Han said
you're not a good person.

503
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,920
Brother Feng, you're a fine man.

504
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,320
Indeed.

505
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,600
Only a girl from a good family background
can be a good match for you.

506
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:04,000
Lady Han comes from a prominent family,

507
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,460
she's a suitable match for you.

508
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,660
Forget about Lady Han.

509
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,750
The most important thing for us is
to become a government official.

510
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,590
And make a change in Yun.

511
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,630
As a man,

512
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,990
we should be ambitious,

513
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,130
do you understand?

514
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,220
What if I can't be a government official?

515
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:25,000
You're saying something like this again,

516
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,920
you will be a government official.

517
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,360
What are you thinking? I believe in you.

518
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,510
Brother Feng, you always say that.

519
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,830
But nothing is definite.

520
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,850
Brother Wen Bin,

521
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,390
you are my best friend.

522
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,800
My soulmate.

523
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,360
My sworn brother.

524
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,670
Let's help each other out
for the rest of our lives.

525
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,710
Stop overthinking about this,

526
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,520
please?

527
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,320
[Hearing you say that,]

528
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,480
[I'll just be your brother then.]

529
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,150
[As long as I can be with you.]

530
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,470
It's midnight.

531
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,420
It's midnight.

532
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,780
It's midnight?

533
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,400
It's midnight now.

534
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,460
Brother Feng.

535
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
Let's go.

536
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,880
Get up, let's go back.

537
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,590
Get up, let's go.

538
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,240
Brother Feng.

539
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,480
Brother Feng.

540
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,700
[Su Wen Medical Shelter]

541
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,640
Please spare my life, good man.

542
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,880
Please spare my life.

543
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,560
Come with me.

544
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,280
Please spare my life, good man.

545
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,600
You almost killed me last time.

546
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,210
Why would I spare your life?

547
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,960
Don't kill me, good man.

548
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,970
What do you want to know?

549
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,490
I'll tell you everything.

550
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,520
Who was the mastermind back then?

551
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,880
About that...

552
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,310
I don't know.

553
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,440
Then how did you escape?

554
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,440
Commander Mu Jiang tipped me off.

555
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,000
He told me to run,
that was how I survived.

556
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,420
Looks like you've opted for the hard way.

557
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
Lei Qi Ying.

558
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,200
Lei Qi Ying is the executioner.

559
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,420
He's tracking us and
our families down to kill us.

560
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,400
You're lying.

561
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,840
I'm not.

562
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,240
My master, Xue Ding Kun's wife and child
were killed by Lei Qi Ying.

563
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,260
You can investigate it
if you don't believe me.

564
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,200
How could this be?

565
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,460
How could this be?

566
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,120
You're lying!

567
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,300
You're lying!

568
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,060
I really didn't!

569
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,160
Please don't kill me, please.

570
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,200
Get lost.

571
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,840
Thank you.

572
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,320
Thank you.

573
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,870
Thank goodness the door is still open.

574
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,080
Hurry up, carry him inside.

575
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:13,960
All right.

576
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,100
Here.

577
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,670
-Slowly.
-Slowly.

578
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,760
Watch it.

579
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,490
What's wrong?

580
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,190
Wen Bin.

581
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,420
That's too bad.

582
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,900
You've bumped into us.

583
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,240
So what?

584
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,430
Today is the open day, the
door is still open.

585
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,180
-Get out of the way.
-Wen Bin,

586
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:47,040
are you trying to bring alcohol
back to the academy again?

587
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,120
I'm not, get out of the way.

588
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,070
Let's go.

589
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,400
We need to search the sedan chair...

590
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:55,610
to check if there is any alcohol.

591
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,440
Search it then, do it fast.

592
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,600
-That's right.
-Bing Shen, search it.

593
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,600
I'm on it.

594
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,530
What should we do now?

595
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,460
Wen Bin,

596
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,600
congratulations.

597
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,400
You've broken the rules again.

598
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,800
Congratulations.

599
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,350
Lei Ze Xin, what are you doing?

600
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,770
Why did you hit him?

601
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,570
Senior.

602
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,950
Let's go now.

603
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,200
Lei Ze Xin,

604
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,730
do you have any idea hitting us will...

605
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:44,910
Brother Feng.

606
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,660
Lei Ze Xin, you...

607
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,030
Senior, let him go.

608
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,070
Senior.

609
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,590
This is outrageous of you two.

610
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,480
Master Wang has sent us a letter.

611
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,449
He said the imperial court is
satisfied with Yun Shang's teaching.

612
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,350
Now I'm getting closer to my dream.

613
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:30,480
I'm so happy.

614
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,120
Congratulations, Principal.

615
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,080
Thank you.

616
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,090
Principal.

617
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,719
Mr Li,

618
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,949
are you here to congratulate me too?

619
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,600
I'm afraid...

620
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,080
I'll have to disappoint you.

621
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,560
Wen Bin and Feng Cheng Jun...

622
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,290
came back late last night after drinking.

623
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,840
I'm here to ask your instruction
about this matter.

624
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,219
What's there to instruct?

625
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,860
Just deduct their nobility marks.

626
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,280
Feng Cheng Jun still
have points to deduct.

627
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,400
But Wen Bin has repeatedly
broken the rules.

628
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,920
Based on Student Council's record,

629
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,840
his issues can't simply be solved...

630
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,800
by just deducting points.

631
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,960
What?

632
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,330
And there is also Lei Ze Xin.

633
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,690
What did he do?

634
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,920
He hit his fellow classmates last night.

635
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,280
Interrogation Hall must give
them severe punishment for this.

636
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,470
Severe punishment?

637
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,960
Without deducting nobility mark,

638
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,540
what are the other options then?

639
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,860
Paddling?

640
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:31,150
Why did you drink so much?

641
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,420
Brother Cheng Jun, Brother Cheng Jun,

642
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,130
get up now, get up.

643
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,300
What's wrong?

644
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,500
What did you do last night?

645
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,500
What about last night? I don't remember.

646
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,530
Nevermind.

647
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,540
Wen Bin and Lei Ze Xin...

648
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,820
are going to be paddled
in Interrogation Hall now.

649
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,100
What do you people want?

650
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,380
According to the academy's rule,

651
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,970
Wen Bin, Lei Ze Xin, have
repeatedly broken the rules.

652
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,340
And they are unrepentant.

653
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,780
Wen Bin will be beaten
on his palm for 20 times.

654
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,060
Paddling 20 times.

655
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,750
Paddling?

656
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,340
Lei Ze Xin will be beaten
on his palm for 50 times.

657
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,340
Paddling 30 times.

658
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,400
Paddling?

659
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,220
President, don't punish me.
I know I made a mistake.

660
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,780
All of you,

661
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,840
I'll take Wen Bin's punishment for him.

662
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,330
Punish me if you dare.

663
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,980
Lei Ze Xin,

664
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,380
are you sure you want to
bear Wen Bin's punishment?

665
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,220
According to the rules of the academy,

666
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,340
punishment will be doubled
if you bear it for someone.

667
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,480
Lei Ze Xin,

668
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,110
you should know that...

669
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,460
the human body can only endure...

670
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,940
30 times of paddling.

671
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,700
You already got 30 times
of paddling for yourself.

672
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,610
If you want to take Wen Bin's punishment,

673
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:42,940
then adding with 40 times of paddling,

674
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,550
it'll be 70 times in total.

675
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,810
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

676
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,260
You have no way to save yourself,

677
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,580
yet you still want to protect others,

678
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,190
such a joke.

679
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,290
I advise you...

680
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,610
better accept your punishment on your own.

681
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,590
Wait a moment.

682
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,180
Mr Li, President,

683
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,020
I would like to take Wen Bin's punishment.

684
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,710
Feng Cheng Jun.

685
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,480
Are you worried now?

686
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,850
Do you want to get a
taste of paddling too?

687
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,540
That's enough.

688
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,180
I've said it just now.

689
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,940
The human body can only
endure 30 times of paddling.

690
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,390
If you want to be punished
on Wen Bin's behalf,

691
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,740
that will be 40 times.

692
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,620
There are 10 times more.

693
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,460
So even if you want to
take Wen Bin's punishment,

694
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,230
he still needs to be paddled for 10 times.

695
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,060
Mr Li,

696
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,340
Wen Bin's health has
been weak since young,

697
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,780
he won't be able to take such punishment.

698
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,630
I am willing to take 40 times of paddling.

699
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,270
That's how a brother should act like.

700
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,190
Punishment is an admonition
within a reasonable range.

701
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,360
I don't care about how you all are...

702
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,190
standing out to take the
punishment for Wen Bin.

703
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,420
You're free to do that,

704
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,300
but the rules must be complied with.

705
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:00,150
Brother Wen Bin, you
will need to endure...

706
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,790
the remaining 10 times.

707
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:03,920
Wait a minute.

708
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,460
The remaining ten times of paddling,

709
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,660
I'll take it.

710
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,990
Last time,

711
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,870
Wen Bin has given me a
memorable birthday celebration.

712
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,190
Consider this as a return of his favour.

713
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,510
After this, we'll owe each other nothing.

714
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,100
I hope President can forgive me,

715
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,460
I'll obey you from now on.

716
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,300
Fine.

717
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,160
Le Xuan,

718
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:37,530
you must keep your words.

719
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,340
You're returning the favour
more than he deserves.

720
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,860
You're loyal.

721
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,700
This way I'll be able to continue...

722
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,500
to follow you with my mind at ease.
