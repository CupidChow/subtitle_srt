1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,800
Boss

2
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:11,700
Boss

3
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:16,200
Boss, I'm begging you, let me down.

4
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:18,266
Boss

5
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:19,266
Boss

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,500
Boss, do you want money or my body?

7
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,900
Don't leave me hanging, let me down!

8
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:28,233
My surname is Jin. I'm Jin Xuehua.

9
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,133
Boss, did you kidnap the wrong person?

10
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:32,066
Boss

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,900
Help!

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,433
Help!

13
00:01:34,366 --> 00:01:35,100
Boss

14
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,500
Boss

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,500
Boss, is there some misunderstanding between us?

16
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:39,333
Boss

17
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,233
Boss

18
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:43,966
Boss

19
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,733
I didn't really understand a saying before:

20
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:06,866
using the wrong means

21
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,366
will never achieve the true goal.

22
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,933
Until this incident with Jin Xuehua happened,

23
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,433
I finally realized

24
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:16,600
that once you cross the legal boundary,

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,000
it only leads to my doom.

26
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:29,200
Welcome to Xuehua Divination.

27
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:29,833
Jin Xuehua.

28
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,366
Welcome to Xuehua Divination.

29
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:37,366
Jin Xuehua.

30
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:54,900
Stop!

31
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:55,600
Come back!

32
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,333
Come back!

33
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,333
Stop!

34
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:16,533
Stop!

35
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:20,700
You little brat!

36
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:21,300
Stop!

37
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:23,700
Don't come over here!

38
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:24,900
Stay back!

39
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,733
You running?

40
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:26,700
I'll beat you to death!

41
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,733
Hit me again and I'll call the police!

42
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:29,066
You? Call the police?

43
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,133
You're Trespassing!

44
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,700
I can beat you with no consequences, you know that?

45
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:34,566
I just owe you guys some money, don't I?

46
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,800
And you chased me all the way home?

47
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:36,533
No, wait a minute.

48
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:37,066
Wait a minute, Bro.

49
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:38,033
No, no.

50
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:39,600
We seem to have a misunderstanding.

51
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,433
I'm not here to ask you for money.

52
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:42,633
I'm here looking for Jin Xuehua.

53
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:44,600
I'm the Top donor in her live stream!

54
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,900
Lone Wolf of the North!

55
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,533
Jin Xuehua gave me your address!

56
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:51,300
She actually told me to come yesterday.

57
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:52,966
You wanted to come yesterday?

58
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,733
Right.

59
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,666
I wasn't home yesterday.

60
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:56,766
What do you want to do?

61
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,100
Boss, no, wait a second.

62
00:03:58,133 --> 00:03:59,166
It's not what you think.

63
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:01,266
Jin Xuehua and I just have a partnership.

64
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:04,233
I... I... I'm a live-streaming shill.

65
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:05,000
What shill?

66
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,900
It means spending money in her live stream,

67
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,400
then waiting for fans to follow suit,

68
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,566
and when they start spending too,

69
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,333
when she settles the accounts, she returns my

70
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:12,266
principal back to me.

71
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:14,033
And I split the rest 30-70 with Jin Xuehua.

72
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,166
An Instigator.

73
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,700
Just trying to make a living, Boss.

74
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:21,833
Jin Xuehua isn't home.

75
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:22,600
Get lost.

76
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:25,966
Boss.

77
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,866
The money I transferred to Jin Xuehua

78
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,433
was company funds I embezzled.

79
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:32,666
If I don't pay it back on time, I'm dead.

80
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:33,966
I'll get sued.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,233
Boss, I beg you.

82
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:37,233
Can you help me contact Jin Xuehua?

83
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:50,900
Why isn't she answering?

84
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:53,733
Boss.

85
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:56,533
How long has it been since you contacted Jin Xuehua?

86
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,200
Could something have happened to her?

87
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,100
Just now when I went into your house,

88
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:02,233
your door wasn't even locked.

89
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,166
And on that table in your house,

90
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,633
there seemed to be blood.

91
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,666
Blood?

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,866
Hello?

93
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,200
Your delivery has arrived.

94
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,133
The intercom is broken. Just leave it downstairs.

95
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,200
Calling again without delivering it.

96
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,900
Look, there's blood on this.

97
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:55,433
So much blood.

98
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:56,733
Alright, alright, stop yapping.

99
00:08:59,966 --> 00:09:00,466
Boss.

100
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,166
I haven't introduced myself yet.

101
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,166
I am Xiao Longzhou.

102
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,533
Boss, what is your relationship with Jin Xuehua?

103
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,333
What's it to you?

104
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:10,500
Call the police, quick.

105
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:12,033
We can't call the police.

106
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,900
Why?

107
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:15,266
We don't have any clues right now.

108
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:16,833
Calling the police now is useless.

109
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,133
At the very least, you need to provide the police with some clues.

110
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,200
Think about it.

111
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:21,766
Where could Jin Xuehua have gone?

112
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,033
Is there any surveillance footage or something?

113
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:35,900
Sis.

114
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:38,500
Just let me take a look at the surveillance footage.

115
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:41,133
I haven't been able to reach Jin Xuehua all day.

116
00:09:41,366 --> 00:09:42,300
In a couple of days,

117
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,633
I'll get you a big new light box.

118
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,500
I guarantee your business will be booming.

119
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:47,133
Just let me see it.

120
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:50,666
Look.

121
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,300
I didn't say you couldn't look.

122
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,466
How's this new nightgown Sis bought?

123
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,333
Here on a business trip?

124
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:00,500
Right.

125
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:05,933
Baby.

126
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:08,266
These are all trade secrets.

127
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:10,166
I have to be responsible to my clients.

128
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:12,033
This is all private info.

129
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:12,866
You know?

130
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:18,266
You work out, Bro?

131
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:19,400
Not really.

132
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,333
If I were to leak this out,

133
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:23,200
my reputation would be ruined.

134
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,000
Who would dare leak it?

135
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,833
Who dares?

136
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,833
I'd be the first to disagree.

137
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,833
I'll just take a couple of looks.

138
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,000
Besides,

139
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,833
even if the whole world starves,

140
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,266
it wouldn't happen to you, Sister Hong.

141
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
Look at you, Sister Hong.

142
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,933
Tall, long legs.

143
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,200
Beautiful and kind-hearted.

144
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:41,133
Great figure, too.

145
00:10:41,566 --> 00:10:42,900
The key is, your technique is good too.

146
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:46,833
My technique is good?

147
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:47,766
How do you know?

148
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:51,700
Industry reputation?

149
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:53,566
They say you offer conscientious service.

150
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:55,166
Want to see?

151
00:10:56,933 --> 00:10:57,633
Fine.

152
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,266
Just as well.

153
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:00,966
You can do an on-site inspection too.

154
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,700
See how your Sis's technique

155
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:03,766
really is.

156
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:05,533
Sis, Sis, Sis.
