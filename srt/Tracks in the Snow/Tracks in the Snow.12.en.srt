1
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:39,466
Boss

2
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,533
When I saw them

3
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:43,666
Jin Xuehua

4
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,200
she was performing a ritual for Lao Wei's daughter

5
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:49,666
Isn't that crazy?

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,866
Does Jin Xuehua have magical power?

7
00:00:51,866 --> 00:00:52,266
Boss

8
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:53,966
don't you know?

9
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,533
Once Lao Wei finds out

10
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,000
that Jin Xuehua can't save his daughter

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,033
he'll be a ticking time bomb

12
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:02,900
He'll... he'll explode

13
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:04,700
Boss, think about it

14
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,133
Are there any clues left

15
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,433
to find Jin Xuehua?

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,800
Dayu

17
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,133
Nothing bad will happen, right?

18
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:26,900
Don't worry

19
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:28,700
I'll definitely find the money this time

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,233
I'm saying, just in case

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,233
in case something goes wrong

22
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,466
I'll go to the Floating market to find Aunt

23
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,200
If you can't reach me

24
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:38,666
let's meet up there

25
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,433
The Floating market in the suburbs

26
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,033
Take... take me with you

27
00:01:51,033 --> 00:01:51,400
Boss

28
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,333
What are you doing?

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,233
You're still targeting Jin Xuehua?

30
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,300
I want to help

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,066
How can you help?

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,266
I really have to help now

33
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:03,300
I need to save myself

34
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,600
They are looking for me

35
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,233
I just want to find Jin Xuehua now

36
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:13,133
At least if we meet

37
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,500
we can talk things over

38
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:16,500
Boss

39
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:17,533
trust me

40
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,000
I can't stay

41
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,666
here any longer

42
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,100
Once I find Jin Xuehua

43
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:25,933
I'll leave

44
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,033
Believe me

45
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:28,266
Besides

46
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:30,533
two people

47
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:32,900
are better than one, right?

48
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:35,633
I can be of help

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,800
I'll trust you one more time

50
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:54,366
Tell me what trouble you got into

51
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,800
I was greedy

52
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:03,800
I wanted to make some quick money

53
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,266
Bullshit

54
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:05,700
Who doesn't want quick money?

55
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:06,933
What exactly happened?

56
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,433
Well, I...

57
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,233
am just a cashier

58
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,500
Xiao

59
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,866
The boss said tonight

60
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:24,100
we must transfer those payments to them

61
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:26,233
Yeah

62
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,233
But the head office hasn't paid us

63
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:30,433
so how can I transfer anything?

64
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,933
Doesn't our boss have many accounts?

65
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:35,200
Just move some funds and it's done

66
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,666
Exactly, just move some funds and it's done

67
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,133
Brothers and sisters, can you give me a Porsche?

68
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:51,466
If you do, I can give you a tarot reading.

69
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:53,033
I can also give you an amulet.

70
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:56,400
To bless you all with safety and big money this year.

71
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:02,033
Thank you, Brother Long.

72
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,166
Thanks, Brother Long.

73
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:04,666
Let's follow each other.

74
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,233
There's a special gift if we do.

75
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,300
I knew it.

76
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,233
You're not a decent person.

77
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:09,100
And then?

78
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,300
So I sent her some gifts.

79
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,100
Nonsense. Old perverts always send gifts first.

80
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,666
And then?

81
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,133
She asked to meet me.

82
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:15,266
You met?

83
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:16,233
Where did you go?

84
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,333
Did you get a room?

85
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,100
Did you get a room?

86
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,300
No.

87
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:18,833
Where did you get a room?

88
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:19,400
Where did you get a room?

89
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,533
It was just a financial transaction between us.

90
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
You actually paid?

91
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,066
You must be pretty rich.

92
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,100
Not that kind of financial transaction.

93
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,300
Listen to me finish.

94
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,100
Speak.

95
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:29,133
She said she could... she could...

96
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,366
Buy gifts from the platform at a low price.

97
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:33,433
Then I sent her money during her PK battles.

98
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:35,100
You know about me and Jin Xuehua running a scam together.

99
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,900
Boss.

100
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,633
You mean...

101
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:42,200
You just took the company's money...

102
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,033
And sent her gifts during Jin Xuehua's livestream...

103
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:46,600
To be the Top donor in her stream?

104
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,233
Yes.

105
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:49,033
The boss wouldn't know anyway.

106
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,100
As long as I put the money back on time.

107
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:53,966
Unless...

108
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:56,366
Jin Xuehua didn't send the money back to me on time.

109
00:04:57,633 --> 00:04:58,833
I'm not lying to you about this.

110
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,766
If I really didn't put that money back...

111
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:01,566
I'd be dead meat.

112
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,966
Jin Xuehua owes you money.

113
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,300
You could go ask her for it.

114
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:08,766
No need to kidnap her, right?

115
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,566
That's about another thing I worked on with Jin Xuehua.

116
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,800
There's more?

117
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,600
I knew you weren't that simple.

118
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,833
What else is there? Speak.

119
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,266
That was at the beginning of the year.

120
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,766
Just over a month after I met Jin Xuehua.

121
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:24,866
This big boss is called Brother Feng.

122
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:28,200
He holds land development projects worth hundreds of millions.

123
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,466
He needs to choose from these projects...

124
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:32,866
A plot of land to develop.

125
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,200
He thought I knew a bit about metaphysics.

126
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,566
Do I actually understand it?

127
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:37,800
I don't understand a thing.

128
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:39,400
You want me to teach you?

129
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,033
No need to teach.

130
00:05:42,366 --> 00:05:43,533
I want you...

131
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:46,666
To help him pick out this plot of land.

132
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,466
Darn it.

133
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,933
You'll get two hundred thousand when it's done.

134
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:54,933
Two hundred thousand.

135
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,666
We split it thirty-seventy.

136
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,266
You went from running a scam online to running a scam offline.

137
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:02,733
This connection of yours...

138
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,000
Needs to be kept tight.

139
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,900
Brother Feng, Brother Feng.

140
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,366
It's me, Xiao Longzhou.

141
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:19,566
This is...

142
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:21,833
Is this the one you mentioned...

143
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:22,900
Master Jin.

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,033
Hello.

145
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:26,800
She said on her way here...

146
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,466
She already checked the surrounding land...

147
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:30,366
And examined the aura completely.

148
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,633
Leave it to her.

149
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,533
Alright.

150
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:35,266
Then I'll trouble Master Jin to take a look for me.

151
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,700
Let's begin.
