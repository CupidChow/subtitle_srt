1
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:45,733
In the night

2
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:48,066
On the street corner

3
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,200
Lights glowing like a dream

4
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:55,200
Alone

5
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,766
All by myself

6
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:01,466
Not knowing where to go

7
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:06,733
Years of hardship

8
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,766
Unimaginable life

9
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:15,633
Fate drifting up and down

10
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:20,533
Like waves in the ocean

11
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:25,300
Life is but a farewell

12
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:29,266
Even if happiness leaves no trace

13
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:34,166
Bitter wind and rain are always on the road

14
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,033
But I still head towards the distance

15
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,900
Why haven't you told her yet?

16
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:50,900
I haven't found the right chance yet.

17
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,033
If you don't tell her...

18
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:57,166
I'll tell her myself.

19
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:00,900
Give me a little more time.

20
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:07,966
You reek of lard.

21
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:11,266
It'll wash off.

22
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:14,433
Yuanyuan

23
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,600
Sis, save me.

24
00:02:58,733 --> 00:02:59,833
Sis will help you.

25
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,633
Are you okay?

26
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:27,100
Should I buy you something to eat?

27
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,200
I won't run away.

28
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:34,966
I still want to live.

29
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,200
Besides...

30
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:40,166
I also want to see if I can do it.

31
00:03:47,266 --> 00:03:48,066
No need.

32
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll eat this.

33
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:00,800
If you don't eat, I still have to.

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,600
You're gonna starve me into low blood sugar.

35
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,933
Who's performing the Ritual for you?

36
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:34,033
My daughter.

37
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,366
Will she wake up?

38
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:41,800
Man proposes,

39
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:43,133
God disposes.

40
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,233
Besides...

41
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:46,900
I want you two to meet.

42
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:51,400
What do you want to eat?

43
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,100
Go buy it yourself.

44
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,700
Hello.

45
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,100
Please add hot water for me, thanks.

46
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:04,333
Use water that's as hot as possible.

47
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:05,633
My dad has a bad stomach.

48
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,033
Okay.

49
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:11,566
Hello.

50
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:13,233
Add a sausage for me too.

51
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:14,133
Okay.

52
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:30,933
Is it ready?

53
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:32,200
Almost.

54
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:33,233
It'll be ready in a second.

55
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:53,666
Lao Wei

56
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,266
Actually, I really envy your girl.

57
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:01,300
Your vehicle registration fell under the seat.

58
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,800
I saw it by accident.

59
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,133
I don't know if it's appropriate to call you that.

60
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:09,066
Suit yourself.

61
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:11,666
Lao Wei.

62
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:15,000
Have you ever thought about it?

63
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,033
If your daughter knew...

64
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:21,566
That you're going through all this trouble for her.

65
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:23,333
What would she think?

66
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,733
I'm just making an analogy.

67
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,900
I'm just saying.

68
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:33,700
Say you're asleep and sleeping soundly.

69
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:36,266
And someone insists on waking you up.

70
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,700
Would you be a little bit...

71
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,733
Just a little bit angry?

72
00:06:50,066 --> 00:06:51,733
I'm very angry right now.

73
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:55,200
When do we start?

74
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,933
Wait for daybreak.

75
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:01,166
I'll perform the spirit calling for your daughter.

76
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:03,400
But now...

77
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:06,233
We need to go buy some props.

78
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:04,133
Lao Wei anxiously trampled down the cornstalks

79
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,033
He was terrified of missing the appointed hour,

80
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,866
trying hard to finish before noon

81
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,766
to create the circular clearing I asked for.

82
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,100
This was his last hope.

83
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,000
I knew

84
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,933
that at this critical juncture,

85
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:18,466
there was no possibility of escape.

86
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,366
Yuanyuan's illness,

87
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:23,166
which even doctors couldn't cure,

88
00:08:23,966 --> 00:08:25,000
how could it possibly be cured by me

89
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:27,733
with a lie I blurted out to save my life?

90
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,633
Perhaps when people are utterly desperate,

91
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:33,900
they really do become unusually calm.

92
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:36,633
I decided to take a gamble.

93
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:37,966
If Yuanyuan

94
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,266
really reacts to some external stimulus,

95
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,233
and that previous coincidence happens again,

96
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:43,933
or rather,

97
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,966
if Yuanyuan is truly awakened,

98
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:49,466
then I will be able to survive.

99
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,433
If I simply go through the motions

100
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:53,633
of performing a Ritual,

101
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,666
and Yuanyuan shows no reaction,

102
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,233
then today

103
00:08:58,866 --> 00:09:00,600
will be the day I die.

104
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,066
I saw the burning anticipation in Lao Wei's eyes,

105
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:08,033
and the motionless figure in the wheelchair nearby,

106
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:09,500
the lifeless Yuanyuan.

107
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:11,900
In this moment,

108
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,100
I truly wanted to help this father and daughter.

109
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,866
I mimicked what I saw in ancient books,

110
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,133
those ritual procedures,

111
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:22,166
and prayed with sincerity.

112
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,566
Perhaps praying for a miracle

113
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,966
was the only thing I could do right now.

114
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,866
I prayed for a miracle of life.

115
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:33,766
For Yuanyuan,

116
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,533
for me,

117
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:38,033
and for Lao Wei too.
