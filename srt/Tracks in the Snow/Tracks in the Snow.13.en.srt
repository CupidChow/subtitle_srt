1
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,800
Xiao Feng.

2
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:43,100
So many dishes for just two people.

3
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,300
Isn't this a bit extravagant?

4
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:45,866
Not at all.

5
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:49,166
Mr. Liu knows you have refined tastes.

6
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:51,600
So he just prepared some home-style dishes.

7
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,300
I hope they suit your palate.

8
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,433
Mm, not bad.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,800
Mr. Liu.

10
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:02,700
The project I've been preparing recently...

11
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,900
The location has been selected.

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,266
It's right on Guangming Road.

13
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,700
This plot of land on Guangming Road...

14
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,600
What do you think?

15
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,566
It's like this.

16
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:13,966
For a long time now...

17
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:17,100
Land-driven development...

18
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:19,566
Using land to boost the economy...

19
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,666
And using land to improve people's livelihood...

20
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,633
Have always been the principles we uphold and implement.

21
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:25,933
This ideology and concept...

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,966
It should be said that in recent years...

23
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:30,033
Inspired by this way of thinking...

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,500
Whether in economic development...

25
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:34,366
Or in the improvement of people's livelihood...

26
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:37,766
We have achieved some results to a certain extent.

27
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:40,033
Of course, this is inseparable from my vision.

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,800
But in this process...

29
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,333
I have also always emphasized...

30
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:44,733
That regarding this land...

31
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,133
How we develop it...

32
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,933
What we develop it for...

33
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,633
And who develops it...

34
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:51,433
Is an issue in itself.

35
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:53,633
Of course, now I feel...

36
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,200
As you may know...

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,966
We have some plots of land...

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,300
That are just about to be developed.

39
00:01:58,433 --> 00:02:00,333
So what we are still facing is...

40
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,500
What the land will be used for next...

41
00:02:03,766 --> 00:02:05,833
How to do it, and who will do it.

42
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:07,366
This is also a question.

43
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,433
So, I think...

44
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,366
As long as...

45
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,966
We can stick to this idea...

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,366
And reach a consensus...

47
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:16,433
I believe...

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,033
That our future...

49
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,166
Will definitely...

50
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:21,000
Be bright. Okay?

51
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,600
Mr. Liu.

52
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,900
Do you mean this land is...

53
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:31,800
Mr. Liu's proposal is approved.

54
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:35,533
That's great!

55
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:37,533
Director.

56
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,966
I've called a few friends over for later.

57
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:42,833
We can have some fun after dinner.

58
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,333
No, no, no, absolutely not.

59
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,366
You understand? That's crossing the line.

60
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,500
Come on in.

61
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:51,400
I know about this matter.

62
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,233
Didn't it work out?

63
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:53,566
But then something went wrong.

64
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:55,300
The one who wanted her kidnapped was Brother Feng.

65
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,033
I really didn't know.

66
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:58,733
Why things turned out this way.

67
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:00,800
If I can't find Jin Xuehua...

68
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,600
Brother Feng is going to kill me.

69
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:05,700
Oh my.

70
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,200
Hey, hey...

71
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,633
Speak up. How do you want to die?

72
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:18,333
Brother Feng, there's a solution to everything.

73
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:19,433
Hmm?

74
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,533
You find some two-bit influencer...

75
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,533
To pretend to be Master Jin.

76
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:25,333
I think you really have a death wish.

77
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,600
I can tell you precisely right now...

78
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:36,300
The time you will leave this world.

79
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:37,733
Do you understand?

80
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,233
I... I...

81
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:39,166
I don't want to die.

82
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:40,800
Oh.

83
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:41,833
Ah, right.

84
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:43,100
What you said just now was right.

85
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,600
There's a solution to everything.

86
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:46,533
Yes, yes, right.

87
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:48,500
Tell you what, I'll give you one more chance.

88
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:49,966
Thank you.

89
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:50,733
Three days.

90
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,566
Mm-hm.

91
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:55,200
In three days, bag this Master Jin and deliver her to my company.

92
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,233
No one's gonna get killed, right?

93
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:13,933
Brother Feng said

94
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:16,566
You have one day to find Jin Xuehua

95
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:19,333
If we don't see Jin Xuehua by tomorrow night

96
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:20,800
We'll kill you

97
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,033
I really don't know where Jin Xuehua is

98
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,966
Can I just pay the money back to Brother Feng?

99
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll pay the money

100
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,033
Even if it's paid, we don't need you to pay it

101
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:32,000
In short, just one sentence

102
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,300
If we don't see Jin Xuehua tomorrow night

103
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,366
You'll pay it back with your flesh, piece by piece

104
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:42,533
You know, this mess between you guys

105
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:44,500
If you had told me earlier

106
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,766
Maybe there would still be a way

107
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,900
What way is there?

108
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,000
Brother Feng is all-powerful

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,333
All-powerful my ass

110
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,033
If he were really all-powerful

111
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:53,500
Would he send you to kidnap Jin Xuehua?

112
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,200
What's wrong with me?

113
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:56,366
You ask what's wrong with you?

114
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:57,533
You're just a cashier

115
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,166
You don't do your job properly

116
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,500
Why are you learning to kidnap?

117
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:03,733
What are you looking at?

118
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,900
You're awake

119
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:50,000
You were too tired, you've been sleeping

120
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,166
Since you're awake, eat something

121
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,100
Your face was too dirty

122
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,900
I wiped it all onto him

123
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:07,866
I also wiped the blood off your forehead

124
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:16,533
These

125
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,766
Are all yours?

126
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:22,900
They're quite pretty

127
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,733
Lend them to me to wear for a bit

128
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,933
You don't mind, right?

129
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,500
If you like them, take them

130
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:32,066
So, uh, if there's nothing else

131
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:34,200
The two of us will get going

132
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:35,866
You're an influencer

133
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,366
I've watched your livestreams

134
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,500
I'm not a big influencer

135
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:48,000
How much does an influencer earn in a month?

136
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:51,800
Not that much

137
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:54,733
Then how much is an influencer's life worth?

138
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:00,500
Brother, what do you mean?

139
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,666
Didn't you want to make a call?

140
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,066
I took this while you were sleeping

141
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,700
Didn't take it well

142
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:28,366
Please forgive me

143
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,466
Currently, the police have received another missing person case

144
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,766
The missing person is female

145
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:40,533
The possibility of the same suspect is not ruled out

146
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:43,533
Surveillance shows the suspect wearing a black trench coat

147
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:44,866
Wearing a black bucket hat

148
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,833
The suspect is currently still at large

149
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,766
Women are advised to be careful when going out

150
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:51,566
This news sounds like it's talking about me

151
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,066
Alright, alright

152
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:11,933
Don't be angry, don't be angry

153
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,066
Don't be angry, don't be angry

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,933
Okay, okay, okay

155
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,600
Ah, okay, not angry anymore

156
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,700
Be good

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,733
Hello? Who is it?

158
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:26,200
Ah

159
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:28,733
Ah

160
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:30,200
What's that sound?

161
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,633
It's Jin Xuehua's voice

162
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:47,666
I see there are cornfields nearby

163
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,533
Which way do we go?

164
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,333
Hmm, ahead I think

165
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,966
It really is true that coincidences make a story

166
00:08:57,766 --> 00:08:58,266
We suspect

167
00:08:58,266 --> 00:09:00,500
Jin Xuehua encountered danger other than Lao Wei

168
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,400
The facts prove exactly that

169
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:05,100
After Jin Xuehua escaped from the cornfield

170
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,700
She was taken hostage by the kidnapper reported in the news

171
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,000
Even more coincidentally

172
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,400
When we went to find Lao Hei last night

173
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,666
Jin Xuehua was actually downstairs at Lao Hei's place

174
00:09:14,566 --> 00:09:15,766
We knocked on the wrong door

175
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,400
And startled that kidnapper

176
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:24,666
Hello

177
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,333
Hey, Lao Hei

178
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:29,900
It's me, Xiao Longzhou

179
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,233
Oh, go up one more floor?

180
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,500
Oh

181
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,033
You really are cautious

182
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,266
I have a favor to ask you.

183
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:53,466
I'm really in a tight spot.

184
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:54,200
Open the door first.

185
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Let's go inside and talk, okay?

186
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,166
Okay, okay.

187
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:56,733
Come in first.

188
00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:57,866
Okay, come, come.

189
00:09:57,866 --> 00:09:58,433
Come, come, come.

190
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,633
It's like this.

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,900
I came to find you today...

192
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:06,733
I really... I have an urgent matter.

193
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,466
The data in my friend's phone...

194
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:10,866
Can you check it for me?

195
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,600
You know the rules, right?

196
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,800
If trouble comes, don't name me.

197
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:19,500
Liu Chunhua. Female.

198
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,600
Forty-five years old.

199
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,766
Died on June 12, 2012.

200
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,733
Can you trace the location of this number?

201
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,033
Yes. One thousand.

202
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:36,700
No problem.

203
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:37,866
Trace it.

204
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:46,966
Where is this?

205
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:48,466
That's my fucking house.

206
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,600
What's wrong?

207
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,733
He then followed us to Lao Hei's door.

208
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,333
We called the number Jin Xuehua just used.

209
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,766
The ringtone sounded at the door.

210
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,566
I was wondering while chasing him...

211
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:07,466
where Lao Wei's accomplice came from.

212
00:11:08,466 --> 00:11:09,466
Later I found out...

213
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:11,866
it was all a coincidence.

214
00:11:16,733 --> 00:11:17,433
Stop!

215
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:24,166
Stop!

216
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,800
Stop!

217
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,100
Stop!

218
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,766
Ouch! Ahhh!

219
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,000
Jin Xuehua.

220
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:09,166
Jin Xuehua.

221
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:14,800
Jin Xuehua.
