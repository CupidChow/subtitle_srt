1
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:46,900
Big Brother

2
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:47,866
Is he reliable?

3
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,533
Why so much nonsense? He is.

4
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,200
He's your friend, right?

5
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:00,600
A friend.

6
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,900
You put the money...

7
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:03,133
...leave one part with me.

8
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,233
I guarantee you'll double it.

9
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:06,866
Of course.

10
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:08,300
Why aren't you talking?

11
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:09,500
Cousin Lin.

12
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:10,766
Wrong number.

13
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:11,533
Sorry about that.

14
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:21,966
Friend.

15
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:22,500
Brother Zhou.

16
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:26,666
Man, haven't seen you in years.

17
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,566
Brother Zhou.

18
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,700
They say your business...

19
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,800
...is doing really big now.

20
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,600
Truly, seeing is believing.

21
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:52,966
So, um...

22
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:54,900
I've run into some trouble lately.

23
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,266
Could you lend me 200,000?

24
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,400
It's life-saving money.

25
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,900
Dabao, Abin.

26
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:35,100
Bro.

27
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,100
What is it, Bro?

28
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,566
Ten thousand for each of you.

29
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,033
Just felt like giving you some cash.

30
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,900
Thanks, Bro.

31
00:02:52,566 --> 00:02:53,233
You see...

32
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:55,400
We are brothers.

33
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,100
Money should be spent together.

34
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,100
Are we brothers?

35
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,033
Why should I lend you money?

36
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,066
Brother Zhou.

37
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:14,366
That money really is to save a life.

38
00:03:14,766 --> 00:03:15,900
How about you lend it to me first?

39
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,666
I'll pay back principal and interest...

40
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:18,966
...all to you later.

41
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:25,333
Dabao.

42
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:26,566
Bro.

43
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,066
Have you collected Lao Wu's debt yet?

44
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,700
Bro, about Lao Wu's debt...

45
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,233
...it's honestly a bit hard to collect.

46
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:38,800
Are you a pig?

47
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:42,466
Hey, Brother Zhou.

48
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,400
Um...

49
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,500
How much does Lao Wu owe you?

50
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,033
What a coincidence.

51
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,900
He owes me 200,000 too.

52
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,900
If you can help me...

53
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,666
...get it back with interest...

54
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:57,700
...I'll lend the money to you.

55
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:12,566
Deal.

56
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:14,266
It's a promise.

57
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:26,600
Hurry up and get it done.

58
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,900
I'm not talking to you.

59
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:32,966
Book a private room. Triple eight.

60
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:37,166
You want me to book it?

61
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:38,900
I'll go, I'll go, Bro.

62
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,233
Big Brother, Big Brother.

63
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,033
Um...

64
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:28,433
Brother Zhou couldn't even get the money back.

65
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,200
We won't be able to get it back either.

66
00:06:31,866 --> 00:06:32,766
Then what do you suggest?

67
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,500
I think...

68
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,033
...how about we put away these weapons...

69
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:38,833
...just put them away for now.

70
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,600
Let's just communicate properly.

71
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,033
Brother Wu.

72
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:47,766
That IOU doesn't count anymore.

73
00:06:48,566 --> 00:06:49,100
How about this...

74
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:50,800
I'll change it to 5% monthly interest.

75
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,533
I'll help you pay the rest.

76
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:53,366
Is that okay?

77
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,100
Just don't tell Brother Zhou.

78
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
So you two...

79
00:06:58,633 --> 00:06:59,933
...are pretty loyal, huh?

80
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,200
I, Lao Wu...

81
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:05,000
...should be grateful to you two, right?

82
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:07,233
No need, no need.

83
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,533
Then write it.

84
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,733
You pay the interest.

85
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,200
5% monthly interest.

86
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,266
I...

87
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,100
...won't tell anyone.

88
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,433
You're not allowed to tell either.

89
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,633
We won't.

90
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:26,066
Listen to that.

91
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:27,300
How sensible.

92
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,033
This Old Zhou...

93
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:43,000
having loyal brothers like you...

94
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:44,600
is rare.

95
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,000
Here.

96
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,000
No...

97
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:55,566
Brother Wu.

98
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:57,300
I mean...

99
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,200
I'll pay the interest for you.

100
00:07:58,233 --> 00:07:59,966
But you have to give me the principal.

101
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:03,366
Is that so?

102
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,800
I only agreed to lower the interest.

103
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:10,066
I never said I'd give you the principal.

104
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,600
Oh, come on, you...

105
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:14,066
What?

106
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,366
You want a beating?

107
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:19,766
No, no, no.

108
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:20,866
This definitely won't work.

109
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,833
You might not get the money this way.

110
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:24,300
But you'll definitely lose face.

111
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,000
Let me ask you.

112
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,300
Are you a man or not?

113
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,333
Then what do we do?

114
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:30,766
Take him on.

115
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:32,366
Take him on hard.

116
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,666
Take him on till the end.

117
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:27,300
Which one of you is Lao Wu?

118
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:37,600
What's going on?

119
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,700
What does this mean?

120
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:40,800
Are you cursing me?

121
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,600
He's cursing me, isn't he?

122
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,633
Matter. As in "a matter."

123
00:09:47,766 --> 00:09:48,966
What, you know sign language?

124
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:50,266
I learned a little.

125
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:51,666
Then ask him.

126
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,766
Is he cursing me?

127
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:53,566
No.

128
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:55,433
Ask him when he'll pay back the money.

129
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:06,733
What does that mean?

130
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,466
He says he has no money.

131
00:10:11,366 --> 00:10:13,966
No. You have to pay even if you have no money.

132
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:48,033
What do we do?

133
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,000
How can we pay the ransom without the money?

134
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,900
What about Brother Zhou?

135
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:56,433
I have a plan.

136
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,366
Isn't this a bank?

137
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:06,833
Wait.

138
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,600
You're good, kid. You actually got it.

139
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:22,666
You're not bad yourself.

140
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,433
How can this be real money?

141
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:26,033
Maybe it's Hell money inside.

142
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,266
Impossible, Bro. It's definitely real money.
