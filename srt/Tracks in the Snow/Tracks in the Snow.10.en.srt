1
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,300
Who was it?

2
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,800
That detained Xiao Liuzi?

3
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,833
I don't know.

4
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:40,966
They were really ruthless.

5
00:00:41,266 --> 00:00:42,966
Didn't you tell them Xiao Liuzi is my brother?

6
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:43,533
I did.

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,666
He even hit... slapped me in the face.

8
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:48,033
They've got some nerve.

9
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:54,266
Where is Liuzi?

10
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:56,466
I'm sorry, Bro.

11
00:00:58,033 --> 00:00:58,566
Sigh.

12
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:03,800
Dad.

13
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:05,966
Yuanyuan.

14
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:11,200
Brother Shui.

15
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:15,300
So, you're crippled?

16
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:17,400
Still alive, huh?

17
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,033
Still alive.

18
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:23,566
Thanks to you.

19
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:24,566
Brother Si.

20
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:27,000
This rotten leg of mine...

21
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:30,100
has made my life smooth sailing.

22
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,366
Your girl has grown so big.

23
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:33,366
Hey, Liu Deshui.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,266
Let's settle our business between us.

25
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:38,166
Don't touch my girl.

26
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:39,866
Brother Si.

27
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:41,466
I know the rules.

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,633
This is your fate.

29
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:49,300
But if you want to keep your life...

30
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:54,800
I want one of your legs.

31
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,966
You keep your word.

32
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:37,466
Brother Si.

33
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,066
Then what you owed me back then...

34
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm taking it.

35
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,266
Come with me.

36
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,666
Why isn't it working yet?

37
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:56,500
I don't know if it works either.

38
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:58,966
I really want to help you.

39
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,266
I want to try the method my grandma talked about.

40
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,833
But I don't know if it will work.

41
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:11,033
You tried your best.

42
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,900
I tried my best too.

43
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,266
It's my daughter's bad fate.

44
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,466
Don't say that.

45
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:29,266
There's always a way.

46
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,300
There is no way.

47
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:34,366
I know.

48
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:42,566
But Jin Xuehua...

49
00:06:42,566 --> 00:06:43,633
I want to thank you.

50
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,900
No matter what...

51
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,466
you gave me...

52
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,033
and Yuanyuan...

53
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:54,100
hope.

54
00:06:58,266 --> 00:06:59,133
But...

55
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,866
I need money to treat my girl.

56
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:03,966
So...

57
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:06,633
I still have to hand you over.

58
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:09,466
Anyway...

59
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,266
I can get the money.

60
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:13,300
Hey, hey, hey, Big Brother!

61
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:14,833
I've got it!

62
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,833
My grandma said we need the ritual drumstick.

63
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,633
Ours is a replica.

64
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,466
It's plastic.

65
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,400
Where is the real one?

66
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:46,466
Um...

67
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,066
Which door do we take?

68
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,733
Who cares which door?

69
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:50,666
Let's take this door.

70
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:00,533
Big Brother, over here.

71
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,533
Yes, it's this box.

72
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:14,166
Where are they?

73
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:17,500
Big Brother, there's another path here.

74
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Let's check over here.

75
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,033
We were searching in the slaughterhouse.

76
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:27,633
I really hoped Jin Xuehua was locked in one of the rooms.

77
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,700
Dead or alive.

78
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:32,033
As long as we can find her.

79
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:34,700
My secret...

80
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,233
can be kept hidden.

81
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:41,033
We moved through the damp corridors.

82
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:45,333
I was so familiar with the atmosphere of the slaughterhouse.

83
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,666
As if I had been here before.

84
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
Big Brother, over here.

85
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,800
They definitely went to perform a ritual.

86
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:12,100
Perform a ritual?

87
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,733
How do you know it's to perform a ritual?

88
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,333
Didn't we already discuss this?

89
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,066
They stole that eagle feather

90
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:23,500
just to perform a ritual.

91
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:25,233
Darn it.

92
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,366
Jin Xuehua said that was all made up.

93
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,733
People actually believe that?

94
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:32,333
Besides, if they really wanted to perform a ritual,

95
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,200
just booking it online would work.

96
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,433
Why kidnap her?

97
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:36,433
That's what I'm saying.

98
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,233
They definitely have some other motive.

99
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:42,300
That Lao Wei, who knows what he's up to.

100
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:44,033
Wait a minute.

101
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:46,466
How do you know he's called Lao Wei?

102
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:56,566
Isn't it right there?

103
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,133
Wei Shengli.

104
00:09:59,066 --> 00:09:59,866
Isn't that Lao Wei?

105
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:16,533
Xiao Longzhou.

106
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:19,966
How come your business card is here?
