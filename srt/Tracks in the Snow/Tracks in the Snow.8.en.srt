1
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:44,333
You're still bluffing to Zhou Qian?

2
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
What if our cover gets blown?

3
00:00:46,366 --> 00:00:48,266
If I didn't say that, we'd both be dead.

4
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,100
Aren't I trying to help you find someone?

5
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,066
Now look what happened.

6
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:53,866
We didn't find the person.

7
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:54,766
Just caused a mess.

8
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,100
Now not only is Jin Xuehua in danger,

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,933
but we're both screwed.

10
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:02,933
Being screwed later is better than being screwed now, right?

11
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:06,566
You've seen Zhou Qian's methods.

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,666
He could kill us in a minute.

13
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,366
He'll throw you off the roof to your death.

14
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:16,100
You lied to him just now.

15
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,200
We're both going to die.

16
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,700
Watch the road.

17
00:01:20,966 --> 00:01:22,166
Even if we find Jin Xuehua,

18
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,700
Zhou Qian will kill all three of us.

19
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,833
Are you really planning to do it for him?

20
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:31,933
If I'm not guessing wrong,

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,333
you plan to run away once you find Jin Xuehua.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,366
You dared to borrow so much money,

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,666
and dared to offend these people so badly.

24
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:42,300
Watch the road.

25
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:45,200
If you say you still want to come back,

26
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:46,633
who would believe that?

27
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,900
What do we do next?

28
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,633
We need to find a cornfield.

29
00:01:59,266 --> 00:01:59,966
Are you messing with me?

30
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,166
No, no, no, no, no.

31
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:03,966
Cornfields have good energy.

32
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:05,333
It's grounding.

33
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,800
Hey, hey, hey.

34
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:32,733
I need to use the bathroom.

35
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:36,800
Hurry up.

36
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,566
All right.

37
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,433
Hey.

38
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,133
Coming, coming.

39
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:15,900
Hurry up.

40
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:33,233
Wait for me, Yuanyuan. Just wait.

41
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:43,733
You said you would help me.

42
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,166
Do you remember the pet shop owner saying

43
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,033
Jin Xuehua left in a Jinbei van?

44
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,666
A few days ago, downstairs at my place,

45
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,866
there really was a sneaky Jinbei van.

46
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,800
It smelled like a van full of dogs.

47
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:23,800
If I can just figure out this van,

48
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,500
I can find this man in black.

49
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:29,566
So you mean

50
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,700
he's a dog seller?

51
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,500
Right.

52
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:35,466
Based on the details Ding Dayu recalled,

53
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,000
we came to the biggest dog farm in the suburbs.

54
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:39,900
Actually, these clues...

55
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,166
I knew them long ago.

56
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,666
I just couldn't say anything.

57
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:45,066
Because my persona with Ding Dayu

58
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
is just a Top donor trying to get his money back.

59
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:50,600
But regarding Jin Xuehua's disappearance,

60
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:52,933
I actually played another role.

61
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,000
Brother Gang.

62
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:57,366
What have you been up to lately?

63
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,800
Me? Nothing much.

64
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:00,866
Just busy with nonsense.

65
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:02,733
I came to see you.

66
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,166
Brought you a case of booze.

67
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,366
If it's not enough, I'll bring more later.

68
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,233
You're a master at stealing booze.

69
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:13,233
Whoever hires you is out of luck.

70
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:17,266
Spit it out. What's up?

71
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:20,433
Help me find out about someone.

72
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,600
Go ahead.

73
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:33,133
I remember the guy you described.

74
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:35,333
He buys dogs from me regularly.

75
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,066
At first, I thought he ran a dog meat restaurant.

76
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:39,566
Later I found out

77
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:40,900
he buys dogs to set them free,

78
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,833
to Build up merit for his daughter.

79
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,033
Ruthless.

80
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:49,833
That old guy was really ruthless when he was young.

81
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,466
People in the underworld called him Brother Si.

82
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:54,800
He loved to break legs in fights.

83
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,000
However,

84
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,833
I heard his own Achilles tendon got cut later on.

85
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:01,200
This guy isn't a local.

86
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,533
He used to deliver meat to our restaurant.

87
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:06,666
He has a daughter.

88
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
She's a musician.

89
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:10,166
She used to perform at my bar often.

90
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:11,666
She just had a bad temper.

91
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,166
She'd jump off the building at the slightest disagreement.

92
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,533
She was quite pretty.

93
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:16,766
It's a pity.

94
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,433
What's her name?

95
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,233
I really don't remember.

96
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:26,166
You can try your luck at the Southern Suburbs Slaughterhouse.

97
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:29,033
Hey.

98
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:32,766
This guy looks really fierce.

99
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,000
You guys better be careful.
