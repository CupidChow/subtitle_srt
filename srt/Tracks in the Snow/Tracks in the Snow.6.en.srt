1
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:49,566
I brought the money.

2
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,733
What are you doing? Who are you looking for?

3
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:57,233
I brought the 200,000.

4
00:00:57,566 --> 00:00:58,766
Hey, what are you shouting for?

5
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:00,900
Do you know what kind of place this is?

6
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,233
Believe it or not, one phone call and she's dead.

7
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,066
You...

8
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,066
The money isn't right.

9
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:26,400
Give me another 50,000.

10
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:28,133
Are you crazy?

11
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:29,900
Didn't we agree on 200,000?

12
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,700
Fine, let me break it down for you.

13
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,700
What is this money for?

14
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,900
This is money Jin Xuehua borrowed for a hair transplant.

15
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,266
Shouldn't this money be paid back to me?

16
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:43,100
Jin Xuehua got a hair transplant?

17
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,766
Here's the IOU.

18
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:53,700
Good-for-nothing woman.

19
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,566
What's the other 50,000 for?

20
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,233
That's because she killed my eagle.

21
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,466
What eagle?

22
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:01,933
Yeah.

23
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:05,866
Last night, Jin Xuehua brought someone to my shop.

24
00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:07,400
And killed my eagle.

25
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,900
Buddy, the surveillance camera was broken yesterday.

26
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:12,000
I only saw it after I fixed it today.

27
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,800
Otherwise, would I have given you so much time?

28
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:15,966
This eagle of mine...

29
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:16,966
It cost me capital too.

30
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:18,000
Several tens of thousands.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,900
Someone offered 100,000, but I didn't sell.

32
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,566
I'm just asking for the cost price.

33
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,666
Isn't that reasonable?

34
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,166
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

35
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,866
Big brother, do you still have that footage?

36
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:28,366
Yes, I have the whole thing on tape.

37
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:28,966
You want to see it, don't you?

38
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:29,666
Hahaha.

39
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,800
50,000.

40
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:34,500
Plus the eagle money, that's 100,000.

41
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,400
Why don't you just go rob someone?

42
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Can we see it or not?

43
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,933
Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?

44
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:40,566
You're scaring my dog.

45
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,733
Oh, look at you, look at you.

46
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:43,566
There's no need for that.

47
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:44,533
Oh my, you...

48
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,400
Just wait a second.

49
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,100
Oh my, this young man has a short fuse.

50
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,066
Come on, let's go.

51
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:48,866
I'll take you to see it.

52
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:58,133
Didn't you want to see the footage?

53
00:02:58,266 --> 00:02:59,766
It's inside. See for yourself.

54
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:06,533
Where's the footage?

55
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:10,000
What are you doing? Open the door!

56
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,600
Aren't you two pretty arrogant?

57
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,966
Trying to blow me up with explosives?

58
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm collecting a debt normally.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,433
It's protected by law.

60
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:19,800
I specialize in dealing with all kinds of defiance.

61
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,166
Darn it, you jerk.

62
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,066
If you're a man...

63
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:22,633
Open the door!

64
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:23,333
Let's go one-on-one. Open up!

65
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,200
Open the door!

66
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:28,266
Young man, what era is this?

67
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:29,000
Still talking about one-on-one fights?

68
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:29,733
Let me tell you.

69
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:31,766
Hurry up and get the money.

70
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:32,600
If you can't raise the money...

71
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,866
No one is getting out.

72
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,500
You shameless scoundrel.

73
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:41,833
Sigh.

74
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,266
I have a way.

75
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,166
Use the explosives to blow the door open.

76
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:45,966
Then blow it up.

77
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:46,833
Give me a lighter.

78
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,433
You brought explosives but no fire?

79
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:49,700
I don't smoke.

80
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,633
I don't smoke either.

81
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,266
You don't smoke?

82
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:52,266
Your breath smells of smoke.

83
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:53,500
I just quit not long ago.

84
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,500
I don't, I don't.

85
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,966
Stop yelling, my ancestor.

86
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:36,333
Don't worry.

87
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:38,333
If I can escape, I'll let you all out.

88
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:39,566
Stop yelling.

89
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:47,266
You are a Shaman.

90
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,166
I... no, I'm not.

91
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,866
I am, yes, yes, yes. I am, I am.

92
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,066
I always felt she could wake up

93
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:35,333
I've tried every possible way

94
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:43,566
Until I met you

95
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:47,700
That stuff you do...

96
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:49,533
Yuanyuan reacted to it

97
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:55,400
So I want to give it a try

98
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:02,800
You really think I can do it?

99
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,433
If it really works...

100
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:09,400
What do we do next?

101
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,366
Invoke the god into the spell, for the half-spirit to return

102
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
You trying to scam me again?

103
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,233
I'm not scamming you

104
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:26,200
With the child like this...

105
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
I couldn't scam you

106
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:34,566
Big Brother, I just want to ask...

107
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,033
You kidnapped me just for this?

108
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:46,833
Look, there was no need for that

109
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:47,766
If it's about this...

110
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:49,533
You could've just placed an order in my fan group

111
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,466
If it's too expensive, I'd give you a discount

112
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:52,933
But tying me up like this...

113
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:54,033
You... I...

114
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:58,433
Or is there someone else who wants...

115
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:00,233
If you really wake Yuanyuan up...

116
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:02,366
I'll let you go

117
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:05,333
But if you dare lie to me again...

118
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,966
I'll chop you up right now

119
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:12,633
I'd never lie to you

120
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:14,866
What do we do now?

121
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,366
We need to find eagle feathers

122
00:07:18,466 --> 00:07:19,366
Where are we gonna find an eagle?

123
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:22,633
If you're talking about eagles...

124
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:28,066
I actually know a guy

125
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:39,333
Tonight's coincidence saved my life

126
00:07:40,366 --> 00:07:42,233
But I know nothing about soul summoning

127
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,966
I have no idea how to wake his daughter

128
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,733
I don't know what will happen next

129
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:52,000
I only know one thing

130
00:07:52,066 --> 00:07:53,466
This absurd soul summoning journey...

131
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:55,166
Is my only chance to survive

132
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,400
Even if I have to fake it...

133
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:00,466
I have to bite the bullet and keep up the act

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,366
I can only come up with a long list...

135
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:05,200
Of offerings that are hard to gather...

136
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:07,866
Hoping to stall for time...

137
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,800
And find a chance to escape

138
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:12,833
But I didn't know...

139
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,166
That in the time we spent together...

140
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,400
I would actually, with this man...

141
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,766
Who originally wanted to hurt me...

142
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:20,400
Form a deep bond

143
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,400
I even started hoping...

144
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:26,300
That I really had special powers...

145
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,933
To help his daughter

146
00:08:59,766 --> 00:09:00,566
Is that all?

147
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:02,400
I know that person

148
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,166
He loves playing with that peculiar stuff

149
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:07,266
I remember he has an eagle
