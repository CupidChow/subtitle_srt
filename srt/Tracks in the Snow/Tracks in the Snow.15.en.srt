1
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,400
She mentioned something to me.

2
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,333
Like a lake or a river.

3
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:43,066
There's a river.

4
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Let's go to the riverside.

5
00:00:47,066 --> 00:00:49,266
Celestial Water is Tears of the Gods.

6
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:50,300
Grandma said so.

7
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:54,133
To save someone, you must make the gods weep.

8
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,233
Isn't that interesting, fam?

9
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:59,700
See you in the stream tomorrow at 8 PM.

10
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,933
Bye-bye.

11
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,166
Oh my god.

12
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,333
That mouth of yours...

13
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,666
You really can blabber.

14
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,533
All that Celestial Water, Tears of the Gods stuff.

15
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:10,133
Why don't you just drag Taishang Laojun down here?

16
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:12,233
What if someone sends you a couple of Carnivals?

17
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:13,800
If you had to explain it now, what would you do?

18
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,166
You idiot.

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,033
Aren't there plenty of lakes on that mountain?

20
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,266
What's it called?

21
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:21,066
Fairy Lake.

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,266
Worst case, I'll say there's a well.

23
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:25,000
There are so many bathhouses.

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,800
The one you always take me to.

25
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:29,900
Didn't she say it was a hot spring lake?

26
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:33,466
Can a bathhouse be the same as Tears of the Gods?

27
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:34,500
You can really bullshit.

28
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:35,466
I remember now.

29
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,833
What Jin Xuehua told me before.

30
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:40,133
Hot spring water.

31
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:41,666
Right, hot spring.

32
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:42,833
Hot spring.

33
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:43,966
I'll take you there.

34
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:05,466
What if we can't find the drumstick?

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,266
Grandma said there's only one drumstick.

36
00:02:09,266 --> 00:02:10,333
Just one.

37
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,866
B-But it's not necessary.

38
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:15,666
Sincerity is enough.

39
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:16,866
Still trying to fool me?

40
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:20,366
I'm not fooling you.

41
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:23,233
We really are missing one thing.

42
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:24,633
The most important thing.

43
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:26,633
Very important.

44
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,200
Too important.

45
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,000
Boss.

46
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:31,666
Celestial Water.

47
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,333
It's Celestial Water.

48
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:35,866
Boss.

49
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,633
Boss, why don't you let me go?

50
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:39,833
I'll go find the Celestial Water for you.

51
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,066
I guarantee I'll find it.

52
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,033
Don't just let him go alone.

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,733
Let us both go, we'll find it together.

54
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,866
I've been carrying on the tradition too.

55
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:55,233
What's that sound?

56
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:56,600
There's someone else?

57
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:57,866
Who is it?

58
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:01,633
The guy inside is about to wake up.

59
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:02,200
Who?

60
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,233
Probably won't mind that you're old.

61
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,600
No, Boss.

62
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:07,566
You just said...

63
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:09,033
Who's old?

64
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:15,600
Right here.

65
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:16,500
Get out.

66
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:38,633
Is this it?

67
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:39,566
No.

68
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,433
This one?

69
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,000
No.

70
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,266
Sigh, this one?

71
00:03:47,266 --> 00:03:47,900
No.

72
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,133
Do you actually remember?

73
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:51,700
I remember, I just said it wasn't.

74
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,600
Gentlemen.

75
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:56,933
Slippers are ready for you.

76
00:03:57,033 --> 00:03:58,533
You can change your shoes here.

77
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:00,266
And go bathe over there.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,500
We haven't untied our shoelaces yet.

79
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:12,200
Hey, hey.

80
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:12,900
No.

81
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,866
No, no.

82
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:18,066
Sir, should I help you instead?

83
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:19,100
No need, don't touch.

84
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,266
My feet just played soccer.

85
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,366
Smelly.

86
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,066
Sir, you look so refined.

87
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:32,600
Your feet shouldn't smell, right?

88
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,433
Also smelly.

89
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm his teammate.

90
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,500
I didn't lie to you.

91
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,800
That Celestial Water is living spring water.

92
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:52,600
Now the living springs on the mountain are all sealed.

93
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,200
Just this place.

94
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,266
The owner of this place...

95
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:57,900
dug a well following the water source.

96
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:05,466
Look.

97
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:07,233
If you're worried...

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,500
let Auntie go find it.

99
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:11,933
I'll stay in the car with you.

100
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:13,466
I'll be the hostage.

101
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:17,700
Hey, sir.

102
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,100
Are you still using that bottle?

103
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:21,033
If not, give it to me.

104
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:24,000
Thanks.

105
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,533
Welcome, Auntie.

106
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:38,533
Hello.

107
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,566
Just change your shoes here.

108
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,500
Auntie, what makes you so happy?

109
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:44,833
You know, in this world...

110
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,100
there are all kinds of people.

111
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,466
Someone asked me to get some hot spring water.

112
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:50,733
This one hundred yuan was easy money.

113
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,000
It'd be great if there were always jobs like this.

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,933
Really great.

115
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:57,533
Come, Auntie, let me help you.

116
00:05:57,533 --> 00:05:58,533
Watch your step.

117
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,100
Miss, the one who just went in is my grandma.

118
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,900
She's been in there for so long.

119
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,533
I'm worried she fell inside.

120
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:17,400
Could you go in and check for me?

121
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:19,133
Your grandma?

122
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,400
Hmm, she left ages ago.

123
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:21,066
Huh?

124
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:22,533
How is that possible?

125
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:24,133
I've been watching the door the whole time.

126
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,266
Our shop has a side door.

127
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,666
Side door?

128
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,700
Where is it?

129
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:29,633
Over there.

130
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:32,566
Why didn't you say so earlier?

131
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,866
You didn't ask earlier.

132
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,200
Psycho.

133
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,633
Hey, wait a minute.

134
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,066
Wait a minute.

135
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:44,500
What are you doing?

136
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,300
Robbery?

137
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:47,233
You have to pick the right person to rob.

138
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,933
Why rob an old lady?

139
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:50,733
No money, no things.

140
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:53,000
Just some scrap cardboard today.

141
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:54,533
If you want it, take it.

142
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:55,133
No, no, no.

143
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:56,200
You misunderstood.

144
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,666
Grandma, who did you give that water to just now?

145
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:01,233
You two want water too?

146
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,133
Alright, I still have that bottle.

147
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:04,266
I'll go fill it for you.

148
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:06,433
But you two have to pay for the ticket.

149
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:07,533
You two have to cover the ticket cost.

150
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:08,133
Grandma.

151
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,900
We don't want water.

152
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,133
Where is the person who wanted the water?

153
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:13,000
Hmm, went that way.

154
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:21,233
I'll go over there and look.

155
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:02,100
Brother Feng

156
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:04,533
I finally get to see you, Brother Feng

157
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:07,866
I was just about to tell you

158
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:09,533
I'm close to finding her

159
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:10,666
Where is she?

160
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:13,433
Looking

161
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,466
Still looking

162
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:16,333
Almost

163
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,766
Just give me a little more time

164
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:18,566
Just a little

165
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:20,766
How long do you need?

166
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:21,766
One hour

167
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:24,266
Is one hour enough?

168
00:08:24,266 --> 00:08:26,566
In one hour, I'll have her in my hands

169
00:08:26,566 --> 00:08:27,800
Just give me another hour

170
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,966
I've been looking for her for the past three days

171
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:31,566
These three days, while looking for her

172
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:33,533
I've been feeling so much regret in my heart

173
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,433
Thinking I brought a con artist to my brother's side

174
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:39,466
In my heart

175
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:42,466
So I hate her to the bone

176
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:43,800
I even hired a professional killer

177
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,066
Specifically to kidnap Jin Xuehua

178
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:46,633
A professional killer, huh?

179
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:48,733
What's his name?

180
00:08:49,366 --> 00:08:50,366
Called Lao Wei

181
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,300
Lao Wei

182
00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:58,233
But Lao Wei took Jin Xuehua

183
00:08:58,233 --> 00:08:59,533
And ran away

184
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:01,766
That professional killer you hired

185
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:03,166
How did he...

186
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:06,533
He's just like us

187
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:07,866
He got scammed by Jin Xuehua

188
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:08,533
He thinks

189
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:11,566
Jin Xuehua can wake up his vegetative daughter

190
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,600
Hahahahaha

191
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,966
Vegetative patient

192
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:18,100
Vegetative patient

193
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,033
Hahahahaha

194
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:21,833
Wait

195
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:22,666
Dizzy

196
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:23,733
You okay, Brother?

197
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,800
Hold on

198
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,066
A vegetative daughter

199
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,066
Hahahahaha

200
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:29,966
Go on

201
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,766
No, Brother, I'm not...

202
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,933
It's a good story

203
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:33,833
I'm not making up a story

204
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:34,833
I-I-I-I-I

205
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,600
Everything I said is true

206
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,033
Just give me a little more time, that's all

207
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:38,933
So you're saying

208
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,566
You found a professional killer with a vegetative daughter

209
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:44,366
To find this professional con artist

210
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:45,933
I'm not lying about this

211
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:46,966
Everything I'm saying is true

212
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:48,066
Brother, you have to believe me

213
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:49,033
I know

214
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:51,566
I was just looking for Jin Xuehua with Ding Dayu

215
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,000
Who is Ding Dayu now?

216
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:34,566
His name is Ding Dayu
