1
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:41,266
What is this mess?

2
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:54,366
What's wrong?

3
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,166
My foot, my foot, my foot!

4
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,033
Chase me, chase me, go on, chase me!

5
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,200
Didn't you sprain your ankle?

6
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,200
You still don't trust me.

7
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,200
I did sprain my ankle.

8
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:20,200
I was forcing myself to keep going.

9
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:21,733
I didn't want to hold you back.

10
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:30,666
Let me tell you something.

11
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:32,700
Don't put on an act with me.

12
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:34,833
I hate people who act the most.

13
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:45,466
Boss.

14
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:46,833
I have a way.

15
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:52,900
I have a way.

16
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,233
I used to work as an electrician.

17
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,700
Now you want to play an electrician?

18
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:39,400
Boss, I have a way.

19
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:40,866
I worked as an electrician.

20
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,066
Ah, it's open.

21
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:44,700
Open my ass.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,400
Didn't you work as an electrician?

23
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:47,966
I... I have a certificate.

24
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:48,833
I never actually worked the job.

25
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:53,033
Ah!

26
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,366
But there's one thing I can't figure out.

27
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,766
Why do you think Jin Xuehua plays with eagles?

28
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:31,400
When Jin Xuehua was livestreaming...

29
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:32,366
I think she said...

30
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:33,333
She said...

31
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:37,266
The eagle is the main magical instrument to cast a spell.

32
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:37,933
Magical instrument.

33
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:38,433
Magical instrument.

34
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,433
She went to find a magical instrument.

35
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:40,900
She found the magical instrument, and then what?

36
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:41,866
And then?

37
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:43,933
Then...

38
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,900
Perform a ritual.

39
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:50,133
Right.

40
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,600
Perform a ritual.

41
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:37,533
Stay away from me.

42
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:47,200
Ding Dayu.

43
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:49,266
Does it hurt?

44
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,800
It hurts me too.

45
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,666
Forces are mutual, you know.

46
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:54,533
How about this.

47
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,833
One last sentence in this world for each of you.

48
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,600
Okay? Want to say something?

49
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,000
Go ahead, we're saying goodbye soon.

50
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:03,400
Nothing to say?

51
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:04,333
Let me speak.

52
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,166
I don't lack money.

53
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,800
I have plenty of money.

54
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:08,866
Ah, face.

55
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,266
My face is gone.

56
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:12,866
You all treated me like this.

57
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:14,666
Cheating me, huh?

58
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:17,366
Then there's nothing to say.

59
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:18,033
Goodbye.

60
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:19,766
Goodbye.

61
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,066
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

62
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:24,966
Boss, you have all the face and reputation.

63
00:06:24,966 --> 00:06:25,800
Let me live.

64
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,466
Let me live, let me live.

65
00:06:27,466 --> 00:06:28,266
Let me live.

66
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:29,733
I have face and reputation, right?

67
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,400
It's nothing.

68
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:34,666
Boss, you like money, right?

69
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,366
I know someone.

70
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:36,733
Who can help you make money faster.

71
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:43,366
Boss, Boss.

72
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:44,666
Everything I'm saying is true.

73
00:06:44,766 --> 00:06:46,966
Jin Xuehua is an Immortal with great magic power.

74
00:06:46,966 --> 00:06:47,966
I guarantee it.

75
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:49,200
I swear to Heaven.

76
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,766
I will find Jin Xuehua.

77
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:52,233
She can bring you rolling wealth.

78
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:53,233
She can make you a fortune.

79
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,166
Everything I said is true.

80
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,200
She is his wife.

81
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,166
Screw you, that's bullshit! Screw you!

82
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,666
What do you say?

83
00:07:04,766 --> 00:07:05,866
I say screw your mother!

84
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:06,966
Zhou Qian.

85
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:08,133
You are a man.

86
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:09,333
You fucking fight me one-on-one!

87
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:14,833
Let me tell you.

88
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,566
I have a good friend too.

89
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:18,800
His name is the Jade Emperor.

90
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,933
No, no.

91
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:22,400
Listen to me.

92
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,033
Listen to me.

93
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,733
You better have something important to tell me right now.

94
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:41,166
Brother Qian, Old Five's money has been paid back.

95
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,566
The spirit has manifested!

96
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,733
Dayu.

97
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,800
Did we win this hand?

98
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:17,433
In this situation, I can usually show my hand.

99
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:22,533
Seven Pairs.

100
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:26,566
Oh my, I am really so sorry.

101
00:08:26,566 --> 00:08:28,233
I didn't expect that once my friend arrived

102
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:29,933
My luck would just turn right around.

103
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:31,733
Haha. Hey.

104
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,566
Oh, this won't do.

105
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:34,800
It's all your fault.

106
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,266
Oh, sorry, sorry.

107
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,633
This Seven Pairs is very, very, very big.

108
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:40,733
Very big, big.

109
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,800
I am really sorry about this.

110
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:57,733
How many One of Bamboos are in this deck?

111
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:06,733
How could we fail this time?

112
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:07,733
Usually at home

113
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:08,800
We practiced so many times.

114
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,533
Practice more next time.

115
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:12,133
Try to win a big one.

116
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,300
We agreed to come out and do business.

117
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,300
But you don't do the business properly.

118
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:19,666
Just swindling and cheating every day.

119
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,900
How many times have we gotten beaten up?

120
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,333
Don't be angry.

121
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,200
But we're getting better at taking a beating.

122
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:38,433
I'll do the job myself tomorrow.

123
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:39,433
You don't need to do it.

124
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,500
Do you hear me?

125
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:42,500
That wouldn't be right.

126
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:44,600
We are the best partners.

127
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,766
What "best partners"?

128
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:47,966
What have you ever contributed?

129
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:51,900
I... I at least helped you hand out business cards.

130
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,800
Get lost.

131
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:57,433
If I hadn't left the Rolex there just now

132
00:09:58,266 --> 00:09:59,433
Could we have gotten out?

133
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,400
Was that Rolex fake too?

134
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,633
What do you mean "fake"?

135
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:06,400
That was a Grade A 1:1 replica.

136
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:09,266
Do you know how long I saved to buy that Rolex?

137
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:10,966
Don't be mad, don't be mad, don't be mad.

138
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:12,333
I have a good idea.

139
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:14,833
To make big money.

140
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,800
Will you go to Macau with me?

141
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:18,000
Piss off.

142
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:20,700
From now on

143
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,800
You can go wherever the hell you want.

144
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,700
As for us, from now on

145
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:25,800
Let's not see each other.

146
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:42,033
You said it.

147
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:54,866
Ding Dayu.

148
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,733
I'll trust you one last time.
