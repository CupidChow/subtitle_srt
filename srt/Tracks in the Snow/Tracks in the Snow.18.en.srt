1
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:37,633
Oh

2
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:39,300
How come it closed down?

3
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,866
The lights aren't even on.

4
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:48,633
Oh

5
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:50,500
I heard

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,633
Poor management.

7
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,133
Who did you hear that from?

8
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:55,933
If you keep chattering over there

9
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:56,733
I'm gonna beat you up.

10
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,800
I have a proposal.

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,466
This shop

12
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,033
I'll buy it.

13
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:06,333
Then you guys acknowledge me as Boss.

14
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,233
Are you kidding me?

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,300
Are you crazy?

16
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:10,900
I'm really gonna beat you up.

17
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:13,733
Think about it.

18
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:15,600
Just consider it.

19
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:18,233
Call you what?

20
00:01:18,566 --> 00:01:19,633
Call me what?

21
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:20,300
Qian Ge

22
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:21,033
Call me Qian Ge.

23
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:22,733
Qian Ge, Qian Ge, Qian Ge.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,066
Louder.

25
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:25,333
Qian Ge, Qian Ge.

26
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,366
Call me what?

27
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:28,066
Qian Ge, Qian Ge.

28
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:29,233
Qian Ge.

29
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:31,166
What's our plan for the next step?

30
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:33,933
Next step.

31
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:40,466
First, change the name.

32
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:41,900
To what name?

33
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,333
Diamond Hub

34
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:49,866
Diamond.

35
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:52,633
Dodge! Dodge! Dodge!

36
00:01:52,633 --> 00:01:54,433
Bend down, I can't reach! Dodge!

37
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:56,566
Do you take me for a 3-year-old?

38
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:00,733
Hey, calm down first.

39
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:02,133
But I'm telling you the truth.

40
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:03,133
I didn't lie to you.

41
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:05,066
Jin Xuehua really ran off with a boss.

42
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:07,266
As long as you can help me find that woman Jin Xuehua

43
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:08,066
And that boss

44
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:09,133
I can catch them cheating.

45
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:10,566
And take the chance to shake them down.

46
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,533
What boss?

47
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:17,500
Called Brother Feng.

48
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:20,733
Brother Feng.

49
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:22,700
It's that...

50
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,133
That big boss with the huge business.

51
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:28,033
Big boss, filthy rich.

52
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:32,766
Your Jin Xuehua has been very close to the big boss lately.

53
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:35,500
Do you want to consider changing...

54
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:36,766
Changing to a different flower?

55
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:37,666
Just my personal opinion.

56
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:38,466
No, no, no.

57
00:02:38,466 --> 00:02:40,266
Changing flowers isn't important.

58
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:42,133
What's important is we get money.

59
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:44,266
How about this, after it's done, you take the big share, I take the small share.

60
00:02:44,366 --> 00:02:44,966
Hurry up.

61
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:46,833
Or they'll be done with their business.

62
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,433
How much money can we get?

63
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:52,500
That's a big boss worth over a hundred million.

64
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,333
If I shake him down...

65
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,233
Shouldn't I get...

66
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:55,966
Five million?

67
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,133
Five million.

68
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:25,300
Who are they?

69
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:28,433
Family members catching cheaters.

70
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,633
On my side.

71
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,466
They don't get a share, right?

72
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:33,833
No share.

73
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,133
Just watching to vent their anger.

74
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:36,900
Has nothing to do with money.

75
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:40,266
License plate number.

76
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,133
You agreed, right?

77
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:45,733
Ding Dayu, if you dare lie to me again

78
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,033
You can bury me alive.

79
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,133
Just bury me here.

80
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:49,033
Dead tight.

81
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:12,666
Oh

82
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:14,500
Boss, found the car.

83
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:17,366
Location.

84
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:22,266
Isn't this that place I often go to...

85
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:23,066
Oh, I know.

86
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,900
I'll pay you when we get back.

87
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:30,900
Found it. Where?

88
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:32,333
See for yourself.

89
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,766
Sigh, getting ready to go.

90
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,733
Hey, little sister.

91
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:37,933
Stop sleeping.

92
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:39,100
We're going to catch cheaters.

93
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,366
You gotta perk up.

94
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,300
Uncle will give you a candy.

95
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:47,533
Not for you.

96
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:53,666
Here, for you, for you.

97
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:00,166
Oh

98
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,433
The seatbelt is broken too.

99
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,433
Ah

100
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:18,066
Since you said this is an auspicious place

101
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,900
Today you should fulfill your promise

102
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:22,300
What exactly do you want to do?

103
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,100
Boss

104
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,966
Just think

105
00:05:25,766 --> 00:05:26,533
this

106
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,166
a woman who knows Psychic Fortune-telling

107
00:05:30,966 --> 00:05:32,733
suddenly and inexplicably

108
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:36,166
dies at a project under development

109
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:38,766
If the media finds out about this

110
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:39,566
and it blows up

111
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:42,366
won't these houses be impossible to sell?

112
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:43,900
Boss

113
00:05:44,366 --> 00:05:46,233
Boss, killing me does you no good

114
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:48,733
I'm just chatting with you

115
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:50,766
Let me tell you

116
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:52,666
if you die here today

117
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:54,500
and I make a big scene out of it

118
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:55,700
the Deyang Group

119
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,433
can forget about continuing this project

120
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:59,566
Projects that my Brother Feng can't develop

121
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:00,833
he shouldn't expect to succeed either

122
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:18,166
Where is this?

123
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,100
It seems like

124
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:22,900
this used to be a big commercial district

125
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,066
called something like Deyang Group

126
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,400
spent a lot of money

127
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:29,200
to develop this place

128
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:30,866
How come?

129
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:33,033
Weren't they supposed to develop Guangming Road?

130
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,100
Don't listen to what people say

131
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:37,966
look at what they do

132
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:39,900
Dozens of companies, big and small

133
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,300
why was Deyang Group chosen in the end?

134
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:44,066
Think about it yourself

135
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:46,166
Boss, listen to me

136
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,166
If you kill me

137
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:50,500
they'll still develop what they need to develop

138
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:51,766
How about this

139
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:53,700
I'm media too

140
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:57,466
You're an influencer, what kind of media is that?

141
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:02,566
Self-media is also media, Boss

142
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,633
Boss, let me educate you

143
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,500
Self-media is translated as "self media" by Xinhua

144
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:10,833
It is a way to provide and share their own

145
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,466
facts and news

146
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:12,966
It is a kind of

147
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:13,266
Enough

148
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,666
stop bullshitting me

149
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:15,833
Come on

150
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:17,233
time to meet your maker

151
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:19,233
Boss, Boss

152
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,266
Boss

153
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:23,400
Help!

154
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,666
Seems like this is the only road here

155
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:29,000
What is this?

156
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,066
Xuehua

157
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:31,400
She seems to be tied up there

158
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:31,600
Jin Xuehua

159
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:36,400
Xuehua

160
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:38,333
She's over there. Xuehua

161
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,233
I'll kill you

162
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:42,500
Hold this

163
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:46,433
Get him

164
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:49,233
Hit him

165
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:52,233
Xuehua

166
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,500
Oh my, you guys

167
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,266
Little sister, you, you

168
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:26,433
come look quickly

169
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,300
it's so exciting

170
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,133
They're fighting

171
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,600
Oh, oh, oh

172
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,466
Does this girl need help?

173
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:44,300
I'll kill you

174
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,500
Oh, she seems to be the toughest

175
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:01,533
Sister

176
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:02,866
stay strong
