1
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,200
My name is Zhou Qian.

2
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,066
If you have any issues in the future,

3
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,100
you can come find me.

4
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:43,766
Okay.

5
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,433
All right?

6
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:46,600
Long time no see.

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,466
You can come to me for anything.

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,333
Here's one for everyone.

9
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:51,600
My condolences.

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,100
My condolences.

11
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:52,966
If you need anything...

12
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:54,366
come find me if you need anything later.

13
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:56,266
Bro, come find me if you need anything later.

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,433
Brother Xu Dong.

15
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:58,700
Xu Dong.

16
00:00:59,166 --> 00:00:59,833
It's you.

17
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:00,733
I'm Xiao Zhou.

18
00:01:00,766 --> 00:01:01,833
I'm Xiao Zhou.

19
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:03,900
In the future, if anyone has any issues,

20
00:01:03,966 --> 00:01:05,100
you can all come find me.

21
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:06,433
Please accept my condolences.

22
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,766
My condolences to everyone.

23
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:08,366
Okay.

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,266
Thank you, thank you.

25
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:11,633
You look very familiar.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,933
Did I read your palm before?

27
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:14,666
Right?

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,500
I can check how things are going for you lately.

29
00:01:16,866 --> 00:01:17,300
Lately...

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,500
this... your luck is totally exploding!

31
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:21,566
Okay, thanks for your hard work.

32
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:23,100
And your career...

33
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:23,666
That's enough.

34
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,633
Stop bragging here.

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,700
How many minutes have I been waiting?

36
00:01:29,266 --> 00:01:30,466
Did you settle the bill?

37
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:31,600
What money?

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,833
The host family is dilly-dallying.

39
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:34,766
They don't want these anymore.

40
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:36,233
They want a refund.

41
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,633
Why should we refund?

42
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:39,466
Their old man died.

43
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:40,366
And they won't pay?

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,900
What does that have to do with me?

45
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:48,133
Thank you.

46
00:01:52,633 --> 00:01:54,066
Bro, have a drink.

47
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:01,966
Friend.

48
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:05,500
We can't refund the joss paper you ordered.

49
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:08,433
The person is gone.

50
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:09,466
Why spend that money?

51
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,566
Just burn a little as a gesture.

52
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,266
This joss paper...

53
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,566
is for when people die...

54
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:16,133
and need to use it over there.

55
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:18,566
Living the high life depends on it.

56
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,766
Don't give me that useless nonsense.

57
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,733
When my father-in-law was alive,

58
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,566
he didn't eat spicy food.

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,000
Just refund it.

60
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:27,633
You're playing games.

61
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:29,100
You kept changing the shroud before.

62
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:30,633
Did I ask you for money then?

63
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,500
The old man got fat then thin while sick.

64
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:34,666
Is that my problem?

65
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:36,600
Besides,

66
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:38,100
the body is already cremated.

67
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:38,800
Right?

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,666
I'm not giving you money.

69
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:41,233
So what?

70
00:02:41,766 --> 00:02:42,700
You won't pay?

71
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:43,533
And you're putting on an act with me?

72
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:44,133
Is that it?

73
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:46,500
I'll ask you one last time.

74
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:48,600
Are you paying or not?

75
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:52,666
What about it?

76
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,233
You want to clash with me?

77
00:02:57,633 --> 00:02:58,466
Second Uncle!

78
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,066
Third Uncle!

79
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:01,400
Uncle-in-law!

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,333
Let's get him!

81
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:04,533
What?

82
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:05,766
Looking for trouble?

83
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:16,633
I wanted to give you...

84
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,433
Eat and drink well.

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,033
Go on, keep eating.

86
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:21,533
Come on.

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,666
Alright, alright, alright.

88
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,233
Let's not stoop to his level.

89
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:25,766
Let's go, let's go.

90
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,466
Who do you think you're messing with?

91
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:31,200
You're something else, kid. You actually got it.

92
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,466
You're not bad yourself.

93
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,033
How could this possibly be real money?

94
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:35,833
Maybe it's Hell bank notes inside.

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,666
Impossible, boss. It's definitely real money.

96
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,800
Why is it impossible?

97
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,866
Think about it. He needs 200,000.

98
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,233
He went to find Lao Wu.

99
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:43,366
And got that 200,000.

100
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:45,066
He should have run away long ago.

101
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:45,933
Real money.

102
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:08,766
Brother Zhou.

103
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:11,200
We've known each other for so many years.

104
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:13,233
I got the money back for you.

105
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,500
You write me a receipt.

106
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:15,733
Then I'll take the money.

107
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,600
That's the proper way to do things.

108
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:24,766
A Hao, write him a receipt.

109
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:25,766
Okay.

110
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,200
Bro.

111
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:32,433
I've never toasted you before.

112
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:49,833
Bro.

113
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,233
You still have to lend me 200,000.

114
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,033
Nobody move.

115
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:04,900
Bank of Heaven and Earth?

116
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:06,533
You haven't had enough of a beating yet.

117
00:05:06,633 --> 00:05:07,366
Don't do anything rash.

118
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,100
Put it down.

119
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:08,866
Don't move.

120
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,200
Open the safe for me.

121
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:13,733
What do we do, boss?

122
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,533
He's pulling a "catch the king first" on us!

123
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,733
Open it!

124
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,466
Hurry up and go!

125
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:22,900
Xiao Longzhou.

126
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:23,866
What are you standing there for?

127
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,766
Hurry up.

128
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,166
Sorry, boss.

129
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,200
You, come here.

130
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,400
Don't move.

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,933
Boss, boss, boss.

132
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:38,466
Boss.

133
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:40,200
To catch the thieves, first catch the king.

134
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,833
Save me, save me!

135
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:42,566
Let my boss go.

136
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,200
Or else I'll kill him.

137
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,700
Then go ahead and kill him.

138
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:47,266
And then I'll stab your boss to death.

139
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,266
To catch the thieves, first catch the king.

140
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,800
He's not the king!

141
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,566
He's a nobody!

142
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,000
Get lost!

143
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,800
Hurry up!

144
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,100
Sorry, boss.

145
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,933
Stop bowing, damn it! Go!

146
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,033
Let my boss go.

147
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,066
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

148
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:18,066
Don't come any closer!

149
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:19,266
Let my boss go, now!

150
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,266
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

151
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:21,133
Back off.

152
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:21,966
Slow down, slow down.

153
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:23,500
Don't come over.

154
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:24,266
Everyone get out here!

155
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,433
Catch them!

156
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:39,700
Ding Dayu!

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,766
Don't run!

158
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:14,500
Go, quick!

159
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:05,466
Um...

160
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,700
Can I ask you a favor?

161
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,566
Spit it out.

162
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:09,933
Well...

163
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,766
Can we maybe drive a little more steadily?

164
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:14,033
If you don't want to ride, get out.

165
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:18,366
Darn it, darn it, darn it.

166
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:50,566
What are you screaming for?

167
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,533
What do you mean?

168
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,400
Regretting it?

169
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:38,866
Too late for regrets.

170
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:41,033
We have to see this through to the end.

171
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,633
Shouldn't we first figure out

172
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,600
our route and plan?

173
00:10:46,633 --> 00:10:48,133
What if we don't find anyone

174
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,266
and get ourselves killed?

175
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:51,433
Look at you, you coward.

176
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,733
Let me tell you something.

177
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:53,666
The plan is simple.

178
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,700
We go in and pay the money.

179
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:56,400
Make him let her go.

180
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:57,566
If he doesn't let her go,

181
00:10:58,233 --> 00:10:59,100
I'll hold them off.

182
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:00,466
You go save her.

183
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:01,533
Get Jin Xuehua out.

184
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:02,466
Don't worry about me.

185
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:04,200
Keep the money safe.

186
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:23,533
You're serious?

187
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:24,933
Just in case we can save

188
00:11:24,966 --> 00:11:25,700
this 200,000.

189
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,766
Hello?

190
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,466
I know, I know.

191
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,166
I'll be right on time.

192
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:46,466
I have no way back now.

193
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,666
If I can't find Jin Xuehua,

194
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,866
not only can't I repay the company,

195
00:11:51,566 --> 00:11:53,300
but my life will be in danger too.
