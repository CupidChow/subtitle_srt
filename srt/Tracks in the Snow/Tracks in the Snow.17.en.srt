1
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:37,566
Let's focus on drinking

2
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:40,066
Come on, come on

3
00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:49,000
Didn't you say before that Guangming Jie

4
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:50,466
could be developed?

5
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:51,000
Right?

6
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,800
Why is Weigong Jie being developed now?

7
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,166
I invested a lot of money.

8
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,433
When did I say Guangming Road could be developed?

9
00:00:58,833 --> 00:00:59,633
Did I say that?

10
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:03,033
Didn't you say last time it could be developed?

11
00:01:03,866 --> 00:01:04,766
It's like this.

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,733
Your investment is your own business.

13
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:09,200
Where we develop

14
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:10,466
is our business.

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,566
So this matter

16
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:12,866
is really two different things.

17
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:14,366
Can't be lumped together.

18
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:15,833
Drink, drink, drink.

19
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:19,533
I see.

20
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:23,366
No, Boss Liu, name a figure.

21
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:25,900
I'll give you this much.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,600
Xiao Feng

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,266
Bribing me?

24
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:30,466
Is your Brother Liu

25
00:01:31,366 --> 00:01:32,966
that kind of person?

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
So talented.

27
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:13,533
Xiao Feng

28
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:15,566
I'm telling you to record.

29
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:16,866
Record.

30
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:23,100
Record.

31
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:33,066
A lifetime, one glass of wine.

32
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,266
Oh.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,433
Oh.

34
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,266
Xuehua

35
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:26,866
Xuehua

36
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:28,733
Xuehua

37
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,200
Xuehua

38
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:33,266
Oh, Lao Wei

39
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,966
What do we do?

40
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:35,833
Xuehua

41
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:38,666
Lao Wei

42
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:40,733
Aunt

43
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:43,033
Get up first, Lao Wei

44
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:44,833
Lao Wei

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,533
The rain! Oh my god, the rain!

46
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:51,833
What took you so long?

47
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:52,966
A car just came by.

48
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,233
And took Xuehua away.

49
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,866
We came down from the hot spring.

50
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:57,866
Let me ask you.

51
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,333
These people Aunt talked about...

52
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,833
Are they the ones who asked you to kidnap Jin Xuehua?

53
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:01,733
Who else could it be?

54
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:02,433
It has to be them.

55
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:04,000
Wait, what exactly happened to Xuehua?

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,733
Why is everyone kidnapping her?

57
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:07,966
Because Jin Xuehua and I scammed them out of money.

58
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:09,733
I just don't get it.

59
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:12,533
Can't you just pay the money back?

60
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:13,633
Why do they have to resort to kidnapping?

61
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:15,000
Anyway,

62
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:16,600
We have to find Jin Xuehua.

63
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:18,533
I'm counting on her to save my daughter's life.

64
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:20,500
Wake up.

65
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,100
Your daughter is a comatose patient.

66
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,633
She doesn't need a ritual.

67
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:25,000
She needs a doctor.

68
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,533
If it weren't for you,

69
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,000
I would have found Jin Xuehua ages ago.

70
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,100
Lao Wei, Lao Wei, Lao Wei.

71
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,233
Cut the crap.

72
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,833
Isn't it because you scammed them?

73
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,266
Now you're blaming me again?

74
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,333
Is it my fault?

75
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,033
Didn't Jin Xuehua scam the money with me?

76
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:37,833
Say that again.

77
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:38,533
What did I say wrong?

78
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:39,300
Say that again.

79
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,366
Hey, stop arguing.

80
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:42,033
Let's figure something out, quick.

81
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:43,100
What do we do?

82
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:45,333
Let me ask you.

83
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:47,600
Do you know Brother Feng's people?

84
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,466
Where is he now?

85
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:50,533
How should I know?

86
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:52,533
Listen up.

87
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,100
Brother Feng.

88
00:04:55,766 --> 00:04:57,000
Since he dares to kidnap,

89
00:04:58,233 --> 00:04:59,300
He definitely,

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,366
Went to a hidden place.

91
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:03,766
Like I don't know he'd go to a hidden place.

92
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,166
Hey, let me ask you.

93
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:09,200
There's only one intersection ahead.

94
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:10,166
Which way do we go?

95
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,000
Go left.

96
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:14,333
You say left but you point right.

97
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,833
Right, go right.

98
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:16,800
Oh, Aunt.

99
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,000
You're pointing to the left.

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,366
Oh, it doesn't matter.

101
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:21,033
That's not important right now.

102
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:22,466
We need to get moving first.

103
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:23,566
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

104
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:24,333
Go right.

105
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,400
Why go right?

106
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,666
Look at that face of yours.

107
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,233
Who would believe a word you say?

108
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:30,133
What's wrong with my face?

109
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:30,933
What do you look like?

110
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:32,400
You look sleazy.

111
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,566
I look sleazy?

112
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't you think you look sleazy?

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,033
I'm sleazy?

114
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,833
Sleazy. Too sleazy.

115
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,033
You're ugly.

116
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:41,866
Hideous.

117
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:42,600
I'm hideous?

118
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,633
Ugly.

119
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,933
Ugly.

120
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:47,366
And you say I look sleazy?

121
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:49,566
I'm sleazy? Look at your big wavy hair.

122
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:50,400
Look at your own head.

123
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,000
Alright, alright.

124
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:53,066
Okay, okay, okay.

125
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:54,600
Okay, stop scratching.

126
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,400
Hey, stop scratching.

127
00:05:56,266 --> 00:05:57,966
Neither of you knows which way to go.

128
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:58,966
Someone knows.

129
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:02,633
Hey!

130
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:04,300
Help!

131
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,233
Where is Xiao Jin?

132
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:11,800
Long time no see.

133
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,233
Why is it you again?

134
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:16,533
What do you want this time?

135
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:18,433
What are you doing?

136
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,466
Aren't you good at fortune-telling?

137
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,366
Tell your own fortune.

138
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,600
See what I want to do.

139
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:25,233
Brother.

140
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:26,533
Stop kidding around.

141
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:27,333
I'm a fake.

142
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,966
I can't tell fortunes.

143
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,200
Give me a break, you're a fake?

144
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:33,933
Last time you performed that ritual for me,

145
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:35,600
that performance was something else.

146
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:38,066
Do another one for me later.

147
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,433
What are we doing this time?

148
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,233
Help!

149
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:46,400
Ah
