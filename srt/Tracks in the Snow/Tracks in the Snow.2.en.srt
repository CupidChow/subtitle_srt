1
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,066
Trying to cover up a crime only makes it more obvious.

2
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,766
And I kept making mistakes to cover the first one.

3
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:41,166
I stopped Ding Dayu from calling the police.

4
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:43,633
I thought I was being smart,

5
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,166
but it only led me step by step

6
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,633
down an illegal path of no return.

7
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:54,600
Want to see?

8
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,100
Sure.

9
00:00:57,866 --> 00:00:58,766
Just in time.

10
00:00:58,766 --> 00:01:00,466
You can inspect the goods yourself.

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,200
See how good my skills are.

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,066
See what they're really like.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:04,900
Sis, Sis, Sis.

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,300
No, no, no, no need.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,200
Such developed pecs.

16
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:08,733
Sis, Sis.

17
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:09,333
Don't, don't, don't.

18
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:09,966
No need, no need.

19
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:11,200
In a rush, brother?

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,300
No, no, no.

21
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:14,166
Don't, don't, don't, no need.

22
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,600
You've got a strong grip.

23
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,200
No, no, no, I'm not strong.

24
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:17,566
No strength.

25
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:18,933
Not strong at all.

26
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:19,333
Sis.

27
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:19,866
Not strong.

28
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,233
WeChat Pay received 888 yuan.

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,733
Sis.

30
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,033
Help me out.

31
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:26,266
You got off cheap.

32
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:27,766
What do you want to see?

33
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,466
It's Jin Xuehua.

34
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:45,400
After an overnight investigation, city police...

35
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,500
found by the river...

36
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:48,000
the body of the kidnapped Ms. Chen.

37
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:50,700
Forensics estimate she has been dead for two days.

38
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,733
This is a heinous...

39
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:52,733
kidnapping and extortion case.

40
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:54,200
After receiving the ransom, the suspect...

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,000
did not release the victim...

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,866
but instead tortured the deceased.

43
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,366
Police have now received...

44
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,666
a report of another missing person case.

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,966
The missing person is female.

46
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:02,733
It is possible the same suspect is involved.

47
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:04,266
Surveillance footage shows...

48
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:06,100
the suspect wearing a black trench coat...

49
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,433
and a black bucket hat.

50
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,300
The suspect is currently still at large.

51
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,100
We advise all women...

52
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,533
to be cautious when going out.

53
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,266
The person in the surveillance footage...

54
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,133
looks just like the description in the news.

55
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:18,766
Pick up the phone.

56
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:24,800
Pick up.

57
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:28,666
Hello?

58
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,300
What's that sound?

59
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:32,733
It's Jin Xuehua's voice.

60
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:36,400
Something happened to Jin Xuehua.

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,500
I always said that girl...

62
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:40,366
messing around all day...

63
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:41,500
playing with the supernatural...

64
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:43,066
was bound to get possessed.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,366
Help!

66
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:39,300
What's your name?

67
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:43,166
Big brother.

68
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:44,233
My name is...

69
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,633
My name is Jin Xuehua.

70
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,533
I have money, don't kill me.

71
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,200
Big brother, Big brother, Big brother.

72
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:26,966
Big brother.

73
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,333
Big brother.

74
00:04:28,366 --> 00:04:30,433
Is there some kind of misunderstanding?

75
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:31,366
Big brother.

76
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:33,100
Big brother, don't hang up on me.

77
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:33,933
Big brother.

78
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,333
Big brother.

79
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,966
Big brother.

80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,633
Big brother

81
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,600
Big brother! Big brother!

82
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,733
Big brother!

83
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,100
Big brother, let's talk this over.

84
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:03,100
Big brother!

85
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:04,900
Big brother!

86
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:05,566
Big brother! Big brother!

87
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,633
Big brother, please let me down.

88
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:09,233
Big brother!

89
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,433
Big brother!

90
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:16,333
Do you want money or my body?

91
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Don't leave me hanging here.

92
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,833
Let me down.

93
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,100
My surname is Jin. I'm Jin Xuehua.

94
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,966
Big brother, did you kidnap the wrong person?

95
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:25,366
Big brother!

96
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,000
Big brother!

97
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:27,700
Big brother!

98
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,600
Big brother!

99
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:30,233
Big brother!

100
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,066
Big brother!

101
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,433
Big brother!

102
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,600
Big brother!

103
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:07,866
Big brother!

104
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,500
Big brother!

105
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,433
Big brother, is there some misunderstanding?

106
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,066
Big brother!

107
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:14,866
Big brother!

108
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,700
Big brother!

109
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:28,966
Scream again and I'll chop you up.

110
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,233
If it were a kidnapping,

111
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:43,233
he would ask for a ransom.

112
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:44,133
But he hasn't said a word.

113
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,200
No way.

114
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,900
This is too complicated.

115
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:46,733
Let's call the police immediately.

116
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:47,600
We can't call the police.

117
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,666
I already told you.

118
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,033
Calling the police is useless without evidence.

119
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:52,466
What if it really is a kidnapping?

120
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,400
Calling the police will just spook them.

121
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,533
Don't you care if Jin Xuehua lives or dies?

122
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:57,366
Then what do you suggest?

123
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,033
How about this, brother.

124
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,033
Calm down for a second.

125
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:04,533
Me,

126
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:05,633
I'm not a local.

127
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,633
I can hear that.

128
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,466
But I have an interesting friend here.

129
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,933
Maybe he can help.

130
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:12,866
Let's go, let's go.

131
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:37,066
What the hell are you doing?

132
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:39,966
Brother.

133
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,400
Can't you have

134
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,500
a little trust in me?

135
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,900
How do I not trust you?

136
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:46,966
No, if you trusted me,

137
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,066
would you handcuff me?

138
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:49,666
And can't you use a proper pair of handcuffs?

139
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:50,466
What is this?

140
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:51,666
Kinky handcuffs?

141
00:07:52,066 --> 00:07:53,133
Isn't this a bit suggestive?

142
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:56,166
Don't you think you're being a little too helpful?

143
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:57,733
You say you're on my side.

144
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,566
What if you're with the kidnappers?

145
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:00,866
I told you.

146
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:03,066
I'm just a middleman.

147
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:04,433
I just...

148
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:05,866
My goal is just to make money.

149
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:08,233
Now I can't even make my own money.

150
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:09,633
I can't even cover my own debts.

151
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:11,866
How could I possibly be with them?

152
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:25,766
You two run a mom-and-pop shop, right?

153
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:27,933
One-stop service.

154
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:29,633
She performs rituals,

155
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:30,933
and you sell funeral supplies.

156
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:32,933
Say something useful.

157
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:34,000
Turn left at the intersection ahead.

158
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:36,666
Turn left at the traffic light ahead.

159
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,033
I don't need your nonsense.

160
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,100
Why aren't you talking now?

161
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:46,566
Speak up.

162
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:47,100
Which way?

163
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,600
Go up the bridge ahead, come down, then turn right.

164
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,833
Why does your friend live so far out?

165
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,833
I even saw cornfields nearby.

166
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,000
Which way?

167
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:25,233
Probably up ahead.

168
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:35,000
Lao Hei.

169
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:36,933
It's me.

170
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,933
Xiao Longzhou.

171
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:40,166
I have something I need your help with.

172
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,333
It's a real emergency.

173
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,100
Open the door first.

174
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,533
Let's go inside and talk, okay?

175
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:48,033
Lao Hei.

176
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,900
Look how well Longzhou treats you.

177
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,566
Sending you business one after another.

178
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,133
I don't even want to bring it up.

179
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,066
Lao Hei.

180
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:57,600
It's like this.

181
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,300
I came to find you today...

182
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,600
I really have an urgent matter.

183
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:03,433
In my friend's phone...

184
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:04,200
This incoming number...

185
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:05,800
Can you check it for me?

186
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,366
What kind of data?

187
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:13,966
Inside this phone...

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,200
Can you check all the info?

189
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:17,200
I can check anything related to signals.

190
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,600
Check a phone number's owner info for me.

191
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:20,433
How much?

192
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:21,833
1,000.

193
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,833
1,000.

194
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:24,233
No problem.

195
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,600
You know the rules, right?

196
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,866
If anything happens, don't say it was me.

197
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:34,800
Liu Chunhua.

198
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,066
Female, 45 years old.

199
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,566
Died in 2012.

200
00:10:38,566 --> 00:10:39,666
June 12th.

201
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,300
Dead?

202
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,733
How can a dead person make a call?

203
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,033
Are you stupid?

204
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:46,500
The owner died...

205
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,500
But the number isn't dead.

206
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,966
If the number works, that's enough.

207
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:50,500
Then the location of this number...

208
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:51,233
Can it be tracked?

209
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:52,700
Yes.

210
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:53,400
1,000 yuan.

211
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:55,466
No problem.

212
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,300
Check it.

213
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,033
Check, check, check.

214
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:10,833
Darn it.

215
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:11,700
Where is this?

216
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,800
This is my home.

217
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:14,966
What's wrong?

218
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,000
Stop right there.
