1
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:45,233
Stop right there!

2
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:46,333
Stop!

3
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:55,766
Stop!

4
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:00,366
Cut him off from that side!

5
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:04,166
Hurry up!

6
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:11,033
If I catch you, I'll kill you!

7
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:14,133
Stand right there!

8
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:19,333
Stop!

9
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:35,333
What's wrong?

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,100
I twisted my ankle! My ankle!

11
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:37,933
Chase him! Go! Go!

12
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:38,933
Chase him! Go on!

13
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:55,833
That's so wicked.

14
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,200
What kind of people are they?

15
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,333
Not only did they cut my breaker,

16
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,633
they also cut my wires.

17
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:01,500
My work is completely ruined now.

18
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,633
Everything is ruined.

19
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,933
Didn't I ask you to check this number's location?

20
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:06,566
Why so much nonsense?

21
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:07,400
Just check it.

22
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:09,366
Do you know what I have to do?

23
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,966
I have to plug all these wires into the ports now.

24
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:12,766
Before I can check.

25
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,333
Do you realize how much trouble that is?

26
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:16,066
And you.

27
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:18,233
Nothing good ever happens when I run into you.

28
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:19,600
Just get lost already.

29
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:23,333
Don't say I didn't warn you.

30
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:25,166
You guys might be being followed.

31
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,933
Whether by man or ghost, I don't know.

32
00:02:33,466 --> 00:02:35,133
Do you have any enemies?

33
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:36,733
Brother,

34
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,266
I'm just saying,

35
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:40,866
one of you is a Spiritual Medium,

36
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:42,166
and the other is an undertaker.

37
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,033
If there really are any Karmic debts,

38
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:46,066
they shouldn't be coming for me, right?

39
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:51,633
Let's go then.

40
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:52,366
Everything we needed to check here,

41
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:53,300
we've pretty much checked.

42
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:58,100
Let's go.

43
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,833
Um,

44
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,433
Lao Hei,

45
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,066
sorry about this.

46
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,433
Sorry to trouble you again.

47
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:17,333
If you get any news,

48
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,200
remember to let me know.

49
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm heading out first.

50
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:19,800
Wait a minute.

51
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,133
Take this.

52
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,066
It's a Protective charm.

53
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:26,433
Yeah.

54
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:28,266
The world's most complete collection of Magical instruments,

55
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:29,366
is right here on this.

56
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:37,533
Do you always scam money online?

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,500
Brother,

58
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,133
don't put it so harshly.

59
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:41,200
What do you mean "scam"?

60
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:42,200
I am a gentleman who loves money,

61
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:43,133
and I obtain it the right way.

62
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:44,133
Besides,

63
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:45,433
I wasn't the only one scamming money.

64
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,900
Didn't Jin Xuehua participate too?

65
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:48,200
You're talking nonsense.

66
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,666
Our Jin Xuehua does live streams online,

67
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,700
that's earning her own living.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,266
Whether fans want to Send gifts or not,

69
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:53,166
is entirely voluntary.

70
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,766
You bunch of Shills,

71
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,366
once you start Stirring things up, the nature of it changes.

72
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:58,166
Brother,

73
00:03:58,466 --> 00:03:59,500
let me ask you something.

74
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,033
Jin Xuehua and that dead woman,

75
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:02,300
did they have a grudge or something?

76
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,633
Did you guys take someone's money,

77
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:04,433
and not do the job?

78
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,500
So they took revenge?

79
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,900
Even if we didn't do the job,

80
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,033
they wouldn't go as far as kidnapping Jin Xuehua, right?

81
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,733
And following us.

82
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:15,733
It's not that big of a deal.

83
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,000
Brother,

84
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,766
is it possible that,

85
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:25,000
the people who kidnapped Jin Xuehua,

86
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:27,000
and the person who just called you,

87
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:28,600
are not the same group?

88
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:43,300
200,000.

89
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,433
One hour later.

90
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,000
Want her alive, don't call the police.

91
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,833
Ask him where he is.

92
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:55,766
Flower-Bird-Fish-Insect Market, No. 28.

93
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:00,833
Brother.

94
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,166
Brother, Brother.

95
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:04,133
I'm just a small-time influencer.

96
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:05,466
I usually just tell little ghost stories.

97
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,133
How did I offend you?

98
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:08,400
I can change, can't I?

99
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:08,866
Brother.

100
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:09,333
Brother.

101
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:10,933
Do you want a spiritual reading?

102
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:12,033
If you think it's too expensive...

103
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:12,933
I'll give you this one for free.

104
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:14,600
10% off the next order is fine too, Brother.

105
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:15,366
Brother.

106
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,033
If something's wrong, just tell me.

107
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:19,933
Is there a misunderstanding between us?

108
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:20,666
Brother.

109
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,133
Brother.

110
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:51,566
Oh my God.

111
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,300
It really works.

112
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,133
It really works.

113
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:50,366
Stop shouting.

114
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,133
I didn't do anything, Brother.

115
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:03,866
I didn't do anything.
