1
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,266
Ahhh!

2
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,266
Damn you!

3
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:11,633
Xuehua!

4
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,033
Yuanyuan!

5
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,133
Are you okay?

6
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:18,566
Yuanyuan! Yuanyuan! Yuanyuan!

7
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,033
Are you all right?

8
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:37,366
Lao Wei.

9
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:55,066
Thank you, Lao Wei.

10
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:58,866
We have to find the ritual drumstick, fast.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,833
I told you.

12
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,433
I don't have the drumstick.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,666
The drumstick is with my Aunt.

14
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,666
Your Aunt?

15
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:17,466
She's my grandma's cousin's niece.

16
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,500
Back when my grandma's grandma practiced Spirit Channeling,

17
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:23,400
she gave the drum and drumstick to my grandma and great-aunt.

18
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,500
Later, my grandma wanted to give me the drum,

19
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:28,666
but my great-aunt gave the drumstick to her niece.

20
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,900
That's my Aunt.

21
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,800
So where is your Aunt?

22
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:39,033
The Floating Market. She sells kimchi.

23
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:39,900
She's easy to spot.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,633
Big wavy hair, big eyes, loud voice.

25
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,733
Like a duck.

26
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:45,233
Let's go.

27
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:46,866
Let's go find your Aunt.

28
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,133
Hey, hey.

29
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:49,966
Let me go.

30
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,500
It's easier if I go.

31
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:53,066
Heheheh.

32
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:53,866
It's more convenient if I go.

33
00:02:53,866 --> 00:02:54,633
Heheheh.

34
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,233
Take good care of Yuanyuan.

35
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,600
How am I supposed to take care of her?

36
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,900
Girl,

37
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:29,933
we've been friends for years.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,433
I'm going to be straight with you.

39
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:33,033
Hurry up. What is it?

40
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:34,400
What exactly did you see?

41
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,600
Your husband is seeing someone else, you know?

42
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,233
What? Someone else?

43
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:40,866
Give me your husband's birth chart later.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,466
And then?

45
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:44,800
We'll perform a "Severing the Affair" ritual on him and that vixen.

46
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,300
Let's get your husband back first.

47
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:47,300
I'm so pissed off!

48
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,233
Hey, alright.

49
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:49,300
Stop talking about me.

50
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,466
How are you doing these days?

51
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:53,766
Look at you, surrounded by pickles all day. Found a man yet?

52
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,433
I'm doing fine.

53
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:55,100
I'm doing great!

54
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:56,700
Come on.

55
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,666
What kind do you want?

56
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,633
I'll find one for you.

57
00:03:58,766 --> 00:04:00,866
I like the manly type.

58
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:01,600
Manly, right?

59
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:01,966
Manly.

60
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:02,366
Oh my.

61
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:03,766
I don't even have one of those.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,833
Leave it to me.

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,800
Sir.

64
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,500
Buying kimchi?

65
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:25,200
Jin Xuehua is in trouble.

66
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,033
Huh?

67
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:27,500
What happened?

68
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:31,766
Are you sure Jin Xuehua went to the Floating Market?

69
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,800
I'm not sure either.

70
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,266
It's not like Jin Xuehua is that capable.

71
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:36,533
That you give her so much credit.

72
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,733
Hey, Aunt!

73
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:46,266
Aunt!

74
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,700
Aunt, wait a second!

75
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:54,533
Hey!

76
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:56,366
Aunt, stop the car!

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,800
Let's go! Get in, let's chase her!

78
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Oh my, how could Xuehua get sick?

79
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,400
I mean,

80
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,566
I told her long ago,

81
00:05:25,766 --> 00:05:27,366
told her not to learn her grandma's stuff.

82
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:29,500
She wouldn't listen, even started livestreaming.

83
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,600
Good heavens.

84
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,533
Who believes in that stuff nowadays?

85
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,000
Sigh.

86
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,900
Right, brother?

87
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,966
Xuehua's illness is different this time.

88
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:46,733
It seems...

89
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:48,400
she bumped into something.

90
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:49,833
Huh?

91
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,566
Possession.

92
00:05:58,133 --> 00:05:59,366
I told that child,

93
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:01,300
not to learn her grandma's stuff.

94
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,100
She just wouldn't listen.

95
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,966
So,

96
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:04,600
you have a ritual drumstick.

97
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,700
That ritual drumstick can save lives in a pinch.

98
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,166
That's why I came to find you.

99
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,400
The ritual drumstick?

100
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,600
I gave it to my nephew.

101
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,266
Let him take it to play with ages ago.

102
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:15,366
Don't know where he threw it.

103
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:16,200
It's gone.

104
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:23,800
Gone.

105
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,966
Yeah, gone.

106
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:28,266
Xuehua knows about this.

107
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:29,400
I mentioned it to her.

108
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:31,000
She didn't tell you?

109
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,400
Wait, brother, who are you?

110
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:39,200
Wait, brother.

111
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,300
Brother! Ah!

112
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:44,900
Brother, wait a minute.

113
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,933
Who are you?

114
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,566
Who are you, brother?

115
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,866
Put me down!

116
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:50,566
I'm not going!

117
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:52,066
Not going, not going!

118
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,766
What are you looking at me for?

119
00:07:02,766 --> 00:07:03,466
Look for it!

120
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:06,533
No, wait.

121
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,800
Lao Wei is looking for Jin Xuehua,

122
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:13,700
because Jin Xuehua can perform a ritual to save his daughter.

123
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:17,066
You've spent the most time with Jin Xuehua.

124
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,166
Think about it.

125
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,666
Did Jin Xuehua give you any clues?

126
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,300
Okay, let me think.

127
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:21,933
Hurry, hurry.

128
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:22,666
Think faster.

129
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm about to lose my life here.

130
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,333
Cut the crap.

131
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,666
Isn't this all because of you?

132
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,266
Anyway, just think quickly.

133
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:40,500
Xuehua...

134
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,466
Jin Xuehua...

135
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,866
You damn girl.

136
00:07:43,866 --> 00:07:45,500
Are you trying to get me killed?

137
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,933
You have no conscience.

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,900
Even ghosts won't let you off.

139
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:48,533
Enough.

140
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:33,666
Same as before:

141
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:36,166
Help me,

142
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:38,533
and I'll let you go.

143
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,600
Help.

144
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,500
Help with what?

145
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:44,700
Who's gonna help?

146
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,266
You help!

147
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:48,700
Oh my.

148
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,433
Then hurry up and help!

149
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:52,133
I can't help!

150
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:53,100
What do you mean you can't?

151
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,166
Brother, let me tell you.

152
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,333
Aunt is here, if she says she can help, she can. Help!

153
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,766
If you don't need me, I'll head back now.

154
00:08:59,766 --> 00:09:00,566
Brother.

155
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,766
Don't go!

156
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,733
Why shouldn't I go?

157
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:04,566
I...

158
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:07,533
No one's at the stall, I still have to sell spicy cabbage.

159
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,133
Besides, two people are coming for fortune-telling this afternoon.

160
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,700
So I'll be going now. Hahaha.

161
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,466
Bye, brother. Heheh.

162
00:09:37,566 --> 00:09:38,933
Staying a bit longer is fine too.

163
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:39,633
Hehehe.
