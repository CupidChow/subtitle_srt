1
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,266
I'll kill you

2
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:41,033
You dare run away?

3
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,800
Stand tall, sister!

4
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,333
Get down

5
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:06,133
Where are your manners?

6
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,100
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow

7
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:12,066
Where are your manners?

8
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:12,800
Where are your manners?

9
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:14,266
Apologize, apologize, apologize

10
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry

11
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,166
I'm sorry

12
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:18,600
Hahaha

13
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:20,033
Yah, yah, yah

14
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:22,100
Yah, yah, yah

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,166
Oh, yah, yah, yah

16
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,000
You dare hit my girlfriend?

17
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:31,233
That's him! Get him!

18
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:33,666
What do you think you're doing?

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,066
You're pushing your luck

20
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:55,866
Get him! Get him!

21
00:01:58,733 --> 00:01:59,533
I'll kick your ass

22
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:02,900
You're still holding me?

23
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,433
Don't be lost

24
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:08,333
Watch your brother move forward

25
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:10,700
Little sister, come party

26
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,533
Yeah, yeah, yeah

27
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,500
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

28
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:16,700
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

29
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:48,333
That's him! Get him!

30
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:49,900
Screw you

31
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:51,366
I'll kick your ass

32
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,166
Little sister, you're finally awake?

33
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,000
You just missed something really exciting

34
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,466
Bullying women

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,933
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

36
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:28,066
Screw you

37
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,866
I'll kick your ass

38
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,000
Dad

39
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:50,533
Dad

40
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:43,100
What's wrong with you?

41
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:02,933
I told you

42
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:05,800
You're all interesting friends of mine

43
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,566
I'm all about networking

44
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,466
I've got wide connections

45
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:13,033
But for all of your issues

46
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,133
Longzhou keeps them all in mind

47
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:16,966
Like you, for instance

48
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,400
You want me to get out and tell your wife

49
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,700
To get you a new lawyer

50
00:07:21,366 --> 00:07:21,966
And like you

51
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,033
You want to get out

52
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:23,900
We'll take that slow

53
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,533
You've got three and a half years

54
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:24,933
Brother

55
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:26,800
Take care of yourself

56
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,300
And like you

57
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:30,000
You want me to go collect a debt

58
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,433
Let's get a pro for that one

59
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,166
Longzhou has many interesting friends

60
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,900
But, hey

61
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,800
Longzhou keeps everything in his heart

62
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,333
You are Longzhou's confidants

63
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,333
Real big brothers

64
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,933
Even though we haven't known each other long

65
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,033
But once we get out

66
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:50,500
We must keep working together

67
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:51,933
Don't worry

68
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,933
Working with me, Xiao Longzhou

69
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:55,700
It's always a 30-70 split

70
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:57,366
You get the big share

71
00:07:58,833 --> 00:07:59,433
You can rest assured

72
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:01,000
Longzhou

73
00:08:01,866 --> 00:08:05,833
Will always be your sincere partner

74
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:13,400
Oh, Brother Bing.

75
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,133
Man, haven't seen you in years.

76
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,333
Your business has really grown.

77
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:19,000
Want a smoke?

78
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:20,733
Look at this huge cigar.

79
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,933
Top-tier stuff.

80
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,633
I'll pass.

81
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,433
It'd be wasted on me.

82
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,733
What's up?

83
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:30,800
Well, Brother Bing...

84
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,500
My business lately...

85
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,733
Money's a bit tight.

86
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:36,033
I need some emergency cash.

87
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,833
See if you can help me out.

88
00:08:38,366 --> 00:08:39,600
As the saying goes...

89
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,433
Help in emergencies, not in poverty.

90
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,333
Brother Bing, you're a boundlessly righteous big brother.

91
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,533
You surely wouldn't refuse to help a little brother.

92
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:47,333
Right?

93
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:49,733
You kid.

94
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:52,533
Alright, since...

95
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,100
You've put it that way.

96
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,766
Man, you're lucky.

97
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,600
I have two brothers...

98
00:08:57,933 --> 00:08:59,133
Something happened a couple of days ago.

99
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,466
You came at just the right time.

100
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:02,933
Do this job for me.

101
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,933
And I'll lend you the money.

102
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,233
What job?

103
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,033
Help me hit a car.

104
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:14,600
With someone inside.

105
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,733
I can't do that.

106
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:18,500
Whoa, what are you saying?

107
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,400
Brother does legitimate business.

108
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,000
We never do anything illegal.

109
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,333
Come over for dinner tonight.

110
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:33,933
Lao Wei.

111
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,333
Here, take this.

112
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:40,466
Yuan, don't get splashed, baby.

113
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:41,566
I know, Auntie.

114
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:44,166
Sanshun.

115
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,400
Is my order ready?

116
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:47,333
Ready, ready.

117
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,300
Lao Wei, picking up the goods.

118
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:49,833
Hurry up.

119
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:50,833
Sister's here.

120
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,366
Thanks Lao Wei, take this.

121
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:55,900
Come again.

122
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,833
Lao Wei.

123
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,166
Did she pay?

124
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,233
No. She'll pay next month.

125
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,566
She didn't pay last month either.

126
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:05,333
She'll pay next month.

127
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,900
She'll pay it all together in three months.

128
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,166
It's fine, we're neighbors.

129
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,300
Why are you doing this?

130
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,200
Do you have a crush on her?

131
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,900
Don't talk nonsense.

132
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,166
How could I like her?

133
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:14,800
The kid is right here.

134
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,566
Don't, don't, don't say that.

135
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:17,766
Yuanyuan.

136
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:19,933
Don't let your dad's honest look fool you.

137
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,133
Don't listen to her, don't listen to your aunt.

138
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:22,366
Your dad isn't that kind of person.

139
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:23,366
I really don't like her.

140
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:25,033
Lao Wei.

141
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:26,900
Family.

142
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,300
Today's "Urban Legends" story ends here.

143
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:29,966
Click follow.

144
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:31,133
Tap the heart.

145
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:33,100
Tomorrow's story will be even better.

146
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,933
Bye-bye.

147
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,600
Hey, next time you make up a story...

148
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,300
Can you not always include me?

149
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,833
And even if you do include me...

150
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,366
Don't always say I'm a punk.

151
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:42,700
So what?

152
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,333
I just like punks.

153
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,200
Fine.

154
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:52,233
Your light box can't be fixed.

155
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:53,466
I'll replace it with a new one tomorrow.

156
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:56,533
Let's go.

157
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,800
Let me show you what a real punk is.
