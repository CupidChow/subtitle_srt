1
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,666
Why is your business card here?

2
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,566
Why is Xiao Longzhou's card here?

3
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,033
What?

4
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:03,666
Come back here!

5
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,433
Stop right there!

6
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,600
Go away!

7
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,566
You can really run, huh?

8
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,433
Who exactly are you?

9
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:30,833
Where is Jin Xuehua?

10
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:33,533
Speak!

11
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,666
Jin Xuehua is in danger.

12
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,700
She doesn't have much time left.

13
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,000
What exactly is going on?

14
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,200
Talk!

15
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:50,266
I took a job.

16
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,900
Someone wanted to kidnap Jin Xuehua.

17
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:55,266
I didn't dare do it myself.

18
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:56,900
So I found Lao Wei.

19
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:07,866
Lao Wei.

20
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,433
You got the wrong guy.

21
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,300
Lao Wei.

22
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:25,666
I know you can settle things for people.

23
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:28,733
Who told you that?

24
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:31,700
Don't ask so many questions.

25
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:33,666
Big job.

26
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,066
You taking it or not?

27
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,433
That chapter is closed.

28
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:40,100
I don't do that stuff anymore.

29
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,933
You've been on the streets.

30
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,066
You can't wash your hands clean.

31
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:53,900
Besides...

32
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:55,800
After you finish this gig,

33
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,200
you'll have the money for your daughter's hospital bills.

34
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:06,366
400,000.

35
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:08,233
70-30 split.

36
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:09,666
You get seven, I get three.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,900
Take it.

38
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:15,700
I can't do murder or arson.

39
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,466
Oh, come on.

40
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,533
Brother, help me out here, will you?

41
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:22,466
It's a society ruled by law.

42
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:24,000
Who goes around killing and burning these days?

43
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,433
Just snatching a person.

44
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:28,866
Don't worry.

45
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,900
I just need you to take her to a specific place.

46
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,100
That's all.

47
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:37,600
Just that is worth 400,000?

48
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,800
It's not 400,000.

49
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,733
Thirty percent of that is mine.

50
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:47,533
And hey...

51
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:50,833
If you're gonna do this job,

52
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,700
then don't ask too many questions.

53
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:59,066
I waited at the agreed spot for Lao Wei to deliver her.

54
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:00,933
But nobody showed up.

55
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:02,200
And he wouldn't answer the phone.

56
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,933
I put a tracker on Lao Wei's car.

57
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,533
And found their location.

58
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,600
It's made of plastic.

59
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,233
Where is the real one?

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,933
Xiao Longzhou.

61
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,600
Surprise, Xuehua.

62
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:29,800
Lao Wei! Lao Wei!

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,733
Is this how you do business?

64
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,700
You kidnapped the person,

65
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,666
you brought her back,

66
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:36,800
but you won't hand her over to me?

67
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,000
Is there such a rule on the streets?

68
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:40,900
You...

69
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:47,200
I'm the one who kidnapped you, Jin Xuehua.

70
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:49,966
Are you some kind of good person?

71
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:52,400
Do you have a conscience?

72
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:55,166
You deceived Lao Wei.

73
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:58,500
You said performing a ritual could wake his daughter.

74
00:04:58,633 --> 00:04:59,500
What is this?

75
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,000
What is this?

76
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,866
This is feudal superstition.

77
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:08,600
Lao Wei couldn't bring you to me, could he?

78
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,066
So I'm doing it myself.

79
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:10,866
Come here.

80
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:12,533
Come with me.

81
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:13,833
Come with me.

82
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:18,233
Jin Xuehua!

83
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:19,333
Take Yuanyuan and go, quick!

84
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,866
Jin Xuehua!

85
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,266
Jin Xuehua!

86
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:54,166
Jin Xuehua!

87
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:55,933
Jin Xuehua!

88
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,733
Jin Xuehua!

89
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,833
Xuehua!

90
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,333
Yuanyuan!

91
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,833
Jin Xuehua!

92
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:28,366
Yuanyuan!

93
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,633
Jin Xuehua!

94
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:30,833
Yuanyuan!

95
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,900
Jin Xuehua

96
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,466
After Lao Wei knocked me down

97
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,266
I couldn't find Jin Xuehua anywhere

98
00:06:58,133 --> 00:06:59,533
The client was pushing hard

99
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:02,933
And I didn't have a clue myself

100
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:07,933
I figured if Jin Xuehua ran, she must have gone home

101
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,133
You know the rest

102
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:15,900
Know my ass

103
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,033
Who is the client?

104
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,600
Why kidnap Jin Xuehua?

105
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:26,233
I don't know

106
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:33,300
A guy named Brother Feng found me

107
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,900
What are the details?

108
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:37,300
What exactly is going on?

109
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,266
I haven't got a clue

110
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:42,000
Jin Xuehua ran away

111
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:45,066
Why didn't she contact me right away?

112
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,300
I find that strange too

113
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,100
This whole thing

114
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:58,000
I tailed you thinking Jin Xuehua would contact you

115
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:01,666
I thought following you was the fastest way to find her

116
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:03,266
But

117
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,066
Jin Xuehua isn't in danger, is she?

118
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,466
Is anyone there?

119
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,100
Anyone home?

120
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,000
Can I help you?

121
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:35,400
What's wrong?

122
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,833
Can we borrow your phone?

123
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,033
My phone is dead

124
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:39,100
My house isn't far

125
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,100
You can call from my place

126
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,300
You look...

127
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,500
What happened to you?

128
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,433
She's fine, she's fine

129
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:44,300
Come, come, come

130
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:51,266
After you, after you

131
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,133
What's the matter?

132
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,533
Have some water

133
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:13,000
Thanks

134
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:13,933
No problem
