1
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:01,366
Auntie

2
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,500
Auntie

3
00:01:04,966 --> 00:01:05,766
Auntie

4
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:07,566
What's wrong with you?

5
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,166
Auntie, do you need any help?

6
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:13,933
Do you have your family's number?

7
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:14,966
I'll call your family.

8
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:16,266
Ask them to come pick you up.

9
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,200
Girl

10
00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:21,700
Your Mr. Right...

11
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:23,900
Is coming to pick you up right now.

12
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,333
He is clad in golden armor

13
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:28,333
Riding a chariot

14
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:31,033
Leading his own great beast

15
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,366
He is just like a great hero

16
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:36,233
And then he will take you...

17
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:40,133
To save the one you call most important.

18
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:43,000
Good luck, girl.

19
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:43,666
Okay

20
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,200
Thanks, Auntie.

21
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,300
You're telling my fortune here?

22
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:48,466
Gosh, you scared me.

23
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:50,133
I thought you were lost.

24
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:51,133
Oh my god.

25
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:52,500
Do you know what I do?

26
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:53,766
We're in the same business.

27
00:01:54,466 --> 00:01:55,300
Oh my

28
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:57,066
Alright Auntie, I'll give you twenty bucks.

29
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:58,300
You hurry on back home.

30
00:01:58,533 --> 00:01:59,866
Gosh, these lines...

31
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:02,233
I'm telling you, I know them better than you.

32
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:09,866
Yuanyuan

33
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:11,366
Just hold on a little longer.

34
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:12,800
Just a bit longer and it'll be fine.

35
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:31,933
Brother

36
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:34,066
We had a deal.

37
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:35,800
We don't hurt anyone.

38
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:44,000
Hey

39
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:46,900
Brother, we promise you.

40
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,700
We'll definitely get the soul summoning done for the child today.

41
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:50,700
Okay?

42
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:53,066
But...

43
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:54,133
Just in case...

44
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,800
In case we can't summon it...

45
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,300
That's not our fault.

46
00:02:58,466 --> 00:02:59,000
Right?

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,600
If even we can't summon it...

48
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,000
Then even if the Almighty gods came...

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,933
They wouldn't be able to summon it either.

50
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:04,733
Brother

51
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,500
Big Brother

52
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,600
Xuehua, say something.

53
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,533
Come on, Xuehua.

54
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:10,966
Oh my

55
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:13,000
It's so dull with Big Brother driving all alone.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,200
Chat a bit, chat a bit.

57
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,666
Big Brother

58
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:17,266
Lao Wei

59
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:20,166
My old aunt is right.

60
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:23,566
We will definitely do our best with this.

61
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:24,366
Definitely

62
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:26,733
I'm saying just in case.

63
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,566
In case I can't summon it...

64
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:31,066
Don't get agitated.

65
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:32,766
Just don't do anything rash.

66
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:33,500
Look

67
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:35,533
You need to open your heart.

68
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:37,233
Don't always overthink things.

69
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:38,566
Right, my brother?

70
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:39,666
You live a whole life...

71
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,266
Enough

72
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:50,500
I just want the child to wake up.

73
00:03:58,366 --> 00:04:00,066
And be able to say a couple of words to me.

74
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:26,666
Still not talking?

75
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,800
If you don't talk soon, you'll be cooked.

76
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:34,066
Brother Feng.

77
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:35,300
I told you.

78
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,133
I'm not lying to you.

79
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:37,533
Everything I said is the truth.

80
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:39,400
Brother Feng, Brother Feng.

81
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:41,900
I'm telling the truth.

82
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:43,433
I didn't lie to you, Brother Feng.

83
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,200
Not a single word I said is false.

84
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,700
Brother Feng, everything I said is the truth.

85
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,433
Brother Feng, you have to believe me.

86
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,333
Still taking me for a fool, huh?

87
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,066
Turn the temperature to the max.

88
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,566
Brother Feng.

89
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:00,233
Give me a little time.

90
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,833
Just give me a little time.

91
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,133
Just give me one hour.

92
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:05,033
I can find Jin Xuehua very quickly.

93
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:06,000
Brother Feng.

94
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,200
Where is this?

95
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:09,700
Who are those people outside?

96
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,066
They're the ones looking for Jin Xuehua.

97
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:16,666
Hey, you outside!

98
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:17,933
Listen to me!

99
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:19,733
If you're a man...

100
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:20,433
Untie me!

101
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:21,666
Let's go one-on-one!

102
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,033
He is Ding Dayu.

103
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,533
He is... he is Jin Xuehua's boyfriend.

104
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:28,833
Brother Feng, Brother Feng.

105
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:29,866
Listen to me.

106
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:32,133
Lao Wei is saving people. It's all real.

107
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:33,533
Brother Feng, what I'm saying is true.

108
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,400
You still take me for a fool.

109
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,200
Do I?

110
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,566
You have my phone over there, right, Brother Feng?

111
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:40,033
I... I... I...

112
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,200
I have chat logs with Lao Wei.

113
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,733
You can check my phone.

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,100
Everything written there is true.

115
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,266
It's all in there.

116
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,333
Brother Feng.

117
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,400
Did you see my phone?

118
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:51,866
I know where they are going.

119
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:53,500
She's going to the cornfield.

120
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,333
Shut up.

121
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,833
She collected magical instruments for the ritual.

122
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:58,333
She's going to the cornfield to perform a ritual.

123
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,833
Brother Feng, what I'm saying is true.

124
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,633
Believe me, believe me.

125
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:03,033
Everything I said is the truth.

126
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,033
Give me a little time.

127
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:05,733
I'll go bring Jin Xuehua back to you right now.

128
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:06,233
Brother Feng.

129
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,000
Shut up.

130
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You're not human.

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,866
Brother Feng, Brother Feng.

132
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:15,533
Is he gone?

133
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,666
We just need to open the door to get out.

134
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,600
No shit, you don't say.

135
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:31,966
Bro.

136
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,133
I used to be a workshop worker.

137
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,033
This door can be opened from the inside.

138
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:46,000
Ouch, bro.

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,433
No, no.

140
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm gonna snap in half.

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,166
I'm gonna snap in half!

142
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:53,700
Let's count one, two, three, and stand up together.

143
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,733
One, two, three.

144
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:13,300
Up, up.

145
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,233
Push up harder.
