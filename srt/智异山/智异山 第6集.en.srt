00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:55,240
No

662
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:58,970
I won't quit.

663
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:05,190
I'm going to stay here with this mountain.

664
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:31,900
It'll hurt.

665
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:33,450
Ouch!

666
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,260
I can't help with it.

667
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:39,420
Someone slammed me down,
and I don't remember anything after that.

668
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,310
What happened?

669
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:45,800
Rest for a bit. I'll bring you some water.

670
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,320
So much blood.

671
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,650
Is this all my blood?

672
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,710
It's been a while.

673
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,020
Yes.

674
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,570
I'm sorry. I didn't think
it'd get this dangerous.

675
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:16,590
On top of the weather condition,

676
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,950
the plans got changed at the last minute

677
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:29,020
I didn't know you were still here.

678
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,920
I haven't seen you once here,
so I thought you quit.

679
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,450
Did you come here often after that?

680
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,050
Yes.

681
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:41,200
You should've called me.

682
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,860
Actually,

683
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:54,510
I need to make a confession.

684
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,170
What is it?

685
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:03,290
You were right.

686
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,520
The money...

687
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,370
I stole that money.

688
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:16,020
Really? Why?

689
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:18,490
I wanted a motorcycle.

690
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:22,950
To take you to the beach.

691
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:31,680
A few months later, I returned the money

692
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:34,290
and apologized to the owner.

693
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:38,530
I was going to tell you
the last time we met,

694
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:40,040
but I couldn't.

695
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,390
I was too embarrassed.

696
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:49,200
I wanted to tell you
if we ran into each other here,

697
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:52,220
but I guess Mount Jirisan is big and wide.

698
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,620
It took this long.

699
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:03,310
I'm sorry I lied.

700
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,060
Aren't you embarrassed now?

701
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:13,470
I'm fine. Maybe because
I'm much older now.

702
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:18,130
I'll call you next time
when I come here for hiking.

703
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:22,330
My wife loves mountains too.

704
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:40,980
Bring proper shoes, clothes,
and gear next time.

705
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:43,040
Don't bug me by getting lost or something.

706
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:49,970
Okay.

707
00:59:58,580 --> 00:59:59,880
It's cold out here.

708
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:33,900
We'll ask for your help
as witnesses later.

709
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:36,380
-Thank you for everything.
-Sure.

710
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:41,120
I'll call you.

711
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,780
Hey!

712
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:58,680
So that's Yim Cheol-gyeong?

713
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:02,590
Right?

714
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:04,980
Right?

715
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:08,420
Gosh, you.

716
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:10,860
I'm hurt.

717
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,550
Are you all right?

718
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:15,310
Yang-sun! What are you doing here?

719
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,500
Are you all right? I heard you got hurt.

720
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:20,770
Well, I'm not badly hurt or anything.

721
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,170
But...

722
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:28,670
That can't be true

723
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,940
-Are you here because of me?
-Yes, I was worried.

724
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,060
You didn't even show up yesterday.

725
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:40,050
What? What do you mean I didn't show up?
I did.

726
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,910
Were you there?

727
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:48,790
[You wanted to meet outside the theater,
but you didn't come.]

728
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:55,250
[December 24th, 4:02 p.m]

729
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:03,690
[Jeong Gu-yeong]

730
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:17,550
[I was wondering what happened to you.]

731
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,530
I waited at the ticket box.

732
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,720
You said outside the theater.

733
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:32,340
Why didn't you call each other?

734
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:34,770
I didn't want to pressure her.

735
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:37,800
Me too. I thought
you've got something else.

736
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,870
So you came.

737
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,640
It was freezing yesterday. Are you okay?
Didn't you catch a cold?

738
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:50,100
I'm fine. What about your wound?

739
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:52,670
It's only a scratch.

740
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,520
Did you run?

741
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:07,870
Yes

742
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:13,960
They're so frustrating.

743
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,150
Let's leave them alone.

744
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,530
How pathetic is this?

745
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:17,520
Everyone else is enjoying Christmas.
But what are we doing here?

746
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:20,420
This is why I really hate Christmas.

747
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,680
Did you really like

748
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:28,690
Cheol-gyeong that much?

749
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:31,680
So much that you couldn't
leave the mountain?

750
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:34,280
What on earth are you talking about?

751
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,970
-I think it's true.
-It's not.

752
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:38,440
Then what?

753
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:40,960
Why do you keep saying you hate mountains

754
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,480
but stuck around here for years as a ranger?

755
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:48,140
I don't know why I'm doing this.

756
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,860
Gosh, my life.

757
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:52,260
That's sweet potato makgeolli.

758
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:14,890
You want to know why

759
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,750
I became a ranger?

760
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,070
I was six

761
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:31,940
when I first climbed the mountain.

762
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:44,670
This way.

763
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:46,600
-All right.
-Put her down here.

764
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:49,750
Oh, dear.

765
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:53,200
-What's happening here? Gosh.
-Goodness.

766
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:55,210
What will we do with her?

767
01:06:55,300 --> 01:07:00,210
-So much hard work for you.
-I'm fine.

768
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:04,370
That was so much work.

769
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:06,130
Not at all. I should get going now.

770
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:08,610
Oh, you came all the way here.

771
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:10,540
Have some honey tea before you go.

772
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:12,350
It's really all right.

773
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:14,990
Well, this isn't the first time.

774
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:19,240
It can't be easy carrying
this darn tall girl.

775
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:21,970
I'll get you some tea. It'll be a second.

776
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:23,180
Okay.

777
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:45,490
[I reached Cheonwangbong Peak
for the first time at seven.]

778
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:48,800
[By eight, I was able to go up alone.]

779
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:53,550
[I brought a Coke and drank it there.
It tasted like heaven.]

780
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:59,010
[And when I was nine
I started to walk along the ridges.]

781
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:01,360
[You've never seen stars up there, right?]

782
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:04,300
[It's awesome.]

783
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:07,370
She couldn't leave because
she loves mountains.

784
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:29,750
[Wildfire]

785
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:27,330
[Jirisan]

786
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:30,740
[A wildfire has broken out
on Mount Jirisan.]

787
01:09:31,029 --> 01:09:33,800
[You said you saw
a wildfire suppression banner?]

788
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:36,529
[I need to find out where it happened.]

789
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,550
[It can get to the village.]

790
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:42,120
[If we find out where that is,
we may know where the fire started.]

791
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,290
Where is that thing?

792
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:45,060
[Are you saying Yi-gang is still there?]

793
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:47,910
[I don't know who that is.
But he's trying to get me.]

794
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,260
[Something happened?]

795
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,109
[Yi-gang, it's me.]

796
01:09:51,189 --> 01:09:54,630
[I know it's hard,
but you should get mentally prepared.]
