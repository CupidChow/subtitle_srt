[the murderer will be here.]

512
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:42,100
So what's the evidence you can use
to prove who the murderer is?

513
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,140
I don't know yet.

514
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,280
But it'll be here somewhere for sure.

515

Here?

516
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,660
Is there really evidence here?

517
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,940
You two have been
suspicious from the beginning.

518
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,920
You're hiding something from me, right?

519
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:12,000
I also want to ask

520
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,900
what Yi-gang asked you earlier.

00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,070
What?

522
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,760
The day Da-won died.

523
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:21,490
Why were you on the mountain?

524

-Something came up.
-Okay.

525
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,900
So what was that something?

526
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,240
I went to see Yang-sun.

527
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:22,570
You told me to remember things.

528

Even if everyone forgets,

529
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:30,720
