Aren't you cold?

181
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,970
Here, put on your shoes.

182
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,450
Gosh, what beautiful shoes!

183
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,550
Where's your mommy?

184
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,360
You should do your homework
instead of coming here.

185

All right?

186

194
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,350

195

You know what happens
if you don't pay it right away.

201
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,050
There's a late charge.
You'd better pay it in time.

202
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,640
Are you all right?

203

You're destined to roam the mountains
even when you're dead.

205
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,100

What's that?

207
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,520
I've never seen this kind of
talisman before.

208
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,450
I should take it and do some research.

209
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,860
People like these must come here often.

210
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,920
You know the expression in Korean,
"go to a valley,"

211
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,520
which means "to die?"

212
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,660
"Gone to a valley."

213
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,990
It originated from here, since no one
walks out of Baektogol Valley alive.

for a period of time.

with a cross or stone pagoda.

No. If Grandma gets in,

You mean he was the top in his year?

248
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,500
That's right.

249
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,310
Mount Jirisan is so wide and rough,
so everyone avoids coming here.

250
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,500
But they were shocked that
the top volunteered to come.

251
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,720
Wow. He's the opposite of Yi-gang.

331
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,820
What's going on?

332
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,930
Sure, we'll check.

333
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,280
Okay.

334
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,220
What is it?

335
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,780
Granny Geum-rye
is up on the mountain again.

336
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,960
And she's not back yet.
She's not picking up her phone, either.

337
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,360
Are they sure she went up the mountain?

338
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,170
Her rucksack and equipment are gone too.

339
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,950
But she never gets lost in the mountain.

340
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,150
Who is this Granny Geum-rye?

341
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,720
She lost her mother in Baektogol
when she was young.

342
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,210
So she goes up several times a year
to commemorate her mother.

343
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,600
She's notorious among
rangers for illegal hiking.

344
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,730
Baektogol...

345
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,480
It's right here.

346
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,270
Are these real bullet holes?

347
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,420
Yes. There was a civilian massacre here
long ago.

348
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,690
So we call it the Bullet Tree.

349
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,840
Jung Gu-yeong.

350
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,900
Any news on Granny Geum-rye?

351
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,750
[No, not yet.]

352
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,100
[Her family's looking everywhere.]

353
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,610
[-Did you arrive?]
-Yes.

354
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:35,840
We know she came for sure,
but something's amiss.

355
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,570
She always took
every last thing she brought.

356
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,020
But today, she left everything.

357
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,210
We'll search this area.

358
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,720
Check the security camera.

359
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,360
[There's no camera on restricted trails.]

360
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:02,470
There's one on the road by the entrance.

361
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,990
Ask the police for cooperation.

362
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,200
What are you doing?

363
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,140
There's signal here.

364
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,130
If she's near, we'll hear her phone.

365
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,730
It might be on vibrate mode.

366
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,240
Let's split and search some more.

367
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,840
You take the side road.

368
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,150
Wait.

369
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,330
Baektogol, stone pagoda ground.

370
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,140
Can we search there?

371
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,450
Why?

372
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,590
Are you seeing things again?

373
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:44,890
What did you see?

374
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,200
You never believed
in the Seven Wonders of the World, right?

375
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:56,570
Just because you don't get them
doesn't mean they're lies.

376
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:00,430
The pyramids, Moai,
the Bermuda Triangle...

377
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,780
These things all exist.

378
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,430
What on earth are you saying?

379
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,380
Never mind.

380
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:13,070
If you don't trust me, I'll go alone.

381
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,210
Hey!

382
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,060
What?

383
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,370
Wrong way.

384
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,260
Follow me.

385
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,000
I found nothing.

386
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,180
You?

387
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,590
I saw it for sure. It was right here.

388
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,340
I shouldn't have trusted you.

389
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,520
I'm serious. It was here.

390
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,740
Whatever.

391
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,530
Are you the national park staff?

392
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,590
Yes, we're from Haedong Ranger Station.

393
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,690
We were informed about your march.

394
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,950
Captain Kang?

395
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,700
Is that you?

396
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,930
It's been a while.

397
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,760
Is Granny back yet?

398
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,700
[Not yet.]

399
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,010
[She didn't go
to a friend's house either.]

400
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,040
Have you checked the security camera?

401
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:50,360
[I've checked all
near the entrance to Baektogol.]

402
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,750
[But she's not on them.]

403
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,270
[I think she's still on the mountain.]

404
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,410
I heard that you were discharged,

405
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,850
but I didn't expect to see you here.

406
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,600
Was it because of what happened?

407
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,030
It was here, right?

408
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:20,179
Where Sergeant Kim was found.

409
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,239
How's the march going?

410
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,139
No accident?

411
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,050
It's just training.

412
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,150
It'll be over tomorrow.

413
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:37,730
Are you on patrol this late at night?

414
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,100
We're just checking something.

415
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:46,469
Have you met an old lady during the march?

416
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,199
No, I haven't seen any civilian.

417
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,670
What's wrong?

418
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,980
An old lady went missing.

419
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,580
Any small thing you noticed?

420
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,940
She seems to have crossed your way.

421
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,200
Sir.

422
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,510
What is it?

423
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,540
When I fell behind earlier...

424
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,950
Oh, this is Private Ahn.

425
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,640
He lost his water bottle
at Baektogol ridge three hours ago,

426
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:17,130
and he went AWOL and fell behind.

427
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,060
So?

428
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,830
What happened then?

429
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,740
You saw a civilian?

430
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,100
Yes, sir. He said he came for hiking.

431
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,950
He was looking at a rucksack,

432
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:49,300
and he said he was wondering whose it was.

433
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,360
What color was the rucksack?

434
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,120
It was pink.

435
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,520
Was this it?

436
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,170
Yes. That's the one.

437
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,320
Where was this?

438
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:09,540
It was the 50-minute point from Baeksil.

439
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,230
Right here.

440
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,540
If we take the shortcut,
we could get there in an hour.

441
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,680
Let's go.

442
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,150
Get back safely.

443
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,990
Over there.

444
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,600
Is it hers?

445
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,500
Common Rustgill.

446
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,220
It's extremely poisonous, so why...

447
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,560
What happens if you eat them?

448
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:50,130
You get dizzy, nauseous,
stomachache, and hallucinations.

449
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,320
You might die if you consume a lot.

450
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,140
We must find her now.

451
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,500
[Mun-ok's Granddaughter Yi-gang]

452
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,250
No answer?

453
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,120
Wait.

454
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,320
[Mun-ok's Granddaughter Yi-gang]

455
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:25,040
No vital signs!

456
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:39,970
Yi-gang.

457
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,710
Please radio them.

458
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,680
Yi-gang.

459
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,050
Yi-gang?

460
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,320
Yi-gang!

461
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,700
Sit down.

462
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,840
No... I'm all right.

463
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:18,990
Please sit.

464
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,210
Can you do that?

465
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:35,490
Breathe deep. Slowly.

466
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,800
One more time.

467
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:14,590
This is Hyun-jo speaking.

468
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,240
[What happened?]

469
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:18,920
[Did you find Granny Geum-rye?]

470
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,850
[She still hasn't called home.]

471
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,640
We found her.

472
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:29,080
[You did? How is she?]

473
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,570
No vital signs.

474
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,800
She's presumed dead.

475
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:43,240
[Her location?]

476
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:53,020
Baektogol, Hyeongje Rock, 30m northwest.

477
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:59,490
It's 30m northwest
of Hyeongje Rock in Baektogol.

478
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:03,190
[I'll let Bidam Shelter know.]

479
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,950
[It'll be a couple of hours.]

480
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,270
This is the second time.

481
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,650
That I'm seeing a dead person
on Mount Jirisan.

482
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:27,970
Back there

483
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:34,010
at the stone pagoda ground,
I've had to let a sergeant die before.

484
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,000
I valued him more than anyone else.

485
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,000
But he died alone and lonely

486
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:46,230
on the mountain because of me.

487
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:53,370
If we keep this pace,
we'll set a new record.

488
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,850
Carry on, soldiers! Speed up a little.

489
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,320
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

490
00:45:58,710 --> 00:45:59,970
That's the spirit.

491
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,230
Kim Hyeon-su, you all right?

492
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:08,910
Yes, sir!

493
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:11,390
This is your hometown, right?

494
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,740
That's right, sir!

495
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,500
Must be nice.

496
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:17,150
I hope your hometown energizes you.

497
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,410

but he wasn't feeling well.

He said he'd go throw up,

544
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:12,430
so I thought he'd be
back and asleep, but...

01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,820
[What I saw was the past, of a year ago.]

665
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:28,630
[Someone murdered my colleague.]

666
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:34,840
[And that person is]

667
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:39,380
[still on this mountain.]

668
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:47,990
[Killing people]

669
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:50,090
[on this mountain]

670
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,320
[to this day.]

671
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:53,050
[Jirisan]

672
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:54,600
[I saw a hand.]

673
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:56,950
[There were five scratch scars.]

674
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,460
[We only need to find him.]

675
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:00,100
[He's got to be our culprit.]

676
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:02,200
[You have to look elsewhere,
not the mountain.]

677
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:05,020
[Haedong One, 3km from
Saemagol. An explosion noise!]

678
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:06,440
[Check for an SOS!]

679
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:09,130
It means a civilian died
because of a park ranger's mistake.

680
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,440
[Someone else was on that mountain.]

681
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:14,170
I will find that person,
no matter what it takes.

682
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:16,230
[There's something I need to tell.]

683
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:17,150
[A ranger?]

684
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,080
It's him.

685
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,170
What do you mean?

686
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:20,220
It's him!
