Well...

332

Let's just say
I had a tough training session.

333

-Goodness...
-That hurts.

So I told you not to carry him.
You brought this onto yourself.

336
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,890
That hurts!

337
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,610

Isn't there any other team?

- What? About mobilizing?

-Yes.

-Not much, but...

371
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,200
-I want to pee.
-You want to pee?

372
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,080
-Oh, I'm worn out.
-We're almost there.

373
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,100
-You good?
-Yes.

374
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,110
Not many people know about this place.

375
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,710
It's slippery here.

376
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,320
Isn't this great?

377

The view's breathtaking.

378
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,050
If you come up here in the evening,

379
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:43,320
the sun's right over there.

380
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:47,260
And the moon from that side,
hung on the horizon.

381
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,980
It's beautiful.

coming all the way up to the ridge.

385
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:07,800
I feel like a real ranger now.

386

I can't climb the mountain,

389
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:19,310
