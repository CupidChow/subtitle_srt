[Year 2019]

334
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,960
So what are those?

335
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,070
People say they see ghost lights

336
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:49,760
on dark and foggy nights
like this on the mountain.

337
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,840
Is that really a ghost light?

338
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,640
Of course not.

339
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,890
Don't you remember this smell?

340
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,670
What's this smell?

341
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:13,030
Dog odor combined with ammonia.

342
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,710
A bear.

343
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,640
A bear? That?

344
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:23,740
I heard wild animals' eyes
look like that when reflected in the light.

345
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:27,060
That's impossible.
I heard moon bears hate people.

346
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,680
Also, they aren't aggressive,
as long as we don't attack them first.

347
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,110
I've never seen anything like this before.

348
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,470
Even if they aren't aggressive,
bears are the wildest of wild beasts.

349
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,410
They're over 2 meters tall
and weigh over 100kg.

350
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:43,440
I don't know why they're so provoked,

351
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,620
but I'm sure it's more dangerous
than a ghost light.

352
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,650
-Pass me your walkie.
-Yes.

353
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:59,190
The battery's dead.

354
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,870
No signal.

355
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,220
We're trapped.

356
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,540
Mayor!

357
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,040
Cable cars or whatever...

358
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,090
I'm not leaving.

359
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,780
We're not here because of the cable cars.

360
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,810
Most of the villagers have left.

361
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,700
The park decided
to demolish the village, too.

362
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,900
-Why don't you move to--
-I'm not leaving!

363
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,160
How have you been?

364
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,370
Did you eat?

365
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,620
Dad keeps saying he sees things.

366
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,170
What do you mean?

367
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,150
He says he sees ghost lights.

368
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,920
There's no such thing.

369
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,810
-He saw wrong.
-No! There is.

370
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,240
I saw it, too.

371
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,110
Let's call it a day.

372
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,560
Yes, sir.

373
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,820
This way.

374
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:52,430
Why are you trying to meet him?

375
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,370
Are you charging him a fine?

376
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,350
-How's his condition?
-They say he's calmed down a lot.

377
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,730
That's the one.

378
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:13,770
Hello?

379
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,580
[So, on my way from Deokseoryeong
to Black Bridge Valley,]

380
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,730
[-there was some woman.]
-Excuse me?

381
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,570
Anyway, I called.

382
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,070
What did you say?

383
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,720
What?

384
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,450
Someone was at Deokseoryeong?

385
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,190
No, well... It was her fault.

386
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,960
Why did she go up there
when she clearly couldn't make it?

387
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,950
Don't tell me you left
a lost person there.

388
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:45,520
Could you let the rangers know
that I'm here?

389
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,780
Gosh, lady.

390
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,310
You want me to take myself in
for illegal hiking?

391
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:54,090
I'll make a report on my way down,
once I'm done with my business.

392
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,420
Where was it?

393
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,550
Well, I... I was busy, too.

394
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,639
Where was it?

395
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,610
When will they leave?

396
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,949
How would I know?

397
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,060
I'm sorry.

398
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,920
But...

399
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,310
I didn't expect such a place
in the mountains.

400
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,340
It must have been a secret hideout
for "Partisans."

401
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,820
What? There's a pole.

402
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:47,300
It must belong to illegal hikers.

403
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:49,949
There's more stuff, like crampons.

404
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,490
-Oh my gosh!
-Gosh.

405
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,920
-Yi-gang...
-What's up with you?

406
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,430
There's someone here.

407
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,300
Her breathing is too weak.
She has serious hypothermia.

408
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,100
We must hurry up
and get her to a hospital.

409
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,020
Will you be okay?

410
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:31,110
Do I have a choice?

411
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,730
There's been a missing report.

412
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,300
Please gather at the restricted trail
entrance in Deokseoryeong.

413
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,300
I called each shelter
and the rangers on their day off.

414
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,860
Any news from Yi-gang and Hyun-jo?

415
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,040
No.

416
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,310
But...

417
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,210
Those two aren't the only ones up there.

418
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,670
Yi-gang, We're back again.

419
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,150
You all right?

420
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,520
What's that?

421
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,660
Gosh.

422
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,600
-What happened? We couldn't reach you.
-Hey.

423
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,610
Who's that?

424
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,740
-And what's that?
-Carry her.

425
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,300
Quick!

426
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,060
-There.
-Hurry up!

427
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,660
What is that?

428
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,840
Hurry up!

429
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
In here.

430
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,380
Watch your step.

431
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,480
On two.

432
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,430
What happened?

433
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,740
-She's in a bad state.
-I know.

434
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,890
That's why we were trying so hard
to get down, but can't find the way out.

435
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,440
Same here.

436
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,730
We kept going around in one direction
since the foggy area.

437
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:50,580
We could only come
because of your flashlights.

438
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,520
-What's that thing?
-Bears.

439
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,290
-What?
-What?

440
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:58,400
No way. Hold on.

441
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,230
Then are we trapped?

442
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,420
Hang on. There must be a way.

443
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,680
A way? What way?

444
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,410
You got lost in here, too.

445
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,600
-Calm yourself down.
-Don't tell me to calm down.

446
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,290
Why did you come up here
in the first place and get us into this?

447
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,800
Did I tell you to come?

448
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,480
-Go back down then.
-Hey.

449
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,630
-Stop it, both of you.
-Stop what?

450
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,730
The promotion test is
only a few days away,

451
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:27,920
and I'm wasting my precious time here.

452
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,410
You took a day off just for that?
When everyone else is busy?

453
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:34,850
Just for that?
This is very important for me.

454
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,540
I'm meeting Yang-sun's mother soon.

455
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:43,000
I should at least have a team leader title
because I've got nothing else!

456
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,600
Hey.

457
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:47,490
Now's not the time for that.

458
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,590
Team leader is only a title.

459
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,070
Shut up. You're already a team leader.

460
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,470
Hey! Do you think
it's all fun and games for me?

461
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,360
I haven't gotten a single day of rest
since I got promoted.

462
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,410
And now...

463
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,540
I can't use my legs.

464
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,600
I might not be able to walk

465
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,870
if I keep climbing the mountain.

466
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,870
Her condition has gotten worse.

467
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,890
I don't think she can last long.

468
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,920
[Park Il-hae. Can you hear me?]

469
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,360
[-Did you get to Black Bridge Valley?]
-Yes, sir.

470
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,790
We met Yi-gang and Hyun-jo.

471
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,980
[We got a call about a missing person]

472
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,920
[between Deokseoryeong
and Black Bridge Valley.]

473
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,280
You mean the woman in a red jacket?

474
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,620
You found her?

475
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,590
How is she?

476
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,950
Not good. We must take her
to the hospital immediately.

477
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,980
Our situation's not that great.
We can't find our way out.

478
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,200
It's hard to secure a clear view
because of the fog,

479
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,140
and the GPS is no use.

480
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:02,420
Plus, moon bears aren't leaving our side
for some reason.

481
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,120
[Yi-gang and Hyun-jo tried to carry
the victim down, but they failed.]

482
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,440
Let me talk to Yi-gang.

483
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,630
This is Yi-gang speaking.

484
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,900
[Take the lead and find the way.]

485
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,920
[You're the fastest,
and you know the mountain best.]

486
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,600
I'm not confident.

487
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,590
I keep getting lost.

488
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,870
[I almost got lost there too once.]

489
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,230
[And a missing person ended up dying
because of me.]

490
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:42,230
[I pondered and found out why.]

491
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:46,220
It was because I was tracing
the animal path, not the human one.

492
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:50,050
I'll take her. You just hurt your knees.

493
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:54,290

[Since when have you known about this?]

658
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,250
[We weren't the only ones
on the mountain that day.]

659
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:45,180
Jeong Gu-yeong?

660
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,110
[Why did you go to the mountain that day?]

661
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,870
It's too risky for you.

662
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:50,430
[There is a way.]

663
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:52,190
Why are they together?

664
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,590
[How can we? We don't know who it was.]

665
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:56,810
[Hyun-jo knew about the murderer.]
