1
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,400
Here.

2
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,439
Where do you think you're going?

3
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,159
Dare to ruin my plans, huh?

4
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,680
Go to hell!

5
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,239
You want to catch me? No way!

6
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,079
Not good.

7
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,959
Burning this much Ancestral Hemp releases deadly poison.

8
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:28,439
Go, let's get out first.

9
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,079
Go!

10
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,159
That was really close.

11
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:43,319
Yuniang has escaped.

12
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,799
How will we explain this to the City Lord?

13
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,159
The Eldest Young Master's faction

14
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,480
has been waiting for a chance to harm you.

15
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,879
Don't be afraid.

16
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,680
I'll get the best doctor for you.

17
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:52,920
You'll surely recover.

18
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,840
I'm afraid I won't make it.

19
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:57,879
Hunchback.

20
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,280
You're an important witness.

21
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,680
You must stay alive.

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,120
To prove our Young Master's innocence.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,799
Zhusheng, life comes first.

24
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,359
Hunchback.

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,840
Have you ever seen the real owner of this inn?

26
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,319
The owner is very mysterious.

27
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,759
We low-ranking attendants

28
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,120
have never seen him.

29
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,400
But I've heard

30
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,319
on the first and fifteenth

31
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,280
he always comes to check the accounts and collect money.

32
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,000
Only

33
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,800
Awu can actually meet him.

34
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,759
Master's Wife, do you remember anything?

35
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,800
She's been drugged for a long time.

36
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,599
Her meridians are sealed.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,680
It'll be hard for her to regain consciousness soon.

38
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,919
I fear I'll die here today.

39
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,960
I'm neither human nor ghost now.

40
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,680
Living has no meaning.

41
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,159
But dying won't be in vain.

42
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,400
Second Young Master.

43
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:00,199
You must find the mastermind behind all this.

44
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,240
Avenge us.

45
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,560
Too rude.

46
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,400
That Second Young Master and his people are really too rough.

47
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,439
What's the point of trying so hard?

48
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,319
In the end, it's all for nothing.

49
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,639
Eldest Young Master.

50
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,000
You are our future true emperor.

51
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,800
Even Heaven is on your side.

52
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,120
Of course.

53
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,039
Who's the cook today?

54
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,439
Why didn't you clean the meat thoroughly for me?

55
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,039
Royal Father is the most frugal.

56
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,960
As the eldest son,

57
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,759
I must set an example.

58
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,800
Diligence and thrift are the way.

59
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,479
You—

60
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,319
Aren't you putting me in a bad position?

61
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,800
Can't even handle such a small task.

62
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,919
Useless to keep you.

63
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,039
Yes, Young Master.

64
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,439
Rest assured, Young Master.

65
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,039
Yuniang burned the inn thoroughly.

66
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,599
They'll never find this place.

67
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,879
Wasn't Minister Hu

68
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,120
killed not far from the inn?

69
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,399
I suppose

70
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,120
they used this as an excuse

71
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,000
to give the Second Young Master a chance.

72
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,279
Eldest Young Master, you're wise.

73
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,959
Two sorcerers suddenly came to the inn today.

74
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,160
They must be with the Second Young Master.

75
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,399
They worked together inside and out.

76
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,600
They destroyed our secret room.

77
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,199
It was definitely premeditated.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,480
Yuniang barely escaped with her life.

79
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,480
That Dongqing

80
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,519
Why is he mixed up with the Second Young Master too?

81
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,079
So, Young Master,

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,160
what should we do now?

83
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,240
It must be truly cleaned up.

84
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
Thoroughly cleaned.

85
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,600
Alright.

86
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,439
Alright.

87
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:21,560
Royal Father

88
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,160
The name of Hu Shangshu

89
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,759
also appears in the ledger

90
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,000
He must be a regular at this inn

91
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,959
Although the cause of death is still unclear

92
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,319
it is definitely connected to the inn

93
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,839
The person behind this has sinister intentions

94
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,600
On one hand

95
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,680
they use the Beast-Creation Art to amass wealth

96
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,240
On the other hand

97
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,720
they also create those fake humans

98
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,240
deliberately sabotaging the Fire Worship Festival

99
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,519
You mean

100
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,399
the disaster at this Fire Worship Festival

101
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,000
was caused by human hands

102
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,680
That's right

103
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,600
On the day of the Fire Worship Festival

104
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,560
we found on those fake corrupted bodies

105
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,839
this as well

106
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:00,959
Ancestral Hemp

107
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,680
This is the substance that destroys people

108
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,920
Ancestral Hemp is extremely potent

109
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,959
It is strictly forbidden to cultivate it in Xuan City

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,240
Even inhaling a little after burning

111
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,639
will seize one's mind

112
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,319
Any other use must be reported through proper channels

113
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,399
Only with Royal Father's approval can it enter the city

114
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,199
Buying or using it privately is a serious crime

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,519
And this herb is extremely expensive

116
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,800
Just one qian

117
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,279
costs five taels of silver

118
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,519
All these herbs in the room

119
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,839
Whoever has the courage and ability

120
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,120
to do such things

121
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,959
must have an unusual status

122
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,360
No matter who it is

123
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:46,920
I will show no mercy

124
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,279
Master's Wife, you are truly impressive

125
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,439
Even with ten silver needles sealing your acupoints

126
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,680
you still have such skills

127
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,079
You really are tough

128
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,480
Senior Brother

129
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,879
Did she remember something?

130
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,879
What is it?

131
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,560
The matter between your master and me

132
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,399
You don't support it either?

133
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,439
We support it

134
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,800
Of course we do

135
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,439
You and my master

136
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,000
are a perfect match

137
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,399
born to be together

138
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,319
Yes, yes

139
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:21,879
Yes

140
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,279
Tell us about the two of you

141
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,800
I want to hear it

142
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,399
Well

143
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,959
Master's Wife, to be honest

144
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,000
You and my master are elders

145
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,560
As juniors

146
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,279
it's not proper for us to ask

147
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,680
But then again

148
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,360
once we find Master

149
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,360
he can tell you in person

150
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,680
and everything will be clear

151
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,680
Yes, yes

152
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,279
The medicine is here

153
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,879
Master's Wife, it's time for your medicine

154
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,639
Master Bukku is really something

155
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,720
He is famous in the martial world

156
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,920
and won the beauty's heart

157
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,800
It's truly enviable

158
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,439
You, young Master's Wife

159
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,680
have quite a bold taste

160
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,519
Watch your words

161
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,360
My Master's Wife is beautiful and kind

162
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,839
just a bit short-tempered

163
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,639
Don't provoke her

164
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,399
Yes, yes

165
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,279
I won't, I won't

166
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:27,959
I won't

167
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,840
She hasn't yet

168
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,519
fully regained her memory

169
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,639
Baihui and Fengfu

170
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,200
The silver needles in those two acupoints controlling her mind

171
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,559
haven't been removed yet

172
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,759
The legendary poison master Feng Wuzhou

173
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,519
How did she end up like this?

174
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,840
We'll have to wait until she's stable

175
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,159
to find out

176
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,399
Did you see clearly?

177
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,639
Yes, it's her

178
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,840
But she seems to have lost her memory

179
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,519
What should we do next?

180
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:07,919
Wait and see

181
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,200
Royal Father actually claimed illness to keep me out.

182
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,120
Could it be...

183
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,879
Be careful, Eldest Prince.

184
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,559
My zhiyuan.

185
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,879
You damned slave, move aside!

186
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,799
Move aside!

187
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,559
Big brother...

188
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:42,799
Yue'er...

189
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,080
You're so reckless these days.

190
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,399
Royal Father should've

191
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,799
married you off to anyone by now.

192
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,159
So you wouldn't be an eyesore like your lowly birth mother.

193
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,279
You're such an eyesore.

194
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,120
Yue'er.

195
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,519
You like this zhiyuan?

196
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:00,919
I do.

197
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,320
I'll make you like it, make you like it!

198
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,679
Like it! Like it!

199
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,759
Like it! Like it!

200
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:10,799
You jinx.

201
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,039
Even if you fly to the sky,

202
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:12,960
when you fall,

203
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,600
you'll shatter into pieces.

204
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:15,679
Like it.

205
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,960
Like it! Like it!

206
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:17,879
I'll make you like it.

207
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,399
You're the princess of Xuan City.

208
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,279
If you truly like zhiyuan,

209
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,080
just tell your father.

210
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,960
All the kites in the city would be yours.

211
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:30,919
If anyone

212
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,919
tries to bully you with a kite,

213
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,600
they'll have to ask

214
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,279
if my walking cane agrees first.

215
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:43,799
Second Young Master...

216
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,879
I was just joking.

217
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,120
Why so serious?

218
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,519
Right, Yue'er?

219
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,399
Fine.

220
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,639
I'll stab you to death!

221
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:13,039
You're just a mutt born of a woman from Mo City.

222
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,480
No matter how brave you are in battle,

223
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,399
even if you defeated Yao City,

224
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,799
what use are your achievements?

225
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,279
You're a cripple, yet still so arrogant.

226
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,679
Hit me! Fight back!

227
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,080
If you dare, fight back! Fight back!

228
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:25,759
Fight back!

229
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:26,440
Eldest Young Master.

230
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:28,200
What is it?

231
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:29,519
Eldest Young Master.

232
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,120
The beast-creations we've cultivated

233
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,480
their bodies have started to rot.

234
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,240
There's barely any life left in them.

235
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,200
They won't last much longer.

236
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,399
The Ancestral Hemp in the inn has been burned.

237
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,279
There's not much left in the manor either.

238
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,399
If we keep trading with Yao City now,

239
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,320
I'm afraid the Second Young Master

240
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,159
will soon trace it back to us.

241
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,360
Second Young Master...

242
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,519
I know he looks down on me.

243
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,320
They all look down on me.

244
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,519
A cripple with a mysterious background.

245
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,159
Why should anyone respect me?

246
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,919
I'm the eldest legitimate son.

247
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:12,879
My mother and my sister

248
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,000
are of the highest status.

249
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,720
No one can compare to me.

250
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,480
Fine.

251
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,200
Investigate.

252
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,799
Since you're so eager to die,

253
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,080
I'll grant your wish.

254
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:33,720
Bring it here.

255
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,360
Since you resemble my sister

256
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,919
at least a little,

257
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,320
I'll be sure to sew you a complete face.

258
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,039
If my sister were here,

259
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,759
she would understand me and protect me.

260
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,799
This is my sister's favorite red.

261
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,559
If you wear it,

262
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,200
it will surely help make my wishes come true.
