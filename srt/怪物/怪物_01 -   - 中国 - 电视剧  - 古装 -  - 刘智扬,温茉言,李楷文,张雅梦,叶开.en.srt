1
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,159
You

2
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,599
Who are you, really?

3
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,879
Brother

4
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,959
I heard things have been dangerous around Qinning Mountain lately.

5
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,319
Let's take a break.

6
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,360
Then leave as soon as we can.

7
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,919
We better not run into those monsters.

8
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,080
Bah, what bad luck.

9
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,080
I've traveled all over for years.

10
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,879
Never heard of anything like Rotten Ones.

11
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,000
Those monsters are so rotten,

12
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,159
yet they can still attack people.

13
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,639
Don't say that at night.

14
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,400
Or they'll come for you.

15
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,639
It's not that creepy.

16
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,479
Th-this...

17
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,439
Miss, slow down when you eat.

18
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,400
Don't choke.

19
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,840
Yeah, miss.

20
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,639
People can scare others to death.

21
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Especially looking like you do.

22
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,240
Sir, I didn't mean to.

23
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,400
I was just too hungry.

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,599
We've got plenty of food.

25
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,599
We can give it all to you.

26
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,400
But you have to do as we say.

27
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,039
Let us brothers take good care of you.

28
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,919
Miss

29
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,759
Why are you running?

30
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,439
Let us brothers take good care of you.

31
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,960
There's no one around for miles.

32
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,400
That's right.

33
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,080
It's just the two of us left.

34
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,120
Hurry, chase her!

35
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,039
Brother

36
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,840
We should get out of here.

37
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,840
This place gives me the creeps.

38
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:56,800
No way.

39
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,840
I haven't had any fun in half a year.

40
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,919
I'm not letting this chance slip away.

41
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,879
You ate my food,

42
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,680
so now you belong to me.

43
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:19,720
That's right.

44
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,800
Let's see where you run now.

45
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,759
And then?

46
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,879
I heard those two

47
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,040
were bitten to death.

48
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,560
They say the Rotten Ones

49
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,439
start rotting from the belly.

50
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,240
When they're dressed,

51
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,639
you can't tell just by their faces.

52
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,079
Who knows,

53
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,759
they might be hiding among us.

54
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,720
It's just that we

55
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,959
haven't noticed.

56
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,399
Sorry to intrude.

57
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,279
Who are you?

58
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,560
And who are you?

59
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:30,519
We are...

60
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,759
We're outsiders.

61
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,360
May I ask,

62
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,160
why are you all up so late?

63
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,959
Gathered here like this?

64
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,160
What's the occasion?

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,680
An occasion?

66
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,759
This is a major event.

67
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,240
It's Xuancheng's Fire Sacrifice Festival, held every three years.

68
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,199
We parade the gods and hold rituals.

69
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,120
Praying to the Fire God for peace all year.

70
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,160
And a bountiful harvest.

71
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,240
Senior brother

72
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,279
You really owe me a thank you.

73
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm the top fighter of Yun Yin.

74
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,160
If I hadn't arrived in time,

75
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,839
and dug you out of that pit,

76
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,519
you wouldn't be seeing this now.

77
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,920
Thanks, I'll treat you to buns later.

78
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,120
Thank you, senior brother.

79
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,000
Master is so unfair.

80
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,639
Didn't even bring us to such a fun place.

81
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,680
If you ask me,

82
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,319
Master just doesn't want to leave.

83
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,839
Here they come!

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,040
The Chosen One to light the fire today

85
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,839
is the Crown Prince, Nan Zhengqi.

86
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,560
He's Xuancheng's most favored son.

87
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,959
Who's that sickly one beside him?

88
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,319
He was injured fighting Mocheng.

89
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,600
That's the Second Prince, wounded in the leg.

90
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,519
Nan Zhengci

91
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,000
Bumpkin

92
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,079
The once legendary brave youth

93
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,199
has ended up like this.

94
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,879
What a pity.

95
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,319
Such a shame.

96
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,399
The auspicious hour has come.

97
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,319
The auspicious hour has come.

98
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,920
The fire is lit.

99
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,319
May the weather be favorable.

100
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,759
May all the people be safe.

101
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,199
What are they doing?

102
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,279
The royal heirs offer their blood as a sacrifice.

103
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,199
To show their sincerity.

104
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,360
Praying for the gods to bless the nation's prosperity.

105
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,600
Praying for divine protection.

106
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:50,960
Praying for divine protection.

107
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,840
Everyone, be careful.

108
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,440
Luobo, help them quickly!

109
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,360
Run! Run! Run!

110
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,559
Protect the princes!

111
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,120
Second Prince, what's happening?

112
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,799
Protect the First Prince!

113
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,840
Zhengci

114
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,039
Zhengci, help me!

115
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,039
Zhengci

116
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,120
Help!

117
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:53,480
Close the net.

118
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,039
We haven't figured it out yet.

119
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,360
And you just burned it like that.

120
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,759
You look unfamiliar. Who are you?

121
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,919
Me?

122
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,360
Take a guess.

123
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,559
What are you doing here?

124
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,039
What's your purpose?

125
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,159
With that attitude of yours,

126
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,639
are you planning to take me down too?

127
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,279
That's exactly my intention.

128
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,679
Move aside! Move aside!

129
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,320
Move! Move! Move!

130
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,080
Move!

131
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,720
Move!

132
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,679
If you resist again, I won't be so polite.

133
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,440
Are you alright? Did you get hurt anywhere?

134
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:36,600
No.

135
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,399
Senior brother, are you okay?

136
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
I'm fine. What about you?

137
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm fine too.

138
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:01,080
City Lord, something's wrong!

139
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,240
The Rotten Ones have appeared again!

140
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,039
They not only disrupted the Fire Sacrifice Festival,

141
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,679
they almost killed the three young masters.

142
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,039
Rotten Ones?

143
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,679
Like me?
