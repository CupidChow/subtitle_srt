1
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,520
Lord, something terrible has happened.

2
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,679
The corrupted ones have appeared again.

3
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,479
They disrupted the Fire Festival,

4
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,119
and nearly killed the three Young Masters.

5
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,479
Corrupted ones?

6
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,120
Are they like me?

7
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,920
Minister Huo.

8
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,439
How dare you barge into my chambers?

9
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:24,760
Forgive me, Lord.

10
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,480
Corrupted ones appeared at the Fire Festival.

11
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,079
We urgently need you to take charge.

12
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,280
What?

13
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,319
Nonsense!

14
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,159
Please calm down, father.

15
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,799
Look at what you two have done.

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,680
A perfectly good Fire Festival

17
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,879
has turned into chaos, with deaths and injuries.

18
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,359
It's a complete mess.

19
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,159
I, Nan Feng, have been brave all my life,

20
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,400
yet my two sons are no better than useless.

21
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,239
Eldest brother.

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,359
Father.

23
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,200
Father.

24
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,280
Father, please!

25
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,000
The corrupted ones appeared out of nowhere.

26
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,200
Everyone is terrified.

27
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,879
I was in charge of organizing the festival.

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,840
But the city's defenses

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,439
have always been handled by my younger brother.

30
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,719
Who could pull this off right under my nose?

31
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,959
How could this happen?

32
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,439
This is very suspicious.

33
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,400
Someone must be plotting behind the scenes.

34
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,319
They want to frame me, father.

35
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,000
I beg you to investigate thoroughly.

36
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,199
In my opinion,

37
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,879
we should start by checking the defense personnel.

38
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,719
Second brother.

39
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,400
Lord, the eldest Young Master...

40
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,199
Zhusheng.

41
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,560
Please calm down, father.

42
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,039
My leg ailment has relapsed recently.

43
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:31,000
I've been unwell and neglected my duties.

44
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,879
I failed to assist my elder brother with the ceremony.

45
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,400
I am willing to accept punishment.

46
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:38,680
Reporting to my lord,

47
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,280
it was the eldest Young Master who ordered the second Young Master

48
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,280
not to interfere with the ceremony.

49
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,680
The second Young Master, to prevent mistakes,

50
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,199
specifically arranged guards around the area.

51
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,960
He was even injured while saving the eldest Young Master.

52
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,439
So that's what happened.

53
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,680
So the second brother was lying in wait all along.

54
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,120
Such sinister intentions.

55
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,560
Father, you must investigate the second brother thoroughly.

56
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,520
Eldest Young Master, how can you turn on your brother?

57
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,639
After such a disaster,

58
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,759
you did nothing,

59
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,319
and even used a young girl as a shield.

60
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,039
Now you want to frame the second Young Master.

61
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,800
Zhusheng, what nonsense are you talking about?

62
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,000
Who do you think you are?

63
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:08,520
Is it your place to speak?

64
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,159
Enough!

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,199
Stop arguing, this is disgraceful.

66
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,240
If you two brothers act like this,

67
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,520
how can Xuan City be entrusted to you?

68
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,039
I'm afraid you won't be able to protect it.

69
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,479
Please calm down, father.

70
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,159
It's all my fault.

71
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,159
I will do my best to investigate.

72
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,960
Last night at the scene, we found

73
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,560
two suspicious outsiders.

74
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,520
They are highly skilled.

75
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,840
They might be involved in this incident.

76
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,759
Yes.

77
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,560
Yes, exactly.

78
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,240
Those two are vicious and ruthless.

79
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,240
They must have come to assassinate me.

80
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,120
Senior brother.

81
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,479
If you don't come down soon,

82
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,400
your dear junior brother will be crushed.

83
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,800
Little Radish.

84
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,639
It's not that I don't want to come down,

85
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,439
the problem is, I'm getting old.

86
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,120
It's not good for me to soak in cold water.

87
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,120
That's true.

88
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,680
You're getting old.

89
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,319
You can't handle much trouble.

90
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,079
It's really cold.

91
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,600
Xuan City's hospitality

92
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,120
is truly terrible.

93
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,360
They invited Master out of retirement,

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,800
yet they locked up his two beloved disciples

95
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,560
in this cold and filthy water prison.

96
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,279
Madam Sun

97
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,399
Madam Sun

98
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:14,519
Sun

99
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,720
Why are you yelling in the middle of the night?

100
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,839
Madam

101
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:21,639
I...

102
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,199
I'm scared.

103
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,680
In this world,

104
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,040
there's nowhere safer than this palace.

105
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,439
Just have some water, you'll feel better.

106
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,240
Madam, this water is cold.

107
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,240
Princess Yue,

108
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,399
it's so late,

109
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,839
and I still have to light a fire to boil water.

110
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,439
That's too much trouble.

111
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,639
Just make do and drink a little.

112
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,519
Madam

113
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,000
I...

114
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,000
What else do you want?

115
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,720
So troublesome.

116
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,160
Princess, are you hungry?

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,600
Zhusheng

118
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,439
You silly girl,

119
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,399
all you care about is Zhusheng.

120
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,240
You don't even have room for your brother.

121
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,680
Second Brother

122
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,800
You're such a bother.

123
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:39,959
With someone like this,

124
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,800
who has no family backing,

125
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,560
there's nothing to gain.

126
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,680
And still so picky.

127
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:48,680
Annoying.

128
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,360
Just trying to get you hot water.

129
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,000
Madam Sun

130
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,199
Is the water ready?

131
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,120
Almost, almost.

132
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,319
I heard Madam's shrill laughter just now,

133
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,439
I thought it was the sound of boiling water.

134
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,079
No.

135
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,519
I... I didn't.

136
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,800
Oh my!

137
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,959
Can't even boil a pot of water.

138
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,560
No use keeping hands like that.

139
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,160
Stop.

140
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,279
Why do you eat like that?

141
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,600
This is the Princess's residence,

142
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,240
can't it even fill your stomach?

143
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:05,759
I heard there were monsters at the Fire Festival lately.

144
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,560
I've been having nightmares every night.

145
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,240
Sometimes I sleep through the day,

146
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,279
and miss mealtime.

147
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,279
So there's no hot food left.

148
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,199
These useless servants...

149
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,199
Second Brother

150
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,360
Please don't stand up for me.

151
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,319
You'll only get punished by father.

152
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,519
I'm not as brave and capable as you, Second Brother.

153
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,319
You worked so hard for your position.

154
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,319
You fought for it yourself.

155
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,399
Don't trouble father because of me.

156
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:33,600
It'll only make him more worried now.

157
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,720
But I can't let you suffer like this.

158
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,399
Second Brother, your injury...

159
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,519
It's nothing.

160
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,960
Just a minor wound, it doesn't matter.

161
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,000
Once I find out the cause of the corrupted ones,

162
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,519
I'll ask father for permission.

163
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,120
To marry you to a good husband.

164
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,080
And prepare a generous dowry for you.

165
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,240
When that time comes,

166
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,120
I won't let you suffer at all.

167
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,039
Princess Yue

168
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,480
The hot water is here.

169
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,480
Thank you, Zhusheng.

170
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,360
Second Brother is still injured.

171
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,679
Take him back to the residence quickly.

172
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,039
Young Master

173
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,840
You insisted on seeing Princess Yue first.

174
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
The princess is perfectly fine.

175
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,600
You can rest assured.

176
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,960
That guy named Dongqing must be tired of living.

177
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,600
He dared to hurt you, Young Master.

178
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,759
You messed with someone from the Princess's residence.

179
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,440
Speak.

180
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,559
Young Master.

181
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,120
She deserves to die.

182
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,360
How could she do such a thing in Yue's residence?

183
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,080
Do you think I don't have enough problems already?

184
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,799
There must not be a next time.

185
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,200
The chaos during the Fire Festival—

186
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,360
Young Master, do you suspect Zhusheng?

187
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,240
If you suspect Zhusheng,

188
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,679
Zhusheng is willing to prove his loyalty with his life.

189
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:10,679
My people wouldn't do something so foolish.

190
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,600
The walking dead that appeared during the Fire Festival—

191
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,799
They had a strong scent of Zushima on them.

192
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:20,559
A tiny amount of this can relieve pain and reduce inflammation.

193
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,559
But if you use even a bit more,

194
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,039
it will numb the nerves.

195
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,600
It causes madness and hallucinations.

196
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,960
It can even turn people into the walking dead.

197
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,919
More importantly,

198
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,720
this substance is extremely valuable.

199
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,799
One liang of the herb costs one liang of gold.

200
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,639
Zhusheng will investigate this matter right away.

201
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,960
And bring justice to the Young Master.

202
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,960
No need.

203
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,639
Is there any news about that girl?

204
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:45,919
Not yet.

205
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,639
I'll send more people to search for her.

206
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:48,840
Besides,

207
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,840
we still have a trump card in our hands.

208
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,320
As long as she's alive,

209
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,200
she will definitely come back for us.
