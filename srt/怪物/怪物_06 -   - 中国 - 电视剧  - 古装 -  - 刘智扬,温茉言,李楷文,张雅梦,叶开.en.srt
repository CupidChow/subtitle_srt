1
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,040
Master

2
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,959
Here are this month's earnings.

3
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,280
Are you satisfied?

4
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,159
Next, I'll follow your instructions.

5
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,640
I'll capture more people for drug testing.

6
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,000
The Fire Festival is just the beginning.

7
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,959
The real show is yet to come.

8
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,439
Where's A Wu?

9
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,120
A Wu went out to deliver goods.

10
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,719
That girl A Wu,

11
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:30,959
not only is she good-looking,

12
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:31,920
she's also quite capable.

13
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,599
It's just a pity,

14
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,640
she's a fool.

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,560
You must keep a close eye on her for me.

16
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,200
Rest assured, Master.

17
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,840
Twelve Silver Needles

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,799
have sealed her acupoints tightly.

19
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,239
And every day there's Zushi Ma incense.

20
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,200
Even if she were a deity,

21
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:53,400
she couldn't escape your grasp.

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,280
A Wu, oh A Wu,

23
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,519
you're truly a treasure.

24
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,479
Where did you get that tiger tooth?

25
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,120
This one?

26
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:21,560
It's mine.

27
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:22,439
Yours?

28
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,159
Don't think just because you're strong

29
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,280
everything belongs to you.

30
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,240
This tiger tooth is one of a kind.

31
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,280
It belongs to my master.

32
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,879
The three long marks stand for Qian.

33
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,280
The six short marks below stand for Kun.

34
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,520
My master carved them by hand.

35
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,879
You—

36
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,400
Who is your master?

37
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,280
Stop pretending.

38
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,159
How many times have you tried to harm us?

39
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,039
And you wear my master's personal item.

40
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:43,759
Tell me.

41
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,360
Where is my master now?

42
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:04,719
So,

43
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,800
you know me?

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,400
Who am I?

45
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,479
You crazy woman!

46
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,639
Who knows you?

47
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,319
You keep saying the same thing.

48
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,280
Silver Needle Acupoint Sealing.

49
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
Darkened meridians.

50
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,199
Looks like this woman is poisoned.

51
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,960
She has no memory of who she is.

52
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,039
How about

53
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,120
I...

54
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,960
I know you.

55
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,159
If you don't want to die, cooperate with me.

56
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,800
Actually,

57
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,120
Actually, you are...

58
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,800
our friend.

59
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,719
Friend?

60
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,360
Senior Brother!

61
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,039
How can you treat a thief as a friend?

62
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,840
I'm the top expert of Cloud Hidden Temple.

63
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,000
I won't acknowledge this mad woman.

64
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,639
Mother...

65
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,840
Mother...

66
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,400
Mother...

67
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,159
I...

68
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,680
Master's Wife.

69
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,840
Master's Wife.

70
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,439
That's right.

71
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,759
You are our Master's Wife.

72
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,280
Master's Wife.

73
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,439
A few days ago,

74
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,000
you went down the mountain with our Master to search

75
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,879
for the truth about that monster.

76
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,360
But both of you disappeared.

77
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,560
Isn't that right, Junior Brother?

78
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,199
Yes, Master's Wife.

79
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,279
You were always kind and approachable.

80
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,120
You got along well with all the disciples.

81
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,120
Really.

82
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,199
Really.

83
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,959
But your love

84
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:38,079
was not accepted by our sect.

85
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,560
Master's Wife.

86
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,480
This tiger tooth

87
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,519
might be the token of love between you and Master.

88
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,560
Where is Master?

89
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,160
Tell him to come out and explain.

90
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,079
Master!

91
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,399
You don't even know where our Master is.

92
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,879
Where should we look for him?

93
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,160
But now,

94
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,199
we have an important clue.

95
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:05,959
That is,

96
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,480
our Master

97
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,800
is closely connected to this inn.

98
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,040
If we find the person behind the scenes,

99
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,519
won't we find Master?

100
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,480
That's right.

101
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,439
The innkeeper.

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,600
I know her.

103
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,560
Then do you know where she is?

104
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,560
Second Young Master.

105
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,360
The hunchback has arrived at the General's Mansion.

106
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,639
Should we act now?

107
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,279
No rush.

108
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,959
Let's wait and see.

109
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,319
Yes.

110
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,920
That startled me.

111
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,480
Who am I?

112
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,240
You...

113
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,480
You're A Wu.

114
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,439
I found you in the mountains when you were little.

115
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,759
Raised you for nothing all these years.

116
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,600
Go down.

117
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,639
Nonsense!

118
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,360
She's skilled in martial arts but her mind is chaotic.

119
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,199
You sealed her meridians with silver needles.

120
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,120
That's how you trapped her here.

121
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:09,800
Isn't that right?

122
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,399
What he said,

123
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,199
is it true?

124
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,199
If you don't explain the inn's affairs today,

125
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,079
clearly,

126
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,680
you'll suffer

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,199
the same pain as those monsters.

128
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,319
Don't use force!

129
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,240
I'll tell you everything.

130
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:39,800
A Wu.

131
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,199
What you're looking for is over there.

132
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,920
Senior Brother, it's this bitter taste.

133
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,639
Zushi Ma.

134
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,399
Master's Wife.

135
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,800
You actually know this herb.

136
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,639
Though she's confused,

137
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,879
she can still name the medicine correctly.

138
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,399
Feng Wuzhou

139
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,839
She’s actually the long-lost top poison master.

140
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,800
Feng Wuzhou

141
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,360
Feng Wuzhou

142
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,040
Is that my name?

143
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,000
You want to know?

144
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,120
Maybe in your next life.

145
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:44,879
A Wu

146
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,480
You traitor.

147
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,480
If I’d known, I would’ve turned you into a monster too.

148
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,920
Just a few petty minions.

149
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,360
Let me send you flying with a few moves.

150
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,759
Radish, what’s wrong?

151
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,519
Senior Brother

152
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,519
Why does my head feel dizzy?

153
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:17,959
Attack!

154
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,519
You arrived just in time.

155
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,120
We caught a big fish tonight.

156
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,480
The Huo Family Army is here. Who dares to cause trouble?

157
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,519
Late again.

158
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,519
This woman is...

159
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,679
This is...

160
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,320
This is our Master's Wife.

161
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,600
Master's Wife.

162
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,360
Master's Wife.

163
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,320
You never mentioned having inside help before.

164
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:06,799
Our Master's Wife was worried about our Master's safety.

165
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,639
That's why she came here ahead of time.

166
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,039
She infiltrated this place.

167
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,159
So you pretended not to know each other before.

168
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,320
You must have been afraid to alert the enemy.

169
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:20,480
Yes, yes.

170
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,279
If not for my keen insight,

171
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,600
we would have been fooled by them.

172
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,080
That's right.

173
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,399
This is...

174
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,159
These match the features seen during the Fire Festival.

175
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,840
They have the same traits as the Rotten People.

176
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:43,279
It seems

177
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,639
this must be their lair.

178
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,919
You poisonous woman!

179
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,320
Speak!

180
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,240
My Master—

181
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,039
Did you harm my Master?

182
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,240
I swear to the heavens,

183
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,919
I truly haven't seen your Master.

184
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,159
Speak!

185
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,919
I... I really don't know.

186
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,279
These Fake Rotten People

187
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,960
are indeed failed experiments,

188
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
assembled together.

189
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,159
But your Master—

190
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,440
I truly haven't seen him.

191
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,919
My Master is highly skilled.

192
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,679
None of you could defeat him.

193
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,159
You're no match for him.

194
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:17,200
But you might resort to dirty tricks.

195
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,720
Once I uncover the truth,

196
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,039
I won't let you off.

197
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,799
Speak!

198
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,399
How do you control these Fake Rotten People?

199
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,840
Look here.

200
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,960
This is the hallucinogenic poison

201
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,159
that numbs pain,

202
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,960
turning people into walking corpses.

203
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,120
You wretch!

204
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:44,919
Watch me—

205
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:45,559
Bah!

206
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,799
You wicked hag!

207
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:47,960
You'll end up in hell sooner or later.

208
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,639
This—

209
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,320
I drink it every day.

210
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,159
It tastes good.

211
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,080
No wonder you're not in your right mind.

212
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,759
This isn't an inn at all.

213
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,720
It's a living hell.

214
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,159
Take all this evidence away.

215
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,720
Let the City Lord decide everything.

216
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:08,399
Yes.

217
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,200
Second Young Master.

218
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,559
Now your name can be cleared.

219
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,840
Second Young Master.

220
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,759
You can't just abandon me.

221
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,879
I only did these things on orders.

222
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,159
You can't just kick me aside now.

223
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,039
How can you trust only her words?

224
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,840
You poisonous woman, how dare you slander me!
