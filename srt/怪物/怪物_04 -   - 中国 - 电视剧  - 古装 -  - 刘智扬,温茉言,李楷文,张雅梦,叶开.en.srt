1
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,520
Hero,

2
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,200
To be honest with you,

3
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,320
ever since the Corrupted attacked,

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,079
I can't eat,

5
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,280
and I can't sleep well.

6
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,239
You can see,

7
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,359
I've lost so much weight.

8
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,799
That woman just now,

9
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,519
she must have come for me.

10
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,439
Luckily, you were here, hero.

11
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,640
Like a preening peacock—full of yourself.

12
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:24,920
Young Master, you flatter me.

13
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,120
That woman is truly fierce.

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,719
Even Dongqing could barely protect himself.

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,959
Hero,

16
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,480
We, the ones everyone despises,

17
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,040
have somehow become heroes.

18
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:35,959
You—

19
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,560
If this villain isn't dealt with soon,

20
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,879
my heart

21
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,439
feels weighed down by a heavy stone.

22
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,120
I can't breathe.

23
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,040
It's hurting both my body and mind,

24
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,079
a double blow, hero.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,719
Young Master,

26
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,560
if you have something to say, just say it.

27
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:58,879
Hero,

28
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,000
I heard

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,640
Father has entrusted you with investigating the Corrupted.

30
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,079
You have full authority now.

31
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:06,599
Hero,

32
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,240
I am willing

33
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,159
to investigate this matter with you personally.

34
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,240
To ease my father's worries,

35
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,800
and benefit the people.

36
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,000
Let me fight alongside you,

37
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,400
what do you say?

38
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,639
Uh—

39
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,319
Uh—

40
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,280
Young Master, your life is precious.

41
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,680
This is absolutely not allowed.

42
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,520
Hero,

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,599
if you agree to this,

44
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,759
from now on,

45
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,120
we'll be brothers.

46
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,639
Here in Xuan City,

47
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,400
you can walk wherever you please.

48
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,759
This matter is far too dangerous.

49
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,840
Young Master, you must think carefully.

50
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,759
Hero,

51
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,879
please agree to my request.

52
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,479
Young Master, what are you doing?

53
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,560
Take this.

54
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,199
No, no, no.

55
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:52,759
No, no, I can't.

56
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,479
Take it.

57
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,080
No, no.

58
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,120
Take it.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,039
This is Minister Hu's goodwill.

60
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,560
I dare not accept it.

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,479
Please leave.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,919
The Second Young Master won't even give me this courtesy.

63
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,280
Don't blame me if things turn sour between us.

64
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,560
A bastard born of a lowly maid from Mo City

65
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,680
dares to act arrogant before me.

66
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,479
We'll see about that.

67
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,879
What are you looking at, you dog?

68
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,520
Second Young Master,

69
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,599
Minister Hu actually dared to insult you.

70
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,520
Such arrogant fools

71
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,520
don't deserve to be called human.

72
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,000
There are plenty like him in the court.

73
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,000
You've been by my side since childhood.

74
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,960
You're used to this by now, aren't you?

75
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,080
Let him be.

76
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,120
Young Master,

77
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,960
if you never fight for anything,

78
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,879
others will walk all over us one day.

79
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,560
The Young Master is already trying to win over

80
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,840
the disciple of Master Bukku.

81
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,479
If that fool takes all the credit,

82
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,680
it'll be even harder for you to rise in the future.

83
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,319
Are we really not going to act?

84
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,120
No rush.

85
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,240
A wise man bides his time with skills at hand.

86
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,279
He waits for the right moment to act.

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,839
In Xuan City, it's hard to tell humans from ghosts.

88
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,879
That woman with incredible strength—

89
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
who is she, really?

90
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,439
Why does she keep targeting me?

91
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:57,560
And why does she have Master's Tiger Fang?

92
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,040
The weather is dry.

93
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,120
Be careful with fire.

94
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,240
It's dry.

95
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,279
June seventeenth

96
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,199
Isn't that five days later?

97
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:44,879
This...

98
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,959
Open the door!

99
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,879
Let me out!

100
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:45,960
A ghost!

101
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,960
Look how scared you are.

102
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,840
And then what happened?

103
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:57,039
I heard this from the Imperial Guards.

104
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,720
It seems the Second Young Master

105
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,399
may not escape Soul Reaping by the Ghost King.

106
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
Is there any way to save my brother?

107
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,440
Don't be foolish, Princess Yue.

108
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,799
Everyone has their own fate.

109
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,480
So many powerful warriors and extraordinary people

110
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,840
still can't figure it out.

111
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,320
They can't handle those monsters.

112
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,240
You're just a young woman.

113
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,039
What could you possibly do?

114
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,919
Can you trade your life for the Second Young Master?

115
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,080
Lord Father.

116
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,000
You called us here late at night

117
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,000
because of the rumors about Soul Reaping by the Ghost King?

118
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,080
That's right.

119
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:38,320
It's no longer just a rumor.

120
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,320
The one killed in the Ghost King Temple

121
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,840
was Eunuch Tong, who managed city affairs.

122
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,000
And the time of his death

123
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,399
matched exactly with what was shown in the temple.

124
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,799
Ci'er.

125
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,720
Your name is also on that list.

126
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,360
You must investigate this matter quickly.

127
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,919
Otherwise, in a few days

128
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,279
I'm afraid

129
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,039
I'm afraid

130
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,519
the Second Brother will also fall victim to the Ghost King.

131
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,360
Second Brother.

132
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,519
I heard those who were killed

133
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:12,360
had their bodies completely disfigured.

134
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,639
The Ghost King is truly brutal.

135
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,240
Second Brother,

136
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,120
you must be very careful, Second Brother.

137
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:20,879
Well...

138
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,559
If I had Master Dongqing's skills,

139
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,639
I would definitely defeat the Ghost King for you.

140
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,360
Dongqing.

141
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,320
What do you think about this?

142
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,639
Replying to Lord Father,

143
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,799
Ghosts and spirits may be frightening,

144
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,720
but not as dangerous as the human heart.

145
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:42,759
I believe behind all this

146
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,120
someone is pretending to be supernatural.

147
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,480
Isn't that right, Young Master?

148
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,240
Yes.

149
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:51,440
Yes to what?

150
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:52,919
Why are you looking at me?

151
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,480
I'm always timid and afraid.

152
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:58,159
I can't stand anything bloody or violent.

153
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,279
Young Master, please don't misunderstand.

154
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,399
I really didn't mean that.

155
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,360
You...

156
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,080
Please give us more time, Lord Father.

157
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:08,159
We will get to the bottom of this.

158
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,360
You must hurry.

159
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:10,919
Yes.

160
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,320
General Huo.

161
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,600
Is there anything I can do?

162
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,279
Forget it.

163
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:18,600
Ci'er.

164
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,279
Your name is also there.

165
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,559
Don't try to be brave.

166
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,600
Just stay in the residence.

167
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,120
Announce my decree.

168
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:28,919
Starting today,

169
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,519
mobilize the Imperial Guards

170
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,159
to protect those

171
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,000
whose names appear on the Soul Reaping list

172
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,279
at their residences.

173
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,679
Lord Father, but—

174
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,399
Enough, the matter is settled.

175
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,600
No further discussion.

176
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,320
You may all leave.

177
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,519
Yes.

178
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Yes, Lord Father.
