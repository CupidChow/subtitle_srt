00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,380
The target's dead.

4
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,939
We have an incident in District 5-7.

5
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,022
District...

6
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,901
Fuck.

<i>Are you the legendary 5-8?</i>

00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,552
I'm Sa-wol. Yoon Sa-wol.

9
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,474
- 4-1.
<i>- Go ahead.</i>

10
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,935
- Got a situation. Move it.
<i>- Got it.</i>

Sergeant Lee.

12
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,581
Let's get started.

13
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,209
Come in.

LIVING ROOM LIGHTS

15
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,624
Looks like it's related to the kidnappings
in the General Districts.

16
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,918
Be thorough as you investigate.

17
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,503
Provide the report when you're done.

18
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,298
We'll investigate.
I assure you that we'll be thorough.

19
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,010
But the room, you're aware that...

20
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,970
I'm aware of the consequences.

21
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,140
Please don't say that.

22
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,600
We're all on your side here, Major.

23
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,995
Unni!

24
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,082
He opened his eyes!

25
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,130
Unni, the refugee boy is awake!

26
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,346
Tell me what your name is.

27
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,307
Sa-wol.

28
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,101
Yoon Sa-wol.

29
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,743
How do you feel? How's your head?

30
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,871
<i>Yoon Sa-wol!</i>

31
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,715
Where am I?

32
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,636
Seul-ah. Where's Seul-ah?

33
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,515
You can't move around yet.

34
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,058
Why are you here?

35
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,104
Let go. I have to go see Seul-ah.

36
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,564
Let go! Let me go!

37
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,608
The girl is dead.

38
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,984
That's not true.

39
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,168
You can't do anything over there anyway.

40
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,030
Don't lie to me.

41
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,740
I'll go see for myself.

42
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,827
Let go.

43
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:52,869
Let go of me!

44
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,516
I think the bullet was stopped
by his skull.

45
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,437
- If it really is what it appears to be...
- That's enough for today.

46
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,689
Let's keep this between us for now.

47
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,232
Okay.

48
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,609
You want me to have a look at that?

49
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,694
No, I'm fine.

50
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,683
It's not just a rumor.

51
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:59,830
MS. JUNG SEUL-AH'S CREMATION IS COMPLETE

52
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,444
Didn't I tell you that this will break
if you stepped on it too hard?

53
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,221
Last time I fixed it real good,
I made it sturdy,

54
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,806
but you always bring it back in here.

55
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,889
You mess around with it.

56
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,142
Ugh, Gramps...

57
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,229
You know I'm not the only person
using this groundwater pump.

58
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,192
Everyone uses it,
different strengths and stuff.

59
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,442
That's why it keeps getting broken.
You know it's true.

60
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,779
You might be right.

61
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:35,283
Okay, so how's the water?

62
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,576
Is the flow strong?

63
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,246
It's not so great these days.
The water just dribbles out.

64
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,291
We, uh, gotta find a new place real soon.

65
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,752
Well, they're pretty good
at finding groundwater.

66
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,088
Take them and look for it together.

67
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,571
Everything with Sa-wol
must have been difficult.

68
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,534
It was a relief
knowing you were there for him,

69
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,746
and I'm so glad
all of his friends were here too.

70
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,167
So what's wrong?
Did something happen to him?

71
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,588
SPECIAL DISTRICT

72
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,929
<i>We are now at
the Government Building, Special District.</i>

73
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,938
<i>We ask that the Special District workers
abide strictly by the working hours</i>

74
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:52,026
<i>set by the government in order to prevent
an oversupply of oxygen.</i>

75
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,240
I'm glad we're meeting so often now.

76
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,034
I'm not sure glad is the feeling.

77
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,494
Right this way.

78
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,375
Should the victim's family
be allowed to investigate?

79
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,043
How did you know that?

80
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,795
Family pictures.

81
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,382
You were beside the victim.

82
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,884
And now I'm seeing you.

83
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:20,429
We're taking your statement
about the incident at District 5-7.

84
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,349
Deliveryman 5-8,
you were the first person to report it,

85
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,226
that's why we brought you
to the meeting room

86
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,061
instead of the investigation room.

87
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,270
Let's get started.

88
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,695
You've heard about the kidnappings
in the General Districts?

89
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,612
Yes.

90
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,489
What they all have in common

91
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,450
is that the security cameras
in the district freeze up,

92
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,995
and the memory cards in the houses
recording entry and exit disappear.

93
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,083
However, what's different
about this instance is the fact that...

94
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,166
There was a murder.

95
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,259
Right.

96
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,054
It's actually the only murder,

97
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,640
and there's a witness
who had called in the case.

98
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,812
If all of the victims open their doors
without any suspicion,

99
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,107
then we can narrow down the person
on the other side of the door

100
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,777
to their family, soldiers, or possibly...

101
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,157
You brought me in as a witness,
and now I'm a suspect?

102
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,285
Every deliverman's work
is recorded by the minute.

103
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,204
That provides a solid alibi.

104
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,332
I'm just leaving the possibility open.

105
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,419
It's not unreasonable to think

106
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,921
that you could have allowed
a level of access.

107
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,008
You may have opened the door.

108
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,762
You believe I helped the murderers
and then decided to report it all later?

109
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:47,266
Then walk me through everything
you happened to see as the first reporter.

110
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,393
I heard a gunshot...

111
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,816
...and when I got inside, it was over.

How many murders were there?

114
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,037
Did no one ever count the bodies?

115
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,790
The only bodies remaining
were the victim's bodies.

116
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,419
Do you remember what they looked like?
Anything to help us?

117
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,300
I'm not sure. It was an awful scene.

118
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,844
Why did you leave the scene
before the military arrived?

119
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,846
You know a deliveryman and his schedule.

120
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,850
Timeliness is everything to us.

121
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,274
Do I look like a joke to you?

122
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,318
I think you're the one
who thinks I'm a joke.

123
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:43,239
I know the simulation shows you the
movements of the culprits who were there.

124
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,283
I think there's more you wanna know here.

125
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,454
The urgent delivery that gave me
no choice but to leave the scene.

126
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,250
I'd be curious
about where that delivery was headed.

127
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,964
I guess that's enough for now.

128
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,590
I'm behind on my work.

134
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,187
I'm sorry, sir.

135
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,572

You don't remember anything?

138
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,468
I've got memory flashes,

139
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,596
but my head hurts too much.

140
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,392
Whenever the pain goes away,
I can't remember a thing.

141
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,560
Sorry.

142
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,189
I survived alone.

143
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,736
I should have protected her.

144
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,866
Don't say that.

145
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,245
I'm so glad you survived.

146
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,871
I mean it.

147
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,343
Seul-ah was the reason
you couldn't leave here.

148
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,097
You had been stuck at home
going stir-crazy.

149
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,392
Go, be with your friends.

150
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,521
You were like family, so I stayed.

151
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,692
And it wasn't that I was going crazy here,

152
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:52,446
it was that I felt bad
when I thought about the two of you.

153
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,604
This is...

154
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,734
Just please stay alive.

155
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,863
I'll come by once in a while.

156
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,167
Thanks for everything.

157
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,921
I wanna thank you

158
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,549

00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,644
God, I'm exhausted.

165
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,814
Me too. Ugh!

166
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,613
Didn't find him, or what?

167
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,531
No, man, he was nowhere to be found.

168
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,967
God, that fool's gotta be alive, right?

169
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,368
His sister came here.

170
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,621
She wouldn't have done that
if he were dead.

171
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,872
That idiot! I...

172
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:10,292
Whenever I do end up finding him,
I'm gonna beat him half to death.

173
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,420
You think you could beat Sa-wol?
Really?

174
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,756
What? Why not? You don't think we could?

175
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,011
Grandpa.

176
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,598
Sa-wol must feel so guilty
he probably wishes he was dead.

177
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:25,766
Probably, yeah.

178
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,786
You're playing games now, or what?

179
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,205
Just beat me up.

180
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,373
What?

181
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,208
Or kill me if you want.

182
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,877
What the hell? Are you insane?

183
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:04,887
Get him!

184
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,816
See? I told you.

185
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,318
He must've wanted someone
to be beat him half to death.

186
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,112
Oh my God, those dirty bastards.

187
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,571
They're gonna kill him!

188
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,448
Grab anything you can find, all right?

189
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,705
You're gonna suffocate
out here anyway, so why don't I help?

190
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,082
Stop it, you jerks!

191
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,338
So the whole gang's gone crazy.

192
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,048
- Um...
- Shoot.

193
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,844
Fine, tonight you're all gonna die!

194
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,595
Guys, stay back!

195
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,848
- Uh oh.
- Just stay there!

196
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,477
Sa-wol!

197
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,923
<i>We are recruiting
construction workers.</i>

198
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,469
<i>After the contract is over, you will be
given a year's worth of oxygen and food.</i>

199
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,432
<i>We are recruiting construction workers.</i>

200
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:34,519
<i>After the contract is over, you will be
given a year's worth of oxygen and food.</i>

201
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,567
Hundreds of refugees
have gone into District A recently.

202
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,569
They're desperate
to finish construction.

203
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,572
Who do you think will be in charge
of the relocation plan?

204
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,075
The government? Or Cheonmyeong?

205
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:51,328
If the construction is completed
like this, wouldn't it be Cheonmyeong?

206
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:54,498
Any hope of refugees living
in General District's will disappear.

207
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,585
When you go to District A,
delay their work as much as you can.

208
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:03,173
You have a knack for nonchalantly
ordering people to do difficult things.

209
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,053
<i>We are recruiting
construction workers.</i>

210
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:11,765
<i>After the contract is over, you will be
given a year's worth of oxygen and food.</i>

211
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,810
Don't you think the sun's gotten
a bit brighter?

212
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:22,067
And my future has gotten darker
considering I have to get on that bus.

213
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,955
No, it's getting brighter.

214
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,588
I was gonna beat him up.

215
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,131
What an idiot.

216
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,801
It's been two whole days.

217
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,305
Maybe he's co... coma, uh...

218
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,390
What's the, uh...

219
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,225
What's the word, "comatose"?

220
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,810
I... I think he is.

221
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,770
Hey,

222
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:03,316
would it make me a piece of total garbage
if I said I was hungry?

223
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,587
You've always been pieces of garbage,
so just go make some food.

224
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,866
Okay. Well, you gotta eat.

225
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,794
You know, I got into my first fight ever
because of you.

226
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,464
And now I'm 0 and 1.

227
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:03,876
He's still out?

228
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:11,176
You know, actually it's better
because he's not awake and suffering

229
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:17,724
Sleep restores your body,
your heart, and your mind.

230
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:32,072
You little shit! I was gonna help you live
like a human being.

231
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,115
Wake the hell up.

232
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,835
Mr. Ryu Seok, CEO of Cheonmyeong Group.

233
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,761
I can't reach you for days,
and you call yourself my cousin?

234
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:57,180
How do you think
that make me look to Mr. Ryu?

235
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,391
The people we kidnapped...

236
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,353
where are they being sent?

237
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,649
There were talks of human experiments
and other horrible things.

238
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,236
You moron. Stop with all your nonsense!

239
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:12,946
I can't do it.

240
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,864
Can't be the key

241
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,576
and a deliveryman.

242
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,371
They're both too much.

243
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,331
5-7,

244
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,375
what is the problem?

245
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,004
Is it really so hard to be the key
to the General Districts?

246
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,881
You think we're taking these people away
and hurting them?

247
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,509
I... I heard it very clearly.

248
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,511
They're killing people,

249
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:38,888
doing experiments.

250
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,641
You must not understand
what it is I'm doing.

251
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,229
The goal here is not to kill anybody,
it is to save them.

252
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,899
That's why I chose a trustworthy man
such as yourself.

253
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,151
Do you understand now?

254
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,327
Very well.

255
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,831
Just one last time.

256
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,834
Play the key for me one last time, okay?

257
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,919
And I'll let you live here
in the Core District

258
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,087
for the rest of your life.

259
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,171
What?

260
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,007
You're being offered everything.

261
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,884
So, say, "thank you."

262
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,054
I'll take care of you Mr. 5-7.

263
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:21,847
In return...

264
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,562
you'll put your life on the line.

265
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:37,197
Just remember
what's in the back of your head.

266
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,121
<i>It's concerning how many
refugee children are disappearing.</i>

267
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,915
<i>I got call about another one yesterday.</i>

268
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:48,958
Where?

269
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,919
It was in Songpa. A boy in his late teens.

270
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,337
Witnesses?

271
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,714
Said there were a bunch of men headed
to Gangnam now.

272
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,342
Two are now in Seocho, and one in Yeouido.

273
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,637
Scope's been getting narrower.

274
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,306
No plate on the vehicle.
Same as last time.

275
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,976
A Gangnam vehicle missing plates, huh?

276
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,273
Just need one of those guys.

277
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,196
It's a GPS tracker.

278
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,906
We'll owe you one.

279
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,617
<i>I promise we'll come save you.</i>

280
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,427
Did they fall for it?

281
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,721
Location confirmed.

282
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,305
We make our move tonight.

283
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,854
<i>Exit secured.</i>

284
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,398
<i>Outside stairway taken care of.</i>

285
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,402
<i>Center stairway is open too.</i>

286
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,114
Entering the hallway.

287
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,242
What about 5-7?

288
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,994
He's gone to work.

289
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,476
What the?

290
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,394
What's going on here?

291
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,522
Those psychos.

292
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,150
How could they do this to children?

293
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,717
Oh man.

294
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,353
Sa-wol.

295
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,856
Uh, whenever people die...

296
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,858
They become stars in the sky?

297
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,903
Don't you give me that bullshit.

298
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,364
- Okay.
- No...

299
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,954
I'd rather they did become stars.

300
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,546
Sa-wol!

301
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,922
Sa-wol!

302
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,632
You're up! Oh my God!

303
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,511
No!

304
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:49,889
Hey, just hold on!

305
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,600
Are you kidding me?

306
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,395
Oh my God.
My pants... my pants are falling!

307
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,855
What are we gonna do?

308
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,858
- Useless!
- Useless!

309
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,653
I can't believe you lost hold of him!

310
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:04,904
I'm sorry!

311
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:08,616
That looks like fun,
as long as you don't die.

312
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,536
CHEONMYEONG GROUP

313
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,621
<i>What are you thinking
so intently about?</i>

314
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,792
The president came by here.

315
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,754
A disturbance in District A
and a murder in the General Districts.

316
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,965
What's going on up there?

317
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:28,052
The president's mostly
just a bunch of talk.

318
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,721
She's meddling where she needs not be.

319
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,723
Are you sure you're not crossing the line?

320
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,226
That's why I'm giving you a report.

321
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,394
I don't need it.

322
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,313
I've heard all that I need to.

323
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,897
You would take
the word of the president over mine?

324
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,027
Listen, Son.

325
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,696
Yes, Father.

326
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:50,783
Ever since I came here,
I have not trusted anyone.

327
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,702
Especially you.

328
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,412
But why would you not trust me?

329
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:58,750
I've built this place and developed
the Air Cores to save more people,

330
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,627
even if it is just one.

331
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:04,088
I see now there's too much
that I have missed

332
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,215
while working on those
for the last few decades.

333
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,135
You envisioned the future,
and you were very accurate.

334
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:12,221
All the progress we have here
is because of the risks that you made.

335
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:25,026
Tell me what you see
whenever you look up at that.

336
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,195
Stupid people living
in a world you created.

337
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:31,449
However, they still take for granted
everything that you have provided.

338
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,202
Cheonmyeong wasn't mine yet you said.

339
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,370
I admit that,

340
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,456
but one day soon you will credit me.

341
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:51,552
I do not know
how big the sorrow is inside your heart.

342
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,846
I would guess that it's quite big.

343
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,935
Although, as each day goes by,

344
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,229
it will get smaller.

345
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,608
Just a little bit,
and the next day a little smaller,

346
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,568
and a little smaller after that.

347
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,196
And that's the way it will go.

348
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:15,535
The smaller the sorrow will become,
each day a bit smaller.

349
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,497
And then it will become a longing...

350
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,751
for people who are...

351
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,878
are gone.

352
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,381
That's how it works.

353
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,758
Our sorrow becomes our longing.

354
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,138
I'm sad and then angry...

355
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,727
but then I start to miss her.

356
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,813
I'm scared that...

357
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,236
that I'm gonna forget all these feelings.

358
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,198
Oh, my crazy Sa-wol.

359
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,452
You really are growing up, kid.

360
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:17,804
<i>Son.</i>

361
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:22,143
I do not trust anyone,
especially since coming down here.

362
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,145
<i>The Earth went to hell decades ago,</i>

363
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,355
<i>and the people here
are starting to lose their minds.</i>

364
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,900
You especially.

365
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,154
You don't know I'm dying.

366
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,031
Of course I'm losing my mind.

367
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:53,174
EXIT FIVE
APGUJEONG

368
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,859
APGUJEONG

369
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:17,240
Okay. So far, all good.

370
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,661
Let's see here. Aha.

371
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:28,918
They keep getting better
and then worse, but, uh...

372
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,799
they may just need more time here.

373
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,467
Did you take a look at this too?

374
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,476
From District A.

375
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,603
GENERAL DISTRICT 1-1

376
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,568
What? You got something to say?

377
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,113
You have Yoon Sa-wol, don't you?

378
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,531
Sa-wol?

379
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,041
A bullet bounced off his head
like it was nothing.

380
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,460
It bounced off, you sure?

381
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,548
His recovery speed's incredible.

382
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,468
Did you know anything about this,

383
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,220
that he was a mutant?

384
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,601
There was an oxyanium mine
his father worked at.

385
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,684
I know that.

386
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,564
Plenty of radioactive material there.

387
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,774
Those miners' children.

388
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,741
Almost 100 refugee kids
have disappeared so far.

389
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:45,703
And the kidnappings are now happening
in the General Districts too.

390
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,496
They're all adolescents

391
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,415
around Yoon Sa-wol's age.

392
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:53,794
So is it really important
that he's a mutant, then?

393
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,561
He's a mess in body, heart, and mind.

394
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,606
Just please leave him here, for now.

395
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,712
DISTRICT 5-7 MURDER CASE

396
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,300
<i>You brought me in as a witness,
and now I'm a suspect?</i>

397
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:44,804
You believe I helped the murderers
and then decided to report it all later?

398
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,559
ACCESS DENIED

399
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,643
Sergeant Lee.

400
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:56,107
The minister's office has ordered
that crimes in the General District

401
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,526
won't be under purview
of the Intelligence Command.

402
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,194
- Because of me?
- Yes.

403
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,573
And the official reply has referenced
the relationship you had with the victim.

404
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:11,080
But I wouldn't worry about this.
We've bought ourselves plenty of time.

405
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,249
What are you saying?

406
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,812
We have all the data we could access.

407
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,919
We made several back-up disks
with everything.

408
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,921
<i>I've got the data on the murder.</i>

409
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,674
I've got data for the ten kidnappings
in the General Districts.

410
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:24,135
And I've backed up
all deliveryman route information.

411
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,223
Thank you, everyone.

412
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,226
Just give us a long vacation
when all of this is over.

413
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,311
How about that, Major?

414
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,484
- Vacation?
- That would be great.

415
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,318
5-7
DELIVERYMAN, CHEONMYEONG GROUP

416
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,501
5-7.

417
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,714
DELIVERY STATION

418
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,436
[objects clattering

419
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,965
He didn't show up
at the meeting place?

420
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,343
No, he did not.

421
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,263
CONTROLLER
5-7

422
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,433
Nothing else to be done.

423
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,062
Uh, sir, I'll knock some sense
into him however I can.

424
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,772
Give him one more chance, please.

425
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:00,898
Mr. Oh.

426
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,818
Do you know why I do this myself?

427
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,028
Well, I know that it's significant.

428
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,113
Yes.

429
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,740
If I were actually
to make someone else do this,

430
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:13,577
they may get the wrong idea
that this will never happen to them.

431
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,455
You're right. I'm sorry.

432
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,500
<i>The kidnappings
in the General Districts,</i>

433
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,127
you're the key.

434
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,128
Yes.

435
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,004
Who are those tattooed men?

436
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,672
Cheonmyeong's?

437
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,551
I'm not sure.

438
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,760
I'm sorry.

439
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,596
I'm the reason
they were dragged off and killed.

440
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,101
What'd you say? Dragged off where?

441
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,436
Uh, I don't know.

442
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,603
I... I'm not sure.

443
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,981
It should be me.
I'm the one who should die. I'm the one.

444
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,566
Tell me. What did you hear?

445
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,067
Where were they all taken?

446
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,113
The... the... the human experiments...

447
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,031
What?

448
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,592
DECEASED

449
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,010
It's too bad.

450
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,052
No, sir.

451
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:16,682
He was always a mess,
a real family embarrassment.

452
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:17,765
So

453
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,187
the dead target was a younger sister
of one of our majors.

454
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,313
Yes.

455
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,983
I'm told their father was a manager
of an oxyanium mine.

456
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,028
Is the major one of our targets too?

457
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,279
No, sir.

458
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:33,866
She was born
before he was stationed at the mine.

459
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,993
I was planning to inform you, sir.

460
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,076
OH JI-HWAN

461
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,374
Mr. Oh,

462
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,127
your work here lately has gotten messy.

463
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,756
Sir, I'm sorry!

464
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,217
I'll never again make that mistake.

465
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:53,885
Sir...

466
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,727
I... I'm sorry.

467
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,810
STOP

468
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,233
Mr. Oh.

469
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,484
Yes?

470
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,487
Think about how you feel right now
and always remember it.

471
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,781
I will never forget.

472
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,493
Oh, and for the key,

473
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,578
a new deliveryman must be found.

474
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,330
I will go find one.

475
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,169
No, no.

476
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,922
Mistakes must not be repeated.

477
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,467
We will put on a special event

478
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,762
to distract everyone from our larger plan.

479
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,097
An event, sir? That's perfect.

480
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,519
It's been a while since we put on a show.

481
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,082
- What's his ranking?
- Thirteen, man.

482
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,002
Dude must be jacked.
He's taking some big hits.

483
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,549
Oh, you hear the 5-7 announcement?

484
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,384
What did it say?

485
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,929
Overworking. You believe that?

486
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:22,808
I've heard of getting killed by hunters,
but overworking? Bullshit.

487
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,187
So when do they choose someone else?

488
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,939
That'll take a little while.

489
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,692
Apparently, this time
they're doing it right.

490
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,735
Doing it right?

491
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,695
Whoa!

492
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,494
Nice one!

493
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,051
Wow. 4-1 really has one nasty kick.

494
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,554
5-8!

495
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,181
5-8, get down here!

496
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:05,893
Yeah?

497
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,186
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

498
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:19,967
What's this?

499
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:30,685
Here.

500
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:40,863
You finally have a chance
to make your dream come true.

501
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,469
4-1.

502
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:04,845
I'm here, go ahead.

503
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,514
- We're assembling.
<i>- Okay.</i>

504
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,475
<i>Put out the cigarette.</i>

505
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:16,982
Well, what's that?

506
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,168
He's making quite the entrance.

507
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:27,839
