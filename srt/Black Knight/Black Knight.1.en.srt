<i>Forty years ago,

<i>Since then, most of the continents
have sunk into the sea,</i>

4
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:49,007
<i>and the Korean Peninsula
has turned into a desert.</i>

5
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,223
<i>Only 1% of the population survived.</i>

6
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,937
<i>These survivors needed
new technology and a new social order.</i>

7
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,069
<i>To deal with the polluted atmosphere,</i>

8
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:13,031
<i>a gigantic Air Core was built
to convert oxyanium into oxygen.</i>

9
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,830
<i>And the scarcity of resources
led to a division of the population,</i>

10
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:26,419
<i>distinguished using QR codes

13
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,805
<i>labeled as refugees.</i>

14
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,976
<i>Some of these refugees,</i>

15
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,438
<i>tired of the discrimination,
starvation, and lack of oxygen,</i>

16
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,399
<i>became hunters

<i>and arrive on time

22
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,930
<i>Deliverymen have to be strong.</i>

00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,141
<i>Deliverymen have to keep cool
under pressure.</i>

24
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,435
<i>They have to risk their lives
to protect their cargo from hunters.</i>

25
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:41,077
<i>This is the reason people dream
of becoming deliverymen.</i>

26
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:48,293
<i>Especially for the refugees
who don't have QR codes,</i>

27

- Oh, sir...
- Don't nag me, son.

No, I just felt bad for him.

- No!
- Please, let him go!

Take me, don't take the kid!

Ow, my back.

109
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,785
I warned you
that it's refugee crackdown period,

110
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,705
and you've been out there wandering about
using up our supplies.

111
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,295
I mean, I do win, at least,

112
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,797
and then I win again,
and then, oh my God, I win some more.

113
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,425
And now, you know,
there's no one to challenge me.

114
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,137
You see, all of this
is just part of the train...

115
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,598
Challenge you? Training?
As a deliveryman, huh?

116
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,643
But, Unni, uh,
I actually think he could do it.

117
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,021
I've seen him fight
a few times.

118
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,273
He's definitely much stronger than he was.

119
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,735
So you've been going out there
as well, huh?

120
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,237
You should've stopped him.
You're better than that!

121
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,239
Drop down, now.

122
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,242

123
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,869
No, don't do that, Noona.

124
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,622
It's all my fault. She did nothing wrong.

125
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,123
Just punish me. Just me. Yeah.

126
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,207
Here.

127
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,670
You think anybody can be a deliveryman?

128
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,048
You think being immature
and fighting everyone

129
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,549
makes you a general citizen?

130
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,843
I promised you I'll find a way.

131
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,053
You promise me?

132
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,722
- You promise me, seriously?
- What?

133
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,974
You got another code implant lying around?

134
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,164
I'm sure you're worried about harboring a
refugee Ms. Major at Defense Intelligence.

135
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,188
So, what?

136
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,442
- Gonna go buy me someone's hand?
<i>- Oppa</i>!

137
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,736
And not just a few days,
it's been ten years.

138
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,532
This way you've been referring to
isn't even possible.

139
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,742
So don't do anything anymore.

140
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,911
I don't wanna put you in danger.

141
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,453
Either of you.

142
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,665
I don't wanna put myself in danger either.

143
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,917
So, don't be making dumb choices
and just stay inside.

144
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,840
The safest thing for everyone
is if I get lost.

145
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:57,877
Yoon Sa-wol!

146
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,798
I told you not to talk about getting lost!

147
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,389
So what about your bright future?

148
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,268
You let me down.

149
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,352
What?

150
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,436
"What?"

151
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,734
You won't be a deliveryman
if you get caught.

152
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,862
You'll just cause trouble for everyone.

153
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,239
So, Yoon Sa-wol,

154
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,491
you're grounded for a week.

155
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,576
Whoa. What?

156
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,744
Are you serious?

157
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,414
Look here, Major Jung Seol-ah,
you're being so unfair.

158
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,957
Aww.

159
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,334
- Fifteen days.
- Fifteen, yeah.

160

I'll keep him right in line.

162
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,800
Okay, I'll do a week.

163
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,968
She'll go to 30.

164
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,725
Okay. All right.

165
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,603

00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,526
- Take this.
- Yes, sir.

183
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,742
Madam President,

184
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,745
how bad is the situation
in the Special District?

185
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,288
Population's out of control.

186
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,040
Can't see the forests or the sky,

187
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,667
so people suffer from depression
and panic disorders.

188
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,713
It's inevitable, though.

189
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:13,884
That's why this relocation plan
is so important to everybody.

190
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,310
There have been so many issues.

191
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:27,147
I guess I really screwed up
when I was designing the place.

192
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,068
It's only been 40 years
since you made all of this here.

193
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,071
You dug five kilometers below ground

194
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,740
and built this world
in such a short period of time.

195
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,827
And then once District A's been finished,

196
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,956
you will have created a new environment
for us all once again.

197
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,833
Thank you for saying that.

198
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,460
I'm old and fear I'm losing my confidence.

199
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,670
I'm so full of regret.

200
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,713
What are you saying?

201
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,590
You're still strong and healthy.

202
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,261
Don't let those bad thoughts in,
just focus on the relocation.

203
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:03,892
It sounds to me like maybe you want me
to finish the plan and then die.

204
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,481
I didn't know you were here,
Madam President.

205
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,024
Is this private?

206
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,651
No, we were waiting for you.

207
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,785
I heard that the Air Road is now complete.

208
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,371
When will you do the operation test?

209
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,582
They're still working on the timeline.

210
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,001
You've been to the District A
construction site, right?

211
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,837
Is the construction schedule
being delayed?

212
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,340
I heard the reports to the government
are not being delivered on time.

213
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,176
Reporting to you is my priority.

214
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,844
Construction's almost done.

215
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,513
You know promptly sharing information
is a must.

216
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,639
I apologize.

217
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,649
So when should I expect it?

218
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,866
I will inform you as soon as possible.

219
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,201
Fine.

220
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,913
"Soon."

221
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,643
Why do you antagonize the government
this way?

222
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,229
Well, Father...

223
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,275
A world of Cheonmyeong's creation.

224
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,403
We wasted a year due
to the government's meddling.

225
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,198
Their telling us what to do
isn't helping us. Listen to me.

226
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,283
So you believe
that Cheonmyeong is yours now?

227
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,828
I don't, Father. You are Cheonmyeong.

228
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,331
Yes. Better not forget that fact.

229
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,249
Ever.

00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,656

236
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,621

237
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,000

238
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,083

239
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,919
So you're still kicking, huh?

240
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:36,920
You little punk.

241
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,131
I'll have you know
that I have no plans of dying

242
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,258
until I fix that rude mouth of yours.

243
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,218
You got that, kid? Huh, huh?

244
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,553
That pinches!

245
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,514
I was never properly educated,
that's why I speak like that.

246
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,309
Hey, unschooled Sa-wol,
some of us are trying to learn.

247
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,227
Grandpa told us it makes us all better.

248
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,480
Oh, he told you that?
Well, I think better is too freakin' hard.

249
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,804
Let's go out, get better later.

250
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:57,858
- Out?
- Out where?

251
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,443

Are you the legendary 5-8?

285
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:17,112
Yes, the guard force
dealt with it. It's over.

286
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,489
I should have called you earlier...

287
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,200
Anyway, thank you
for coming all the way here.

288
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,354
Since I have, I'd like to meet
the head of the guard force.

289
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:30,542
Even you can't go in there
without authorization beforehand, Major.

290
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,795
I understand secrecy is important,
but it's ridiculous to restrict access

291
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,797
to a major
of the Defense Intelligence Command.

292
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,882
I've told you time and time again,

293
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,461
Cheonmyeong is leading
the construction of District A.

294
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,013
Please don't take this the wrong way.
I ask for your understanding.

295
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,606
Where are they going?

296
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,608
They are Cheonmyeong's assets,

297
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:59,404
and that being the case,
they're not of your purview either, Major.

298
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,918
It's strange they're going this far
to stop people from seeing District A.

299
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:17,046
Actually, yeah.
I was also wondering about that.

300
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,468
That jackass head guard disappears
whenever I show up,

301
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,888
and that Oh guy always brings up
Cheonmyeong, Cheonmyeong. God!

302
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,474
The head guard's pretty old.

303
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,976
I think calling him a jackass
is a little, um...

304
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,564
Yeah, no, you're correct.

305
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,609
Whoa!

306
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,321
Oh shit.

307
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,365
Hey, watch out, you damn idiot!

308
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,784
Yes, sir, uh...

309
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,327
I was trying to be careful.

310
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,085
Stay alert!

311
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,890
Open the door.

312
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,689
Stop, hands in the air!

313
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,318
What's going on?

314
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,363
I hate having guns aimed at me.

315
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,615
Major Jung Seol-ah,
Defense Intelligence Command.

316
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,158
Is this your vehicle?

317
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,743
The Cheonmyeong Group owns it.

318
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:29,911
I know that.

319
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,955
Please answer the question I asked.

320
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,293
Yes, I drive this vehicle. Major.

321
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:40,171
The area near District A
is off-limits.

00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,465
Why is your delivery vehicle
this far off-route?

323
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,635
I got lost because of the tornado
and saw another path.

324
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,220
Where did you go?

325
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,763
Does that matter?

326
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,390
I asked you where you went.

327
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:06,655
I

328
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,198
was

329
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:09,908
uri...

330
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,493
...nating.

331
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,621
Let me check your ID.

332
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:24,798
IDENTITY CONFIRMED

333
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,721
Please leave right away.

334
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,361
Get in the car.

335
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,046
Little angry.

336
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:24,858
I'm back.

337
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,842
So did you have fun today?

338
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,302
Huh?

339
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:54,763
Mm-hmm.

340
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,766
Go to your room, now.

341
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,849
Now?

342
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,273
What do we got here?

343
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,568
Should be plenty, okay?

344
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,945
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

345
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:09,904
LOCKED

346
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,532
<i>- Commencing QR lockdown.</i>

347
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,701
<i>You put yourself in my shoes, </i>Oppa<i>.</i>

348
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,412
I'm sorry, but you couldn't even stay
inside for one day<i>.</i>

349
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,580
<i>- What else can I do?</i>
- You serious? Um...

350
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,124
Something went down today. Really.

351
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,292
Just open the door.
I'll tell you everything.

352
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,794
<i>Okay, then just say it.</i>

353
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,838
<i>You can say everything just right here.</i>

354
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,382
<i>How about we, uh,
eat something and chat?</i>

355
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,012
Those boxes have enough food
to last 15 days.

356
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,138
Ugh!

357
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,392
<i>Okay look, I promise after tomorrow
I'll be inside every day.</i>

358
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:42,145
<i>- I promise, I promise, okay?</i>
- You promise?

359
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,939
'Cause I was thinking about it today.

360
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,734
How many times
have you actually kept your word

361
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,569
in the ten years you've lived here?

362
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,820
How many? Uh...

363
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,321
Not once.

364
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,781
Zero times.

365
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:55,824
Hey!

366
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,952
That doesn't mean you can lock me in here.

367
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,996
<i>Listen to Seol-ah and me
just this once.</i>

368
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,623

REFUGEE DISTRICT - LABOR MARKET

371
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,614
Are you on your own?

372
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,698
No.

373
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,743
My dad,

374
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,454
he went to go get oxygen.

375
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,833
Hmm.

376
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,169
I GAVE MY ALL TO BECOME A DELIVERYMAN

377
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,295
What's that book?

378
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,550
It's mine.

379
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,719
I'm gonna become a deliveryman.

380
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,181
Oh, is that right?

381
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,184
Yes, I really, really want to.

382
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,645
I'll help the refugees,

383
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,940
like 5-8 does,

384
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,234
and give them oxygen and food.

385
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:57,155
That way I'll become
the refugees beacon of hope,

386
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,074
just like 5-8.

387
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,959
Hey, old man.

388
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,716
They suppressed
the armed protest at District A,

389
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,177
so the mission
to delay the construction failed.

390
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,220
Our informant is out of contact too.

391
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,265
The idiot. Wonder if he died.

392
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,436
The Air Core's in District A now.

393
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,480
I'm gonna need you to go.

394
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,107
Okay.

395
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,497
PROCESSED FOOD

396
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,499
It'll be a bit short this time.

397
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,210
I'll be by again soon.

398
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,628
Thank you so much.

399
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,464
Just when we're about to die,
that's when you guys show up.

400
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,384
I know I say this every time
but split it fairly.

401
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,761
- Okay.
- Here.

402
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,983
Heartbeat and blood pressure
are all normal.

403
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,277
I'll come by again before the delivery.

404
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,487
Thank you.

405
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,738
Here.

406
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,577
Thank you.

407

<i>Challenger,

So strong. My God.

409
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,135
<i>Take a break from losing and eat.</i>

410
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,556
If I eat,
I'm gonna have to take a dump. What then?

411
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,142
<i>Why do you have to be gross?</i>

412
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,643
It's the rebellion of youth.

413
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,812
You sound like a child,
not some kind of rebel.

414
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,067
<i>Deliveryman,
identity confirmed.</i>

415
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,150
A package!

<i>Disinfection complete.</i>

417
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,951
You're not Deliveryman 5-7.

418
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,079
No, he's busy, so I'm here today.

419
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:34,954
Oh.

<i>- Ms. Jung Seul-ah...</i>
- Wait. Oh my God.

What is it?

422
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,758
Are you the famous 5-8?

423
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,260
- Yes.
- No way!

424
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,344
Wow.

425
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,430
Wow, that's totally...

426
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,724
Could I get a picture with you? That okay?

427
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,809
What's going on?

00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,610
- Why am I hiding?
<i>- Thank you!</i>

432
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,946
<i>I should get going.</i>
I did nothing wrong.

00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:40,771
"Just one more, please."

"Goodbye now."

00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,203
He's much more handsome

<i>Oppa,</i> you're done.

Uh, no.

445
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,878
You know his looks aren't even close.

00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,172
Hmm.
