1
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,432
Cheonmyeong's power started
from oxygen.

2
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,601
If the air gets cleaner,
they will lose everything.

3
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,024
<i>Noona.</i>

4
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,078
You sure they're polluting the air
on purpose?

5
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,406
I measured it myself.

6
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,200
CEO RYU SEOK OFF-SITE SCHEDULE

7
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,577
What'll you do now?

8
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,545
<i>Air purification...</i>

9
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,883
Are the physical examinations
going well?

10
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:53,094
Yes, but more of them are getting exams
without problems,

11
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,555
which makes it a bit more popular
as we proceed.

12
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,895
VACCINATION COMPLETE

13
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,154
<i>Gonna be rough from here on out,</i>

14
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,198
<i>so you do what you feel is right.</i>

15
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,811
Gotcha.

16
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:46,981
Drop the gun.

17
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,985
I think you should drop the gun.

18
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,288
Here, this way, this way!
This way, here! Over here!

19
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,290
Protect him, quick!

20
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,377
This way!

21
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,629
This way, sir!

22
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,386
Mr. Oh betrayed us.
I'm heading down.

23
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,888
This way! Find the shooter!

24
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,697
I'll get Ryu Seok! Cover me!

25
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:37,258
BLACK KNIGHT

26
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,017
The kidnappings,
the explosions at the Refugee District,

27
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,436
the truth
behind the air purification vehicles.

28
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,563
In all of this,
Cheonmyeong's been involved.

29
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,984
So should I take care
of all of this privately?

30
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,404
You know I'm a soldier.

31
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,492
I'll solve the case based on
the concrete evidence we discover.

32
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,333
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON RYU SEOK
SUSPECT: 5-8

33
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,172
Our deliverymen?

34
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,550
So the guy shooting at me
and destroying my stations

35
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,845
is one of Cheonmyeong's deliverymen?

36
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,763
Yes.

37
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,515
The explosions and bus hijackings

38
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,226
have been planned out
by our deliverymen, sir.

39
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,729
There is a secret organization
among the deliverymen,

40
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,439
and the mutant is in it.

41
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,066
He's part of that group, sir.

42
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,241
Those bastards get to breathe
because Cheonmyeong allows it.

43
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,828
And they think
that they're superheros, or something?

44
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,544
Chairman Ryu
now knows the truth,

45
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,067
He's meeting the president tomorrow.

46
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:00,300
So we just hide in our little holes now
until they figure something out?

47
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,136
And what? Cover up the truth?

48
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,763
Even if Ryu Seok's
out of the picture, what changes?

49
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,974
If you keep all of this up,

50
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,727
you might just bring about
uncontrollable chaos.

51
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:16,065
Preventing chaos sounds
like Ryu Seok's logic.

52
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,192
Refugees getting massacred,

53
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,529
the complete breakdown of the atmosphere.

54
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,159
Has Cheonmyeong's order
brainwashed you a little, Major?

55
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,631
Everything
will be resolved tomorrow.

56
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,799
Be careful.

57
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,592
Okay.

58
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,186
<i>If Chairman Ryu knows,
isn't that it for Ryu Seok?</i>

59
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,146
Yeah, that's what the major thinks.

60
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,231
I think it's worth trusting.

61
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,442
If we wait another day, we'll know more.

62
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,402
I agree. Let's wait.

63
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,404
We'll split up for now.

64
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,975
Dammit! Those sneaky sons of bitches!

65
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,896
<i>Kill your GPS
and stand by in the Refugee Districts.</i>

66
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,609
These are not deliverymen,

67
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,946
they're terrorists who put our company
and our way of life in jeopardy.

68
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,867
You may shoot to kill
starting immediately, understood?

69
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,912
All except for the mutant.
I want him alive.

70
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,122
Yes, sir.

71
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,853
GENERAL DISTRICT 2-4

72
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,445
So there was a reason you were all dying.

73
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,720
So how are you?

74
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,765
Well, just been getting old.

75
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,851
You've aged well.

76
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:01,355
I would rather stay up here
on the surface and suffer a little bit

77
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,941
than have to move underground
just for air.

78
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,820
Took me five more years
to complete building the Air Core

79
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:08,904
without you there,

80
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,241
which also delayed
the construction of District A.

81
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:18,080
If I had been there,
I'd have blown up the Air Core.

82
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,170
Hey, why did you have to raise
such an awful son?

83
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:27,131
Son takes after the father,
that's the way it is.

84
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,550
This is my burden in life.

85
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,850
The soil is coming back to life
more and more the further south you go.

86
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,228
I heard the air is getting cleaner too.

87
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:41,938
To hell with District A.

88
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,232
What about leaving the Air Core
and coming back out?

89
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,526
It's still a possibility.

90
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,615
Yes, I have to finish this.

91
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,010
I'm a cleaner, and you're a deliveryman,
so why am I delivering things, huh?

92
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,846
You know that I got let go.

93
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,601
This is the government's Refugee
Reassignment Plan revised by Ryu Seok.

94
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,938
The physical examination is proceeding
according to the revised plan.

95
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,481
It'll be different this time.

96
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,774
And you're sure, right?

97
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,110
Gotta see it to believe it,
or what is this?

98
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,947
You gonna be all paranoid
like that forever?

99
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,284
I'll be less paranoid when the refugees
are in General Districts.

100
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,981
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION COMPLETE
VACCINATION COMPLETE

101
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,941
CHAIRMAN, CHEONMYEONG GROUP
RYU JAE-JIN

102
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,110
PRESIDENT, REPUBLIC OF KOREA
CHAE JIN-GYEONG

103
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,613
<i>The relocation plan led
by the government</i>

104
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,656
<i>will include you, the refugees.</i>

105
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,283
<i>You will be given relocation rights</i>

106
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,410
<i>that will allow you to live
in General Districts.</i>

107
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,996
JOINT AGREEMENT, CHEONMYEONG
WILL ENTRUST TO THE GOVERNMENT

108
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,874
THE RIGHTS TO OXYGEN SUPPLY,
DELIVERY SYSTEM, AND RELOCATION PLAN

109
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,089
I'm very sorry about your son.

110
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,426
I feel as though I'm handing you,
Madam President,

111
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,012
a great burden to carry now.

112
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,149
I never would've thought
you'd do something like this.

113
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:53,653
The chairman will be giving a statement
about the agreement soon.

114
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,655
I'm gonna miss seeing you around.

115
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,281
Hold on a minute...

116
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,950
You can talk with the defense minister.

117
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,453
You better be going.

118
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,386
The oxygen and delivery system
are the heart of Cheonmyeong.

119
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,887
Why are you giving it away?

120
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:24,100
It was my goal to create these things
to save people, not to kill them.

121
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,643
What?

122
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,478
I know about what you've done.

123
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,980
You did this.
You made your bed, now lie in it.

124
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,151
There's still time to save this, okay?

125
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,153
But admitting this destroys me.

126
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,155
I am not losing Cheonmyeong this way!

127
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,158
You can't because it was never yours
in the first place.

128
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,328
Oh, Father.

129
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:55,548
Now it's time to take responsibility
for everything you've done.

130
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,094
Mr. Ryu, you're being placed under arrest
for violating the law.

131
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,223
What?

132
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,686
Arresting me?

133
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:24,994
What have you done?

134
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,293
Why?

135
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,548
I'm sorry, did that surprise you?

136
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,011
You know I blew up hundreds of refugees.

137
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,679
This shouldn't surprise you.

138
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,283
Take care of your burden right now,
don't put it off on someone else.

139
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,996
Your problem
is not knowing when to stop.

140
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,249
Then make me stop, old man.
Do it! Kill me!

141
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,544
You think
I can't pull this trigger right now?

142
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:47,910
Oh, Father.

143
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,456
Mr. Ryu...

144
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,631
the last step of the plan is the coup.

145
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,467
We'll capture the president first.

146
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,872
GENERAL DISTRICTS
REFUGEE REASSIGNMENT PLAN

147
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,797
What's that?

148
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,758
The Refugee Reassignment Plans.

149
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,427
- Oh.
- Not sure I trust it.

150
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,346
I think you should believe it this time.

151
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,975
Yesterday Chairman Ryu came by.

152
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,980
He personally promised
we'll go to the General Districts.

153
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,608
- He was here?
- The announcement will be made soon.

154
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,245
Sir, uh...

155
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,455
Huh?

156
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:22,795
<i>I, Ryu Seok,</i>

157
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,634
<i>will carry on
the late Chairman Ryu's will</i>

158
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,136
<i>and lead Cheonmyeong</i>

159
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,931
<i>with dedication and devotion.</i>

160
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:37,728
All high-ranking officers are summoned
to the defense minister's office.

161
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,606
What?

162
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,233
<i>I also promise
to arrest every one of the deliverymen.</i>

163
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,152
Are they attempting to stage a coup?

164
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,696
<i>They're disrupting our citizen's safety,</i>

165
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,866
<i>they're destroying facilities
and attempting assassinations</i>

166
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,577
<i>alongside the Defense Ministry,
and are considered terrorists.</i>

167
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,955
All deliveries will be halted

168
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,167
until every terrorist has been arrested.

169
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,212
<i>We ask for your understanding</i>...

170
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,757
<i>...in dealing
with this troubling situation.</i>

171
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,886
We've got one option...

172
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,808
go to the Core District immediately.

173
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,403
The Core District's blueprint.

174
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,155
Chairman Ryu and I created it.

175
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,868
I always hoped I'd never have to use it.

176
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,331
Thank you for it.

177
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,377
<i>These are wanted terrorists.</i>

178
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,422
<i>Deliveries to all districts
will be completely halted</i>

179
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,882
<i>until all 12 deliverymen
have been arrested.</i>

180
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,434
CHEONMYEONG LOGISTICS

181
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:11,822
<i>Cheonmyeong Group and the government
will send supplies to each district.</i>

182
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,241
<i>Please check when and where
the supplies will be delivered.</i>

183
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,537
<i>We ask for your full cooperation
in order to minimize any confusion.</i>

184
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,396
Right here.

185
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,987
<i>We ask that all refugees
at the Physical Examination Center</i>

186
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,405
<i>for the relocation plan</i>

187
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,450
<i>stand in line to register
your personal information first.</i>

188
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,913
<i>The comprehensive vaccine was created
by Cheonmyeong Pharmaceuticals</i>

189
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,957
<i>in consideration
of the weakened immune system</i>

190
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,458
<i>and health of refugees.</i>

191
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,795
<i>The vaccine has undergone a thorough range
of clinical trials and tests</i>

192
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,672
<i>to prove its safety and efficacy.</i>

193
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,299
It's about time they start dying, right?

194
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:59,012
Yes, sir. Should be taking effect now
that we've passed the incubation stage.

195
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,236
What in the world is going on?

196
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,238
It seems to be a contagion.

197
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,490
We're moving
to the General Districts soon.

198
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,076
It's awful
right before getting out of here.

199
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,036
A contagion?

200
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,790
Useless,

201
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,751
it... it's the physical examination!

202
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,335
What?

203
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,507
Huh?

204
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,968
- Oh my God.
- What?

205
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,345
The dummys went
to get their physical exam.

206
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,429
Huh?

207
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,047
Sir, what is it? What's the matter?

208
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,636
Uh, don't do the physical examination...

209
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,638
Don't let them do
the physical exam on you.

210
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,557
If they give you the vaccine,

211
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,141
you will die!

212
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,863
4-1: THE VACCINE WILL KILL YOU

213
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,533
Dammit!

214
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,702
<i>We have to stop it,
whatever it takes.</i>

215
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,089
Wow,
so all you need to do is get a shot?

216
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,174
Just a little prick
and that's it, right?

217
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,093
Everyone, wait! Stop!

218
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,719
You can't go in there!

219
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,305
- You'll die if you get the shot!
- Who are you?

220
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,642
You'll die if you get the shot!
I've checked!

221
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,060
Dummy, Dumb-dumb!

222
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,104
You guys, get out of there right now!

223
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,064
Huh? What's with him?

224
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,483
Everybody,
get out of there!

225
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,736
- Useless!
- Useless!

226
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,737
Don't move!

227
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,239
Whoa, whoa!

228
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,783
<i>I'm at the physical exam center.</i>

229
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:25,866
<i>I'll get started.</i>

230
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,020
<i>Terrorists are appearing
at physical examination centers</i>

231
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,396
<i>around the districts.</i>

232
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,356
<i>Heighten security and kill on sight.</i>

233
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:57,983
Don't move!

234
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,569
Who are you? Identify yourself!

235
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,155
What? Why is he there?

236
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,116
Shit!

237
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,237
Don't come over here!

238
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,200
Stop! Don't...

239
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,670
Useless.

240
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,422
Useless.

241
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,134
Useless!

242
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,220
Useless!

243
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,517
No.

244
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,312
Go. Run away.

245
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,607
Don't let them capture you, okay?

246
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,943
Hey, U...

247
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,861
Useless!

248
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,570
Run...

249
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:28,781
Useless.

250
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,199
Useless!

251
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,577
Useless! Oh, God!

252
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,038
Useless, no!

253
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,123
Useless.

254
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,584
Useless!

255
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,510
- Sa-wol!
- Useless!

256
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,429
- Yoon Sa-wol!
- Useless!

257
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,609
The mutant deliveryman's been arrested.

258
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,653
He'll be sent here.

259
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:07,737
Good.

260
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,073
The vaccine plan has failed
due to the attack

261
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,534
on the physical examination centers.

262
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,743
Minister.

263
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,832
Let's just wipe them all out.

264
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,835
It'd be easier that way.

265
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,799
Major...

266
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,304
they've just arrested your brother.

267
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,472
Sa-wol?

268
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,307
They're transporting him
to Cheonmyeong now.

269
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,390
Cheonmyeong?

270
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,727
Just give us the order, Major.

271
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,315
We're ready to move out.

272
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,901
No orders, but...

273
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,570
there is one thing.

274
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,003
Good luck, my friends.

275
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:06,838
Just be careful.

276
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,550
Who's there?

277
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,901
Did you hear about Yoon Sa-wol?

278
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:31,404
Yes, he should be
at Cheonmyeong's office by now.

279
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,198
We're going to get him back.

280
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,158
We're headed
to the same destination.

281
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,577
I'll show you the way.

282
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,387
<i>Did you help me
because I'm a mutant?</i>

283
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,307
<i>No, I did it because you were
an immature refugee kid</i>

284
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,100
<i>who didn't know what the world was like.</i>

285
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,227
<i>What does that mean?</i>

286
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:50,942
<i>You asked what was different about
the Special District residents, right?</i>

287
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,902
<i>You said they were born there.</i>

288
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:03,413
<i>So what do you think about people
who live and die miserably</i>

289
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,415
<i>just because they're refugees?</i>

290
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,251
<i>Refugees are people too.
They live and breathe.</i>

291
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,419
<i>That's unfair.</i>

292
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:15,050
<i>Cheonmyeong wants anyone born
as a refugee to die.</i>

293
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,177
<i>That's how it's gone so far,</i>

294
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,720
<i>and will continue to go.</i>

295
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,520
<i>That is the world you're living in now.</i>

296
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,650
<i>We're attempting to change that.</i>

297
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,988
<i>There's only one way
into the Core District.</i>

298
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:17,899
We'll go to the president.

299
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:48,137
It's a direct transfusion,
so there may be side effects.

300
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,764
How are you feeling?

301
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,058
A little bit weird, yeah.

302
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:53,935
It's mutant blood.

303
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,751
- Sir.
- What is it?

304
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,044
Have a look.

305
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:41,107
I think it'd be safest
to stay here for now, sir.

306
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,692
What are they doing?

307
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,068
Where's Mr. Oh?

308
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,531
Crashed down through the sky?

309
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,538
What just happened?

310
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,168
Who's there?

311
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,587
Who do you think?
I'm the deliveryman here to get you.

312
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,436
<i>Initiating
emergency power system.</i>

313
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,402
How does this make any sense?

314
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,072
They must've found a blueprint.

315
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,866
They've cut off the main line
to the Core District.

316
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,870
Get me Defense.

317
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,830
<i>He's with the president now.</i>

318
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,641
Gun.

319
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,005
Who do you think it is?

320
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,466
I'm looking forward
to seeing who it is as well.

321
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,280
Minister,

322
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,199
you're under arrest for treason.

323
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,139
<i>This is Major Jung Seol-ah
of the Defense Intelligence Command!</i>

324
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,433
<i>The defense minister
has been placed under arrest.</i>

325
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:06,229
<i>Insurgents,
drop your weapons and surrender.</i>

326
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,402
I repeat.
The defense minister is under arrest.

327
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,322
Insurgents,
drop your weapons and surrender.

328
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,703
This is not how everything ends.

329
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:50,064
<i>Air Core energy overloading.</i>

330
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,993
<i>Air Core energy overloading.</i>

331
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,620
<i>Evacuate. Air Core energy...</i>

332
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,218
Come out here!

333
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,848
Isn't the brat important to you as well?

334
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,645
Yes, he is.

335
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,868
Killing yourself is the best you got?

336
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,496
I'm not letting
the refugee, vermin scum have this.

337
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,624
I'll decide how to end things.

338
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,043
You massacred the refugees,

339
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,420
you polluted the atmosphere,

340
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,798
you conducted experiments on kids.

341
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,220
Your death won't bring forgiveness.

342
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,306
I'm not looking for forgiveness from you,

343
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,808
5-8.

344
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,895
It's impossible to satisfy everybody.

345
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,398
But I had a job to do.

346
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,414
<i>Unable
to control energy supply.</i>

347
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,632
It's all over.

348
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,437
You don't get to decide that.

349
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,858
<i>Unable
to control energy supply.</i>

350
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,527
<i>Emergency evacuation.</i>

351
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,445
<i>The Air Core will explode.</i>

352
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,802
<i>The construction of District A
is now complete</i>

353
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,678
<i>and we will begin relocation.</i>

354
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,640
Refugees will be relocated in order

355
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,683
according to the date
on their registration.

356
00:39:55,601 --> 00:40:00,439
<i>And the government will do its best to
facilitate a safe and speedy relocation.</i>

357
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,234
<i>The government will also remove
the status system</i>

358
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:07,321
<i>classifying people into refugee,
general, special, and core citizens,</i>

359
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,658
<i>and reform the residential
and oxygen supply system.</i>

360
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,201
<i>We will never cease working</i>

361
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:17,289
<i>to ensure that every Korean citizen
can live equally without discrimination.</i>

362
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:54,243
THREE MONTHS LATER

363
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,053
<i>Disinfection complete.</i>

364
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,640
Ugh! Why are you so late?

365
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,605
When am I allowed
to go back to work already?

366
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,524
It's imprisonment.
I'm going crazy in here.

367
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,526
You complain a lot.

368
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,404
You still got more to learn.

369
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,658
Shouldn't you check ID?

370
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,537
Oh, right.

371
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,256
Doesn't the air feel cleaner?

372
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:59,183
Sky's getting much clearer as well.

373
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:58,320
