1
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:18,935
<i>Vehicle One, Joo Gyeong-nam,
advances to the final round.</i>

2
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,605
<i>Participant Number Eight,
Refugee 034, is currently in second.</i>

3
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,108
Don't think, don't think, don't think.

4
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,444
Think, think, think.

5
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,324
Let's go!

6
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,127
Idiot.

7
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,681
Get in! Quick!

8
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,895
Thanks.

9
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,036
So now two people
are tied for second here?

10
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,872
Uh, I guess so.

11
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,209
FINISH LINE

12
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,795
<i>Vehicle Three, Hyeon Su
and Refugee 034,</i>

13
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,379
<i>have crossed the finish line.</i>

14
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:43,770
CHEONMYEONG GROUP

15
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:45,938
Good work.

16
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,566
Vehicle Three, Hyeon Su,

17
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,069
you came in second
and will advance to the final round.

18
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,029
What about me?

19
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,513
I crossed the finish line with her.

20
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,449
Participant Eight,
you were disqualified.

21
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,368
What do you mean?
We crossed together.

22
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,285
I brought this.

23
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,663
You lost your car,
and your package was damaged.

24
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,124
- Both grounds for disqualification.
- What?

25
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,836
<i>Vehicle Three, Hyeon Su,</i>

26
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,797
<i>came in second
and will advance to the final round.</i>

27
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,634
<i>Vehicle Three, Hyeon Su, came in second
and will advance to the final round.</i>

28
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,122
We have a problem with the final round.

29
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,375
Seems Participant Number Three is out
due to an arm injury.

30
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,340
- Did you investigate?
- Yes. Your guess was correct.

31
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:55,967
She broke her arm.

32
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,930
Okay. Who goes to the final?

33
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,727
The eliminated refugee or fourth place?

34
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,854
We'll set the atmosphere.

35
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,025
The deliverymen
who observed the competition think

36
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,735
that we should advance the refugee boy.

37
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:14,903
Oh yeah?

38
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,198
Because he saved someone's life?

39
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,870
REFUGEE 034
MUSCLE MASS: MAX, BMI: MAX

40
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:32,170
"The refugee participant who saved a life
and crossed the finish line with her."

41
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,756
It will give some hope to the refugees,

42
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,884
and then our plan will be easier.

43
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,611
The weather's just like me,
lousy.

44
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,910
Huh?

45
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:11,918
What is that?

46
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,592
Hey, losers!

47
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,598
Who are you calling "losers"
Not me, surely, right?

48
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,350
I advance to the final.

49
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,018
REFUGEE O34

50
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,524
- Really?
- For real?

51
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,608
Yeah, for real! Duh!

52
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,027
How did you do that?
Someone end up dropping out?

53
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,529
Who? How did you know?

54
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,197
- So, yeah?
- Did they?

55
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,374
Here are the numbers, genders,
age groups, and average oxygen consumption

56
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,251
of the residents in each district.

57
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,336
I'll start
with the General District first.

58
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,673
We have plenty of data like this
at Cheonmyeong Group.

59
00:04:58,756 --> 00:04:59,756
This isn't new.

60
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,262
Mr. Ryu didn't come all the way here
for something so obvious.

61
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,184
So what exactly can we help with?

62
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,395
Well, I believe we've indicated that...

63
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,563
Mr. Oh.

64
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,192
You provided some basic data points.

65
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,279
In order to reassign residents,
I'll be needing something more.

66
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,530
Something like

67
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,075
personal data on all residents.

68
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,078
I want to know physical fitness,
IQ numbers.

69
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,081
I want medical records,
I want past criminal offenses.

70
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,085
Is that too much for me to ask here?

71
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,839
Providing data of that sort could be
considered a violation of human rights.

72
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,842
It requires proper authorization.

73
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,095
Well, I'm certain the defense minister
has done just that.

74
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,598
Grade One data requires official approval.

75
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:56,230
Major, do you disagree
with Cheonmyeong's relocation plan?

76
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,650
I'm a soldier above all.

77
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,487
I don't have opinions.

78
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,672
<i>Special District working hours
are now over.</i>

79
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,674
<i>Controlling oxygen level.</i>

80
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,058
I haven't ordered anything.

81
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,898
It's a special delivery.

82
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,778
Yes. I'll get it done
as quickly as possible, sir.

83
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,912
You've mentioned a fair relocation,
mind elaborating?

84
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,875
Well, we'll have a selection process
for the new environment.

85
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,335
"Selection process?"

86
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,046
Sounds like controlling residents
using relocation rights.

87
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,630
Controlling?

88
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,301
That's a fitting word.

89
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,847
Shouldn't people pay a price
for a better life?

90
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,600
I think a bigger issue would be if
everyone took what we've done for granted.

91
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,521
Don't you agree with me?

92
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,732
A selection cannot possibly reflect
any level of fairness,

93
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,860
no matter the criteria you may employ.

94
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,737
That's why your help is greatly needed.

95
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,491
So we can do our best to be fair,
all right, Major?

96
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,166
Let's have the next briefing
at Cheonmyeong.

97
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,718
Ooh.

98
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,224
Ryu spoke
to the Intelligence Command major.

99
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:01,439
So the relocation plan's now
in Cheonmyeong's control?

100
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,275
Well, the chairman's backing
the government's relocation plan,

101
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,068
which includes the refugees.

102
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,905
This is pitting father against son,
so to speak.

103
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,784
I don't trust Chairman Ryu either,
to be honest.

104
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,996
Nine years ago
he massacred all of those refugees.

105
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,000
So what if the man's sorry,
it won't bring them back.

106
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,835
I'm not telling you to let it go.

107
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,547
I'm just saying the bigger enemy
is his son, Ryu Seok.

108
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,382
Right now, he's the one holding the reins.

109
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,554
The dad's with the president,

110
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,057
the son's with the defense minister.

111
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,688
They'll choose
what they feel suits their goals.

112
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,484
Did you look into
what I asked you about?

113
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,904
There are no human experiment labs
in the Special District.

114
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,155
There's only a hospital.

115
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,450
If there were, the cleaning vehicle
would have gone there.

116
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:08,422
Why are they demanding people's
personal information and bio data too?

117
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,222
They're trying to build Cheonmyeong's
new world

118
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,678
with people with the most superior genes.

119
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,850
I'm stuck between Cheonmyeong
and the government now.

120
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,435
If that's what's happening,

121
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,564
I think you should try
to remain neutral in this.

122
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,415
<i>Everyone's in position.</i>

123
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,004
Start when I give the signal.

124
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,087
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

125
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,599
<i>Begin.</i>

126
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,193
All right. Looks good, huh?

127
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,195
Confirmed.

128
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,115
Keep an eye on him
from your positions.

129
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,916
- Come back again.
- See you next time!

130
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,422
He's heading your way.

131
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,136
Lee,
take position on the opposite side.

132
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,262
The rest, back him up.

133
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,347
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

134
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,541
He's onto us. The western alley!

135
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,175
Lee,
what's your current location?

136
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,760
Heading to the end of the alley!

137
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,679
He went into the building.

138
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,138
Sweep the area.

139
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,396
Drop your gun.

140
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,375
Are you a soldier?

141
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,210
If you wanna be precise,

142
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:52,670
soldiers.

143
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,046
Hands in the air.

144
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,716
Drop your gun.

145
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,344
Drop your gun and get on the ground.

146
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,367
<i>I saw the man die.</i>

147
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,746
A tiny device had exploded
inside of his head.

148
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,630
Can this be fixed?

149
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,804
So why do you want to become
a deliveryman?

150
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,430
Well,

151
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,140
you know...

152
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,437
I can't stay here
and keep wasting precious air and food.

153
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,563
Don't say that.

154
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,940
Feeding you really is no trouble at all.

155
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,276
Is it your friend,

156
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,653
the one in the necklace?

157
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:09,996
Mm-hmm.

158
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,045
If it's really what you want,
I'll root for you.

159
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,882
You made it this far, go ahead and win it!

160
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,197
Huh?

161
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,366
Yoon Sa-wol,
the dumbass, in the final round.

162
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,410
Guess I underestimated you.

163
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,457
What about those guys?
You catch them?

164
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,417
Not yet.

165
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:39,961
Your memories?

166
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,381
Not yet.

167
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,800
<i>We are now
at Special District, first floor.</i>

168
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,052
Whether you win or lose,
remember to stay safe.

169
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,637
Was that encouragement?

170
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,139
Of course.

171
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,782
<i>Today's Special District
air quality.</i>

172
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,327
<i>Oxygen level is at five percent.</i>

173
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,495
<i>Fine dust level is average.</i>

174
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,414
<i>Humidity is at 52%.</i>

175
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,332
Wow.

176
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,917
<i>The temperature is...</i>

177
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,585
This place is awesome.

178
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,130
The refugee participant will stay
in temporary lodging

179
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,381
until the competition.

180
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,635
There is one rule.

181
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,388
You may not leave your lodgings
unless accompanied by your mentor.

182
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:32,889
Mentor?

183
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,600
What's a mentor?

184
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,562
The one behind you is your mentor.

185
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,524
Ohh.

186
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,193
So your name's Mentor?

187
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,072
Yeah. My name's Mentor.

188
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,038
JOO GYEONG-NAM VS REFUGEE 034

189
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,920
JOO GYEONG-NAM

190
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,840
REFUGEE 034

191
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,852
JOO GYEONG-NAM
SECOND ROUND WINNER

192
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,473
REFUGEE 034
FINALIST BY DEFAULT

193
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,280
Well, it looks like they're all focused
on the refugee boy, as expected.

194
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,075
Of course. Especially since
we sent him to the finals.

195
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,077
What happens now is more important.

196
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,160
Yes, sir.

197
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,373
This Deliveryman competition
that you planned is,

198
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,083
I mean, it's nothing short of brilliant.

199
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,710
From this point on,

200
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,255
I'd like you to come up
with these brilliant plans.

201
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,590
Yes, sir. I'll try my best.

202
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,313
We got a tip that a generating unit
is being sent to District A.

203
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,487
Once we hear from 6-3, we'll head out.

204
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,213
What the...?

205
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,058
Fricking crazy refugee bastard.
I should run him over.

206
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,943
Where are we moving it?

207
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,154
We're not moving it, we're destroying it.

208
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,541
WAITING FOR SIGNAL

209
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,397
Uh, um, sir.

210
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,653
District A operation test
has a little setback.

211
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:33,904
What?

212
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,740
The generating unit
was apparently blown up by somebody.

213
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,911
Blown up?

214
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,746
Sir, I'm sorry, uh...

215
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,164
Our men are investigating.

216
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,584
Mr. Oh.

217
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,630
You imbecile!

218
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,912
How are you feeling?

219
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,536
Who came up with all this?

220
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,587
A place where people live this nice
and eat food this good every day.

221
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,590
Who designed this?

222
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,009
Not my idea.

223
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,552
Are they special here?

224
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,720
They were born here.

225
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,764
That makes no sense, though.

226
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,311
Why is being a deliveryman important
to you?

227
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,438
Well...

228
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,899
If you win,
there will be no more hiding for you.

229
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,651
No more worrying
about getting food and air, right?

230
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,946
- Right.
- And what of your friends?

231
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,572
My friends?

232
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:00,949
- Hey!
- Let's go!

233
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,285
We're future deliverymen!

234
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,245
- Look at the oxygen and masks!
- Good.

235
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,831
They'll ask you the same questions.

236
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,210
"Who decided all this?
If you're different than they are?"

237
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,475
The finals are the only thing
you should think about.

238
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,478
Where are you going?

239
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,021
What's my job here?

240
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,273
Deliveryman.

241
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,359
That's right, and I gotta do my job.

242
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,406
I've heard you asked Intelligence Command
for personal information and bio-data.

243
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,532
I have, yes.

244
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,909
Are you leaving out people
who are inferior?

245
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,328
We can't accommodate everyone
in the relocation plan.

246
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,248
We'll need to make the same choice
that you made.

247
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,500
This choice you're referring to,

248
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,962
do you have any idea
what kind of impact it has?

249
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,673
Those who came here
were 1% of the population.

250
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,384
Ninety-nine percent were abandoned.

251
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,052
Yes, I'm aware.

252
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,556
However, the relocation plan is up to us.

253
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,560
The decision that pained you so much
will be in my hands.

254
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,563
No, the government
will lead the relocation plan.

255
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,648
Every person with a pulse is included,

256
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,317
refugees too, no matter what.

257
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,570
No, Father,
we can't have refugees. Impossible!

258
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,822
The oxygen need...
there would be too much to produce.

259
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,241
Only more oxygen masks
will need to be produced.

260
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,826
You can't be serious!

261
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:12,099
DANGER, OVERSUPPLY OF OXYGEN

262
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,276
Useless vermin.

263
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,408
<i>You take after me way too much.</i>

264
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,077
What do you expect?
I am your son, you know?

265
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,870
And that there is the issue.

266
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,498
That I can see myself in you.

267
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,377
<i>If you don't like
that I take after you,</i>

268
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,089
<i>then I'll show you a different me.</i>

269
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,722
This is your opponent tomorrow.

270
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,767
Joo Gyeong-nam is
the strongest candidate we've seen so far.

271
00:23:56,268 --> 00:24:00,272
He's got a great physique.
Speed, strength, amazing technique too.

272
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,065
He's good all around.

273
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,277
Stronger than 5-8?

274
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,778
No one's stronger than he is.

275
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,864
Why do you think he's a legend?

276
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,575
I might have a chance, then.

277
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,163
Do you even know what your strength is?

278
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,622
What is it?

279
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,459
It's your blind confidence.

280
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,545
Is that a good thing?

281
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,299
Why do I bother?

282
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,343
Just watch.

283
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:49,654
They're sending five broadcast trucks
to the Refugee District.

284
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,158
Cheonmyeong's guys are out patrolling.
People are getting nervous.

285
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,910
They're gonna show the finals live?

286
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,163
JOO GYEONG-NAM VS REFUGEE 034

287
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,084
I think they're doing it
because he's a refugee kid, you know?

288
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,920
Did they show it live when we won?

289
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,088
- Nope.
- They didn't.

290
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,258
This all started after 5-7 died.

291
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,054
Once we're done with work today,
let's visit each district to make sure.

292
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,305
- Okay.
- Okay.

293
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,479
Are you gonna watch it in person?

294
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,980
After my deliveries.

295
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,203
Guys, turn it a little to the left, okay?

296
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:41,456
Hey, is this way to the left?

297
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,459
No.
Trust me, it's the other way, you idiot.

298
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,588
No, I'm asking
if it's our left or if it's his left.

299
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,799
Uh, why don't we just ask him?

300
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,383
Oh, right.

301
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,470
Hey, Gramps

302
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,265
do you mean our left?

303
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,892
<i>Hey, it's your left, right?</i>

304
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,938
Guys, just turn to whichever side.

305
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,315
Just turn it until I say it's good, okay?

306
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,775
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Okay.

307
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,486
All right, this way.

308
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,198
Hey, is this right?

309
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,493
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You got it, you got it!

310
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,619
Stop! We have a signal!

311
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,538
Gramps! Gramps!

312
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,960
People are going wild out there.

313
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,297
<i>There will be a special
live broadcast of the competition</i>

314
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,049
<i>as a refugee participant
has made it to the final round.</i>

315
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,594
They got it up
on a huge screen out there.

316
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,304
There's presents and free stuff.

317
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,888
- Huh? Free stuff?
- Free stuff?

318
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,601
<i>Oh-ho-ho, Cheonmyeong's looking
after the refugees too?</i>

319
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,311
<i>I want presents too!</i>

320
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,565
<i>We'll be giving away
compressed oxygen and food supplies</i>

321
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,483
<i>to people who watch the competition today.</i>

322
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,070
<i>There will be a special live broadcast
of the competition</i>

323
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,157
<i>as a refugee participant
has made it to the final round.</i>

324
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,995
I don't wanna be anywhere
where there's a really big crowd.

325
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,205
Let's watch it here, huh?

326
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,289
Ugh!

327
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,969
<i>We are now at Core District,
5 km underground.</i>

328
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,155
What is this place?

329
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:38,907
The Air Road.

330
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,660
You don't need an oxygen mask
in the Core District

331
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,204
because oxygen circulates
throughout this place.

332
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,804
Where are we?

333
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,854
The air
is completely different here.

334
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,694
It's not a vacation.

335
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:16,903
Stay focused.

336
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,054
Sir, she's here.

337
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,269
Hello, ma'am.

338
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,237
The chairman isn't here.

339
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,488
That's right.

340
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,074
What brings you here?

341
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,910
The relocation plan presentation
is now completed.

342
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,998
That plan's the responsibility
of Cheonmyeong.

343
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,292
I was certain
we had already settled that.

344
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,130
You can't pull off this plan.

345
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,299
I am the president, you know?

346
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,843
And I can do whatever I want.

347
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,936
<i>Did you cross Hannam Bridge?</i>

348
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,564
Crossing over now.
Approaching the delivery center.

349
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,108
Just passed by two black SUVs. Suspicious.

350
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,069
- Why?
<i>- They didn't have license plates</i>.

351
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,988
<i>Headed toward Kyobo Tower intersection.</i>

352
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:45,408
<i>No plates?
Maybe they're the guys with the tattoos.</i>

353
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,327
What if they're going
to kidnap more kids?

354
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,661
<i>I'll go check it out.</i>

355
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,043
Is it you?

356
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,691
Who the hell are you?

357
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:19,776
Me?

358
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,820
A deliveryman.

359
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,529
Who are you?

360
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,195
You're not getting me twice.

361
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:52,327
<i>The final round
of the Deliveryman Selection Competition</i>

362
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,661
will now begin!

363
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,586
<i>A former soldier,</i>

364
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:02,962
Joo Gyeong-nam!

365
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,842
From the Refugee Districts,

366
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,428
Refugee 034!

367
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,065
<i>Each round is five minutes,</i>

368
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,318
<i>and the final victor
will end the competition.</i>

369
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,244
Each round will last five minutes,

370
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,789
and the competition will only end
with a knockout.

371
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,832
Touch gloves.

372
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,098
Fight!

373
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,686
FINAL ROUND
JOO GYEONG-NAM, REFUGEE 034

374
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,888
Hold yourself together!

375
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,056
Get out of there!

376
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,640
Get up!

377
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,240
Stop!

378
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,618
The first round is over.

379
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,417
This is a bit disappointing.

380
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:50,129
You put quite a bit of effort
into a pathetic thing like this.

381
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:53,049
The second round will begin
after a three-minute break.

382
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:58,096
It's the first round.
These boys are just getting started.

383
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,391
Don't let him get to your chin so easily.

384
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,685
Just wanted to feel a few first.

385
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,355
5-8's stronger.

386
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,818
I got this.

387
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,705
Is what you're doing so huge you'll kill
yourselves when things go wrong?

388
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:41,597
REPORT YOUR LOCATION

389
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,270
Yes?

390
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,398
Is the plan proceeding?

391
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,650
Yes, sir. The plan is proceeding.

392
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,469
Fight!

393
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,766
Ugh. Wasn't the first round a total bust?

394
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,018
It's okay.

395
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,188
Just one punch knocks this dude out.

396
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,232
Wanna punch me? Then do it.

397
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,817
What the hell are you saying?

You crazy bastard!

407
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,791
They're broadcasting the final round
in order to lure in the refugees?

408
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,588
Those bastards.

409
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,217
This might be the final round.

410
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,139
- Come here.
- Yes?

411
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,503
I think you should take a look at this.

I'm gonna finish him now.

415
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,802
His pattern's obvious.

416
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:09,888
Good.

417
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,264
Then finish it.

418
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,942
Emergency, everyone.
Get to the closest Refugee District.

419
