1
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,308
Sir...

2
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,643
Keep your head down.

3
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,187
Everything's gonna be okay.

4
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,314
- Let's go.
- Hold on to me.

5
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:28,778
Are you okay? Get up!
Go! Keep going!

6
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,572
Keep going! Come on!

7
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:33,158
<i>The refugee mob
is fighting back hard!</i>

8
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,368
<i>Don't let them gain any ground.
Kill them all!</i>

9
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,801
Don't come out till it's dark,
even if the gunshots stop.

10
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:01,996
Grenade!

11
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,021
CHEONMYEONG MUST BE BROUGHT DOWN

12
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,332
I got the order
to burn them all.

13
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,855
<i>Don't come out till it's dark,
even if the gunshots stop.</i>

14
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:47,287
BLACK KNIGHT

15
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,637
He's making quite the entrance.

16
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,869
Whoa. Thought I was dead meat there.

17
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,176
Did you wanna die today?

18
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,259
I did.

19
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,471
Not anymore, though.

20
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,479
Gonna do this.

21
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,357
And I've got a reason to do it.

22
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,983
Just tell me how I can win.

23
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,860
I don't care what reason you have.

24
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,904
Telling you won't help much either.

25
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,788
I abhor rudeness.

26
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,043
You got me out of there.

27
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,670
You saved me! Why'd you do that, huh?

28
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,223
How's your head? Your memory back?

29
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,510
You're my only option to win.

30
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,853
- Why?
- You're the strongest there is.

31
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,521
Please.

32
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,958
Prove yourself worthy.

33
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,676
10:00, NOVEMBER 21

34
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:17,103
<i>But, Unni, uh,
I actually think he could do it.</i>

35
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,230
I've seen him fight a few times.

36
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,441
He's definitely much stronger
than he was...

37
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,885
How many people do you think died?

38
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,261
Thousands.

39
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,347
We thought that we were just resisting,

40
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,768
but Cheonmyeong,
they thought that it was a riot.

41
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,937
Do we have to go on living
like this?

42
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,607
What other option do we have?

43
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,527
I will find one...

44
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,407
no matter how long it takes.

45
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,965
Trying to be a deliveryman, huh?

46
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,136
YOU TOO CAN BECOME A LEGEND LIKE 5-8

47
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:39,644
Okay, so the legendary 5-8 is gonna
help you become a deliveryman?

48
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:43,147
No. He said, "Prove yourself worthy."

49
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,066
Yeah, same thing.

50
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,652
- You're always so pessimistic!
- Watch it, man.

51
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,988
- Do you feel confident?
- Well...

52
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,449
whatever it is, I can do it.

53
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,411
I'm also gonna test to see
if 5-8 is the legend that people say.

54
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,915
No, you're the one who's gonna be tested.
Do you even know what the word test means?

55
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,334
Of course I do, moron! It's like an exam.

56
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,629
Wanna be useful, man?

57
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,804
It's not just your future
on the line, it's your life.

58
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,807
Ever heard of passing
through the Gate of Hell?

59
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,226
Gate of Hell?

60
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,399
Ugh. Man, always working late.

61
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,818
I tell them to conserve oxygen,
but they never listen.

62
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,703
Ma'am.

63
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,454
Hmm? You can go.

64
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,498
Uh, may I really?
Because that would be great.

65
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:46,877
Is something going on?

66
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,630
Yes. Tail team has put out
an emergency report.

67
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,714
5-8?

68
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,010
He's been found
outside the General District.

69
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,222
Oh, you're coming with us?

70
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,017
What, think I'm going home?

71
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,899
PHYSICAL TRAINING FACILITY

72
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,835
Is everyone here?

73
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,550
Let's get started.

74
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,642
It's an old training room
for deliverymen.

75
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,936
I saw 11 people enter, including 5-8.

76
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,481
They were all deliverymen
who used to be refugees.

77
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,817
Deliverymen in the 5-8 line.

78
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,321
They're kidnapping children.

79
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,074
Conducting experiments.

80
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,201
Did you say experiments?

81
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,411
So then do you think Cheonmyeong's
behind everything?

82
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,414
- I know they are.
- Why target children of the miners?

83
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,791
'Cause of the mutation.

84
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,210
Is all that stuff
actually real?

85
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,913
ANALYSIS OF THE REFUGEE SURVIVOR

86
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,310
Oh, it's real.

87
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,524
There are over ten deliverymen,
including 5-8.

88
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,984
What if there's a situation?
What if they fight?

89
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,987
Even better.
It'd give us a reason to arrest them.

90
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,991
The bones are metal,
and wounds heal extremely fast.

91
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,493
So it is real.

92
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:46,789
But then, I guess nothing's impossible
with how far the world's gone to hell.

93
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,833
If they really are targeting mutants,

94
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,875
the boy's perfect.

95
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,130
You gonna use him
to find the missing children?

96
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,673
If we have to.

97
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,050
He told 5-8 he wanted to be a deliveryman.

98
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,555
The kid needs me as well.

99
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,786
What brings you all the way here
at this hour?

100
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,587
I felt today was the day
we continue our conversation.

101
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,434
Each of the days the kidnappings happened,

102
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,352
5-7 was on leave.

103
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,939
He must have acted as the key,
as a deliveryman.

104
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,651
We put out a wanted notice,
then he's dead. You know why?

105
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,819
Overworking.

106
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,454
Stop right there.

107
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,334
The higher ups ordered
a private investigation.

108
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,251
Was he murdered?

109
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,337
I'm sorry, information's classified.

110
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,473
CHEONMYEONG LOGISTICS

111
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:31,060
It's the first time a deliveryman's died
from overwork since Earth fell apart.

112
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,143
Yes.

113
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,771
Officially.

114
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,524
You don't believe
the official announcement, Major?

115
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,025
I'm very skeptical.

116
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,320
Still missing the testimony
of the key witness.

117
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,080
5-7 was murdered.

118
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,163
Murdered?

119
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,624
Based on what?

120
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,543
I saw the man die.

121
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,213
A tiny device had exploded
inside of his head.

122
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,092
Were there any...
any clues before this happened?

123
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,390
What'd you say?

124
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,559
Where were they all taken?

125
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,687
The human experiments...

126
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,446
The culprits' tattoo.

127
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,700
On the back of their necks.

128
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,954
Kidnappings are happening
in many other places.

129
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,623
Refugees are being taken too.

130
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,875
Oh my God.

131
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,668
It's happening, Major.

132
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,504
Take care out there.

133
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,962
<i>It says he went
to meet 5-8 like you did,</i>

134
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,714
and saw hell.

135
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,258
The Gate of Hell.

136
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,594
Once you go through that gate,

137
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,054
you become pulp.

138
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,973
They beat you up good
until you lose yourself,

139
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,099
and then never let up.

140
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,727
They beat you up? Really? Everyone?

141
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,395
The guy who wrote that book,

142
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,065
he spent a whole week in a coma.

143
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,818
CHAPTER 3
THE GATES OF HELL

144
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,205
You're the Gate of Hell?

145
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,380
Let's go.

146
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,229
Just you guys?

147
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,856
- Who else do you need?
- I mean...

148
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,193
The Gate of Hell...

149
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,736
People fighting?

150
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,116
Did you read that book

151
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,576
<i>I STAKE MY LIFE </i>or whatever?

152
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,453
Let's start.

153
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,372
I can do it.

154
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,711
If you do it, it might kill him.

155
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,380
I can hold back a bit.

156
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,515
Let's see what you got.

157
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,559
I'm ready.

158
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,025
You're slow.

159
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,157
One, two.

160
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,909
Three, four.

161
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:16,993
Too slow.

162
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,586
Already tired?

163
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:26,712
Not a chance!

164
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,884
Faster.

165
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,725
Let's go.

166
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,612
One, two, three...

167
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,698
...four.

168
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,701
Enough of this. Get serious.

169
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,577
That's what you want?

170
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,130
Did you see my fist?

171
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,549
- No.
- Oh.

172
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,051
So, that's where you're at.

173
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,600
What do you think?

174
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,602
He's not disciplined, he's very slow.

175
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:24,686
Hmm.

176
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,029
Aren't you going?

177
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,656
Should I go

178
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,450
You wanna be a deliveryman, right?

179
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,744
Wouldn't you first have to register?

180
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,873
Uh... oh. Uh-huh.

181
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,543
Use your head and think.

182
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,295
Oh.

183
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,762
What are you drawing?

184
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,061
This doesn't leave the team, okay?

185
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,235
Listen up!

186
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,154
We have new information.

Oh, I'm sorry.

What you up to?

217
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,735
I'm thinking
for the first time in a while.

218
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:03,822
Are you sad that Yoon Sa-wol
is now Refugee 034?

219
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,494
Not exactly sad. It's just that...

220
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,578
Do you know my name?

221
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,374
- 5-8.
- That's right.

222
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,377
I'm 5-8, and she's 4-1.

223
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,881
You're Refugee 034. That's reality.

224
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,507
Oh.

225
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,302
Fine, then.

226
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,056
Now what do I do?

227
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,616
Wait, what's that?

228
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,455
Huh?

229
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:56,833
Do I dodge those?

230
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:58,960
No, you hit them all!

231
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,715
Seriously?

232
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,971
Stop dodging and hit the balls!

233
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,353
Your eyes are as slow as your body is.

234
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,855
What are you even saying right now?

235
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,190
How about you try it?

236
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,526
Man, he really doesn't listen.

237
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,036
Always no shirt.

238
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,376
Fire away.

239
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,173
Whoa.

240
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:53,764
Whoa!

241
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,310
So cool, man! Wow!

242
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,857
Got so much to learn.

243
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,992
<i>The first round of Cheonmyeong
Deliveryman Selection Competition</i>

245
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:16,621
<i>The last participant standing
will make it to the second round.</i>

246
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:21,668
<i>When the round begins,
the oxygen to the rooms will be cut off.</i>

247
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,096
Don't attack for now, just block.

248
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,806
So this is the gang attack.

249
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,019
<i>Oxygen level 100%.</i>

250
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,054
I think he'd be better
if we push him harder.

251
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,556
He's average at best
for a new deliveryman.

252
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,732
Turn it up a notch.

253
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,195
What the...?

254
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,325
<i>Oxygen level 50%</i>.

255
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,993
This is completely insane.

256
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:49,464
Get it together.
Watch the flow of your opponent.

257
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,038
Shit, shit.

258
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,804
Yeah!

259
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,306
A cocky one.

260
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,350
Shoot the balls faster.
Don't they go any faster? It's too easy!

261
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,435
Whoo, whoo!

262
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,057
<i>Oxygen level 5%...</i>

263
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,784
<i>Oxygen level 1%.</i>

264
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,038
<i>Oxygen is being supplied.</i>

265
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,383
<i>The following participants

266
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,595

267

268
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,017
<i>Room Three, Hyeon Su.</i>

269
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,687

273
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,742
<i>Room Eight, Refugee 034.</i>

274
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,248
TEHERAN-RO, 9 P.M.

275
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,211
He passed the first round.

276
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,138
He's my only son,
and they took him right in front of me.

277
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,682
The fact
that they left you behind

278
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,517
means it was your son
who mattered to them.

279
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,853
Well, what... what should I do now?

280
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,522
Right now you need to look
for a guy who has this tattoo

281
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,149
on the back of his neck, all right?

282
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,820
I just need to find someone
who has this tattoo?

283
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,114
Yes.
We'll be the ones to arrest him.

284
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,033
Can I notify other districts?

285
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,367
As many as you can.

286
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,702
Okay, I'll do that.

287
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,292
He has a bad skin condition.

288
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,460
Was he a mine worker?

289
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:59,380
Yes. They took him away
when he was young. Barely escaped

290
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,553
The children of the mines.

291
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,082
Get out.

292
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,419
Everyone, take one.

293
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,763
The destination?

294
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,431
The oxyanium mine.

295
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,810
The work at their district is over,

296
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,812
so they were going there to be killed.

297
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,313
Are you okay?

298
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,774
I volunteered
to be a refugee warden there.

299
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,443
- I'm fine.
- How are things in District A?

300
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,821
I think they're going to test
Air Road operation soon.

301
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,281
We have to delay it.

302
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:10,076
I'm setting things up here and there
for our next move,

303
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,871
but the security's on high alert
after the last one.

304
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,581
We can't fail this time.

305
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,291
We'll look for a way too.

306
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,252
Which one, arm or leg?

307
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,753
What do you mean?

308
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,339
You're going back.
You need at least one bullet in you.

309
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,924
No, leg, leg.

310
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,050
Arm.

311
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,636
Who did this?

312
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,179
<i>We don't know yet, sir.</i>

313
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,983
<i>A warden survived,
so we're questioning him,</i>

314
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,266
<i>but he's out of his mind.</i>

315
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:36,102
How dare they go after
what is Cheonmyeong's.

316
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,772
Let's get the military
and guard team on this.

317
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,190
<i>Of course. Yes...</i>

318
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,196
What is it?

319
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,699
<i>The defense minister's party
is here.</i>

320
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,042
Hello, sir.

321
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,628
Major Jung Seol-ah.

322
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,672
Cheonmyeong Group CEO. Good to meet you.

323
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,592
Major Jung Seol-ah, Intelligence Command.

324
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:11,095
The construction is 90% complete.

325
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,779
We have an agreement with the government

326
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,925
and everything is progressing
under airtight security.

327
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,727
Seems like your security really is tight.

328
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,730
Well, information overload
just leads to chaos.

329
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:23,232
So you're moving District A
over to the Core,

330
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,444
and the Special and General Districts
are each being upgraded by a level?

331
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:31,157
Oh, well, I can see why the minister
thinks so much of you.

332
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,285
Another mass exodus will begin.

333
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:36,871
Cheonmyeong Group,

334
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,501
along with Mr. Ryu,
are doing something extraordinary here.

335
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,544
Why did you ask for me, sir?

336
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,550
I want the files, every district file.

337
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:53,262
A reassignment of residents, Major,
and I want your cooperation.

338
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,186
Reassignments, huh?

339
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,896
That's correct.

340
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,398
There's no pressure.

341
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,900
Just work with Mr. Ryu.

342
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,986
Cooperation.

343
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,029
I look forward to it, Major.

344
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,500
<i>They do not want you</i>

345
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,420
to lead the relocation plan
for District A.

346
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,298
Is it the president?

347
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,302
GOVERNMENT RELOCATION EXECUTION PLAN

348
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,596
The chairman is behind the president.

349
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,558
Cheonmyeong Group must speak as one

350
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,145
if your plan is to be fully realized.

351
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,067
It's always something.

352
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,342
So I passed?

353
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:20,767
Can you even drive?

354
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,518
Drive?

355
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,579
Yeah!

356
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,873
Okay, so he can drive.

357
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,594
In this round,

358
00:34:56,677 --> 00:35:00,932
you must deliver a package
safely across the finish line.

359
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,391
Along the route

360
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:06,979
there are hunters waiting to attack,
each with a special criminal record.

361
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,069
<i>Any hunter who takes your packages</i>

362
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,489
<i>will be released from prison immediately.</i>

363
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,786
Each vehicle is supplied with weapons.

364
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:25,373
You will use them to stop the hunters
attacks and protect the package.

365
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,707
Can we kill them, sir?

366
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,793
Yes, you may.

367
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,213
In this round,
we will advance two participants

368
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,675
who complete the mission,
whose packages have been delivered safely.

369
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:37,885
Then the final round, right?

370
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,804
If you're still alive at that point.

371
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,646
Why did you have us come here?

372
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,607
You're here as observers
to make sure the competition is fair.

373
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,571
Mr. Ryu is here.

374
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,700
Good work, everybody.

375
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,051
<i>The second round
of the Cheonmyeong Deliveryman</i>

376
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,387
<i>Selection Competition will begin.</i>

377
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,930
Man, these are beat up.

378
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,569
What?

379
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:39,572
NUMBER EIGHT
REFUGEE 034

380
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,532
You just drive straight?

381
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,535
<i>The two participants
who make it to the finish line first</i>

382
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,245
