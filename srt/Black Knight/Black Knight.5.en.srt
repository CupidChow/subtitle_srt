00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,146
BLACK KNIGHT

2
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,395
Yes?

3
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,066
Is the plan proceeding?

4
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,443
Yes. Yes, sir. The plan is proceeding.

5
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,591
There were similar explosions
at the other refugee centers too.

6
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,553
Broadcasting the final round
was bait.

7
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,890
I think you should see him.

8
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,559
Yeah.

9
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,648
Tell me who's behind all this,
you bastard.

10
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,785
Tell me, now.

11
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,830
What are you guys planning next?

12
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,551
You bastard, just tell me
how many others are out there.

13
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,848
Nobody knows for sure.

14
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,850
You're psychotic.

15
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,566
It'd be easier to die, right?

16
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,242
I'll do it for you.

17
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,413
DELIVERYMAN RECRUITMENT TOURNAMENT
WINNER

18
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,925
How are you feeling?

19
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,179
You must have known all this,
that I'm a mutant?

20
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,143
We need to leave.

21
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:32,855
You can ask 5-8.

22
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,149
I'm out of it.

23
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,260
<i>5-7,
status registration complete.</i>

24
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,054
That's all I get?

25
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,267
They were trying
to wipe out the refugees.

26
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,812
Everything's clear now.
The refugees aren't part of their plan.

27
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,776
Shouldn't we tell them
and join forces with the refugees?

28
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,528
We can't let it happen again.

29
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,864
It's already happening again.

30
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,117
If we organize, it'll give them an excuse.

31
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,414
We'll move first this time around.

32
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,879
Infiltrate the Core District?

33
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,380
No.

34
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,927
Ryu Seok gets captured.

35
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,517
I've never seen
such a healthy mutant before.

36
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,145
Should we observe the boy
in one of our labs, sir?

37
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,397
Not right now.

38
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,525
We've got too many eyes and ears on us.

39
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,862
We'll take it slow.

40
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,740
I want his test results before we move.

41
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,495
We could recover
from the human experimentation failures.

42
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,140
You're more thrilled than me right now.

43
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,418
All I ever do is worry about you, sir.

44
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,379
Anyway, the refugee removal plan

45
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,840
and the Deliveryman Selection Competition
were a resounding success.

46
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,342
Congratulations, sir.

47
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,057
How bad was it?

48
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
What?

49
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,561
I don't know.

50
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,109
They just turned to ashes before my eyes.

51
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,119
It's okay to mourn a while.

52
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,203
You mourn your loss,

53
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,580
then go around to each district

54
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,375
and tell everybody
they need to be careful for a while.

55
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,836
Do you understand?

56
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,919
Yeah.

57
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,629
All right.

58
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,799
<i>Sa-wol won,</i>

59
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,427
but then it was horrible.

60
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,722
If not for Grandpa...

61
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,643
we could've been killed as well.

62
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,395
You're right.

63
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,941
But what's with that wound
on Sa-wol's forehead?

64
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,027
Pretty sure it was shining, right?

65
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,156
Is Sa-wol some kind of mutant, or what?

66
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,575
I don't know.

67
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,078
But maybe we should ask.

68
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,838
I guess you knew I'd come.

69
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,381
But you're late.

70
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,560
It looks like a surgical scar.

71
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,643
What is it?

72
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,230
It's the amygdala.

73
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,984
It was basically a surgery on his brain.

74
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:08,321
They don't have any emotions.
They kill people, kill themselves.

75
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,450
We just captured one earlier.
The animal blew himself up.

76
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,911
What happened today earlier today
was a massacre.

77
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,621
Yeah, that's why I came.

78
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,788
I need to be certain.

79
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,296
Maybe this might help you
to be more certain.

80
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,342
DELIVERYMEN, DISTRICT A
KIDNAPPING STATUS

81
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,487
We found some earlier today,
but they were destroyed.

82
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,720
They were burned beyond use.

83
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,556
A lot of the files have been encrypted.

84
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,391
You can decrypt them, can't you?

85
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,822
- What I want to know is...
- What their planning next is our focus.

86
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,315
And the GPS data.

87
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,240
You gonna find
these guys' leader?

88
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,617
I always give back as good as I get it.

89
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,701
Let me ask you.

90
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,329
You and the ten
former-refugee deliverymen,

91
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,122
what do you want to accomplish?

92
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,375
Cheonmyeong to be destroyed.

93
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,255
Well, I don't know
if I can do that much for you.

94
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,092
Then how much can you help us get done?

95
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:21,102
<i>I can't move forward
without concrete evidence.</i>

96
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,813
<i>Of course. You're a soldier.</i>

97
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,567
<i>Air purification in progress.</i>

00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,741
<i>Air purification in progress.</i>

108
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,307
Hey, Mr. Deliveryman. Looking good.

109
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,830
I know Seul-ah would love this.

110
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,081
Mm-hmm.

111
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,589
No questions for me?

112
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,466
Like?

113
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,636
You know I'm a mutant, don't you?

114
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,475
Don't tell me
that you have superpowers now?

115
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,104
No powers just yet.

116
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,361
Okay, about your mutant status here,

117
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,905
you're gonna get a lot of attention
now that people know.

118
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,199
Always be careful.

119
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,412
Mm-hmm.

120
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,728
- What is it?
- The chairman's asked for you.

121
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,108
Are things progressing well?

122
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,570
Yes. We took Yoon Sa-wol's blood
and extracted mutant stem cells,

123
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,453
and are preparing
to run a test on a candidate

124
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,407
with the same symptoms as yours, sir.

125
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,210
I'm looking forward to it.

126
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,365
<i>5-7, first day of work.</i>

127
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,703
So Major Jung has the device now?

128
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:50,955
She does.

129
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,998
She now knows who we all are.

130
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,084
Can we trust her?

131
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,548
We are on different paths,
yet we have the same goal.

132
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,428
I hope there's enough evidence
to arrest Ryu Seok.

133
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,057
It's the Major who needs the evidence.

134
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,558
Hmm?

135
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,144
What are you planning?

136
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,857
What's going on?

137
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,869
Where on earth is he?

138
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,832
Oh hey, man!

139
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,842
- Don't we have a lot to talk about?
- We do.

140
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,343
We'll talk after work.

141
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,136
Where though?

142
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,472
Where do you think?

143
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,793
CHEONMYEONG LOGISTICS

144
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,012
First delivery on my first day...

145
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,576
Hundreds of innocent refugees died

146
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,120
right before the relocation plan
went into action.

147
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,166
So assure me it's absurd
to think you were involved with it.

148
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,923
You did tell me you couldn't trust anyone,

149
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,842
so don't pretend that you'd believe me.

150
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:13,597
I'll speak to the president and move up
the relocation plan announcement.

151
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,934
With those mysterious terrorists
running about,

152
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:21,480
we need a safe place we can send
the refugees to live as soon as possible.

153
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,398
Well, sir...

154
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,110
Go over the government's relocation plan
and fix whatever's not working,

155
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,154
and then a meeting should be set up
right away.

156
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,795
I have already finished revising
any shortcomings in the government's plan.

157
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:48,048
If I fail to convince you,
there's nothing else I could do.

158
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,927
I'll conduct a census
and speak to the president about it.

159
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:56,390
I cannot for the life of me tell
what's going on in your head.

160
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,776
Wonder what the guys are doing.

Did you guys miss me?

166
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,306
Duh! Of course we did!

167
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,059
Hey, by the way,

168
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,852
are you really, like, a mutant?

169
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,187
Well, I'm not sure yet.

170
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,107
Hey, but,

171
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,360
now I'm a deliveryman!

172
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,493
Hey, we waited forever for you.
Give us a ride.

173
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,036
Okay, yeah. Let's go.

174
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,954
- Oh my God!
- This is awesome..

175
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,164
Let's go!

176
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,084
Whoa!

177
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,762
Whoa!

178
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,266
Woohoo!

179
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,476
Yeah!

180
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,144
- Yeah!
- This is wild.

181
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,866
Don't be too sad.

182
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,202
Next time I drive you
we'll go to the General District.

183
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,870
- You mean it?
- You know it.

184
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,080
Go.

185
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,666
- Bye!
- Bye!

186
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,423
Yoon Sa-wol, the mutant, be careful.

187
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,810
MILITARY POLICE

188
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,941
Man, I used to crawl
through holes to get in.

189
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,788
<i>District Five, Apartment 794.</i>

190
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,629
<i>Deliveryman,
identity confirmed.</i>

191
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,595
<i>Disinfection complete.</i>

192
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,313
Oh, wait.
You have to confirm recipient ID.

193
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,980
Oh.

194
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,412
You press this button and then...

195
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,331
<i>Ms. Park In-hwa,
recipient confirmed.</i>

196
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,414
You do that.

197
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:09,916
Oh.

198
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,889
Whoops.

199
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,891
I really enjoyed watching the match.

200
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,601
How's your forehead?

201
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,684
My, uh...

202
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,772
Well, it's all good.

203
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,316
You're too informal with the recipient.

204
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,567
Huh?

205
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,113
"Use polite language with recipients,
regardless of age."

206
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,991
That's gonna be tough.

207
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,119
- He's here, he's here!
- He's here!

208
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,371
It's the mutant!

209
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,581
- It's the mutant!
- What do you have?

210
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,084
What are you guys doing?
You can't... What? Stop!

211
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,794
Stop it, guys!

212
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,077
What are you doing? God, stop!

213
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,974
Is it ever gonna be easy?

214
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,021
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

215
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,108
God, this is annoying.
Why order so much at one time?

216
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,234
Oh, oh, oh.

217
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,610
Oh, I'm gonna fall!

218
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,487
Whoa!

219
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,586
I had a rough time here.

220
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,801
This way.

221
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:52,894
Who's this?

222
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,525
What are you doing?

223
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,635
Who's that? Where are we?

224
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:29,056
He belongs to the group
who killed your little sister,

225
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,352
and this room only a few may enter.

226
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,520
You found the ones who murdered her?

227
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,690
Hundreds of refugees died
while you were fighting the final round.

228
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:42,902
<i>Bombs went off</i>

229
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,530
<i>and turned all those people into ashes.</i>

230
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,583
Those bastards did all that.

231
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,793
There were hundreds?

232
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:01,046
They used the final round
to gather refugees, and then attack.

233
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,174
Who on earth would do something like that?

234
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,552
- Cheonmyeong.
- Cheonmyeong?

235
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,638
What? But why?

236
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:13,058
Cheonmyeong wants anyone born
as a refugee to die.

237
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,519
That's how it's gone so far,

238
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,270
and will continue to go.

239
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,899
That is the world you're living in now.

240
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,363
We're attempting to change that.

241
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,454
The personal data
on the residents that you asked for.

242
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,373
Thank you, Major.

243
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,459
I got the report that you decided
to accommodate the refugees

244
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,460
in General Districts.

245
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,630
I've made some revisions
based on the government plan.

246
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,257
The president and the chairman agreed.

247
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,008
You'll be taking a census.

248
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,192
Let me know if I can help you with that.

249
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,429
Of course.

250
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:54,724
In addition, I'll be providing
the refugees physical examinations.

251
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,227
We don't know
what diseases or viruses they have,

252
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,147
so we must consider using
a comprehensive vaccination.

253
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,608
It's true
that fewer people starve to death

254
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,153
than die because of a common cold.

255
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,240
I'm sure that vaccines will be crucial
for the success of the plan.

256
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,536
Why don't you confer with Mr. Oh,
a director, about the details?

257
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,204
Yes, I'll schedule a meeting.

258
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:18,956
<i>Yoon Sa-wol.</i>

259
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,753
5-7.

260
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,255
Mm-hmm.

261
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,299
I've told you everything now.

262
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,677
Got any questions?

263
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:32,845
No, I'm all right.

264
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,815
You decide if you're going with us.

265
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,298
Oh my God.

266
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,176
Gramps, got a package.

267
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,802
Is that right?

268
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,598
TOURNAMENT WINNER

269
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,725
Oh my goodness.

270
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,894
What the heck is this, huh?

271
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,230
But why did you bring it here?

272
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,608
You fought hard for this.
You won, it's yours.

273
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,485
You should have it.

274
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,738
You should cherish it, you rascal.

275
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,993
- Grandpa.
- What?

276
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,745
Sure, my wish came true,

277
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,248
but there's still a lot I don't know.

278
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,210
Course there is, you've got much to learn.
You have no idea.

279
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,505
This is just the beginning.
There's a lot more to learn.

280
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,091
You become a grown-up little by little.

281
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,968
You understand?

282
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,515
That's it for today's lesson.

283
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,561
Don't die till I come back.

284
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,469
There's hard evidence
about the kidnappings and the explosions

285
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,054
during the final round,

286
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,016
but no traces or Cheonmyeong
or Ryu Seok's involvement.

287
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:45,228
The encrypted files didn't have anything
on their next plan of action either.

288
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,605
What about the GPS data?

289
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:50,275
They move about here and there,
but no repeated coordinates.

290
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,235
I think they're a point organization,

291
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,571
they rally when given an order
and then scatter again.

292
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,823
Nothing very helpful.

293
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,451
If the DIC takes action
based on so little,

294
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,734
we'll just get the grunts
and their leaders will escape.

295
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,416
Are you sure about Ryu Seok?

296
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,253
Didn't we reach the same conclusion?

297
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,173
The government's plan
has been chosen for the relocation.

298
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,925
They'll start physical examinations

299
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,345
and do a census
to assign refugees to General Districts.

300
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,805
Ryu Seok yielded.

301
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,767
You really think
he'd give up so easily?

302
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,437
He would never do that.

303
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,693
<i>The relocation plan
led by the government</i>

304
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,945
<i>will include you, the refugees.</i>

305
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,822
<i>You will be given relocation rights</i>

306
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,575
<i>that will allow you
to live in General Districts.</i>

307
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,203
<i>All refugees must register
their personal information,</i>

308
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,330
<i>complete a physical examination,</i>

309
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,458
<i>and get vaccinated
to be reassigned to General Districts.</i>

310
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:55,757
<i>The relocation plan led by the government
will include you, the refugees.</i>

311
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,676
<i>You will be given relocation rights</i>

312
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,969
<i>that will allow you
to live in General Districts.</i>

313
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,181
<i>All refugees must register
their personal information,</i>

314
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,183
<i>complete a physical examination,</i>

315
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:08,395
<i>and get vaccinated

316
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,259
Can you move?

317
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,612
Move him this way, hurry!

318
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,706
We can't let them escape! Get them!

319
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,219
EMERGENCY, MEETING REQUESTED

320
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,489
What happened to you?

321
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,825
What's with the face?

322
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,578
It's those damn deliverymen.

323
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,663
Tell me everything.

324
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:35,166
I was ambushed
and captured by, uh... by 5-8.

325
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,876
- Oh my God.
- Yeah.

326
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,253
Him and the other deliverymen.

327
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,088
So how the hell did you get out of there?

328
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,048
The rescue team arrived.

329
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,424
Team? No team was sent.

330
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:53,393
Why'd you get me involved in this,
you fucking idiot.

331
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,151
What do you want?

332
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,782
You good?

333
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,043
- This gonna work?
- Of course, it will.

334
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,641
Watch where you're pointing that thing.

335
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,351
You're way out of bounds here.

336
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:36,935
I'm sure you're right.

337
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,606
What the hell are you planning to do, huh?

338
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,277
How funny.
That's what I was gonna ask you.

339
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,696
Drop the gun and take a seat.

340
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,665
You two working together?

341
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,709
You really think
you'll get away with this?

342
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:02,921
Murdering deliverymen,
bombings, kidnapping children,

343
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,088
genocide.

344
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,507
You're under arrest,
we have witnesses for everything.

345
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,845
What now?

346
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,183
This becomes public, and, well,

347
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,061
the bomb in your neck goes off.

348
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,022
ACTIVATE

349
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,857
I'm sorry.

350
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,651
Sir, I'm sorry!

351
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,070
I'll never again make that mistake.

352
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,199
STOP

353
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,785
Mr. Oh.

354
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,455
Think about how you feel right now
and always remember it.

355
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,418
What do you want, huh?

356
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,379
You planning more killings?

357
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,713
There's no need for that.

358
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,299
They're going with the government's plan.

359
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,009
What about the kids you kidnapped?

360
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,093
Where are they?

361
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,389
I have no idea, but...

362
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,349
...I doubt they're still alive.

363
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,017
Let's stop wasting time.

364
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,047
It's painful
when you can't breathe, right?

365
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,298
No, don't...

366
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,319
Give us what we want.

367
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:54,574
Solid information we can use
to track the whereabouts of Ryu Seok.

368
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:57,535
You want me to give you all that?

369
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:00,955
Want all the blame falling on you,
or someone else?

370
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,253
<i>We ask that all refugees
at the physical examination center</i>

371
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,796
<i>for the relocation plan</i>

372
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,799
<i>stand in line to register
your personal information first.</i>

373
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,845
- So am I done?
- Yes.

374
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,849
You can move into the General Districts,
barring any health problems.

375
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,059
Okay, thank you.

376
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:25,063
Oh, and word to the others
that they have to get vaccinated soon too.

377
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,397
I will.

378
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,575
Well, these guys are springing up.

379
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:41,162
Yeah, although they do droop now and then.

380
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,581
The soil's from down south.

381
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,626
- From down south?
- Yes.

382
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,586
How's the General District's air?

383
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,632
Can't be out for ten minutes
without a mask.

384
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,553
So even if the refugees go
to the General District

385
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,138
there won't be fresh air available.

386
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,365
All right, let's start.

387
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,226
Mr. Oh.

388
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,479
His face is getting rosier, right?

389
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,692
Yes, his color is returning for sure.

390
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,091
Where would I be now?

391
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:03,387
5-7: DOING DELIVERIES
5-8: FIRST MISSION

392
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,774
<i>Air purification in progress.</i>

393
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:17,276
<i>Pollution level five, dangerous.</i>

394
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,908
<i>Air purification in progress.</i>

395
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,952
<i>Pollution level five, dangerous.</i>

396
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,579
<i>Air purification in progress.</i>

397
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:29,747
<i>Pollution level five.</i>

398
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,212
<i>...in progress.</i>

399
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,098
<i>Pollution level five, dangerous.</i>

400
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,977
<i>Air purification in progress.</i>

401
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,645
AIR POLLUTION LEVEL

402
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,234
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE EMITTED

403
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,965
Those maniacs.
I didn't think they'd go this far.

404
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,718
Cheonmyeong's power started from oxygen.

405
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,888
If the air gets cleaner,
they will lose everything.

406
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,728
<i>Noona.</i>

407
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,693
You sure they're polluting the air
on purpose?

408
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,361
I measured it myself.

409
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,869
CEO RYU SEOK OFF-SITE SCHEDULE

410
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,203
What'll you do now?

411
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,256
Gonna be rough from here on out,

412
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,925
so you do what you feel is right.

413
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,766
Are the physical examinations
going well?

414
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,559
Yes, the explosions scared them,

415
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:16,062
but more of them
are getting exams without problems,

416
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,606
which makes it a bit more popular
as we proceed.

417
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,864
<i>Refugees who have finished
registering their personal information</i>

418
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:30,284
<i>will receive a basic physical examination,
including measuring height and weight,</i>

419
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,453
<i>and receive a comprehensive vaccine shot.</i>

420
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:36,082
<i>The comprehensive vaccine was created
by Cheonmyeong Pharmaceuticals</i>

421
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:39,710
<i>in consideration of the weakened
immune system and health of refugees.</i>

422
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,838
<i>The vaccine has undergone a thorough range
of clinical trials and tests</i>

423
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,965
<i>to prove its safety and efficacy.</i>

424
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,010
<i>Refugees will...</i>

425
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,012
Oh, there's more than I thought.

426
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,807
I'm sure it's because we had announced
that you'd be here.

427
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,729
<i>Once all refugees
have completed their examinations,</i>

428
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:02,316
<i>the government and Cheonmyeong Group
will announce the relocation plan.</i>

429
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,805
Let's go.

430
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,345
SENDING FILES...

431
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:16,806
System hacked.

432
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,395
Explosives installed.

433
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,442
Major Jung Seol-ah?

434
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,235
Yes, sir. Hello.

435
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,350
Gotcha.

436
