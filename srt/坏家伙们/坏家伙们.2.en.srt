00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,530
- Excuse me.<b>- Yes?</b>

2
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,190
Are you okay?

3
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,910
<i>- Episode 2 -</i>

4
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,770
You woke up early.

5
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,180
Hey, psycho.

6
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,240
You were at Cheongsong, right?

7
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,460
I was there too. For a short period, though.

8
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,690
So?

9
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,450
I'm just saying.

10
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,700
It's a small world.

11
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,770
Don't we need to wait and see if that's a good or bad thing?

12
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,200
If it's ill-fated, you'll die by my hands.

13
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:12,530
Be quiet! I need some sleep!

14
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,200
<i>Lee Jung Hun</i>

15
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,210
Salute! Lieutenant Nam Gun Wook here to greet!

16
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:56,020
Stay strong. And don't die.

17
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,390
Yes, sir!

18
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,100
Are you having fun?

19
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,830
Bastard.

20
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:58,030
<i>Outlaw</i>

21
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,250
Let me just tell you a few things before we arrive.

22
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,490
There's another victim for a total of 9 victims.

23
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,290
I’ll skip her bio since you probably don’t care anyway.

24
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,860
Anyway, you’ll have access to the crime scene

25
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,150
after the police do a preliminary inspection.

26
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,100
Some of the police might recognize you.

27
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,960
That’s unavoidable, so we request your compliance.

28
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,740
- Stop the car. <b> - What?</b>

29
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,110
Stop the car, quick!

30
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,270
What, man, you need a toilet?

31
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,940
Would you please give me some time?

32
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,090
What did you say?

33
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,870
It won't take long. I'll only be a minute.

34
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,590
Please, Lieutenant Yoo.

35
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,580
Let him go with Detective Kim.

36
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,060
What if something happens?

37
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,580
I will take the responsibility. Just let him go.

38
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,070
Who is it?

39
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,790
Who is it?

40
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,640
Does Park Sun Jung live here ?

41
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,670
No.

42
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,660
Hello, have you eaten yet?

43
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,200
Hey.

44
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,040
The case file?

45
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,090
- What ?<b>- Can I use your phone?</b>

46
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,070
Oh, it's nothing. It's nothing at all. What did you say?

47
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,380
I guess I can't.

48
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,740
I said no.

49
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,340
Uh, Miss, I mean Inspector.

50
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,690
Uh... So I, too... um...

51
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,710
Can you also give me some time?

52
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,000
Won't take long, it'll only be a minute.

53
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,790
Please, Miss Yoo, I mean, Inspector Yoo Mi-young.

54
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:41,320
You've never been punched by a woman, right? Ready for the first experience?

55
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh, I'm dizzy. This damn anemia...

56
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,960
Get ready to leave.

57
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,870
He's moving too fast.

58
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,000
Ahh, I knew that bastard would do that, that bastard.

59
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,170
Hold on tight, I'm going to crash into him.

60
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,080
Is that woman that important to you?

61
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,610
You killed me and she saved me.

62
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,040
Then, why did you turn yourself in?

63
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,080
I told you back then, instead of trying to atone for your sins by surrendering,

64
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,440
you should have stayed and protected her.

65
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,530
Stop talking about that.

66
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,380
You abandoned her.

67
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,610
You abandoned her<b>to clear your conscience.</b>

68
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,980
Would you reduce the time if I get that bastard?

69
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,250
Let's talk about that later.

70
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,350
Damn it.

71
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,040
You see...

72
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,380
The handle, this car doesn't have power steering! Damn this car!

73
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,310
What's wrong with you?

74
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,380
What happened? Where is that woman now?

75
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,420
I have no idea, I just wire the money into her account, that's all.

76
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,930
I said I'll definitely protect that woman, didn't I?

77
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,640
So that you can live.

78
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,420
Do you not trust me?

79
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,880
Hey,

80
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,680
look at me.

81
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,360
Master, I said look at me.

82
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,710
Don't talk about trust and listen. Find out where she lives,

83
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,860
if she’s in good health, if she’s suffering at all,

84
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,400
whether she is raising her child well or not,

85
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,140
whether there is any guy flirting over this single mum or not.

86
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,860
Find out all about it

87
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,590
and let me know.

88
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,940
They came really quickly, damn.<b><i> (Referring to the police).</i></b>

89
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,040
You keep her safe.

90
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,110
Don't be afraid and run away from it.

91
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,120
I want to do that too.

92
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,360
This is what I get for trusting you?

93
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,330
Why is everyone talking about trust?

94
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,880
Don’t just trust anyone.

95
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,220
If someone you trust betrays you, you’ll only suffer for the rest of your life.

96
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,330
You think the world revolves around you?

97
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,050
Selfish bastard.

98
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,300
Where are they now?

99
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,140
Detective Oh is leading them to the crime scene.

100
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,050
This is the real beginning.

101
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,430
<i>For the past 12 months, Citizens been living in fear.</i>

102
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,280
<i> A new victim is identified in the northeastern region serial killings. Victim identified as a Ms. Kim from S Women’s University.</i>

103
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,570
Is it him?

104
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,820
Same method. Same location.

105
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,720
It was raining too. It’s being investigated as the same case.

106
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,560
It sure is raining a lot.

107
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,000
My son Gun-wook must be crying.

108
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,120
He wants us to hurry and catch the bastard who made his wife a widow.

109
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,740
That’s what he’s crying about.

110
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,600
Uh... Commissioner?

111
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,490
I have one more question.

112
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,150
Sure. Go ahead.

113
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,880
Do you know why Detective Oh

114
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,890
chose Park Woong-chul, Jung Tae-soo and Lee Jung-moon?

115
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,560
Something’s odd.

116
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,080
The timing of them going to jail and when Detective Oh was suspended...

117
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,400
And Oh Goo Tak knows so much about Lee Jung-moon.

118
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,970
Am I right?

119
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,820
Yes, you’re right.

120
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,250
Let Goo Tak deal with his business. Today, let’s just eat.

121
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,310
Yes, sir.

122
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,420
Let’s begin.

123
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,650
You’ll have half a day. In exactly half a day,

124
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,500
you need to find that asshole.

125
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,700
This neighborhood has a high rate of suicides and all kinds of crime.

126
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,330
When Gangnam real estate prices rise, the number of dead bodies here rise too.

127
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,770
But to have a serial killer here, isn't that too much for anyone?

128
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:11,380
Bastards who are comfortable don’t know the fear of eating and living.

129
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:16,140
You guys know how crappy life can be.

130
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:21,930
Now it’s that bastard's turn. He'll find out how dirty and scary life can be.

131
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,530
Rather than getting bitten by you guys who take everything to the extreme,

132
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:29,800
make him feel that it's better for him to bite his own tongue and die.

133
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,570
Let him feel that.

134
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,390
This wasn’t your first time.

135
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,510
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

136
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,400
What’s not the first time?

137
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,310
Hey.

138
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,700
Tell me before you leave.

139
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,190
What’s not the first time?

140
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,720
Let go.

141
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,600
I don't want to.

142
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,740
I’ll kill you.

143
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:42,350
Just because you’re crazy doesn’t mean you can kill anyone.

144
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,300
You have to look at each person and then attack.

145
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,220
You keep it up, and you’ll die for real.

146
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,530
You know yourself well, right?

147
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,420
I don’t really know myself.

148
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:01,420
So I don’t remember how I killed people.

149
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,780
Do you know what’s good about not remembering a murder?

150
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,190
There’s no guilt.

151
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,520
Is it the same for you too?

152
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,010
How did you get here?

153
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,660
I took a minivan here.

154
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,290
I said, how did you get here?

155
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,470
First I rode in a van. Then I got out and came in.

156
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,270
You ass--

157
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,550
Who the hell--

158
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,940
Are you Yoon Chul Joo? You! Move!

159
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,740
Who are you?

160
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,980
Who sent you?

161
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:01,420
I’ve seen a lot of bastards like you.

162
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,470
Go home before you get hurt.

163
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,700
This place could make you sick, really make you sick.

164
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,590
Look at that innocent face. Double eyelid surgery?

165
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:13,690
A little bit. Is it obvious?

166
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,190
Then you're really asking for it.

167
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,480
Hey.

168
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,210
This asshole really wants to get hurt.

169
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,480
Hey. Hey. Chul Joo.

170
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,440
You bastard. Bastard.

171
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,350
- If you don't want to get hit more, then answer me properly.<b>- Yes, yes.</b>

172
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,670
Do you collect protection money in this neighborhood or not?

173
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,820
What protection money?

174
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,650
From the hardware store out front to the bathhouse and Chinese restaurant, and this place too,

175
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,590
you collect protection money for all of it.

176
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,410
Answer when someone’s talking to you!

177
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:50,490
Yes! Yes! You're right. I do collect that money.

178
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:54,490
Then you’re in charge of this neighborhood, right?

179
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,540
How many guys can you call out?

180
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,930
Um... what’s this all for?

181
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,850
You just need to find one person with me.

182
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,680
There’s no CCTV and no witnesses.

183
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,280
It’s the optimal location for a murder.

184
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,780
The killer would be very familiar with this neighborhood.

185
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,900
The key point is their shock at being stabbed. Considering the knife wound was lower on the body,

186
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,880
and the victim's height was 170 cm, the killer was shorter than the victim.

187
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,720
He only kills on a rainy days.

188
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,530
A psychopath’s psychological compulsion?

189
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,950
Is it something like that?

190
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:20,250
You wandered around for half a day and came up with nothing. Do you think that’s acceptable?

191
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,650
You think I’m going to take credit for your work?

192
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,890
I don't do that.

193
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,990
So go ahead and tell me while I'm still asking nicely.

194
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,340
He’s not the problem.

195
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,450
There’s another problem.

196
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,680
Just trust me. I can catch that killer within 3 days.

197
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,620
How?

198
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,230
I can’t tell you how.

199
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,520
Look who's here.

200
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,200
As if you'd say anything we want to hear. Hyungnim, you said you don’t expect teamwork.

201
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,410
So don’t push us to reveal information or work together on this.

202
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,550
And what if there’s another victim because of that? Are you guys going to take responsibility?

203
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,830
If I can take responsibility, I’ll do it.

204
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,500
But will that do anything for me?

205
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,030
I only need to pick enough fruit for me to eat.

206
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:12,750
Aren't people like you in charge of cleaning up the mess?

207
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,170
So in other words,

208
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:27,810
you don't care how many victims there are. You only care about catching the killer and reducing your sentence.

209
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,240
Is that what you guys think?

210
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,970
Fine. Let’s do as you think then.

211
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,570
What might the killer's motive be for murder?

212
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:50,590
It's the smell of blood. Because he likes the smell of blood.

213
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,110
That’s why he’s killing people.

214
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,640
That's also why he kills on rainy days.

215
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,160
When it rains, the smell of blood will be stronger,

216
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,530
so his compulsion is harder to resist.

217
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:10,470
Rainy days. The smell of blood. The urge to kill.

218
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,840
There must have been other cases too.

219
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,300
What do you mean by that?

220
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,140
He killed more people besides the one in this case.

221
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,590
Why do you think that?

222
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,640
His method was too clean this time. He killed her in one stab.

223
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,140
He stabbed her in the lung in one shot

224
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,840
without hesitation and killed her in an instant.

225
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,880
Through his previous crimes, the perp developed teeth.

226
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:05,000
He made many mistakes as he developed teeth but, when they all grew in, he bit his victim in one bite perfectly,

227
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,720
and without any mistakes.

228
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:13,500
He repeatedly made mistakes as his teeth for hunting grew in...

229
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,060
His murders focused on his instinct and desire to smell blood.

230
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,330
The crime scene is covered in blood, and the body is mangled because he lacked skills.

231
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,100
Within that scene, the perp is hiding.

232
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,740
A perp hidden in his murder...

233
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,640
We have to find that.

234
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:53,310
How many murders were there in the past year?

235
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:58,010
No, omit the cases where the suspect is arrested. Please focus on the unsolved cases.

236
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:02,580
If I ask for the files, just hand them over! Why do you keep asking, asshole?

237
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,880
Do you ask this many questions when you do victim registration reports?

238
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,360
Do you believe what he said?

239
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:19,300
It seems like he's leading us on a dirt path, while he's about to take the highway alone.

240
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:24,260
We'll just have to wait and see if he's lying.

241
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:50,890
You killed quite a lot, you bastard.

242
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,840
Is murder a game?

243
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,500
<i>It's the smell of blood.</i>

244
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,880
<i> Because he likes the smell of blood.</i>

245
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,970
<i> That's why he killed those people.</i>

246
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,360
<i> Because on rainy days, the smell of blood is even stronger</i>

247
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,660
<i> and it's harder for him to resist.</i>

248
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,260
<i> His murders focused on his instinct and desire to smell blood.</i>

249
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:26,910
<i> The crime scene is covered in blood, and the body is mangled because he lacked skills.</i>

250
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:29,870
<i> The culprit is hidden in a case like that.</i>

251
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,120
<i> A perp hidden in his murder...</i>

252
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,750
<i> We have to find that.</i>

253
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,120
I found it.

254
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,160
A hidden murder.

255
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,610
This is between July and November of last year.

256
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:57,290
These are the robber homicide cases in the northeastern Seoul area.

257
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:01,730
Whenever it rains, he does whatever he can to politely open the door and go in.

258
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:05,350
He beats the victim with a pipe wrench to death

259
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,050
and escapes.

260
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,680
There are a few similarities in all of these cases.

261
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,970
There's extreme amounts of blood present in all these crime scenes.

262
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:22,160
It's clearly a robbery case, but nothing was stolen.

263
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,510
He didn't go in to steal a few pieces of gold.

264
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,620
He went in to steal a person's life.

265
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,160
We're still lacking in facts.

266
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,490
The things you discussed are totally possible in a typical robbery scenario.

267
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,150
What is that?

268
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,690
A mark from a needle shot.

269
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:45,180
All of the victims had this. Needle marks.

270
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,640
So, after the criminal bastard killed the victim,

271
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,020
he took blood from the body of the dead victim.

272
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,140
<i> He collects blood from the victim. </i>

273
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,240
But the victims of our case did not have marks from needle shots.

274
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,020
And that's why the method is scary.

275
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,720
That bastard is the same.

276
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,590
He probably found a way to do it faster, easier or more efficiently.

277
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,910
Why didn't the other officers pick up on this?

278
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,420
Do you think it's easy to get information from the Serious Crimes Division?

279
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,380
That's like taking money out of their pockets.

280
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,190
Are you sure about that? If it's a prediction, that would make matters complicated.

281
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:28,210
The last day this case occurred was November 27th.

282
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,350
As we took over this case,

283
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:35,660
another victim, Park Chan-ok, died on December 5th.

284
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,350
He changed his method of murder is a span of 10 days.

285
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:44,810
So he grew his teeth through these cases.

286
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:49,720
He started biting his victims here.

287
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,180
How many victims are a part of that case?

288
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,190
15 victims. But...

289
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,270
Out of all the victims,

290
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,550
two are alive.

291
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,820
So why would I meet them?

292
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,990
If I meet the victims, will they give me the perp's address?

293
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:20,520
No, I'm saying I have my own methods in mind.

294
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,780
Ah, seriously!

295
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,100
Ah, shit.

296
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,790
He keeps annoying me.

297
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,830
What are you doing, boss?

298
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,820
Why, are you going to figure it out if I tell you?

299
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,300
No, it's not like that.

300
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,410
What are you eating on your own? Give me some.

301
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,250
You have your own right here.

302
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,720
What is this?

303
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,890
And don't spit out those formal curiosities, you ass.

304
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,740
Say something that you really mean from your heart.

305
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,800
You look like you have a disease.

306
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,320
- Why are you talking about my looks, Boss? <b> - The guy on the phone said</b>

307
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,450
the perp is someone who picks locks. He doesn't leave any traces either.

308
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,080
Maybe he used a wire, Boss.

309
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,810
I picked locks with wires back in the day. There wasn't a lock that I couldn't pick.

310
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,940
Should I tell you a funny story, Hyungnim?

311
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:16,370
When I first used a wire, I was in middle school, and I had to poop so bad.

312
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,840
The bathroom door was locked, so I dug into the lock with a wire.

313
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,150
- I dug and dug-- <b>- Hey.</b>

314
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,840
If your house keys are broken,

315
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,540
then where would you get new keys?

316
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,640
Why would I get new keys? I would get in myself. I can pick the lock, Hyungnim.

317
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,770
Let's say you're not a lock picker, okay?

318
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:36,440
The keys to your house are broken. Where would you get new keys?

319
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,730
Maybe someone else who picks locks?

320
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,020
I'll ask another guy who picks locks and ask him to fix it for me.

321
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,470
The hardware store! The neighborhood hardware store, you ass!

322
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,460
If your toilet breaks, the hardware store! If your sink breaks, the hardware store!

323
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,370
If the door breaks, the hardware store! Whatever breaks, it's the hardware store! What?

324
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,520
The hardware store.

325
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,720
Right? The hardware store, right?

326
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,660
- Yes, of course. <b> - Of course.</b>

327
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,470
That’s why there’s no suspicion.

328
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,730
What is it that you need?

329
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,330
Mister, is this the only hardware store in the neighborhood?

330
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,130
Yes.

331
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,490
So if people break their house keys, they would come here.

332
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,570
Most of the time.

333
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,940
- So you fix the keys for them? <b> - Yes.</b>

334
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,080
Since you've fixed them, you can also pick the locks?

335
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,280
I suppose so.

336
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,720
- Do you make house calls?<b>- Ah, yes.</b>

337
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,460
- And you know this neighborhood very well?<b>- Ah, yes!</b>

338
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,160
- And you also kill people? <b> - Yes!</b>

339
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,940
Excuse me?

340
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,480
It is this bastard.

341
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,150
Come out here.

342
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:50,030
- Ah, seriously this bastard. <b> - Why are you doing this?</b>

343
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,240
Asshole.

344
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,180
Causing so much trouble. I told you to get up. Come here.

345
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,200
Hey, you bastard!

346
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,020
Did you just hit me?

347
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,510
Did it hurt?

348
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:07,310
You insect-like bastard!

349
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,800
Leave innocent people alone!

350
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:25,710
I said I would go alone, why did you insist on coming along?

351
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,340
I have to catch the criminal.

352
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,110
Do you want to get a sentence reduction so badly?

353
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,740
I have someone to protect.

354
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,340
Who is it?

355
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,470
It's the police.

356
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,280
The police?

357
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,990
Miss Park Seon Jeong?

358
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:03,810
Yes. What is the matter?

359
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,800
<i>Are you alright?</i>

360
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,060
Please have some.

361
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:23,650
You didn't have to give this to us. Thank you.

362
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,820
Do you live alone? What about your husband?

363
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:37,430
My child is at daycare and

364
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,630
my husband died a few years ago.

365
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,460
- Are you alright? <b> - Yes, I am okay. It's just...</b>

366
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,750
Why are you like this? Are you sick?

367
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,740
No.

368
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,990
If you aren't feeling well, I told you to rest.

369
00:31:55,990 --> 00:32:01,270
Could you please tell us what happened the day of the incident?

370
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,460
Although it may be hard on you.

371
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:12,950
This happened last summer.

372
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,840
<i>Help me! My mom is...</i>

373
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,730
<i>Help!</i>

374
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,590
Did you see the culprit's face?

375
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,600
It was too dark.

376
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,780
That day...

377
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,930
So the day of the incident...

378
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,300
it was a really rainy day.

379
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,930
I woke up from sleeping

380
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,670
because the mosquitoes were so noisy.

381
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,830
That's when I saw him.

382
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,560
I was so...

383
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,180
I was so scared.

384
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,940
My younger sister was dying next to me.

385
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:57,450
I was so scared that I couldn't do anything.

386
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:02,240
I thought if he didn't know I was awake, he'd let me live.

387
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,480
If I did that, I thought I wouldn't die.

388
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,930
That's why I did that.

389
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:16,540
And then at that moment he said this to me.

390
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,300
<i> If I want to beat him,</i>

391
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:24,400
<i> I have to kill a lot at once.</i>

392
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:29,410
<i>That's why I came to your house</i>

393
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:33,160
<i>so that I can kill two people at once.</i>

394
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:39,280
<i>"So you understand that,"</i>

395
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,130
"okay?"

396
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,790
Did you see the culprit's face?

397
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,960
I tried not to look at his face

398
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,640
because I was afraid he would kill me if I did.

399
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,160
You are lucky.

400
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,220
You didn't die and you're alive.

401
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:21,140
Because my sister is dead but I am alive,

402
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,630
Are you saying I'm lucky?

403
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,220
What's...

404
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,330
so lucky about that?

405
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,310
Live in the light.

406
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,470
Don't die in the dark.

407
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,080
We will contact you every now and then.

408
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,380
Yes. Thank you.

409
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,800
Let's go.

410
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,260
Ah, yes.

411
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,120
Work hard.

412
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,260
Wait a second.

413
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,370
- What? <b> - I have a few things to ask</b>

414
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,760
to that person.

415
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,790
Why...

416
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,740
Why do you live in a place like this?

417
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,230
Sorry?

418
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,300
You don't have money?

419
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,940
Why do you ask?

420
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:14,430
Do you want to say that this happened to me because I live in a place like this?

421
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:18,720
No, that's not what I mean.

422
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,300
Excuse me, Detective.

423
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:31,040
No one in the world is poor because they want to be.

424
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,790
Don’t just look up in life. You need to look down too.

425
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:40,290
Many poor people commit suicide! Many poor people get in accidents!

426
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,680
Many poor people

427
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,780
get murdered, too.

428
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:51,120
If you’re going to continue police work, you need to look down, too.

429
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,930
Do you understand?

430
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:08,330
Ms. Park Sun-jung,

431
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,640
I will certainly

432
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,260
catch the culprit.

433
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,920
Jo Dong Soo. He is a psychopath serial killer who was arrested a year ago.

434
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,540
He mainly committed crimes in the south Gyeonggi area.

435
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,790
He attacked women on rainy days.

436
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:42,350
Victims are 23 people in total. They all died at the crime scenes.

437
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:46,690
After he was arrested, Jo Dong Soo said this during the police investigation.

438
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,550
"I love the smell of blood."

439
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:53,550
" The smell of blood gets stronger on a rainy day, so I can’t resist."

440
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:56,550
"So I had no choice but to kill people.”

441
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:04,690
So I’m confident that the perp was referring to Jo Dong-soo when he spoke to Bae Ji-hyun.

442
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:34,180
To beat Jo Dong Soo, one has to murder

443
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,580
more people quickly.

444
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:40,580
He’s going to kill at least two more people.

445
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,260
That way one can beat him.

446
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:49,430
Does he want to earn the title of

447
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,520
the "best" serial killer in Korea?

448
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,640
He wants to brag about that.

449
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:02,190
Isn't it a given that second place wants to beat first place?

450
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,230
These are the case files from Dobok West.

451
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:13,880
I had to force them to hand them over. They complained that you're taking their work.

452
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,550
I have a feeling it's too late but thank you.

453
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,470
Detective Oh!

454
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:41,730
They're going after the survivors from the hidden murders.

455
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,270
The perfect serial murder

456
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:47,440
without a single mistake.

457
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,480
Find Park Sun-jung's whereabouts! Get the car ready!

458
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,650
This bastard's going to do something today!

459
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:16,360
Don't fall asleep and keep your eyes open!

460
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,360
- Yes, sir.<b> - Yes, sir.</b>

461
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,970
Increase security in the area and strictly control civilians from entering.

462
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:33,180
It's raining. Let's clean his body tomorrow and have this bastard's funeral the day after.

463
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,350
Damn.

464
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,510
Let me get a pack of cigarettes.

465
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,480
Hey!

466
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,960
Hey! Come over here!

467
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,620
Come here for a second! I want to talk to you!

468
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,750
You have sausages shoved in your ears? Stop for a minute!

469
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,560
It's you, right?

470
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:43,650
Hey! Man in the black hat! Black hat!

471
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,650
Go that way!

472
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:01,830
Hey, bastard! Where are you...?

473
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:05,450
Go to Bae Ji-hyun! Quick!

474
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:41,520
I found him. I'm at Young-il Bakery.

475
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,960
Who are you, you ass?

476
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,720
The suspect is in a black hat.

477
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,500
Woong-chul is up there...

478
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:56,260
This is Detective Oh Goo-tak! Come in, Black Crow!

479
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:00,750
<i>We’re in pursuit of the suspect now! We’re in pursuit of a man in black hat!</i>

480
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,570
Where did that bastard go?

481
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,940
Damn, this bastard’s fast.

482
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:20,190
Hey! Get that bastard! Quickly!

483
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:55,100
Is there a problem?

484
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:25,260
Are you all in mourning? What’s with the mood?

485
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,210
Aren’t we going to catch this bastard?

486
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:30,610
The DNA results will be out soon, so just wait a minute.

487
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:32,490
There won’t be any results.

488
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,770
There wasn’t any until now.

489
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,870
There won’t be in the future either.

490
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,400
Yeah. It’s me.

491
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,520
Did the DNA results come out?

492
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,220
What did it say?

493
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:04,610
I got it.

494
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:17,930
There’s a fingerprint of the suspect.

495
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:43,870
Wait, where do you take me?

496
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:47,160
- Wait!<b>- Lift your chin up.</b>

497
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,000
Lift your chin up, you ass!

498
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:56,350
Hey!

499
00:49:56,350 --> 00:50:00,580
I really didn’t kill anyone, Hyungnim!

500
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,340
Why would I kill her, Hyungnim? Hyungnim!

501
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,710
There’s something wrong, Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

502
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,640
<i>The man who is suspected to have killed 23 people</i>

503
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,350
<i>in a serial murder case since last July has finally been arrested.</i>

504
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:20,270
<i>Police are currently investigating.</i>

505
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:24,100
An interview and removing security... isn’t it a bit too soon?

506
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,470
What’s too soon?

507
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:29,700
If the suspect was caught, then that’s the next step.

508
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:34,080
<i>The man who is suspected to have killed 23 people...<b>[Northeastern Region Serial Killer Arrested]</i></b>

509
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,850
Are you sure he’s the killer?

510
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:38,390
Don’t talk to me unless you want a beating.

511
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:40,580
That guy is not the killer.

512
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:46,420
He’s shaking in fear.

513
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:49,620
He’s scared of all the attention.

514
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:53,490
If he were the killer, he would be mad not scared.

515
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:54,480
Why?

516
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,380
23 is the same as Jo Dong-soo.

517
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,500
If he killed one more person, he would be first.

518
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,340
It's a waste.

519
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:11,810
This is Yoo Mi-young.

520
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:13,700
How tall is that bastard?

521
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,710
Excuse me?

522
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:19,380
The guy who was arrested, Yoon Chul-joo... How tall is he?

523
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,040
He’s 175cm tall.

524
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,340
Why? What is it?

525
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,270
It’s raining.

526
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:35,730
If he kills one more, he’s first.

527
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,670
There’s one victim still alive too.

528
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,170
Oh no.

529
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:31,380
Oh, you live up the hill, don’t you?

530
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:34,350
- Oh, yes. Hello. <b>- Hello.</b>

531
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:37,040
- I guess you went shopping for groceries.<b>- Yes.</b>

532
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,440
Look at this mess. All the fruit fell on the ground.

533
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,810
They’re probably all bruised.

534
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:44,760
- It’s okay. I’ll do it.<b>- No, no.</b>

535
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,430
It’s okay. I’ll pick them up, so just stay there.

536
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:52,540
- Here you go.<b>- Thank you. Goodbye.</b>

537
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:55,550
Uh... I’ll walk you home.

538
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:57,830
It’s okay. It’s right over there. Bye.

539
00:52:57,830 --> 00:52:59,420
I’ll walk you home.

540
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:03,390
All the cops are gone now, so it’s very dangerous.

541
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:06,540
It’s okay. Give me the bag.

542
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:11,100
I’ll walk you home.

543
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,490
Why aren’t you listening?

544
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:19,800
You’re pissing me off.

545
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:25,720
I guess you had a drink or two. Goodbye.

546
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:00,450
Why aren’t you listening to me?

547
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,520
I said I’ll walk you home.

548
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,260
Help me!

549
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:07,820
Why do you girls ask for help?

550
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,830
I’m going to kill you.

551
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,910
Wait a minute.

552
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,750
It’s going to be fun from now on.

553
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:02,630
I will...

554
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,060
make it more fun for you.

555
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,560
Beg.

556
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,590
"I'm sorry."

557
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:15,710
"I've done wrong."

558
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:17,970
Beg, you bastard.

559
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:23,900
You're crying?

560
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,590
That’s a funny thing you’re saying.

561
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:39,310
That's right.

562
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:43,960
You’re not a human. You’re a beast.

563
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:46,420
So

564
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,770
I'll treat you like a beast.

565
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:53,480
Say it!

566
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:56,990
Ask me to spare you, you ass!

567
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:59,700
Ask me to spare your life

568
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:03,470
just as the women you killed did!

569
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:10,510
Say it, you bastard!

570
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:26,210
Help me. P-please.

571
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:29,550
Please help me.

572
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:31,730
Do you want to live now?

573
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,720
Then

574
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,220
you should die

575
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,670
right now.

576
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:51,210
That’s enough, Tae-soo!

577
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:54,350
You can’t kill that bastard.

578
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:59,320
What are you doing?

579
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:04,310
That’s enough. If you beat him that much, that’s enough, you ass.

580
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:14,960
Did you

581
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:18,380
set this up?

582
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,380
Tell me.

583
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,470
Put him in jail for now.

584
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:06,120
I’m sure the right time will come later.

585
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:46,150
I contacted forensics.

586
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:50,040
They said there were no prints on the body of Bae Ji-hyun.

587
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,700
Why did you lie?

588
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:56,240
Why did you make Yoon Chul-joo out to be the suspect?

589
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,410
Because this asshole wants to beat Jo Dong-soo.

590
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:02,940
He got pissed because someone else was credited for what he did.

591
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,340
Did you remove security

592
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,710
so that you could use Park Sun-jung as bait?

593
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,720
You have to unleash a dog so that it’ll find its food.

594
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:15,890
You agitated the suspect, pushed up the next murder and set up a trap.

595
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:21,640
It’s interesting indeed, but it’s cruel. And a bit disrespectful.

596
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,300
You smiled?

597
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,260
Excuse me?

598
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:29,150
Guys who are cruel and disrespectful like me feel like shit,

599
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:34,510
but nice and polite Inspector Yoo is laughing right now?

600
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:38,050
Quit acting moral. Don't be cynical.

601
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:41,580
<i>Where’s the last one?</i>

602
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:44,640
<i>Why are there only 22 vials of blood?</i>

603
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,660
<i>You killed 23 people.</i>

604
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:52,610
What are you talking about? I killed 22 people.

605
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:57,150
I had one less than Jo Dong-soo.

606
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:04,490
It's not 23?

607
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,540
I said it was 22.

608
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:18,640
I should’ve killed that bitch before getting caught.

609
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:32,130
Who didn’t you kill among these people?

610
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,670
Why did you do it?

611
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:49,570
Why did you use her?

612
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:55,330
I thought you said no sharing information or working together?

613
01:00:55,330 --> 01:01:00,090
You didn’t care if there were more victims, you just needed years off.

614
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:03,420
Shut up, you bastard!

615
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:09,910
I don’t know what Park Sun-jung is to you.

616
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:14,530
As she is important to you, you need to think about other people.

617
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:21,050
Then bullshit about not caring whether there are more victims won’t come out of your mouth.

618
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:23,220
Ever.

619
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,570
Hey, Oh Goo-tak!

620
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,800
You mess with people’s lives like that?

621
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,380
<i>I didn’t kill this woman.</i>

622
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:51,880
<i>Is she really dead?</i>

623
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:54,560
That’s interesting.

624
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:57,660
- What are you talking about?<b>- It was about three months ago.</b>

625
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:01,660
I followed her to kill her, but I turned back

626
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:03,770
because someone was there.

627
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:05,310
What?

628
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:09,820
I didn’t kill this bitch.

629
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,350
I got the address wrong.

630
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:33,120
What do you need at this hour?

631
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,110
We’re here for the bad guys.

632
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:37,280
We’re in the middle of an investigation. Come back later.

633
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,600
We’re not here for him.

634
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:45,260
What do you think you’re doing?

635
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:48,430
What are you doing? Huh?

636
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:05,950
The hunt is over, so it’s a dog day.

637
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:10,260
We have no choice but to eat them alive.

638
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,450
<i>Bad Guys <b> Preview</i></b>

639
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:33,210
<i>Are we people or beasts?</i>

640
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:36,140
<i>The people we need to catch are beasts.</i>

01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:39,150

<i>Am I your bank account? You put me in and take me out whenever you want?</i>

<i>Save as many people as the number who died.</i>

<i>What are you thinking?</i>

646
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:49,980
<i>I’ll take that as a yes.</i>

647
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:51,810
<i>Are you ready to hunt?</i>

648
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:53,670
<i>Here are the details on the suspect.</i>

649
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:56,930
<i>Yang Shi-chul. Hometown is Gumi. Age 37.</i>

650
01:03:56,930 --> 01:03:58,450
<i>Find Shin So-jung.</i>

651
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:01,380
<i>Find her first, then catch Yang Shi-chul.</i>

652
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:05,310
<i>Take his bones and gnaw on them.</i>

653
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,830
<i>I’m looking for someone right now.</i>

654
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:10,490
<i>They’re here! They’re here!</i>

655
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:15,160
<i>I was going to sell them, so I gathered some more and got a surplus.</i>

656
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:17,980
<i>Don’t go overboard.</i>

657
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:19,900
<i>Are you Yoon Chul-joo?</i>

658
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:21,330
<i>No, I’m not Yoon Chul-joo.</i>

<i>If you change your story now, you’re dead. Follow me.</i>

<i>How much was your wife’s surgery?</i>

661
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:31,620
<i>Seventy dollars for the stomach and 190 dollars for the intestines. Do it.</i>
