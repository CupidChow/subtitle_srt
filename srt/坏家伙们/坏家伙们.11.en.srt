1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,592
BAD GUYS

2
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,615
BAD GUYS

3
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,760
Who's here at this hour?

4
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:08,318
Hello? Have you eaten yet?

5
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,334
I did my best.

6
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,003
I hope you like it.

7
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,046
Have some.

8
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:35,846
I can't even drink water in front of
someone who makes me uncomfortable.

9
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,683
Just get straight to the point.

10
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,273
Commissioner Nam.

11
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,318
I lost my wife about four years ago.

12
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,613
We started out
in a tiny basement apartment

13
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:55,991
when I was studying for the bar exam.
She was always there for me.

14
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,536
I still can't believe she's gone.

15
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,123
The serial killer from 2010, Cho Man-sik.

16
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,334
It was him, right?

17
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:10,797
That's right.
My wife was Cho Man-sik's last victim.

18
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,927
Come to think of it,
you and I have both suffered

19
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,973
the pain of losing a family member
because of work, right?

20
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,894
Are you here for a pity party?

21
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,609
Prosecutor Oh.

22
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,781
When I have even the slightest back pain,
I leave the house with an umbrella.

23
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,324
That's who you're talking to.

24
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,496
I know what you want to say.

25
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:48,877
"I caught the serial killer
who murdered my wife and put him in jail

26
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,255
while abiding by the law
as a prosecutor should."

27
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,091
"But what about you?"

28
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,678
"You killed the man
who murdered your son."

29
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:01,014
"I'll graciously let it go just this once,

30
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,226
so ditch Oh Gu-tak and those three guys."

31
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,646
"If you don't, I won't turn a blind eye

32
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,481
to your audacious crime."

33
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,821
Half of that is true.
But as for the other half...

34
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,239
I'm not so sure.

35
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,993
It is true that I caught Cho Man-sik.

36
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,915
From indictment to sentencing,
I got him good and made him a lifer.

37
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,504
Well, I'm sure you already know about that
because it was all over the news.

38
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,344
The truth is, what happened
after that is more interesting.

39
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,640
Would you like to hear it?

40
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,988
I believe it was three months
after he was sent to prison.

41
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,701
I visited him like you did.

42
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:08,331
Do you know
what my only wish was on my way there?

43
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,879
I just needed to see that
he was suffering as much as I was.

44
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:21,303
I didn't even care
to know what he was thinking.

45
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:26,183
I just hoped
he'd look absolutely miserable

46
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,228
as though he'd lost everything
and there was no hope left whatsoever.

47
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,397
Then I could forgive him.

48
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,734
I needed him to be a wreck.

49
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,113
That was what I had hoped to see.

50
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,535
But...

51
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,915
do you know what I saw instead that day?

52
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,389
How have you been, Mr. Prosecutor?

53
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,686
When I heard that,
my mind just went blank.

54
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,440
So for a few minutes,
I couldn't even talk.

55
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,902
I just sat there silently,
staring at that scumbag's face.

56
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,739
That moment, it dawned on me.

57
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,536
"He is the one who has sinned."

58
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,080
"Why am I the one being punished?"

59
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,499
"Oh, I see."

60
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,502
"The 'punishment' set out
by the justice system

61
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,379
is not a real punishment."

62
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:42,592
"It's mere isolation
for crime prevention purposes."

63
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,886
"If victims' families must suffer

64
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,764
instead of criminals
because of the so-called punishment,

65
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,393
if that's all the law can do
for those who seek justice,

66
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,228
then fine."

67
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,981
"I shall punish you myself."

68
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:01,194
"I'll take matters
into my own hands and do it my way."

69
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:07,909
"It is now your turn to suffer
the pain you put me through."

70
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:11,913
"Feel the pain I suffered
and drown in that misery."

71
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:20,046
"That is how I'm going to punish you
and how my justice system works."

72
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,091
So?

73
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:29,598
Are you saying you killed Cho Man-sik?

74
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,517
No.

75
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,729
Death isn't punishment.

76
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,315
It's the easiest way out.

77
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,818
What's worse than death
is living in unbearable grief and misery.

78
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:48,658
Even though he murdered eight people,
he seemed to truly care for his wife.

79
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,580
So I killed his wife.

80
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,712
So he'd have to live in absolute hell.

81
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,339
Just like me.

82
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,802
After that, I visited him again.

83
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,056
I took a good look at his face.

84
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,392
And I have to say, he looked...

85
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,690
I finally got to see
what I had hoped to see.

86
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,568
That experience taught me

87
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,697
that sending a murderer
to prison isn't punishment.

88
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:33,078
Killing their loved ones to make them
experience the exact same pain...

89
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,874
That is true punishment.

90
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,090
But why...

91
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,469
are you telling me this?

92
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:58,687
Who are you to those
in the Special Crime Investigation Team?

93
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:08,363
Without you, they'd be in trouble.

94
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,198
Right?

95
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,250
You should at least know why you must die.

96
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,752
That's why I'm telling you all this.

97
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,221
Oh Jae-won, you...

98
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,168
I'm sorry.

99
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,962
I had no choice.

100
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:13,803
BACK OUT INTO THE WORLD

101
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,687
FINAL EPISODE

102
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,230
Come on. Convince me.

103
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,361
I said, convince me.

104
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,156
Please!

105
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:42,832
Okay.

106
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,212
I understand.

107
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,503
I'm sorry.

108
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:14,716
I don't know what the truth is but...

109
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,644
Come on. Let's go.

110
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:30,732
The truth will come to light
as we investigate.

111
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:01,763
Jung-moon.

112
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,351
Just remember this.

113
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,022
I will kill you with my own hands.

114
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,202
It's me.

115
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,330
Let me ask you something.

116
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,668
Gu-tak.

117
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,463
Are we...

118
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,636
humans or beasts?

119
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,013
What's going on?

120
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,976
Did something happen?
You sound like you're dying or something.

121
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,311
I'm fine, buddy.

122
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:56,985
Don't overreact
and just answer my question.

123
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,737
What the heck are you saying?

124
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,991
Stop talking nonsense. Where are you?

125
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,993
All of a sudden...

126
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,369
Gu-tak.

127
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,123
This thought suddenly struck me.

128
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:20,550
Violence for violence
is the rule of beasts,

129
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:28,766
and nonviolence is
the law of the human race.

130
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,771
That's the way it should be.

131
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,028
But the two of us...

132
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,241
Which rule have we been living by?

133
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,538
The one of the human race or of beasts?

134
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,833
Who is it?

135
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,336
Who hurt you?

136
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:57,795
Forget it.

137
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,258
Don't even try to find out.

138
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,804
Even if you know, act like you don't
and just live your life.

139
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,848
Answer me! Where are you right now?

140
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,978
Dying a beast...

141
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,649
should end with me.

142
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,906
I wouldn't wish this on anyone else.

143
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,785
Gu-tak, heed my advice

144
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,622
and die a human.

145
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:38,252
That's all I ask.

146
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,422
Do you understand?

147
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,716
Gu-hyun.

148
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,468
Gu-hyun!

149
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,472
I'm getting sleepy.

150
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:57,772
I'm going to sleep.

151
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,251
Gu-hyun!

152
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,056
Hey, Chang-joon.
Can you track someone's phone for me?

153
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:51,784
Gu-hyun.

154
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,620
Gu-hyun!

155
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,321
Captain Oh, why did you do this?

156
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:33,409
You shouldn't let these brutes
bring you down to their level.

157
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,870
What the heck are you saying?
We didn't kill him.

158
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,539
You know that we didn't kill him.

159
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,875
We'll find out
once we start investigating.

160
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,003
Anyway, you'll have to come with us.
All of you.

161
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,593
This, here. How did you get this?

162
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,431
When you stab someone with too much force,

163
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,308
the blade digs into your hand

164
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,852
resulting in a cut like this.

165
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,899
Prosecutor Oh,
did you stab someone earlier?

166
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,449
Commissioner Nam Gu-hyun.

167
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,576
Did you kill him?

168
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,624
I was thinking this was all too easy.

169
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,795
I'm sorry,
but I won't go easy on you anymore.

170
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,541
Get started.

171
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,134
You've got the brains. Got any ideas?

172
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,677
It's not looking good.

173
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:17,972
Follow me, you twerp.

174
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,170
This won't be an easy fight, right?

175
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,758
You're the only one
I can count on, Mr. Cha.

176
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,761
Take care of it.

177
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,899
Senior Inspector Yoo. It's me, Oh Jae-won.

178
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,902
Something's come up.

179
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,947
The ankle monitors
on Park Woong-chul and Jung Tae-su...

180
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,825
We need to trace them.

181
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,247
Sinwoo-dong 318-1, Jinsung Auto Repair.

182
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,543
It looks like that's where they are.
Send backup to the address.

183
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:15,339
AUTO REPAIR

184
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:33,941
A step too late.

185
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,026
Yes, I guess.

186
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,655
Anyway, who did they kill?

187
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,142
Mi-young.

188
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:12,104
Do you not regret your decision?

189
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:16,192
I guess I'm getting old.

190
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,194
Because I already lost my son,

191
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:23,824
it really hurts to lose you too.
You were like a daughter to me.

192
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,412
You can come back anytime
if you change your mind.

193
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,664
I'm not going anywhere.

194
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,879
You and I are in this together.

195
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,090
If I live, you'll live too.

196
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,967
And if I die...

197
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:43,886
Do you understand?

198
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:53,562
Sir, I'm afraid I can't keep that promise.

199
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,067
I will protect you no matter what.

200
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,611
So please,

201
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:05,199
don't say anything about dying, sir.

202
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,327
AUTOPSY ROOM 1

203
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,541
Don't say anything

204
00:22:56,709 --> 00:23:00,004
until I catch the person
who killed Commissioner Nam.

205
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:09,388
Don't worry. We're going public
with the investigation today.

206
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,225
I promise I'll catch those
who killed Commissioner Nam.

207
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,828
It's okay. You can sit down.

208
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,002
All the competent detectives
I know are here.

209
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,795
Detective Choi, how's your kid?

210
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,505
Good. Thank you for asking.

211
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,342
Why did you gather us together?

212
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:50,304
Right, let me tell you
why I called this meeting.

213
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,390
GOSEONG RESERVOIR MURDER

214
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,519
Commissioner Nam Gu-hyun
of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency

215
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:01,023
was attacked and murdered
at around 2:30 a.m. today.

216
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:07,112
The suspect managed to take down
the arrest team and fled the scene.

217
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:10,699
As of right now, 11:35 a.m.,
we do not know where he is.

218
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:16,038
The good news is my team
has managed to identify the suspect.

219
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,667
Here's what we know so far
about our prime suspect.

220
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,169
NAME: OH GU-TAK

221
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,087
Oh Gu-tak.

222
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,340
Led Gangseo Police's Violent Crimes Unit 2
up until 2 years ago.

223
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,716
Currently on suspension.

224
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,052
It seems that he killed Commissioner Nam

225
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,097
because Commissioner Nam had found out

226
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,225
about his unlawful act
and he wanted to cover it up.

227
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,728
We've also confirmed
that he had accomplices.

228
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:43,107
Park Woong-chul,
Jung Tae-su, Lee Jung-moon.

229
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,818
We suspect that these three men
conspired with Oh...

230
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,112
No, we're sure of it.

231
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,906
Oh Gu-tak's unlawful act?

232
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,366
Could you elaborate on that?

233
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,202
He sneaked
convicted criminals out of prison.

234
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:58,622
At the moment, we do not know

235
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:02,793
why Oh Gu-tak helped
the three criminals escape prison.

236
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:06,964
What we do know for certain
is that Oh has been working with them

237
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,341
since July
and has committed various crimes.

238
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:12,970
And when Nam Gu-hyun,
the Commissioner of Seoul Police,

239
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,180
found out about it, they murdered him too.

240
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:19,435
These jerks dared to thrust a knife
into the heart of a police commissioner.

241
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,895
We can't let these scumbags roam free.

242
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,732
I'm Senior Inspector Yoo
from Seoul Police.

243
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:27,359
I'm here for the dashcam memory card.

244
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:30,571
The memory card?
Someone already picked it up.

245
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,489
Who?

246
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:35,951
He said he worked
for Special Prosecutor Oh Jae-won.

247
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,330
We're putting out an APB on them.

248
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,166
As of this moment,

249
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,461
you'll investigate the case
as members of our joint task force.

250
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,504
It's just after 12:00 p.m. now.

251
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:51,967
At the moment, their wanted posters
are being distributed nationwide.

252
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:55,637
Since this is a huge case,
all the media outlets

253
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,639
including the ten major newspapers

254
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,101
and the national TV networks
have promised us their support

255
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,937
in publicizing the case
to help us track them down,

256
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:09,651
so I believe that we will catch them
in one to four days at the most.

257
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:10,986
That's what my gut says.

258
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,782
All right, let's get started.
Any questions?

259
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:17,159
How much force are we allowed to use?

260
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,371
Clearly, we'd struggle if we had
to catch them with our bare hands.

261
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,793
Are you asking
if you can use live ammunition?

262
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,090
You can't hunt down beasts
with bare hands.

263
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,384
Yes, you may use live ammunition.

264
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,846
They're like brutes.
Just beat them to death.

265
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,891
Kill them and bring me
what's left of them.

266
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:43,352
Got it?

267
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,902
Where is the dashcam memory card?

268
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,279
Oh, that.

269
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,241
We threw it out. There wasn't much on it.

270
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,158
What?

271
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:02,287
How could you
deliberately destroy evidence?

272
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,123
There was nothing on it.

273
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,753
They didn't do it.

274
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:14,133
Park Woong-chul and Jung Tae-su.
I checked their GPS data.

275
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:19,221
They were in Galhyeon-dong
at the estimated time of death.

276
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:24,017
They arrived at the scene after the fact.
The killer is someone else.

277
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,605
What are you trying to pull here?

278
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,941
I must find out
who killed Commissioner Nam!

279
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,025
Enough.

280
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:37,239
I have no patience left for your yapping.
This is getting tiresome.

281
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,324
Prosecutor Oh.

282
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,576
Shut up.

283
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:47,749
You need to figure out
what you want first.

284
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:52,004
It doesn't look good if you keep
switching sides and nitpick everything.

285
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,964
Make up your mind.

286
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,303
If you want a successful career,
keep your mouth shut and do as I say.

287
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,514
You shouldn't have picked me

288
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,933
had you valued integrity
and crap like that.

289
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:11,940
I don't think I need you anymore.
Just go home and rest up.

290
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,026
Once the case is closed,

291
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,447
I'll make sure you can wear another star
on your shoulder. You have my word.

292
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,800
Look at this. They're wanted for murder.

293
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,469
WANTED FOR MURDER

294
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,478
So to sum it up,

295
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,982
you went after a psychiatrist
named Kim Dong-ho

296
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:58,195
to find out what happened two years ago
but got kidnapped by him.

297
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,657
Then you were taken to some place
where he drugged you.

298
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,784
And you have no memory after that?

299
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,119
That was when Lee Du-kwang was murdered.

300
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,038
Correct?

301
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:19,174
Okay, then let's move on.

302
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,845
When you woke up,
you were covered in blood?

303
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,724
And you have no idea whose blood it was.

304
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,562
Then Kim Dong-ho
handed you over to someone

305
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:35,524
and that was the same guy
who fought with me last night.

306
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,528
So what's your take?

307
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,322
Kim Dong-ho
handed you over to that knifer,

308
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:45,200
who showed up with Prosecutor Oh.

309
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,036
They must be connected one way or another

310
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,540
and you think
it has something to do with your case.

311
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,791
Is that it?

312
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:58,255
The three of them
must know the truth about me.

313
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,009
We must uncover the truth

314
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,511
to find out who killed Lee Du-kwang

315
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,055
and who ordered the hit on me.

316
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,766
It'll tell us everything.

317
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,727
In other words, we must capture

318
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,521
at least one of them
to figure out what's going on.

319
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,026
Let's go after Kim Dong-ho.
It'll be the safest and easiest.

320
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:23,196
I know that he knows
something about me because I heard it.

321
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,869
I wouldn't believe him if I were you.

322
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,831
Beware of his sly tongue.

323
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:37,044
At first, he lures you in with his words.

324
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:40,589
Then when you become obsessed
with his sly words, he'll kill you.

325
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,591
He'll stab you in the head.

326
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,344
I don't care
whether you believe me or not.

327
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:46,595
I really don't care.

328
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,180
But what choice do you have?

329
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,265
Should we just die?

330
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,145
Is that what you want?

331
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,856
You piece of...

332
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,073
That's enough.

333
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:11,286
Should I blow a fuse too?
Then who do you think I'd kill first?

334
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,002
Find a way to live
instead of begging for death.

335
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,255
When the truth is finally out in the open,

336
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,383
we can point our knives at one another.

337
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,134
Do you understand?

338
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:37,979
So what's your point then?

339
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,649
We just need to track down Kim Dong-ho?

340
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:52,953
We won't find him at his place.

341
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,704
He must've fled long ago.

342
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,957
He probably doesn't know that I escaped.

343
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,669
Let's hope the news
hasn't reached him yet.

344
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,504
Make a left at the next light.

345
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,319
-Follow that car.
-What?

346
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,697
Kim Dong-ho is in that car.

347
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,996
Should I run them over and drag him out?

348
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,998
Just follow them quietly.

349
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,042
Causing a commotion on the road
won't do us any good.

350
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,253
Where are they taking him?

351
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,505
They're trying to hide him.

352
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,841
They knew we were coming.

353
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,279
It's been a while, Dr. Kim.

354
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,864
Why is Lee Jung-moon...

355
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:14,034
Oh, it's nothing to worry about.

356
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:18,246
Stay here for a few days.
Rest up. They'll take care of you.

357
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:28,131
Even if those bastards
somehow find out that he's here,

358
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:30,383
do not let them barge in.

359
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:31,551
Understood?

360
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,555
What should we do?

361
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,266
It won't be easy
to strike them and get him out.

362
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:41,978
If we can't go in,

363
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:43,772
we'll make him...

364
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:46,900
come out.

365
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,954
ESCAPED PRISONERS AND DETECTIVE ON THE RUN

366
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,627
What's going on?

367
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,754
What's going on? What's with the blackout?

368
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,632
It could just be a power outage.
Don't worry.

369
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:13,343
Stay put until we figure out
what's going on.

370
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,011
But this is...

371
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:17,639
Hang on to this just in case.

372
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,153
INCOMING CALL

373
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:38,618
Mr. Kim Dong-ho?

374
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,204
Yes, speaking. Who is this?

375
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:44,332
I don't have time to explain.
You must get out of there now.

376
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,960
Lee Jung-moon is in that building now.

377
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,795
What? Who?

378
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,880
How did he get in?

379
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:56,595
I think there's a mole helping him.
That's how he found out that you're there.

380
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:01,474
He's after you...
You need to get out of there.

381
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,602
Hurry and get out. Quick.

382
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:08,481
Take the staircase

383
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:10,900
at the end of the hallway
and go down one floor.

384
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,069
Then you'll see an elevator.

385
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:16,281
That elevator is connected
to a backup generator,

386
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,783
so you can use it
even during a power outage.

387
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,286
Go find that elevator. Hurry.

388
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,998
I'm here. What do I do now?

389
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:28,543
We have a car waiting for you
in the underground parking lot.

390
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:32,005
Take the elevator down
to the underground parking lot

391
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,214
and find the car.

392
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:37,052
They'll take you to Prosecutor Oh
safe and sound.

393
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,096
Okay. Got it.

394
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,100
Keep in mind that we do not know
who the mole is at the moment.

395
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:47,646
So don't ask for help
no matter who you run into.

396
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:48,688
Just get out.

397
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:51,608
Make sure no one sees you

398
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,694
until you get picked up
by our agents. Okay?

399
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:56,738
Got it.

400
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,160
Hey, Kim Dong-ho!

401
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,750
Kim Dong-ho got out.
The emergency elevator!

402
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:14,130
Do you see the silver van
by the entrance of the parking lot?

403
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,262
I see it, a silver van.

404
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,099
That's the one. Hurry up and get in.

405
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,558
See you in a bit.

406
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,436
Kim Dong-ho!

407
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:30,689
Mr. Cha.

408
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:32,482
Going somewhere, Dr. Kim?

409
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:36,528
Honestly, I have no idea what's going on.

410
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:38,822
You should stay with us.

411
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,658
Many people are after you right now.

412
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,669
If we can't go in,
we'll make him come out.

413
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:54,504
What do you mean?

414
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,299
Senior Inspector Yoo.

415
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,805
I'll get straight to the point.
We did not kill Commissioner Nam.

416
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,808
Prosecutor Oh Jae-won. It was him.

417
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,812
I don't care whose words you believe.

418
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,815
But if you're after the truth, help us.

419
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:19,487
I want nothing more
than to uncover the truth.

420
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,073
Then...

421
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,201
what do you need me to do?

422
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:29,664
Confuse them.

423
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,130
You people...

424
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,174
I don't trust you!

425
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:03,072
Just know this though.

426
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:09,746
I'm not doing this to help you guys.

427
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:13,124
I want to know the truth.

428
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:17,587
So find out the truth no matter what.

429
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,006
Do you understand?

430
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,245
Tell us what you know.

431
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,540
What is it that you're hiding?
Talk, you jerk!

432
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:56,459
I can't. I can't tell you.

433
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:59,420
If I tell you, they will kill me!

434
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,715
Do you think we're playing with you?

435
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:06,678
Do you think we'll be all nice
and understanding if you don't tell us?

436
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,222
You little prick. Got a death wish?

437
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,682
Here's my advice to you.

438
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:15,562
If you want to save your life,
I suggest you run now.

439
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:20,692
People like you will never beat him!

440
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,294
I know wimps like you pretty well.

441
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:44,215
You won't talk no matter what,
so let's not waste our energy.

442
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:45,884
Just die.

443
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,556
No! Don't kill me. Please!

444
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:55,727
I'll talk. I'll tell you everything!

445
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,032
Oh Jae-won

446
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,953
was the lead prosecutor in my wife's case.

447
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,122
My wife...

448
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:19,417
She was murdered
five years ago by a serial killer.

449
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:22,921
Yes.

450
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,340
That's right.

451
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:31,262
Prosecutor Oh caught the killer
and got him sentenced to life.

452
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,600
At the time, I was pleased with it.

453
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,979
But after some time,
it became even harder to bear.

454
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:44,233
With no one to take out my anger on,

455
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:47,862
my resentment just kept piling up
so I couldn't even get any work done.

456
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,406
Every day,
I was drinking and popping pills.

457
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,117
I was a wreck.

458
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:58,414
I spent two years of my life
living in that hell.

459
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:03,002
But one day, Prosecutor Oh
came to see me out of the blue.

460
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,967
He visited me unannounced after two years.

461
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:12,595
He told me he was working
on an interesting case

462
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,890
where the main suspect was a psychopath.

463
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:20,478
He said he'd bring him
to my clinic for treatment

464
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,605
and that he had a job for me.

465
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,483
Then...

466
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,612
a few days later, he showed up with...

467
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,123
Was it...

468
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:42,500
me?

469
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,588
Yes.

470
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,841
It was you.

471
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:52,135
Lee Jung-moon.

472
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:07,734
What was it that he wanted you to do?

473
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:14,699
The pills I gave you
a few days ago was Exphalin.

474
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:19,245
It's a tranquilizer but due to
the adverse effects, it's now been banned.

475
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:23,458
The adverse effects of Exphalin include

476
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,837
emotional disorder and memory loss.

477
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,963
I...

478
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,841
don't remember.

479
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,843
Parasomnia hypnosis.

480
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:38,306
A sleep disorder
that induces a pseudo-hypnotic state.

481
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:46,314
The reason you couldn't remember
whether or not you killed those people

482
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,566
was all because of that drug.

483
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,486
Exphalin.

484
00:42:56,949 --> 00:43:00,536
You scumbag. Don't bend the story
out of chronological order.

485
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,873
What exactly did you do
with that bastard, Oh Jae-won?

486
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:08,836
Jung-moon came
to my clinic once or twice a week.

487
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,837
And every time,

488
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:13,841
I gave him Exphalin.

489
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:19,055
Then, when Jung-moon
fell into a hypnotic state,

490
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,766
I made him memorize all the info

491
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:25,311
Oh Jae-won gave me on those people
and showed him their photos.

492
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,524
You showed me their photos, then what?

493
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:34,570
Hwayeon 7-dong 35-12.

494
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,365
Yoo Ha-na.

495
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,872
Kill this woman.

496
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:14,986
So?

497
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,655
So did I...

498
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,450
Did I...

499
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,662
kill them?

500
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:53,149
Both Prosecutor Oh
and I hoped that you would but...

501
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:11,334
Your subconscious mind refused to kill.

502
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:25,056
So Prosecutor Oh and Mr. Cha
killed them in your stead.

503
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:36,734
Then they framed you for the murders of

504
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,905
all 15 victims of the Hwayeon-dong case

505
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:42,782
and...

506
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:45,868
Lee Du-kwang.

507
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:50,373
They framed you for the mob boss too.

508
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,917
There you are, at last.

509
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,656
So I...

510
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,744
I didn't kill them?

511
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:35,376
He used me because I was a psychopath?

512
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:51,976
Why?

513
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,604
Why me?

514
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:00,609
Just because I'm a psychopath?

515
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,236
That's why...

516
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,614
That's why you did that to me?

517
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:09,994
I'm...

518
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,204
I'm sorry.

519
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:19,086
You're sorry?

520
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,183
I'm sorry too,

521
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:34,977
but you two...

522
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:39,482
I can't forgive you.

523
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:42,943
Jung-moon.

524
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:44,528
-Hey.
-Let go.

525
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:46,155
-Hey!
-I said, let go!

526
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:48,741
Let go of me!

527
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:50,451
Jung-moon!

528
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,535
Get him out of here.

529
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,245
-Jung-moon.
-Let go!

530
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,677
So, Oh Jae-won picked the victims?

531
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,888
Based on what?

532
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:14,850
He said his goal was to kill

533
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,354
the families of the criminals he put away

534
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:25,152
while he was working at
the Southern District Prosecutor's Office.

535
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:26,987
But why?

536
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,906
After his wife was murdered...

537
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,368
After he went through what I went through,

538
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:37,248
he realized that
the only way to truly punish them

539
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:41,001
was to inflict on them
the same pain he had suffered.

540
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:50,010
The first one was the wife
of the scumbag who killed my wife.

541
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:01,230
Now with every breath he takes,
he'll regret being alive.

542
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,566
Just like us.

543
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,778
Yoo Ha-na.

544
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:10,573
That's how it began.

545
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:17,329
Oh Jae-won always said

546
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,666
that he was simply

547
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:25,004
trying to right the wrongs he had made.

548
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:32,094
He said the hackneyed moral gibberish
in the law books was completely useless.

549
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:34,472
He said it was the only way...

550
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:35,598
Then...

551
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:43,606
Why did you guys
kill my daughter, Ji-yeon?

552
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:45,858
Why?

553
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,696
With Jung-moon being released
due to insufficient evidence,

554
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:56,619
we needed someone to get him again

555
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,247
so we wouldn't be caught.

556
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,874
Okay, but...

557
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:04,960
Why Ji-yeon?

558
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,922
Why did you kill Ji-yeon of all people?

559
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:12,635
Because you...

560
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:16,847
were convinced
that Jung-moon was the killer.

561
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:25,981
This was what
Oh Jae-won said to me back then.

562
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:30,945
"Oh Gu-tak is blinded
by his own doggedness."

563
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:35,407
"Adding anger to that doggedness
will turn him into a beast."

564
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:37,451
That's why

565
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,829
we killed your daughter.

566
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,692
We thought if we turned you into a beast,

567
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:14,154
you'd arrest Jung-moon
and put him away no matter what

568
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:17,491
and might even kill him.

569
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,585
So I was played

570
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,379
by you two.

571
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:35,301
Believe me, I was against the idea
of killing your daughter.

572
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:40,097
It wasn't in line with our initial goal,
so I was against it.

573
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,851
Then I took my hands off it
altogether and...

574
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:48,230
I wanted to live in repentance
for the rest of my life.

575
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:51,609
But...

576
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,447
Now, it's starting to make sense.

577
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:01,493
The case was closed,
so you guys thought that was it.

578
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:06,540
But I suddenly got them out
and started doing stuff

579
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,795
which made Oh Jae-won anxious.

580
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:16,675
That is why he tried to get Tae-su
and Woong-chul to kill Jung-moon.

581
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:19,887
It was that bastard, Oh Jae-won.

582
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:24,725
Right?

583
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:21,573
I had branded you as a murderer.

584
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,414
And as a psychopath.

585
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,502
Just so I could put all the blame on you.

586
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,591
It was my fault...

587
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:44,138
that my daughter died.

588
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,727
And I just...

589
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:54,064
I just couldn't handle the guilt.

590
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,654
It was just too much to bear.

591
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,497
That's why I put it all on you.

592
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,420
I bet you can't even listen
to what I'm saying now.

593
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,840
I know you're not ready
to listen to what I have to say.

594
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:26,096
All the things I've done to you...

595
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:29,641
I'm sorry.

596
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:32,728
Forgive me.

597
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,717
Do as you please.

598
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,046
You know, the emotions you feel.

599
00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:43,674
I can't feel them.

600
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,429
You people call me a psychopath.

601
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:52,891
Psychopaths cannot feel

602
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:57,312
the emotional state of others.

603
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:07,614
I don't feel these emotions,

604
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,786
but I want to learn to feel them.

605
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:18,375
In fact, you've taught me quite a bit.

606
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:27,009
Whether it's resentment, sorrow, or joy.

607
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:33,140
So I understand

608
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,475
why you're sorry.

609
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:38,520
I get it, but...

610
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,779
Don't expect forgiveness.

611
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:34,701
Come on. Let's go.

612
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,789
That jerk killed your child
and messed me up.

613
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,500
Don't you want to catch him?

614
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,942
One day, a man named
Zhuang Zhou had a dream.

615
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:09,236
In his dream,

616
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:15,075
he was a butterfly
fluttering from flower to flower.

617
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:20,122
But then, he woke up
and realized he was human.

618
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:23,250
So he wondered,

619
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:26,878
"Am I a man
who dreamt of being a butterfly?"

620
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:29,464
"Or am I a butterfly
dreaming that I am a man?"

621
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:32,968
This sums up the gist of our plan.

622
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:34,553
"Butterfly Dream."

623
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:37,014
Jeez, put it in layman's terms.

624
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:38,807
What are we doing with Oh Jae-won?

625
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,726
We'll wake him up from his dream.

626
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:42,894
Give him a good wake-up call.

627
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:49,443
So he can finally realize that he is
a despicable scumbag, not a butterfly.

628
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:54,698
We will teach him that lesson.

629
00:58:57,569 --> 00:58:58,535
How?

630
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,747
What do you think
he needs the most right now?

631
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:06,209
Bait.

632
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:08,920
Use him as bait to lure Oh Jae-won?

633
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:11,298
"Kim Dong-ho told us everything."

634
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:15,177
"So let's talk face to face."

635
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:19,014
Say something like that to lure him out?

636
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:22,601
Will he believe us though?

637
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,104
He's very cautious and thorough.

638
00:59:26,188 --> 00:59:28,190
Why does the grass look greener
on the other side?

639
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:31,443
The reason is simple.
Because it's not yours.

640
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,028
The same goes for information.

641
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:37,616
If it wasn't obtained firsthand
but through eavesdropping...

642
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,827
-It's me.
-How did it go?

643
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:43,246
Now, we know the truth.

644
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:47,167
Prosecutor Oh sure went overboard.

645
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:50,378
Anyway, I'll fill you in
on the details in person.

646
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:53,799
Before figuring out whether or not
it'll be useful to you,

647
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:58,845
you'd first want to find a way
to get your hands on it

648
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,764
to make it yours.

649
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:05,352
That's just human nature.

650
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:08,105
Daeheung Pier in Incheon,
tomorrow at 4 a.m.

651
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,732
Got it. I'll meet you there.

652
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:18,657
I told you she'd sneak Dr. Kim out.

653
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,743
I'll take care of it myself.

654
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:36,466
This operation will be
a dangerous one, right?

655
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,846
Why? Are you scared?

656
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,267
Is it because of Park Sun-jung?

657
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:49,062
Could you give me some time?

658
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,441
There's something I must tell her.

659
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:55,694
I must talk to her.

660
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,420
Detective Jung?

661
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:21,303
What brings you by?

662
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:26,308
Did something happen?

663
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,484
Detective Jung, what are you doing?

664
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:38,987
Sun-jung.

665
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:48,246
The man who killed your husband...

666
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:52,959
It was me.

667
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,050
What?

668
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,215
What are you talking about?

669
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:03,511
Lee Man-chul, age 31.

670
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:08,475
June 13, 2012, 8:32 p.m.
It was a staged car accident.

671
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:11,603
I was the one

672
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:14,105
who killed him.

673
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:24,532
I killed your husband
with broken glass from the car.

674
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:30,538
Then to make it look like
a traffic accident, I broke his bones,

675
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:34,251
threw him under a moving car

676
01:02:38,046 --> 01:02:41,341
and even killed the driver
to make it look like a DUI accident.

677
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:45,136
-Then with the car...
-Stop.

678
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:51,518
I ran over your husband
when he was already dead.

679
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,818
I needed to stage it as an accident.

680
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:02,070
That's why...

681
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,949
That's why I did that.

682
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:16,251
There's only one reason...

683
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,046
why I'm telling you all this.

684
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,383
A while back,

685
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,387
you said you wanted

686
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:30,765
to ask the killer

687
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:34,936
why he killed your husband
if you ever met him.

688
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:38,481
You said that.

689
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:45,113
To answer...

690
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:48,992
To answer that question...

691
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:02,589
I killed your husband.

692
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,926
He died because of me.

693
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:11,240
I...

694
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:14,768
couldn't get you out of my mind

695
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,188
because I had

696
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,983
developed feelings for you,

697
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:29,908
so your husband...

698
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:36,373
I'm sorry.

699
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:40,960
I'm sorry.

700
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,766
I do not expect you to forgive me.

701
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:58,520
But...

702
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:01,773
But I just...

703
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,319
I'm sorry.

704
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:29,676
I'm sorry. I really am.

705
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:31,719
I'm sorry.

706
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:30,612
Let's go get him.

707
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:55,053
It's 2:30 p.m. now.

708
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:58,806
Senior Inspector Yoo is meeting us here
in five and a half hours.

709
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:02,477
Why don't we go through the plan
and rehearse what we're going to do?

710
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:08,107
Tae-su, do you think the SWAT team
and the Violent Crimes Unit will come too?

711
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:10,068
No, he can't bring them along.

712
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:14,781
Exposing Kim Dong-ho
won't do him any good.

713
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:20,453
Then let's say he brings that prick,
Mr. Cha, and about 20 minions.

714
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:22,580
We'll deal with them first.

715
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:26,042
Oh Jae-won
will probably arrive early, right?

716
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:30,255
Jung-moon. Where would you hide
if you were him?

717
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:36,970
I would hide up there.

718
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,485
I don't see anyone at the moment.

719
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:56,364
We must find Dr. Kim first.

720
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:59,284
We have to take care of him
so we can breathe a little.

721
01:08:00,212 --> 01:08:01,202
Okay?

722
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:08,334
Over there.

723
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:16,259
-Where are you?
-I'm almost there.

724
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:19,304
By the way, where is Kim Dong-ho now?

725
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:22,348
You'll see a boat called Hermes.

726
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:26,227
He's there with the boys. Meet me there.

727
01:08:27,862 --> 01:08:28,813
Look for Hermes.

728
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:40,700
It's time we put an end to this
once and for all, Oh Gu-tak.

729
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:51,002
But why lure them here?

730
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:57,508
To isolate them.
We'll chew them to pieces one by one.

731
01:08:57,884 --> 01:08:58,718
Okay.

732
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:04,349
Hey.

733
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:08,394
You know me, right?

734
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:47,475
I want to handle that guy
they call Mr. Cha. Would that be okay?

735
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,728
-Why?
-Well...

736
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,147
For a little payback.

737
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:54,649
Just trust your luck.

738
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:59,070
You will meet him if you're in luck.

739
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,813
Tae-su and I will take care
of them here. Then what?

740
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:37,316
While the boys are busy hunting,

741
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,194
the mother bird will be left
all alone in the nest.

742
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:49,162
We'll throw some bait.

743
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,956
The kind that will make
the mother bird salivate.

744
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:55,793
Then she'll have no choice
but to crawl out of the nest.

745
01:10:55,877 --> 01:10:59,422
Our location's been exposed.
We're moving Kim Dong-ho.

746
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:16,040
Let's repent for the rest of our lives.

747
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,126
Both you and I.

748
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:38,396
You guys aren't leaving here in one piece.
Got that?

749
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:53,953
Hey, idiot. Your face is all messed up.

750
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:57,248
You're not looking so good yourself.

751
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:44,545
It's unfortunate that
things had to come to this.

752
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:51,302
I knew you'd tell them everything,
Dr. Kim.

753
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:55,806
I always knew
how faint-hearted and weak you were.

754
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:04,690
I wanted to keep you safe
so none of this would happen,

755
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:06,734
but that didn't go so well.

756
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:10,696
I'm sorry, Dr. Kim.

757
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:12,698
This is all my fault.

758
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:19,205
Killing murderers' loved ones.

759
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:20,998
Is that your law?

760
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:27,588
Do you know this saying?

761
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:32,635
"It is the man who sins,

762
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:36,889
but the devil is the one

763
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:39,684
who justifies it."

764
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:46,899
Tolstoy.

765
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:51,529
Tolstoy also said this.

766
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:56,575
"Everyone thinks of changing the world,
but no one thinks of changing himself."

767
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:02,957
I am trying to change the world
by changing myself first.

768
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:08,254
Those who have sinned
must suffer for what they did.

769
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:12,591
That's only fair
for the victims and the bereaved.

770
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:17,555
Don't even try to justify what you did

771
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:22,309
because you're a murderer
no matter what you say.

772
01:15:22,393 --> 01:15:23,728
But I have at least atoned

773
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:28,274
for my mistakes and made it right
for those who had to suffer.

774
01:15:28,816 --> 01:15:31,444
The families of the victims
in the cases I worked on

775
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:34,947
will be haunted by pain, resentment
and sorrow for the rest of their lives.

776
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:37,533
So I did what I could
to lessen their load.

777
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:44,165
That's why I killed all those people.

778
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:52,048
Isn't it funny?

779
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:57,762
I'm the psychopath here,
but you look more like one in my eyes.

780
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:01,432
If all you have is a hammer,
everything looks like a nail.

781
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:05,352
I'll kill you first.

782
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:11,776
Sparing a psychopath like you
won't do this world any good.

783
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:16,280
You're bound to kill someone eventually.

784
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:23,954
You'll kill people
even without me meddling.

785
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:43,390
Why?

786
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:46,644
Why did you kill my daughter, Ji-yeon?

787
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:49,522
Why?

788
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:51,690
You bastard! Why didn't you just kill me?

789
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:54,693
Why? My daughter did nothing wrong!

790
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:57,905
Why? Why did you kill her?

791
01:16:58,364 --> 01:17:00,866
Why? You scumbag!

792
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:18,175
Oh Jae-won.

793
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:24,098
Who do you think you are?

794
01:18:46,597 --> 01:18:47,973
We as humans

795
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:54,813
always tend to justify our mistakes.

796
01:18:55,898 --> 01:19:01,528
You used justice as an excuse
to fulfill your greed.

797
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:03,656
You know that, right?

798
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:11,163
Whether I was right or not,
the world will be the judge.

799
01:19:12,539 --> 01:19:13,707
You have no shame.

800
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:20,881
You may be able to fool a person,
but not the world.

801
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:27,179
Very soon, all the crazy things
you've done will be brought to justice.

802
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:33,894
Arrest him.

803
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:55,791
Commissioner Nam passed away,

804
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:59,670
so it doesn't look like
we can get their sentences reduced.

805
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:02,131
Also...

806
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:09,096
Because of the incident two years ago,
you'll be reprimanded as well.

807
01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:16,895
So what do you suggest we do?

808
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:19,940
Once they wrap up the investigation,

809
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:25,195
just run away.

810
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:31,452
Senior Inspector Yoo.
Are we humans or beasts?

811
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:37,833
Even if we only have one day left to live,
we want to live as humans.

812
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:39,793
That's what we've decided to do.

813
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:49,053
We will accept our punishment
for what we did,

814
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:51,263
repent and beg for forgiveness.

815
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,724
We'll turn over a new leaf.

816
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,310
That's what a nice guy would do.

817
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:01,857
If we're not the bad guys,
the world will see that.

818
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:02,501
Lee Jung-moon is on retrial at the moment.

819
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:06,213
Depending on the results, we'll decide
whether he should be released.

820
01:22:10,551 --> 01:22:11,552
And...

821
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:14,930
there's something else I must tell you.

822
01:22:16,223 --> 01:22:20,602
There's something we found out
while interrogating Oh Jae-won.

823
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:26,733
I believe another serial killer
is linked to this case.

824
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:40,706
I didn't kill this wench.

825
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,334
You got the wrong guy.

826
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:48,839
Kim Yong-hee, age 24.

827
01:22:49,756 --> 01:22:52,885
Her father is Kim Sang-tae,
a robber and murderer in Gangseo,

828
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:55,387
so we assumed Oh Jae-won killed her.

829
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:56,847
But we were wrong.

830
01:22:57,723 --> 01:23:01,768
We've confirmed that
he stopped killing two years ago

831
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:04,897
when Lee Jung-moon was arrested.

832
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:07,858
Another serial murder within this case?

833
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:12,404
Do we have a way to solve this?

834
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:14,198
We do.

835
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:19,745
There is a way.

836
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:38,305
They want to let out the crazy dog again.

837
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:08,460
BAD GUYS

838
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:35,821
At the moment...

839
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:36,738
I think so.

840
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:44,788
-This is...
-Is it a video?

841
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:51,753
Is this where my arm should be?

842
01:25:00,053 --> 01:25:00,971
Action!

843
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:13,317
-Such long legs.
-We're following him again.

844
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:16,361
Bad Guys is a good drama.

845
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:22,200
If everyone wants a second season,
it may happen. Maybe?
