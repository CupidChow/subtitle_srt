1
00:00:19,382 --> 00:00:20,983
Who the hell are you?

2
00:00:25,254 --> 00:00:29,926
Who are all of you? 
Why do you keep following me?

3
00:00:29,926 --> 00:00:32,595
Did President Gim send you here?

4
00:00:33,396 --> 00:00:37,934
Even if you kill me, you won't get any 
money, so why are you always...

5
00:00:51,147 --> 00:00:52,882
You remember me, right?

6
00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:56,085
You...

7
00:00:57,019 --> 00:00:59,021
<i>In my entire life, </i>

8
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:02,758
<i>this is the first time I've been asked
to follow the person who hired me.</i>

9
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:05,695
<i>I'll record everything.</i>

10
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:14,504
<i>We'll see whether you really 
kill someone or not...</i>

11
00:01:28,918 --> 00:01:32,121
You've come rather late. 
By two years.

12
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:37,193
You must already know the 
reason I came to find you.

13
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:40,663
You want to know if I 
recorded any proof,

14
00:01:40,663 --> 00:01:42,932
of whether you're a killer or not.

15
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:46,936
While I was following you,
I saw it very clearly.

16
00:01:46,936 --> 00:01:48,004
As to what kind of a person you are,

17
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:51,874
I guess I'm the one who knows best,

18
00:01:51,874 --> 00:01:53,476
even better than you?

19
00:01:56,012 --> 00:02:01,083
And so? What did you see?

20
00:02:01,884 --> 00:02:06,022
I am not sure how you're 
going to take this.

21
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,159
Lee Jeong Mun, you really are a killer.

22
00:02:12,962 --> 00:02:15,898
You killed those people.

23
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:19,769
The killer in the Hwayeondong 
serial murders was you.

24
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:22,705
Lee Jeong Mun, it was you.

25
00:02:28,978 --> 00:02:32,448
<i>In the beginning, I didn't think
you could be a murderer.</i>

26
00:02:33,783 --> 00:02:35,785
<i>I mean...</i>

27
00:02:35,785 --> 00:02:41,390
<i>why in the world would a serial killer
want someone to record his crimes?</i>

28
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:47,396
I could just make some easy money by
watching a lunatic do some crazy things.

29
00:02:47,396 --> 00:02:50,333
That was the reason I decided
to follow you.

30
00:03:00,476 --> 00:03:02,612
<i>What the hell is that kid up to?</i>

31
00:03:06,883 --> 00:03:11,687
Why you chose those people
and why you wanted to kill them,

32
00:03:11,687 --> 00:03:14,223
don't ask me about any of that stuff.

33
00:03:14,757 --> 00:03:17,560
It was only my job to follow you
and take pictures.

34
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,763
So I don't know anything, and I 
don't want to know either.

35
00:03:20,763 --> 00:03:24,367
If I got too deeply involved, I might 
also end up getting blamed.

36
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:27,303
That would be very risky.

37
00:03:27,303 --> 00:03:32,241
Someone who's too timid to even 
kill a cockroach, that's me.

41
00:03:50,793 --> 00:03:53,996
<i>You would pick someone out
and then quietly follow them.</i>

42
00:03:53,996 --> 00:03:56,132
<i>When that person went home,</i>

43
00:03:56,132 --> 00:04:01,471
<i>you would follow them and then
slip into their house.</i>

44
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:07,877
<i>Then exactly one hour later, 
you would come out of the house.</i>

45
00:04:10,546 --> 00:04:15,084
<i>And all those people you followed, 
without missing a single one...</i>

46
00:04:17,353 --> 00:04:20,956
<i>you killed all 6 of them like that, 
all 6.</i>

47
00:04:24,026 --> 00:04:27,630
How do you feel? 
Pretty horrified, right?

48
00:04:33,903 --> 00:04:37,507
Did you personally see me 
kill those people?

49
00:04:37,507 --> 00:04:39,375
Why should I see that?

50
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:43,513
I just told you quite plainly that
I don't like to stick my neck out.

51
00:04:43,513 --> 00:04:46,048
Since I followed those people,

52
00:04:46,048 --> 00:04:49,118
and then those people were all
found dead later,

53
00:04:49,118 --> 00:04:51,521
that means I'm a killer.

54
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:56,859
Aren't you jumping to conclusions?

55
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:06,068
If you weren't the killer, why did 
you always go back there?

56
00:05:06,068 --> 00:05:10,606
<i>Why were you always hanging around 
a house where someone had died? Why?</i>

57
00:05:15,545 --> 00:05:18,080
And the last one you killed 
was a girl, right?

58
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,885
A high school girl. The daughter of that 
detective in charge of your case.

59
00:05:23,152 --> 00:05:24,620
<i>Remember?</i>

60
00:05:25,555 --> 00:05:26,622
What about her?

61
00:05:26,622 --> 00:05:31,294
That day she died, you were there,
right in front of her house!

62
00:05:31,828 --> 00:05:35,298
<i>That time... you bastard....</i>

63
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,035
What about it?

64
00:05:39,302 --> 00:05:41,571
You were really scary.

65
00:05:42,638 --> 00:05:46,776
<i>It scared me so much,
I nearly peed my pants.</i>

66
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:49,045
<i>What did you see in front of 
her house?</i>

67
00:05:49,712 --> 00:05:56,919
To be honest, you were faking it
back then, weren't you?

68
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:00,656
What did you see? Just tell me.

69
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:04,660
In case the police caught you later on, 
so you could say you didn't remember,

70
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,463
you pretended to be crazy.

71
00:06:07,463 --> 00:06:10,933
Hiring me to take photos and all 
that was just part of your show!

72
00:06:11,734 --> 00:06:13,603
You bastard...

73
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,274
I asked you what you saw.

74
00:06:18,674 --> 00:06:21,611
I must be trash for believing a 
madman like you.

75
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:22,945
I really must be trash.

76
00:06:22,945 --> 00:06:26,949
No matter how much I needed the 
money, I shouldn't have done this...

77
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:30,686
I... I was so scared back then.

78
00:06:30,686 --> 00:06:33,356
I never even went back to 
my office again!

79
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:37,894
What the hell did you see in front
of her house, you bastard?

80
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:50,039
You smiled. You... 
looked at me and smiled...

81
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:18,734
<i>You smiled at me and said...</i>

82
00:07:20,203 --> 00:07:28,611
<i>"I killed them. All of them. 
I killed them all."</i>

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,123
<i>You killed them. 
You wanted to kill me too.
</i>

86
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:16,125
<i>It was you, Lee Jeong Mun!</i>

87
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,597
<i>In fact, aren't you the one who
killed your parents too?
</i>

88
00:08:21,597 --> 00:08:24,801
<i>And after you killed them,
you pretended not to remember.</i>

89
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:48,558
What car is this?

90
00:08:48,558 --> 00:08:50,827
Why would I get out of this car?

91
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:55,765
<i>It was probably a friend or an 
accomplice's car, wasn't it?</i>

92
00:08:56,699 --> 00:08:58,568
<i>Why do you think that?</i>

93
00:09:01,637 --> 00:09:07,910
<i>Every time you got out of that car, 
you would kill someone.</i>

94
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,667
<i>A high school girl. The daughter of that
detective in charge of your case.</i>

95
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:35,938
<i>That day she died, you were there,
right in front of her house!</i>

96
00:09:36,205 --> 00:09:38,875
<i>Anyway, be sure to come 
home early today.</i>

97
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:42,078
<i>Your dad's going to make the army 
base stew that you like so much.</i>

98
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:43,012
<i>Really?</i>

99
00:09:43,012 --> 00:09:47,550
<i>What's going on with you? You're 
even cooking for your daughter?</i>

100
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,154
<i>Since I have to be leaving soon,
are you already missing me?</i>

101
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,837
<i>My daughter, what's going on?
You aren't answering your phone. </i>

102
00:10:07,837 --> 00:10:10,773
<i>You were supposed to come home
early because you're leaving in 
the morning.</i>

103
00:10:10,773 --> 00:10:14,110
<i>Listen, something urgent came up
and I have to go out for a while.</i>

104
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,980
<i>Eat as soon as you get home.
The army base stew is ready.</i>

105
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,849
<i>I'll be home in a little while.</i>

106
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,054
<i>The method of murder was 
exactly the same.</i>

107
00:10:25,054 --> 00:10:27,857
<i>But why was she killed outside?</i>

108
00:10:27,857 --> 00:10:31,327
<i>Why didn't he kill her inside the house?</i>

109
00:10:31,327 --> 00:10:33,863
<i>Why did he do that to my Ji Yeon?</i>

110
00:10:34,397 --> 00:10:37,333
<i>Ji Yeon was also killed at her home.</i>

111
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:44,140
<i>Then why was my Ji Yeon outside?</i>

112
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,142
<i>Why was it like she was thrown out?</i>

113
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,479
<i>I just don't know.</i>

114
00:10:51,747 --> 00:11:04,293
<i>She wasn't even able to eat her
favorite meal that I made for her
before going away.</i>

115
00:11:04,694 --> 00:11:07,897
<i>As a father, I'm worthless. </i>

116
00:11:07,897 --> 00:11:10,967
<i>My daughter is going far away. </i>

117
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:18,174
<i>My only daughter is going to 
see her mother in Heaven,</i>

118
00:11:22,044 --> 00:11:29,118
<i>but she left before I could even
give her a meal to eat.</i>

119
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,339
<i>I can't forgive myself. </i>

120
00:11:51,274 --> 00:11:53,943
<i>This is the only way.</i>

121
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:58,614
<i>The bastard who murdered Ji Yeon...</i>

122
00:11:59,415 --> 00:12:02,885
<i>after I catch him and kill him...</i>

123
00:12:03,553 --> 00:12:12,495
<i>I'm going to kneel down in front of 
my Ji Yeon's funeral portrait and beg, </i>

124
00:12:15,832 --> 00:12:18,901
<i>"I'm sorry your father is 
so worthless."</i>

125
00:12:19,702 --> 00:12:25,441
<i>I will beg her to understand her
useless father,</i>

126
00:12:25,441 --> 00:12:29,178
<i>and beg her to forgive me.</i>

127
00:12:29,712 --> 00:12:39,188
<i>That's what... that's what I
would beg of my Ji Yeon.</i>

128
00:13:18,027 --> 00:13:21,230
Lee Jeong Mun, what do you 
think you're doing?

129
00:13:22,298 --> 00:13:25,234
I heard that one of our team 
members ran away for no reason.

130
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:27,503
Why did you do that, Jeong Mun?

131
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:28,971
What are you doing here?

132
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:31,107
I think I just asked you why
you did that.

133
00:13:31,774 --> 00:13:33,776
For what reason did you disappear
without telling anyone?

134
00:13:33,776 --> 00:13:35,778
You're not in very good shape.

135
00:13:38,981 --> 00:13:41,784
I guess it will be just like
3 years ago,

136
00:13:41,784 --> 00:13:43,786
with you and with me.

137
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,256
"No matter what crazy things I do, 
it doesn't matter."

138
00:13:47,256 --> 00:13:50,993
"Whatever happens, I will be 
acquitted by psychiatric evaluation."

139
00:13:50,993 --> 00:13:54,730
"Why? Because I'm a psychopath."

140
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:57,400
That's what you're thinking, 
Lee Jeong Mun.

141
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,001
Isn't it?

142
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:08,744
Are you finished?

143
00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:23,960
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

144
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,896
No. After being on the front line
for so long,

145
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:29,165
isn't it expected for you to handle 
your own issues?

146
00:14:29,165 --> 00:14:31,167
You don't need to be concerned.

147
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,968
But still...

148
00:14:31,968 --> 00:14:35,838
You will learn that I don't care about 
things like that, Inspector Yu.
Understand?

149
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,914
You all go back to the hospital now.
I need to take care of something first.

150
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:01,998
What? Do you have something
else to say?

151
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:04,267
There's something I want to ask you.

152
00:15:19,348 --> 00:15:21,083
Go ahead and ask me.

153
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:25,087
You had something to ask me, 
so just say it.

154
00:15:26,422 --> 00:15:31,627
What kind of relationship do you 
have with Lee Jeong Mun?

155
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:35,231
Nothing special.

156
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:39,635
The last time...
and then this time...

157
00:15:39,635 --> 00:15:42,038
it seems like there's some kind
of unusual history there.

158
00:15:42,705 --> 00:15:46,976
I was the prosecutor in charge of 
Lee Jeong Mun's case.

159
00:15:46,976 --> 00:15:49,912
You mean the Hwayeondong 
serial murder case?

160
00:15:49,912 --> 00:15:51,914
No. It was before that.

161
00:15:51,914 --> 00:15:55,384
The first time Lee Jeong Mun killed 
someone, I was in charge of the case.

162
00:15:55,384 --> 00:15:57,787
The first time he killed someone?

163
00:15:58,187 --> 00:16:01,257
Then you're saying before that case...

164
00:16:01,257 --> 00:16:06,062
Three years ago, Lee Jeong Mun was 
just an ordinary graduate student.

165
00:16:08,331 --> 00:16:13,002
<i>It was that case that awakened the 
psychopath in Lee Jeong Mun.</i>

166
00:16:13,002 --> 00:16:17,406
<i>It all took place on September 19, 2011.</i>

167
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:47,436
<i>Hey, there isn't anything here.</i>

168
00:16:47,436 --> 00:16:50,506
<i>Same here. Let's go.</i>

169
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:12,528
<i>Why was it my house?</i>

170
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:26,943
<i>Why was it my house?</i>

171
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:33,883
<i>Wait a minute. Even if Lee Jeong Mun
killed those thieves, </i>

172
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:36,552
it really seems like a case of 
self-defense.

173
00:17:36,552 --> 00:17:39,222
Yes. It really was self-defense.

174
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:41,224
To defend the lawful rights and 
interests of yourself or others,

175
00:17:41,224 --> 00:17:43,493
and defend against illegal trespass,
you are entitled to

176
00:17:43,493 --> 00:17:44,560
a reasonable self-defense.

177
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,096
The police handling the case 
certainly thought so.

178
00:17:47,096 --> 00:17:48,965
At least they did until seeing
the crime scene.

179
00:18:17,527 --> 00:18:19,929
Penal Code section 21, paragraph 2.

180
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:22,064
In order to safeguard your own 
lawful rights and interests,

181
00:18:22,064 --> 00:18:25,401
an excessive retaliation against those 
who infringe upon your lawful rights,

182
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:29,005
is not recognized as self-defense.
That's what the provision states.

183
00:18:29,005 --> 00:18:31,407
An excessive retaliation against
someone who has attacked you,

184
00:18:31,407 --> 00:18:33,810
that's excessive force.

185
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,013
That applies to Lee Jeong Mun.

186
00:18:37,013 --> 00:18:39,949
That's the kind of case I took.

187
00:18:39,949 --> 00:18:42,885
So, how did you handle it?

188
00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:44,487
To sum it all up,

189
00:18:44,487 --> 00:18:46,756
I dismissed the arrest warrant 
and released Lee Jeong Mun.

190
00:18:46,756 --> 00:18:47,824
What was the reason?

191
00:18:47,824 --> 00:18:51,294
After walking in on the scene of 
his parents' murder,

192
00:18:51,294 --> 00:18:54,230
I felt it was an understandable
response that anyone might make.

193
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,766
And more importantly, at that time, 
Lee Jeong Mun,

194
00:18:56,766 --> 00:18:58,768
wasn't considered a murderer, 
but mentally ill.

195
00:19:02,835 --> 00:19:04,203
-=PCL-R Psychopathic 
Personality Checklist Results=-

196
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,646
<i>You're a psychopath, Lee Jeong Mun.</i>

197
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:14,650
<i>Psychopathic murderers are 
mentally ill.</i>

198
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,652
That's an interesting way to look at it.

199
00:19:16,652 --> 00:19:19,188
Surely you don't still believe that?

200
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:21,457
I couldn't.

201
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:24,393
Lee Jeong Mun, whom I had released
as being mentally ill,

202
00:19:24,393 --> 00:19:27,864
went on to become the serial killer
in the Hwayeondong case.

203
00:19:27,864 --> 00:19:29,732
Yes. That's right.

204
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:33,603
So when the Hwayeondong case
happened, I resigned my position.

205
00:19:33,603 --> 00:19:36,005
I know it was my fault.

206
00:19:37,607 --> 00:19:41,210
Now I will never make that same
mistake again.

207
00:19:43,212 --> 00:19:47,216
What do you mean by that?

208
00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:52,555
Why do you think I joined this team?

209
00:19:55,491 --> 00:19:57,894
Just a moment.

210
00:19:57,894 --> 00:19:59,629
Yes, this is Yu Mi Yeong.

211
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:04,967
What did you say?

212
00:20:26,455 --> 00:20:28,191
When did you come?

213
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:35,131
Jeong Mun... I have something 
to ask you.

214
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:43,005
When you beat to death those 
bastards who murdered your parents,

215
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:45,141
how did it make you feel?

216
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:57,286
Happy? Sad? 
Or just empty?

217
00:21:01,824 --> 00:21:05,561
You are more experienced than I am.

218
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:13,169
Tell me. When you killed those
bastards, how did it feel?

219
00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:22,245
When my daughter died, Jeong Mun...

220
00:21:22,245 --> 00:21:25,448
at first, I was a complete wreck.

221
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:32,388
My daughter had died, so how could
I swallow food or even fall asleep?

222
00:21:32,388 --> 00:21:37,994
If it was too hot to sleep, should I 
turn on the fan, or cover myself if
it was too cold...

223
00:21:39,195 --> 00:21:42,532
I was preoccupied with absurd 
things like that.

224
00:21:42,932 --> 00:21:46,536
I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep.

225
00:21:47,203 --> 00:21:53,609
Just like that. Just drifting along,
feeling empty and hollow.

226
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:55,478
Just like a piece of trash.

227
00:21:56,813 --> 00:22:01,350
But after living like that for 
a few days,

228
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:05,087
I somehow started unconsciously 
to take care of myself.

229
00:22:05,087 --> 00:22:10,426
Eating 3 meals a day, going to bed
and waking up on time,

230
00:22:10,426 --> 00:22:14,430
washing my hair, shaving my face,
and even exercised when I had time.

231
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:19,368
I turned on the fan when I was hot,
and the heater when I was cold.

232
00:22:20,703 --> 00:22:26,175
Like that. I lived just like that.

233
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:40,456
At that time, why did I do all that?

234
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:48,998
There was only one reason.

235
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:53,803
Because when I met the bastard
who murdered my Ji Yeon,

236
00:22:53,803 --> 00:23:00,209
I wanted to be stronger than him,
so I could take my revenge.

237
00:23:25,168 --> 00:23:27,170
Do you think I'm the one?

238
00:23:29,438 --> 00:23:34,911
Do you think I'm the one who
killed your daughter, Oh Ji Yeon?

239
00:23:37,847 --> 00:23:42,118
<i>Why? Do you still think you're 
innocent?</i>

240
00:23:42,118 --> 00:23:44,654
<i>Oh Gu Tak, what do you 
think about that?</i>

241
00:23:48,658 --> 00:23:50,927
<i>I'm hopeful.</i>

242
00:23:55,198 --> 00:23:58,267
<i>Damn. I don't know either.</i>

243
00:24:01,604 --> 00:24:03,473
<i>That's how I am.</i>

244
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:10,813
<i>I hope so too, 
but I don't really know.</i>

245
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,819
Why did you come to find me
in the first place?

246
00:24:16,819 --> 00:24:23,226
When you visited me in prison,
why did you mention Yu Jin?

247
00:24:23,226 --> 00:24:25,228
<i>Why should I feel sorry?</i>

248
00:24:25,228 --> 00:24:33,903
<i>That's what the detective in charge 
of my case told me. He said you 
should be sorry to me.</i>

249
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:41,377
I asked you this before.

250
00:24:42,979 --> 00:24:45,515
<i>Every time I see you, Oh Gu Tak,</i>

251
00:24:45,515 --> 00:24:49,252
<i>I wonder the same thing about you...</i>

252
00:24:50,586 --> 00:24:52,455
<i>Just what are you thinking?</i>

253
00:24:59,662 --> 00:25:01,797
What do you want from me?

254
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:05,001
The truth or someone to hate?

255
00:25:09,138 --> 00:25:14,076
If you want the truth, 
then help me one last time.

256
00:25:14,076 --> 00:25:19,949
If you want to hate someone,
then just pull the trigger.

257
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:25,555
Hurry up and kill me.

258
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:20,409
If there's hate once we figure out 
the truth, what happens then?

259
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:25,348
Then do as you will.

260
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:35,091
Check out this car for me.

261
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:48,571
I'm giving you one last chance.

262
00:26:58,181 --> 00:27:02,451
What that car was... 
he didn't ask.

263
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:16,426
<i>Please spare me!</i>

264
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,962
<i>Why do you all ask me to 
spare you?</i>

265
00:27:18,962 --> 00:27:20,697
<i>I have to kill you.</i>

266
00:27:23,233 --> 00:27:25,369
What was the cause of death?

267
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:26,738
Suicide by hanging.

268
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:28,438
Suicide?

269
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:32,709
Are you sure?

270
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:34,177
What?

271
00:27:34,177 --> 00:27:38,582
There would be a V-shaped bruise on 
the neck if it was a hanging.

272
00:27:38,582 --> 00:27:41,919
Why does this person have a
U-shaped mark?

273
00:27:43,253 --> 00:27:47,925
This clearly indicates he was 
strangled from behind.

274
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:53,263
<i>The bruising on the neck and the
broken fingernails show signs of 
resistance.</i>

275
00:27:53,263 --> 00:27:57,668
<i>This is evidence that he was fighting 
for his life against a stronger force.</i>

276
00:27:57,668 --> 00:28:00,203
This was obviously a homicide, 
so do you think processing it

277
00:28:00,203 --> 00:28:02,205
as a suicide makes any sense?

278
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,142
First, we should get an autopsy.

279
00:28:05,676 --> 00:28:07,811
I haven't heard anything like that.

280
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:09,947
What did you say?

281
00:28:09,947 --> 00:28:13,150
No one said anything about doing 
an autopsy.

282
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,486
You've heard me say it now, 
so let's get on with it.

283
00:28:18,355 --> 00:28:22,893
He's someone with no family.

284
00:28:22,893 --> 00:28:30,100
The only instructions I received were to
have him cremated and throw his ashes
into the nearest river.

285
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,969
So that's what we'll do.

286
00:28:32,236 --> 00:28:33,570
Put him away.

287
00:28:36,106 --> 00:28:41,578
Look here. Who was it who
gave you those instructions?

288
00:28:41,578 --> 00:28:46,250
Those orders came from someone
higher up than you.

289
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,518
Don't strain yourself trying to 
look up there.

290
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:51,188
Just keep living your life while 
looking at the ground.

291
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:55,859
If you're pointlessly looking upward, 
it will only cause you to suffer,

292
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,861
Inspector Yu Mi Yeong.

293
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,302
-=Morgue=-

294
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:15,612
What was the cause of death?

295
00:29:19,082 --> 00:29:23,220
By the look on your face, 
I think I know how the story goes.

296
00:29:25,622 --> 00:29:29,760
Commissioner Nam Gu Hyeon 
is a good man.

297
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,495
He worked his way up,

298
00:29:31,495 --> 00:29:34,965
and for that reason, 
people really respect him.

299
00:29:34,965 --> 00:29:38,168
But occasionally, Commissioner Nam 
can be somewhat reckless,

300
00:29:38,168 --> 00:29:40,037
just like this time.

301
00:29:40,971 --> 00:29:45,509
Are you telling me this to see 
how I react?

302
00:29:45,509 --> 00:29:48,045
You remember what you asked
me before, right?

303
00:29:48,045 --> 00:29:51,515
Why do you think I wanted
to work with this team?

304
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:56,453
To help facilitate the prosecution 
of the Special Crime Investigation 
Unit's cases.

305
00:29:56,853 --> 00:29:59,790
Inspector Yu Mi Yeong, you're 
more naive than I expected.

306
00:30:00,457 --> 00:30:02,859
Think about it carefully.

307
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:03,794
Do you really think I'm someone

308
00:30:03,794 --> 00:30:08,198
who would join for a reason you 
would only see in the movies?

309
00:30:08,198 --> 00:30:12,336
Then what was your real reason 
for joining the team?

310
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:19,276
It's very simple. I intend to dissolve 
the Special Crime Investigation Unit.

311
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,879
This team should either self-destruct,

312
00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:24,081
or just disappear quietly.

313
00:30:24,081 --> 00:30:26,617
That is what you should 
figure out how to do.

314
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:29,152
I can only tell you this.

315
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,822
If you can get that team disbanded,

316
00:30:31,822 --> 00:30:34,891
I will support you in any way I can.

317
00:30:37,027 --> 00:30:40,631
You don't have to be actively involved
if you think about it like this...

318
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,633
Pak Ung Cheol, Jeong Tae Su,
Lee Jeong Mun,

319
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:46,370
and even Commissioner Nam Gu 
Hyeon and Squad Leader Oh Gu Tak,

320
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:49,439
those guys are all nuclear bombs.

321
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:51,308
Although a nuclear bomb
can stop a war,

322
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:54,378
it can also start one, Inspector Yu.

323
00:30:54,378 --> 00:30:58,515
Why are you telling me all this?

324
00:30:58,515 --> 00:31:01,050
Your support in the Seoul District 
Office may be on the line now,
(from Commissioner Nam)

325
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,920
but if you just let it collapse,

326
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,256
you may find you have a supporter
on the Supreme Court instead.
(if Prosecutor Oh gets promoted)

327
00:31:06,256 --> 00:31:09,192
But it's your decision to make.

328
00:31:12,396 --> 00:31:13,730
Inspector Yu.

329
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,272
I heard that the day before that man 
died, someone went to visit him.

330
00:31:28,145 --> 00:31:31,882
Is there some reason I can't go
visit that guy?

331
00:31:31,882 --> 00:31:38,956
No. But Commissioner, the day after
you went there, he committed suicide.

332
00:31:46,964 --> 00:31:54,838
That guy laughed.
He looked right at me and smirked.

333
00:31:55,906 --> 00:31:58,976
Everyone always says it's 
difficult to forgive someone,

334
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:02,312
but I wanted to try to forgive
him anyway.

335
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,784
Like a person. Like a man.

336
00:32:07,784 --> 00:32:11,121
I sat right across from him.

337
00:32:11,655 --> 00:32:16,460
Okay. If you do your time in here
and truly repent what you've done,

338
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,663
if you do that, I will forgive you.

339
00:32:20,464 --> 00:32:22,599
That's what I wanted to say to him.

340
00:32:25,936 --> 00:32:33,277
But instead... that guy looked at
me and said,

341
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:38,348
"I'm going to strengthen my body,
and come see you when I get out."

342
00:32:38,348 --> 00:32:41,285
"Make sure you live until then."

343
00:32:41,285 --> 00:32:43,553
What do you call that?

344
00:32:52,629 --> 00:32:54,231
Have one.

345
00:32:57,701 --> 00:33:01,705
Take it. I'm offering it to you.

346
00:33:01,705 --> 00:33:03,974
I want to ask you something, 
Commissioner.

347
00:33:03,974 --> 00:33:05,709
First have a drink, then ask.

348
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:09,980
I need to ask you first, so I can
feel more at ease.

349
00:33:16,253 --> 00:33:17,721
Then ask me.

350
00:33:18,521 --> 00:33:23,727
Why did you pick me to join the
Special Crimes Investigation Unit?

351
00:33:34,938 --> 00:33:39,610
Because you're smart...
and also ambitious.

352
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:44,815
What do you mean by that?

353
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:49,485
Smart people don't see the world
as it really is.

354
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,023
They're only focused on what
they are interested in,

355
00:33:54,023 --> 00:33:57,094
and they will make that their
world for a long time.

356
00:33:57,628 --> 00:34:03,900
They have no idea what the world
is like for ordinary people.

357
00:34:04,301 --> 00:34:08,438
Ambitious people take no notice
of others,

358
00:34:08,438 --> 00:34:11,909
because they're too desperate to
feed their own ambition.

359
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:17,381
What others might want.
What others are hoping for...

360
00:34:17,381 --> 00:34:22,452
they don't want to see those things
and they will never see them.

361
00:34:22,452 --> 00:34:24,054
<i>It's that way.</i>

362
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:31,395
You're saying because I don't 
understand the world and don't 
understand other people,

363
00:34:31,395 --> 00:34:33,397
that's why you chose me?

364
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:41,805
What? That's not as bad 
as it sounds.

365
00:34:43,407 --> 00:34:45,676
Under my hand, you will be
able to learn,

366
00:34:45,676 --> 00:34:48,078
just as you obviously learned so
well at the university.

367
00:34:48,078 --> 00:34:51,815
Later on, you will be able to rise 
through the ranks and...

368
00:34:51,815 --> 00:34:57,688
No. It's not that way, Commissioner. 
That's really not how...

369
00:35:03,026 --> 00:35:04,494
I'm sorry.

370
00:35:14,371 --> 00:35:18,242
In order to win the residents'
hearts and trust...
[-=Police Chief Swearing-In=-]

371
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:20,777
<i>the Gangseo police fulfill a 
variety of duties.</i>

372
00:35:20,777 --> 00:35:25,716
<i>They must have strong ability and 
be accredited in police sciences.</i>

373
00:35:25,716 --> 00:35:26,917
<i>These are my expectations.</i>

374
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:31,989
<i>To gain the hearts and trust
of the residents...</i>

375
00:35:31,989 --> 00:35:34,391
Is this old man ever going 
to shut up?

376
00:35:34,391 --> 00:35:36,260
<i>Hearts and trust!</i>

377
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,863
There are four social evils that the
police should work to eradicate,

378
00:35:39,863 --> 00:35:43,066
<i>if they strive to gain the hearts
and trust of the public.</i>

<i>Pak Chang Jun! Chang Jun! 
Chang Jun where are you?</i>

380
00:35:49,873 --> 00:35:54,678
You dumb, big ugly guy!
Your hyeongnim is here!

381
00:35:54,678 --> 00:35:55,879
Chang Jun!

382
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:56,947
What are you doing here?

383
00:35:56,947 --> 00:36:01,218
I'm here looking for someone.
Please don't let me interrupt you.

384
00:36:01,218 --> 00:36:03,620
Hearts and trust.

385
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,222
Chang Jun!

386
00:36:05,222 --> 00:36:06,957
What? What do you want?

387
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,825
Chang Jun!

388
00:36:08,825 --> 00:36:11,495
What am I doing, kid?
Of course I came to see you.

389
00:36:11,495 --> 00:36:12,963
Come out for a moment.

390
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:19,636
In other words, you want me to
find out who this car belongs to.

391
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:22,973
Just for this, did you have to 
cause such a scene?

392
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:25,375
You didn't want to be there either.

393
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:28,979
Some bullshit about hearts and trust...

394
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:31,782
They probably won't even pay 
for your lunch.

395
00:36:31,782 --> 00:36:34,318
That's Mad Dog Oh Gu Tak.

396
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:36,453
I thought your dog days were
far behind you.

397
00:36:36,453 --> 00:36:38,055
Hyeongnim, you....

398
00:36:38,055 --> 00:36:39,256
Hang on a minute.

399
00:36:41,221 --> 00:36:43,660
-=Vehicle registered owner:
Cha Jin Man=-

400
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,063
This is Cha Jin Man's car.

401
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:48,599
Do you know him?

402
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:51,668
Not very well. This guy runs
an illegal taxi service.

403
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:52,603
An illegal taxi?

404
00:36:52,603 --> 00:36:54,071
Yeah, an illegal taxi.

405
00:36:54,071 --> 00:36:57,541
But why are you looking for him?
Has he done something?

406
00:36:57,541 --> 00:37:01,011
Just print out everything you have
for me. Quickly.

407
00:37:05,148 --> 00:37:06,350
Here you go.

408
00:37:08,752 --> 00:37:09,953
Thanks. Let's have a drink sometime.

409
00:37:09,953 --> 00:37:11,822
Hyeongnim!

410
00:37:11,822 --> 00:37:13,290
What?

411
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,959
Well, I just....

412
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:17,961
I'm busy. Spit it out.

413
00:37:19,162 --> 00:37:22,232
I haven't kept in touch with you.
I'm sorry.

414
00:37:22,232 --> 00:37:25,569
You never contacted me, 
but I never contacted you either.

415
00:37:25,569 --> 00:37:28,105
Because when I see you, 
it reminds me of my Ji Yeon.

416
00:37:29,306 --> 00:37:31,174
Hyeongnim.

417
00:37:31,174 --> 00:37:34,511
Aigoo. Whether it's 2 years
ago or now,

418
00:37:34,511 --> 00:37:37,180
what's going on with this office?

419
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,983
That old flower pot and that sofa...

420
00:37:39,983 --> 00:37:43,987
Try decorating this place.
It looks tacky.

421
00:37:43,987 --> 00:37:45,188
I'm going.

422
00:37:57,601 --> 00:38:01,071
If I try leaving here, Inspector Yu 
will know immediately.

423
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:02,272
Lift up your foot.

424
00:38:03,473 --> 00:38:05,342
Don't make me bend over.

425
00:38:05,342 --> 00:38:07,477
Lift your foot up here, kid.

426
00:38:19,623 --> 00:38:21,892
That car you were in is an 
illegal taxi.

427
00:38:21,892 --> 00:38:24,027
It's called an illegal taxi,

428
00:38:24,027 --> 00:38:27,097
because it's someone's private car, 
so of course it's illegal.

429
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:30,701
The vehicle's owner is Cha Jin Man. 
He's been in business for 4 years.

430
00:38:30,701 --> 00:38:33,237
It shouldn't be a problem to find 
the car or the owner.

431
00:38:33,237 --> 00:38:35,639
After you see Cha Jin Man, 
confirm what he looks like.

432
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:38,308
See if it's the same guy from
3 years ago.

433
00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:40,444
Where can I go to see him?

434
00:38:41,378 --> 00:38:43,914
Why go anywhere?
I said he comes if you call him.

435
00:38:43,914 --> 00:38:45,515
I already called him and he will come,

436
00:38:45,515 --> 00:38:46,850
as long as he's interested in
making money.

437
00:38:50,854 --> 00:38:53,257
Did you call?

438
00:38:53,257 --> 00:38:55,525
You really got here on time!

439
00:38:55,525 --> 00:38:59,930
We need to go to Yongsan. 
About how long does that take?

440
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:04,735
<i>Take care now!</i>

441
00:39:11,942 --> 00:39:14,745
It's not rush hour yet, so it 
shouldn't take very long.

442
00:39:14,745 --> 00:39:16,213
This way.

443
00:39:19,416 --> 00:39:20,617
Please get in.

444
00:39:27,024 --> 00:39:31,028
What? Aren't you feeling well? 
What's wrong?

445
00:39:33,678 --> 00:39:34,097
No, it's nothing.

446
00:39:34,097 --> 00:39:39,570
Did you see something you 
shouldn't... Cha Jin Man?

447
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,052
You know me, don't you?

448
00:39:55,052 --> 00:39:56,653
Please let me go!

449
00:39:56,653 --> 00:39:57,854
If I tell you that, then...

450
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:01,858
I just drove you to Hwayeondong
and other nearby neighborhoods!

451
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,193
I don't know anything else!

452
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:06,263
It was only Doctor Gim's orders!

453
00:40:06,263 --> 00:40:07,731
Dr. Gim?

454
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,536
Who is that person?

455
00:40:16,273 --> 00:40:18,809
<i>It was probably about 3 years ago.</i>

456
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:23,614
<i>He said he'd pay me triple the rate
to work for him exclusively.</i>

457
00:40:23,614 --> 00:40:24,548
<i>Doing what?</i>

458
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:28,552
<i>After his sessions were over, 
I was to drive him to Hwayeondong. </i>

459
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:31,622
<i>Sometimes he wanted to go to 
Yeokchondong or Sinsadong. </i>

460
00:40:31,622 --> 00:40:34,691
<i>And so? What would I do?</i>

461
00:40:34,691 --> 00:40:36,693
<i>Although it wasn't the same
place every time, </i>

462
00:40:36,693 --> 00:40:39,096
<i>you knew exactly where you
wanted to go.</i>

463
00:40:39,096 --> 00:40:43,634
<i>Wherever you said to stop, 
I would let you out. </i>

464
00:40:43,634 --> 00:40:46,036
<i>Ever since I stopped driving this
customer around, </i>

465
00:40:46,036 --> 00:40:49,773
<i>I haven't had any further contact
with that doctor. Really!</i>

466
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:52,576
<i>Where is the hospital where 
I was being treated?</i>

467
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:56,446
<i>It was on the other side of Guro.
I remember where it is.</i>

468
00:40:56,446 --> 00:41:00,984
<i>Why was he going to the hospital? 
What were they treating him for?</i>

469
00:41:01,348 --> 00:41:06,553
-=Yeon Seong Psychiatric Clinic=-

470

00:41:21,004 --> 00:41:24,474
What is it? Are you able to 
remember something?

472
00:41:25,542 --> 00:41:27,411
We have to go inside to
find out, right?

473
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:39,556
Welcome. Do you have 
an appointment?

<i>Do you have an appointment?</i>

475
00:41:45,562 --> 00:41:48,231
<i>Oh, we haven't seen you in a while. </i>

476
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:52,369
Is the doctor here?

477
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:54,638
What? Yes.

<i>I didn't come here by myself.</i>

480
00:42:17,995 --> 00:42:19,329
What?

481
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:23,867
Someone else... always came
here with me.

482
00:42:23,867 --> 00:42:26,670
Who was it? Do you remember?

Please answer my questions and
we can finish quickly.

How long have you worked
at this clinic?

Almost two years.

489
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:27,264
Then do you know the person who 
worked here before you?

490

You are talking about 
Dr. Gim Dong Ho?

491
00:43:36,073 --> 00:43:41,411
I'm a little anxious. May I ask 
where I might find that person?

The master won't die just 
because his dog bites him.

502
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:50,948
=I have something to add to that.=

503
00:44:50,948 --> 00:44:58,021
If that dog runs away from home, 
it will find another master.

504
00:44:58,021 --> 00:45:00,691
And like you said before,

505
00:45:00,691 --> 00:45:06,163
As long as it wags its tail, the new 
master will be pleased with it.

506
00:45:06,964 --> 00:45:07,898
Right now are you...

507
00:45:07,898 --> 00:45:13,103
=But what about the first master?
He'd probably feel sad, right?=

508
00:45:13,103 --> 00:45:17,641
Because his dog isn't there to 
wag its tail for him anymore.

509
00:45:20,978 --> 00:45:25,382
I'm grateful for our time together,
Commissioner Nam Gu Hyeon.

510
00:45:45,102 --> 00:45:46,299
-=Prosecutor Oh Jae Won=-

511
00:45:50,607 --> 00:45:52,209
Yes, Prosecutor Oh.

512
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:58,215
That offer of your support, 
is it still open?

513
00:46:22,906 --> 00:46:25,709
Are you really prepared to 
change sides?

514
00:46:28,645 --> 00:46:30,247
Of course.

515
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:34,785
But... I have a condition.

516
00:46:35,986 --> 00:46:39,856
We need to work together on this, 
not just you watching me.

517
00:46:39,856 --> 00:46:42,659
You don't want to become the 
scapegoat, is that it?

518
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:45,862
I want you to be my running mate.

519
00:46:47,598 --> 00:46:49,733
Tie your shoelaces very tightly.

520
00:46:49,733 --> 00:46:52,135
If you fall down, I'm not going
to help you up.

521
00:46:58,675 --> 00:47:00,944
<i>Our plan isn't difficult.</i>

522
00:47:00,944 --> 00:47:03,880
<i>Just like water dripping on a 
stone will wear it away.</i>

523
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,950
<i>If the rock is very hard, 
it may take more time. </i>

524
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:11,622
<i>But the Special Crimes Investigation 
Unit is already covered with cracks.</i>

525
00:47:11,622 --> 00:47:14,558
<i>A weathered rock only held 
together by a bit of moss, </i>

526
00:47:14,558 --> 00:47:16,426
<i>it's really not much different.</i>

527
00:47:16,426 --> 00:47:20,297
<i>Even one more drop would be 
enough to make it crumble.</i>

528
00:47:21,498 --> 00:47:23,367
Why are you suddenly dropping by?

529
00:47:23,367 --> 00:47:27,237
<i>When I see Pak Ung Cheol, 
what should I ask him?</i>

530
00:47:27,237 --> 00:47:31,642
<i>You should ask him who put out 
the contract on Lee Jeong Mun,
of course.</i>

531
00:47:32,442 --> 00:47:36,446
<i>What? Are you surprised I
know about that?</i>

532
00:47:36,446 --> 00:47:38,048
<i>There are no secrets in this world.</i>

533
00:47:38,048 --> 00:47:40,717
<i>Even they all thought it 
was their own secret. </i>

534
00:47:42,586 --> 00:47:47,124
<i>Pak Ung Cheol and Jeong Tae Su 
both received orders to kill 
Lee Jeong Mun,</i>

535
00:47:47,124 --> 00:47:48,191
<i>didn't they?</i>

536
00:47:48,191 --> 00:47:52,329
You want to know who asked Du Gwang 
hyeong to kill Lee Jeong Mun?

537
00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:55,132
I don't know. I wish I did know.

538
00:47:55,132 --> 00:47:57,534
Have you ever thought about
it carefully?

539
00:47:57,534 --> 00:48:01,805
Whether there might have been 
some clue you never noticed.

540
00:48:02,739 --> 00:48:06,343
There was one thing he said in 
the very beginning.

541
00:48:06,743 --> 00:48:09,947
An elder brother that I know...

542
00:48:09,947 --> 00:48:15,953
<i>...it seems his daughter was a victim of 
that Hwayeongdong serial killing bastard.</i>

543
00:48:15,953 --> 00:48:18,755
<i>How will finding the person who 
wanted Lee Jeong Mun killed,</i>

544
00:48:18,755 --> 00:48:22,759
<i>have anything to do with dissolving
the Special Crimes Investigation Unit?</i>

545
00:48:22,759 --> 00:48:25,829
<i>Because this is the biggest crack.</i>

546
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:28,632
<i>When we find out who was behind 
the order to kill Lee Jeong Mun,</i>

547
00:48:28,632 --> 00:48:31,835
<i>the Special Crime Investigation 
Unit will naturally crumble.</i>

548
00:48:33,971 --> 00:48:39,176
When I was first commissioned to
kill Psycho, it was 2 years ago.

549
00:48:39,176 --> 00:48:40,644
What do you mean by that?

550
00:48:40,644 --> 00:48:44,200
Two years ago, Lee Jeong Mun and I

551
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:49,186
were in Cheongsong prison 
at the same time.

552
00:48:55,859 --> 00:49:03,333
<i>That's when someone tried to 
hire me to kill Lee Jeong Mun.</i>

553
00:49:03,333 --> 00:49:06,003
You don't know who it was
who placed the order?

554
00:49:07,471 --> 00:49:08,805
That I don't know.

555
00:49:09,339 --> 00:49:13,610
I don't know... but I know who
the contact was.

556
00:49:25,222 --> 00:49:26,823
Pak Jun Cheol.

557
00:49:31,361 --> 00:49:35,098
Two years ago, you received a 
contract to kill this man, right?

558
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:40,971
So at that time, you had Jeong Tae Su 
transferred to the same prison as him.

559
00:49:43,774 --> 00:49:45,242
Is that right?

560
00:49:51,248 --> 00:49:58,322
Who was it... the person who
hired you to kill Lee Jeong Mun?

561
00:50:03,794 --> 00:50:05,128
Yes, Prosecutor Oh.

562
00:50:05,128 --> 00:50:07,798
According to what Lee Du Gwang 
and Pak Jun Cheol both said,

563
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:10,200
a family member of a victim of
the Hwayeondong serial murders

564
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,202
is definitely the one behind it.

565
00:50:12,202 --> 00:50:15,272
<i>At that time, that person said,</i>

566
00:50:15,272 --> 00:50:20,210
<i>he was the father of one of 
Lee Jeong Mun's victims. </i>

567
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:25,549
<i>For his daughter's sake, 
he had to kill that guy.</i>

568
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:31,555
It looks like we'll need the files
from the officers who handled the 
Hwayeondong murder case.

569
00:50:31,555 --> 00:50:33,290
Will they give them to us?

570
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:35,292
If not, we'll just take them, right?

571
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,762
I can take care of that.

572
00:50:42,499 --> 00:50:44,901
What brings you here now?

573
00:50:44,901 --> 00:50:47,971
Nothing much. I just need 
your help, Baek Pro.

574
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:53,977
What is it? If you need something, 
then of course I will...

575
00:50:53,977 --> 00:50:55,712
From the Gangseo Police Department,

576
00:50:55,712 --> 00:50:57,981
I need you to help me get
a few things.

577
00:50:57,981 --> 00:51:03,987
What would be the reason?
We don't want to upset them...

578
00:51:03,987 --> 00:51:08,525
Accepting bribes, embezzlement.
There could be a lot of reasons.

579
00:51:08,525 --> 00:51:11,595
Who is it you want me to go after?

580
00:51:14,798 --> 00:51:16,133
Oh Gu Tak.

581
00:51:20,003 --> 00:51:22,806
For any cases that were even 
touched by Oh Gu Tak,

582
00:51:22,806 --> 00:51:25,609
confiscate any relevant materials.

583
00:51:25,609 --> 00:51:27,344
If it is related to Oh Gu Tak,

584
00:51:27,344 --> 00:51:30,948
take it away, even if it's a 
speck of dust.

585
00:51:30,948 --> 00:51:33,216
<i>- Quickly, quickly!
- Yes!</i>

586
00:51:38,021 --> 00:51:40,023
Detective Pak Sang Jun?

587
00:51:42,025 --> 00:51:42,693
Yes.

588
00:51:42,693 --> 00:51:48,565
You were Oh Gu Tak's partner, right?
Before Oh Gu Tak was suspended.

589
00:51:48,565 --> 00:51:50,033
Yes. Why?

590
00:51:50,033 --> 00:51:53,770
Let's go somewhere together. 
We need to have a talk.

591
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:55,505
Hey!

592
00:51:56,306 --> 00:51:58,308
Hey. Let go!

593
00:52:01,645 --> 00:52:04,181
Yes, Baek Pro.

594
00:52:04,448 --> 00:52:06,583
Okay, that was good work.

595
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:08,585
Okay. Keep working hard.

596
00:52:26,163 --> 00:52:27,898
This was it, right?

597
00:52:27,898 --> 00:52:29,233
It should be.

598
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:33,370
A doctor who was doing very well
for himself, all of a sudden

599
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:37,107
goes into hiding in the countryside
and lives like a vagrant.

600
00:52:38,175 --> 00:52:40,444
It seems very odd.

601
00:52:44,982 --> 00:52:49,920
Is someone here? Anybody home?

602
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:56,727
Gim Dong Ho!

603
00:52:57,661 --> 00:52:59,396
Nobody's around.

604
00:53:14,007 --> 00:53:15,276
-=Consultation Room=-

605
00:53:20,147 --> 00:53:23,216
-=Psychiatrist Gim Dong Ho=-

606
00:53:26,089 --> 00:53:31,028
Jeong Mun, don't you remember 
what Gim Dong Ho looked like?

607
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,771
<i>Take it. It will help to relax you.</i>

608
00:53:49,313 --> 00:53:51,448
Who are you people?

609
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:11,869
Lee Jeong Mun?

610
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,675
Gim Dong Ho?

611
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:22,546
Bastard!

612
00:54:22,946 --> 00:54:25,883
Stop! Gim Dong Ho, you bastard!

613
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:12,062
You bastard. Just how many crimes 
have you committed in all this time?

614
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:16,600
Making me chase you down and 
nearly die, you asshole.

615
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:21,138
Jeong Mun, you're not feeling well. 
Sit down and rest.

616
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:25,542
Why were you following me
that night?

617
00:55:33,283 --> 00:55:39,423
Lee... Lee Jeong Mun, you bastard.

618
00:55:41,692 --> 00:55:43,560
Did you think I didn't know?

619
00:55:55,038 --> 00:55:58,909
<i>How long have you been
watching me?</i>

620
00:56:02,513 --> 00:56:07,050
Oh Gu Tak... I can't trust
you anymore.

621
00:56:07,985 --> 00:56:14,658
You can keep on hating me. 
But the truth... I will find it.

622
00:56:39,883 --> 00:56:44,555
That's lompeun. It's a narcotic.

623
00:56:55,098 --> 00:57:01,772
Lee Jeong Mun, I knew someday 
you'd come looking for me.

624
00:57:02,573 --> 00:57:05,242
I know everything.

625
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:14,985
Me... I did it. I did it!

626
00:57:23,063 --> 00:57:24,532
-=Lee Jeong Mun=-

627
00:57:30,868 --> 00:57:34,204
=The number you called is 
temporarily unavailable...=

628
00:58:55,886 --> 00:58:57,221
You came.

629
00:58:59,223 --> 00:59:03,227
The one who murdered your 
daughter was Lee Jeong Mun, right?

630
00:59:06,296 --> 00:59:08,699
Squad Leader Oh, you're 
quite impressive.

631
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:13,637
How you did all this just to bring 
your daughter's killer closer to you.

632
00:59:17,774 --> 00:59:19,910
I already know all about it.

633
00:59:20,711 --> 00:59:21,778
<i>Squad Leader Oh, 
your daughter,</i>

634
00:59:21,778 --> 00:59:24,982
<i>was the last victim in the 
Hwayeondong serial murders.</i>

635
00:59:26,984 --> 00:59:31,922
<i>Also, what you did to Lee Jeong 
Mun afterward,</i>

636
00:59:31,922 --> 00:59:36,994
the reason you picked Pak Ung Cheol,
Jeong Tae Su and Lee Jeong Mun,

637
00:59:37,528 --> 00:59:43,267
and how you've been entangled with 
these 3 people for the last 2 years.

638
00:59:43,267 --> 00:59:45,402
I already know everything.

639
00:59:47,805 --> 00:59:53,143
One thing. Let me ask you just
one thing, Squad Leader Oh.

640
00:59:53,143 --> 00:59:57,414
Regardless of what happened in the
past, this is what's most important.

641
01:00:01,018 --> 01:00:06,757
<i>The one who had Lee Du Gwang 
order Pak Ung Cheol to kill 
Lee Jeong Mun.</i>

642
01:00:06,757 --> 01:00:10,494
<i>Lee Jeong Mun, that guy, 
dispose of him quietly. </i>

643
01:00:10,494 --> 01:00:13,964
<i>And commissioned a middleman 
named Gim Do Sik</i>

644
01:00:13,964 --> 01:00:16,500
<i>as someone to approach Jeong Tae Su.</i>

645
01:00:17,968 --> 01:00:24,508
And when the plan for Pak Ung Cheol
and Jeong Tae Su to kill Lee Jeong Mun
fell apart...

646
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:26,510
<i>After they failed to kill 
Lee Jeong Mun,</i>

647
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:30,113
<i>the one who ordered Pak Ung Cheol 
and Jeong Tae Su to also be killed...</i>

648
01:00:30,113 --> 01:00:34,918
<i>If you refused... then you were 
also to be killed.</i>

649
01:00:34,918 --> 01:00:36,920
<i>All of these things that our team
has gone through,</i>

650
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,257
<i>the person behind this whole 
terrible chain of events...</i>

651
01:00:40,257 --> 01:00:45,329
the person who gave the orders
behind the scenes, was it you?

652
01:00:48,398 --> 01:00:55,472
Say it. Oh Gu Tak, did you 
give those orders?

653
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:02,813
Say it. Oh Gu Tak, 
are you the culprit?
