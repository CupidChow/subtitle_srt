1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,963
BAD GUYS

2
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,823
BAD GUYS

3
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,539
RESTRICTED AREA

4
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,122
We found Lim Jong-dae.

5
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,709
You keep watch over her.

6
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:46,463
You're out now,
no matter what the situation may be,

7
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,132
so you keep her safe.

8
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,178
Don't hide even if you're scared.

9
00:01:07,606 --> 00:01:12,636
CRISIS

10
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:23,208
They found the weapon at the scene,
so they'll catch the perp soon.

11
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,669
Let's trust them and wait.

12
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,088
For what? Prints on the weapon?

13
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,675
This guy is a pro.

14
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:33,969
They won't find anything.

15
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,179
Leaving no prints doesn't mean he's a pro.

16
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,726
He hit a major artery.

17
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:45,522
There are only five in the human body.

18
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,774
When it's ruptured,

19
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:51,069
you lose thirty liters of blood
in just a minute.

20
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,155
And you die

21
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:54,865
in five seconds.

22
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,163
There were no signs of struggle
or any other injuries

23
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,708
which means he was stabbed precisely
before he could even resist.

24
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:08,086
And it tells us that
the killer made a calculated move

25
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,965
with his target's
reflexive reactions in mind.

26
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:15,927
This was done by someone
who kills people for a living.

27
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:19,097
Someone in the top five percent,
a real professional.

28
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,477
A hitman.

29
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,146
They kill without emotion.

30
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,523
That way, they leave no evidence behind.

31
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,443
No emotion means no pain.

32
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,737
And that way...

33
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,742
they don't have to feel guilty.

34
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,502
OH JAE-WON
NEW MESSAGE

35
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,132
There's someone
waiting for us at the office.

36
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:58,220
He'll butt heads with us often,
so get comfortable.

37
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,429
Who is this person?

38
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,015
I wasn't told we'd get a new member.

39
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,896
EPISODE 7

40
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,483
It's nice to finally meet
all of you in person.

41
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,319
I'll be working with you from now on.

42
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,113
I'm Special Prosecutor Oh Jae-won.

43
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:22,786
I've been pestering Captain Oh
to introduce me to you guys.

44
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,956
Thank you, Captain Oh.

45
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,959
My, you must be Park Woong-chul.

46
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:33,714
You look really strong.
My, you've got huge fists.

47
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,299
Catch lots of bad guys.
I'm counting on you.

48
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,970
You caught
the northeast serial killer, right?

49
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,140
Jung Tae-su,
I look forward to working with you.

50
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,023
I'm Senior Inspector Yoo Mi-young
from Seoul Police.

51
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,358
Do you know about me?

52
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,319
Yes, a little.

53
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,989
It's nice to meet you.

54
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:04,786
Hey!

55
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,497
It's been a while, Jung-moon.

56
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,468
PCL-R RESULTS
LEE JUNG-MOON

57
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,053
You scored 38 out of 40.

58
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,309
You're a psychopath, Lee Jung-moon.

59
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,407
It's been three years, right?

60
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,993
You haven't changed one bit.

61
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,578
How have you been?

62
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:49,623
Right.

63
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,918
Not well, of course.
I forgot about the Hwayeon-dong murder.

64
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,464
You're trying to move away
from the past and start afresh.

65
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,300
Sorry I brought it up. My bad.

66
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,346
You've already put the past behind you.

67
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,473
Come on. You clearly have.

68
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:10,018
That's why you and Captain Oh
can work together. Otherwise...

69
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,269
Prosecutor Oh.

70
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,858
That's enough.

71
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:33,166
Don't worry.
I promised I wouldn't say anything.

72
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,045
Fine. I'll shut up
and just enjoy the ride.

73
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:45,637
Anyway, a contract killer by the name
of Lim Jong-dae was murdered, right?

74
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,807
Well, I didn't mean to be nosy.

75
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,226
The NFS called
while I was waiting here earlier.

76
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,479
The NFS called? What was it about?

77
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,482
They found a fingerprint
on the murder weapon.

78
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,405
It's probably the killer's.

79
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,730
Wait.

80
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,554
Anyway, congratulations.

81
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,973
I hope you can live
a good and normal life now.

82
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,944
What's the cause of death?

83
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,447
Suicide by hanging. He took his own life.

84
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,966
Hyun-woo!

85
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,594
Hyun-woo, no!

86
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:10,448
Woo Hyun-woo killed Lim Jong-dae
and killed himself because of the guilt?

87
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,659
Is that what happened?

88
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,577
Well...

89
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,708
A groom-to-be took his own life
just before his wedding?

90
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,042
Don't you think it's odd?

91
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,422
They found his print on the murder weapon,
so the evidence is there.

92
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,843
But it seems like
it's all laid out for us,

93
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,220
and I find it strange.

94
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:38,018
Detective Jung Tae-su, right?
Let me ask you something.

95
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:43,982
Do you really think
that Hyun-woo took his own life?

96
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:51,072
Well, we need to investigate...

97
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:54,534
Hyun-woo would never do
something so irresponsible.

98
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,579
He was so happy
that we were getting married

99
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,082
and promised to make me happy
for the rest of my life.

100
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,795
He was worried I'd be embarrassed
in front of my friends at our wedding

101
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,881
because he walked with a limp.

102
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,968
He said he wanted to make me proud

103
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,138
and felt so bad that he couldn't.

104
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,976
He apologized to me in tears.

105
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,734
I'm not sure
if it's right for me to say this to you,

106
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:33,948
but if Mr. Woo didn't die by suicide,

107
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,743
and if he was murdered,

108
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,704
I promise you that I'll catch the person

109
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,582
who killed him.

110
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,293
At all costs.

111
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,674
I noticed that he was wearing a leg brace.

112
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,761
What happened?

113
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,514
Do you know anything about it?

114
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,475
A little while ago,

115
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,521
there was a firearm accident
at his shooting range.

116
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:11,277
I asked him what exactly happened
and who was responsible for it,

117
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,071
but he didn't tell me much.

118
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,409
It was Jong-seok.

119
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,038
Be careful of him.

120
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,985
I get that you want to quit,

121
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,779
but you need to settle up first.

122
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,325
It's only fair, don't you think?

123
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,373
There are body parts that we have two of.

124
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,250
If one breaks down,

125
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,794
you can use the other.

126
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,173
Losing one will teach you

127
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,091
to appreciate what you've got left.

128
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,428
-Now, it's time to settle up.
-No...

129
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,514
Congratulations on getting hitched.
Wait for my wedding gift.

130
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,559
Let's do this.

131
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,209
What are you doing, Tae-su?

132
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,378
I told you. I'm going to catch
the person who killed him.

133
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,173
Hyun-woo? No, it wasn't him.

134
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,633
Why do you think that?

135
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,968
Because he's not that skilled.

136
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,763
He learned to shoot
because he wasn't good with knives.

137
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,849
Yet he managed
to hit the artery so precisely

138
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,101
and even predicted the reflex responses?

139
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,189
The killer is someone else.

140
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:18,321
So you're saying
a skilled knifeman killed Lim Jong-dae,

141
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,531
made it look like Woo Hyun-woo did it,

142
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,535
killed Woo Hyun-woo,
and staged it as suicide.

143
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,287
Is that what you think?

144
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,289
I'm sure of it.

145
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,333
Then you must know who did it.

146
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,045
You know everyone in the circle.

147
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,923
I bet you have someone in mind.

148
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,136
A suicide or an accident.

149
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,557
If that doesn't work, they stage it as
a revenge killing or a crime of passion.

150
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:50,311
A fingerprint on the murder weapon
is all you need to frame someone.

151
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,938
That's how they roll.

152
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,858
It's what I used to do.

153
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,319
Take my advice.

154
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,989
If you want to live,
get your hands off this case.

155
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,617
If you want to catch this guy,
you'll suffer a lot more

156
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,286
than just a few knife injuries.

157
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,466
GO ASSOCIATION

158
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,978
Mr. Lim is dead.

159
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,901
So is Hyun-woo.

160
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,989
Long time no see, Tae-su.

161
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,707
Jong-seok...

162
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,502
Where is he now?

163
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,213
Do you think Jong-seok killed them?

164
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,342
I don't know where he is.

165
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,635
I cut all ties with him a while ago.

166
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,304
They get all the jobs...

167
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:14,103
through you which is why you know
where everyone is and what they're up to.

168
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,522
Stop playing dumb. Just tell me.

169
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,776
Where is Jong-seok?

170
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,946
Stagnant water is bound to rot,
and one nail drives out another.

171
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,990
That's the way of the world.

172
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,660
I got a new deliveryman a while ago.

173
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:30,703
Who is it?

174
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,706
Who replaced Mr. Lim?

175
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,170
His name is Kim Do-sik.

176
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,799
He's young so he solves problems quickly.

177
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:47,011
He always finds the right guy
for each target and gets the job done.

178
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,389
If the situation doesn't look good,

179
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,475
he quickly finds someone else
who can get the job done.

180
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,069
Where can I find Kim Do-sik, that bastard?

181
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,832
There's no evidence to suggest
that his death was a homicide.

182
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,293
What am I doing here?

183
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,755
Am I a forensic investigator now?

184
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,208
Was he planning
to leave the country or something?

185
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,419
Can you bring that over?

186
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:21,272
I can't find a single fingerprint.
Even on the remote control.

187
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:27,403
If he had to erase all traces
of himself even in his own home,

188
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:33,284
it means he didn't want someone
to find out that he lived here.

189
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,869
And that means...

190
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,373
someone was after him.

191
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,004
You have luminol, right?

192
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,516
TAE-SU

193
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,442
Hello.

194
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,663
TAE-SU

195
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,124
Found anything?

196
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:31,754
Well, there are bloodstains
all over the place.

197
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,840
Woo's face was unharmed, right?

198
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,635
Does that mean Tae-su was right?

199
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:41,347
Yes, he was right.
This wasn't a suicide. Woo was murdered.

200
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:46,519
They just finished analyzing
the security footage from the parking lot.

201
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,771
There's an untraceable vehicle

202
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,316
that left the parking lot
around the time of Woo's death.

203
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,319
And the driver's face? Do we have it?

204
00:19:55,403 --> 00:20:00,574
Due to the resolution and the distance,
we weren't able to get it.

205
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,703
But they know
how many were in the vehicle.

206
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,037
How many?

207
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,249
The driver, the passenger seat,
and one in the back.

208
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,625
Three in total.

209
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:15,131
Then it's possible that Lim and Woo
weren't killed by the same guy.

210
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,966
Right?

211
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,051
This won't be an easy case.

212
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:24,098
Anyway, I'll call
for the bloodstain pattern analysis team.

213
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:25,558
Okay.

214
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:53,335
Stop watching that thing.
No one came in after Woo and Lim left.

215
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,963
Why are you still watching it?
Your eyes must hurt.

216
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,299
Seriously, stop.
You'll pee out of your eyes.

217
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:03,095
Maybe Woo really killed Lim
and took his own life.

218
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,348
Why must we do this
just because of what Tae-su said?

219
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:08,476
It's a possibility.

220
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,524
The knife's always behind your back.

221
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,696
Remember, Woong-chul.

222
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,824
The knife's always behind your back.

223
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,410
Don't ever forget that.

224
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,625
What do you mean by that?

225
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,129
Literally, as you heard.

226
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,423
You could get killed by someone you trust.

227
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,259
Hey.

228
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,012
Don't turn me into a scumbag.

229
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:48,849
Stop trying to suss me out,
or I'll beat you up.

230
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,102
Then go ask your boss

231
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,689
who ordered him to kill me.

232
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,359
Go ask him.

233
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,572
You little...

234
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,993
Whatever, suit yourself.
You're such a prick.

235
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,603
Who's there?

236
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:47,908
Is it Lee Du-kwang?

237
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,350
I'll just ask him myself.

238
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:23,777
Jung-moon, let me take care of this.

239
00:24:11,672 --> 00:24:12,534
Here.

240
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:17,039
I want you to kill him
using the cruelest means possible.

241
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:36,058
Babe, don't fall asleep just yet.

242
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:42,731
Is it you?

243
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,568
Are you Kim Do-sik?

244
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,587
Hey, you stay here.

245
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,634
He won't talk to you, so just stay here.

246
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,722
Don't worry. I got this.

247
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,528
I only had one question for you
before I knew who you were.

248
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,156
But now that I know,
I have so many questions.

249
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:34,992
I'll ask one question at a time.

250
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:39,872
If you don't answer my questions,
this is what will happen.

251
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,847
You asked me to kill
Lee Jung-moon, remember?

252
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:03,479
That and this case.
How are they connected?

253
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:08,108
A few weeks ago, someone came to see me.

254
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,319
Lee Jung-moon...

255
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:15,991
He asked me to kill Lee Jung-moon
and offered three times the going rate.

256
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:19,578
He said he had already picked out
the hitman he wanted.

257
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:25,334
He said it'd be a clean job
because this guy was the best.

258
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:28,670
Who was this guy?

259
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,674
Mr. Lim? Hyun-woo?

260
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:33,759
No.

261
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,177
You.

262
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,764
He recommended you, Jung Tae-su.

263
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,445
What are you looking at?

264
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,072
Boss, let's talk!

265
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,866
He's not here now.

266
00:26:58,492 --> 00:26:59,701
Move, you little prick.

267
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,245
Damn you...

268
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:09,795
That's enough.

269
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,720
He wanted me to do the job?

270
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,100
-Why?
-How would I know?

271
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:25,727
He recommended you for the job

272
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,606
which was why I approached you.

273
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:34,653
But you turned down the job,
so I contacted someone else.

274
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,948
I did nothing wrong. Believe me.

275
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,659
Someone else? Who?

276
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,580
Park Jong-seok?

277
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,793
From what I know,

278
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:53,380
he's number one, not you.

279
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:59,136
Park Jong-seok killed
Mr. Lim and Hyun-woo. I'm sure of it.

280
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,762
Why do you think that?

281
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,098
You know how Mr. Lim was killed, right?

282
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:07,436
Out of all the contract killers I know,
Park Jong-seok is the only one

283
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,104
who can use a knife like that.

284
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,899
-And the call.
-What call?

285
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:15,402
I don't know how Mr. Lim found out,
but he called me that night.

286
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,197
He was furious.

287
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:19,907
Who is it?

288
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,159
Who is it?

289
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:23,911
And?

290
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:27,456
I told him it was Park Jong-seok.

291
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,918
And then he died.

292
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,587
Get it?

293
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:38,675
I don't know how good you are,
but forget about this if you want to live.

294
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:43,138
If you get on Park Jong-seok's nerves,
he'll cut you to pieces.

295
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:47,142
No one else needs to die,
once Lee Jung-moon is taken care of.

296
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,811
So everything's over
once Jung-moon is dead?

297
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:55,651
And I should just sit back
and wait until Jong-seok finishes him off?

298
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,200
You're kidding, right?

299
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,035
As you probably know by now,

300
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,288
Lee Jung-moon is
bound to get killed anyway.

301
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,960
He will get whacked,
but if you really want to save him...

302
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,714
Then do not leave him alone.

303
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,304
Who ordered you to kill Jung-moon?

304
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,348
What do you mean?

305
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,225
Why did you send your boys over?

306
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,852
You know he saved your life!

307
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,313
Are you scared of the bastard
who gave the order?

308
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:34,648
Woong-chul.

309
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,151
You probably won't believe me,

310
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,904
but I didn't send anyone.

311
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,365
I'm done with that business.

312
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,449
What?

313
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,369
Then who...

314
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:52,291
Park Jong-seok will know when he's alone.

315
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:55,294
If he's with someone,
Park will separate them at all costs.

316
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:59,715
He will finish him off,
quickly and quietly.

317
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,599
Here, this way.

318
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,436
His HR and BP are dropping.
Get epinephrine ready.

319
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,437
Yes, doctor.

320
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,670
Missed the lung by just 3 cm.

321
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:27,010
Woong-chul told me that someone
had ordered Du-kwang to kill him.

322
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:32,057
So at first, I wondered
if one of Du-kwang's men did this.

323
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,101
I did wonder that.

324
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,354
But as you can probably tell,

325
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:41,650
a mere thug wouldn't hold
or use a knife in this manner.

326
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,653
It went in too sharp.

327
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:48,865
Whoever did this
dropped the knife at the scene,

328
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:51,576
and Woong-chul's fingerprint
was found on the knife.

329
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,955
Had Jung-moon died on the spot,

330
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,708
Woong-chul would've undoubtedly
been accused of killing him.

331
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:11,304
The M.O. is very similar
to the old man's case.

332
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:17,978
I bet you know who did this to Jung-moon.

333
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:25,735
What's the link between this case
and Jung-moon's stabbing attack?

334
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,702
About the order to kill Jung-moon...

335
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,706
I was approached too.

336
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,712
Who is it? Who's behind it?

337
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,088
I don't know yet.

338
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:49,593
However, I do know someone who does.

339
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,736
What the hell happened?

340
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:10,989
Which hospital?

341
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,617
Okay, I'll be there shortly.

342
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,873
Uncuff me before you go!

343
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,585
Sleeping pill overdose?

344
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,086
Another suicide?

345
00:33:31,465 --> 00:33:34,095
RECENTS
1 OUTGOING CALL

346
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:41,061
You said, if Jung-moon
had died on the spot,

347
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,271
Woong-chul would've been arrested.

348
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,815
Then the case would be closed.

349
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,736
And everyone who cared
for Jung-moon would end up

350
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:53,365
blaming and resenting the wrong person
for the rest of their lives.

351
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,575
Undoubtedly.

352
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,291
I have no choice but to meet him.

353
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,251
Meet who?

354
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,797
I'm really sick of this
and I bet he wants it over too.

355
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,716
Keep Jung-moon safe.

356
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,995
How many times have I told you, Soo-cheol?

357
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:46,167
When you're disguising it
as a suicide by hanging...

358
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:47,877
Right here.

359
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,548
You need to tie them
right where the Adam's apple is.

360
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:57,721
That way, it's pushed backward
and gets the muscles tangled up

361
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,558
which blocks the airway
and makes the heart stop in a flash.

362
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:05,353
That way, you can kill them
without having to tussle.

363
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:08,857
I've told you time and time again.
Right, Soo-cheol?

364
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,326
You see,

365
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,830
this is exactly how
you should've killed Hyun-woo.

366
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:29,085
And that prick, Lee Jung-moon...

367
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,296
Let's not even talk about that.

368
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:36,593
Soo-cheol, I'll kill you exactly
how you should've killed them.

369
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,929
I'll make a big donation at your funeral.

370
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:44,351
And I'll make sure
to give your mother a big hug.

371
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,814
I'm seeing a lot of blood today.

372
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,442
What an eventful day.

373
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:15,090
Three, six, five,

374
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,176
three, five, one.

375
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,061
At 36 degrees,
53 minutes 51.5 seconds north.

376
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,481
And 126 degrees,
49 minutes, 43.7 seconds east.

377
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:04,681
Long time no see, Tae-su.

378
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,602
Who wants to have Lee Jung-moon killed?

379
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,856
Getting straight to the point?

380
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,235
It's been a while, buddy.
Shouldn't we catch up first?

381
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,905
-Who is it?
-I don't know.

382
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,616
Kim Do-sik delivered the order to me.

383
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:29,080
We just get the job done.
We never meet the clients.

384
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:30,915
You know that.

385
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,126
Listen.

386
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,171
You can't kill Lee Jung-moon.

387
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:38,590
Ever.

388
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,008
Well, if he has you...

389
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,218
Then sure, maybe not.

390
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:46,055
But you see, you're with me now.

391
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:50,435
You think I called you here
because I wanted to see you?

392
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,730
That prick, Lee Jung-moon.

393
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,482
He's going to die.

394
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:01,571
Actually, he's probably dead by now.

395
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:25,053
You probably think they're a joke.

396
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,264
An old police detective,

397
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:31,100
a nagging woman
who thinks she's damn smart,

398
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:34,395
and a thug who thinks he can punch.

399
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:38,858
It's a total joke.

400
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,235
Right.

401
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:42,821
You are right.

402
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,783
But I guess you don't know this.

403
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:52,705
Who are you?

404
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:55,291
I know this
because he's hit me a few times.

405
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,085
Let him punch you and you'll know

406
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,463
that he can punch real hard.

407
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:35,540
You piece of...

408
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,335
Man, you're sleeping?

409
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,796
I'm tired.

410
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,220
Why did you kill

411
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,599
Mr. Lim and Hyun-woo?

412
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:55,268
I guess Kim Do-sik left out some details.

413
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:59,355
I thought he broke the rules
and told you everything.

414
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,609
I guess I didn't need to kill him.

415
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,694
What are you saying?

416
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:08,448
You turned down the order
to get rid of Lee Jung-moon.

417
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,993
I heard there was one condition.

418
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,079
If you refuse to take on the job,

419
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,749
then you're out as well.

420
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,046
And I was assigned...

421
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,384
that job, Tae-su.

422
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:37,977
Lim Jong-dae died because of you.

423
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:42,398
He knew I'd take you out

424
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,985
and he overreacted trying to protect you.

425
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,949
Before he makes a move,

426
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,076
we should

427
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,870
take him out.

428
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:59,666
That's why he got killed, that old man.

429
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:03,836
Let's just get started.

430
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,092
INDOOR SHOOTING RANGE

431
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:27,026
Two seconds to pull it out,
one second to aim.

432
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,987
And 0.5 seconds to hit.

433
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,406
In total, 3.5 seconds.

434
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:34,033
Who will be faster?

435
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,661
You or me?

436
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:39,914
Be smart about it.

437
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:42,709
You've got two legs,
but you only have one life.

438
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,752
Don't you want to get married?

439
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,172
You've already set your wedding date.

440
00:41:58,433 --> 00:41:59,475
What about Hyun-woo?

441
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:03,563
Did you kill him on purpose?

442
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,443
To get his fingerprints on the knife

443
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,030
and stage it as suicide?

444
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,115
I saw him just now.

445
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,201
Take care of him.

446
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:23,291
Did you know about his wedding?

447
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,460
I had no hard feelings toward Hyun-woo.

448
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,047
I kill people for a living. That's all.

449
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:34,802
I feel bad for his fiancée.

450
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,680
You feel bad?

451
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,560
Hyun-woo...

452
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,522
He grew up with us.

453
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,233
And Mr. Lim raised us.

454
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,611
You killed them with your own hands.

455
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,031
How could you...

456
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,619
talk about it as if it's not a big deal?

457
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:01,954
Remember what the old man used to say?

458
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:05,083
You, me, Hyun-woo. The three of us.

459
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,794
When we used to work for him together,

460
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,671
he said it to us all the time.

461
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:12,965
Remember?

462
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:15,718
"Killing may be easy..."

463
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:17,595
Killing may be easy,

464
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,807
but dealing with the guilt isn't.

465
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:23,935
Always remember that.

466
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,396
Let's take the easy way, Tae-su.

467
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,358
Don't choose the hard way.

468
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,110
Okay?

469
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:35,905
The two of us...

470
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,326
We've come too far to choose the easy way.

471
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:45,081
Remember?

472
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:50,461
I said, if we crossed paths again,
one of us would die.

473
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:52,922
Today's the day.

474
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:58,094
One of us must die today.

475
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,708
Turn the knife.

476
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:55,920
Go on.

477
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:02,051
Just do it.

478
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:06,097
Go ahead and kill me!

479
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,561
I don't

480
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:15,398
kill anymore.

481
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:17,692
No.

482
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,444
I can't do it anymore.

483
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:35,167
The grief and pain
of losing someone precious.

484
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,129
The guilt and remorse

485
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:42,174
of robbing someone of their loved ones.

486
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,846
Now that I know what it's like,

487
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:51,434
I really can't bring myself
to kill anyone.

488
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:56,856
And you know, Jong-seok...

489
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,445
Everyone who remembers me

490
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:04,822
is gone.

491
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:08,242
They're all dead.

492
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,371
So if I lose you too,

493
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,248
then...

494
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,752
I'll really have no one.

495
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:23,341
Don't leave me alone. Please.

496
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:26,052
If you spare me now,

497
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,015
you'll be the first one I kill.

498
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:34,685
Can you handle that?

499
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:43,861
The old man, Hyun-woo and you...

500
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,658
Why did you all change like that?

501
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:55,247
I'm still rolling in the gutters.

502
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,416
I'm still living like this.

503
00:47:58,751 --> 00:47:59,877
So why are you

504
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,964
trying so hard to get out?

505
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,008
Why?

506
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:08,844
Why...

507
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:12,681
Why?

508
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,824
Choose your lady wisely.

509
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:35,246
You've changed an awful lot
since you met that woman.

510
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,921
I didn't change because I met her.

511
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:48,008
Because I had changed,

512
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,429
I was able to meet her.

513
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:55,015
So please...

514
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:00,146
You need to stop too. Please.

515
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:05,943
Please, Jong-seok!

516
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:16,245
When you get blood on your hands,
you can wash it away.

517
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:22,877
But it'll be stuck in your head forever,
and the guilt will haunt you, Jong-seok.

518
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:29,717
Turn around and be on your way.

519
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:34,054
I came too far.

520
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:39,245
He was a good husband and a great father.

521
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:46,085
He never once
did anything to cause harm to others.

522
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,962
So why...

523
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,298
Why did he have to kill him?

524
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,011
If he were to

525
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:57,972
deeply regret

526
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,433
what he did,

527
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:07,439
would you accept his apology?

528
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,485
You give an apology

529
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:18,117
when you make a mistake.

530
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:21,787
Murder...

531
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,000
isn't a mistake.

532
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:28,794
I can...

533
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:31,338
never...

534
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:34,466
forgive that man.

535
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,177
Ever.

536
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,979
Detective Jung?

537
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:53,444
What brings you by?

538
00:51:57,615 --> 00:52:00,659
Are you hurt? There's blood...

539
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:05,456
Are you just getting back?

540
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:08,792
I had to go to the bank
and take care of some things.

541
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:14,548
Oh, that reminds me.
The last time I saw you,

542
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:18,385
you asked me about
a monthly deposit of a million won.

543
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:24,892
The other day, a social worker came by.

544
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,186
The social worker told me

545
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:32,524
about a bank account
that was set up in my name

546
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:34,943
and the deposit
that's been coming in monthly.

547
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:36,820
She asked why I'd left it untouched.

548
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:39,198
I checked and the money's all there.

549
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,867
It's been two years,
so it's a large sum now.

550
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:47,081
What happened was,
the bank kept sending me letters,

551
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,084
but they only had my old address on file.

552
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,343
Sun-jung.

553
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,148
Yes, Detective Jung. What is it?

554
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:18,487
It's nothing.

555
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,491
I still have a long way to go.

556
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:26,995
I'm sorry.

557
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,918
Now that I've lost the ones I cared for...

558
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:37,297
Now that they're all gone...

559
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:41,885
And now that I'm all alone...

560
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,473
I feel so terrible.

561
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:48,851
I'm sorry.

562
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:34,998
VOICE MAIL

563
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:38,085
First new message.

564
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:42,381
Why aren't you answering your phone?
You're okay, right?

565
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:47,553
Anyway, the man you asked me to look into.
Joo Jung-gook or whatever his name is.

566
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,681
I found him. Here's the address.

567
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:57,289
Who are you guys?

568
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:03,003
You people...

569
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:06,089
Why do you keep following me?

570
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,593
Did Mr. Kim send you? Did he?

571
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:14,264
I told you. I have no money.
What do you want from me?

572
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,112
Remember me?

573
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,449
You're...

574
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,786
This is new.

575
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:39,414
I've never met anyone
who asked to be tailed.

576
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,917
I'll record everything.

577
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:43,835
We'll find out...

578
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:49,591
if you're really murdering people or not.

579
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:08,986
Too late, don't you think?
It's been two years.

580
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:10,570
I don't have to tell you

581
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,115
why I'm here, right?

582
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:19,079
You want to see what I recorded
to find out if you really killed people?

583
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:23,500
I did witness everything
while tailing you back then.

584
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:27,546
No one knows you better than I do.

585
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:31,299
You don't know what I know.

586
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:34,803
So?

587
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:37,764
What did you see?

588
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:43,020
I don't know how you'll take this.

589
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:47,524
But you are a murderer, Lee Jung-moon.

590
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:53,655
-For real.
-Come on. No way.

591
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:57,868
What's he doing?

592
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,377
It is true that
you killed all those people.

593
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:11,131
And you are
the Hwayeon-dong serial killer.

594
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,301
It was all you, Lee Jung-moon.

595
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:48,460
BAD GUYS

596
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,337
Remember me?

597
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:53,173
Too late, don't you think?
It's been two years.

598
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,299
What did you see?

599
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:56,218
You are a murderer, Lee Jung-moon.

600
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,386
Why did you leave without permission?

601
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:02,224
How do you and Jung-moon know each other?

602
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:05,936
I'm here to disband your team.

603
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,563
If you want the truth,
help me one last time.

604
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:11,983
This is your last chance.

605
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:15,320
Is the offer still on the table?

606
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:17,239
Tighten your shoelaces.

607
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:20,867
Jung-moon,
do you remember Kim Dong-ho's face?

608
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:22,786
Who are you guys?

609
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,246
