1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,838
BAD GUYS

2
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,698
BAD GUYS

3
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:34,576
A group of organ traffickers
was arrested on the 29th

4
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,247
for illegal organ trade
in the Yeongdeungpo area.

5
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:45,254
Yang, a man in his 30s, who has been
actively involved in organ trade,

6
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:48,423
is a member of an underground
organ and human trafficking ring,

7
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:51,552
whose brutality is sending
shock waves across the country.

8
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:54,012
Even if the police
apprehend the suppliers,

9
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:57,808
it'll be very difficult to figure out
how the entire organization operates.

10
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,602
The fact that anyone can fall prey
to organ traffickers

11
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:03,021
is spurring fear among civilians.

12
00:01:08,941 --> 00:01:13,699
TOO MANY BAD GUYS

13
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:18,078
EPISODE 4

14
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,758
I've memorized your faces.
You're all dead meat.

15
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,719
Yes, I understand.

16
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,015
Got it. Let's do that.

17
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,274
Long time no see, Woong-chul.

18
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:54,114
Boss.

19
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,376
PRIVATE DETECTIVE AGENCY

20
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,213
I'm looking for someone.

21
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:14,217
Well, that is my specialty.

22
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,429
Who are you looking for?
A debtor on the run?

23
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,930
Did your wife run away?

24
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,724
Do I have to tell you?

25
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,981
No. You don't have to tell me the details.

26
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,609
But I do need
some information on this person.

27
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,819
Joo Jung-gook, a man in his late 30s.

28
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,197
-Late 30s...
-He's between 175 and 180 cm tall.

29
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,699
He's slim and has a scar on his forehead.

30
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,244
He was a private detective
until two years ago.

31
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,954
So he's in this line of work.

32
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:44,706
Where did he work?

33
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,044
Here.

34
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,015
Please help me.

35
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,183
This is new.

36
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,479
I've never met anyone
who asked to be tailed.

37
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:14,361
Well, put your worries to rest.
I'll record everything.

38
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,029
We'll find out...

39
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,910
if you're really murdering people or not.

40
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,766
Stop pacing back and forth.
You're driving me crazy.

41
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,019
How could I sit still right now?

42
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,690
We haven't been able to reach
Park Woong-chul for three hours.

43
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:55,110
Why are you so worried
when we can track his ankle monitor?

44
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,739
You don't get it, do you?
This whole project could be at risk.

45
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,366
You think he's going
to put this project at risk.

46
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,201
Is that what you're trying to say?

47
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:06,329
It's certainly possible.
He's done it before.

48
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,751
I know that we're a team,
but a criminal is still a criminal.

49
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:11,877
And we're cops.

50
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,212
Decide wisely, Captain Oh.

51
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,763
Decide what?

52
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:27,225
Woong-chul is ready
to turn over a new leaf.

53
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:30,729
It may seem like he only cares
about getting his sentence reduced,

54
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,898
but he was never given a chance.

55
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,692
As you know,
you and I have given him that chance.

56
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,694
So we should trust him and wait.

57
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:41,782
What if something happens?
Who will take responsibility?

58
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,283
Me, of course.

59
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:47,245
If I deny responsibility,
you will lose your chance.

60
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,706
You want to seize this opportunity

61
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,958
to add

62
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:57,839
a few stars here. Am I wrong,
Senior Inspector Yoo Mi-young?

63
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,810
Jeez, I can't believe
I got lost in the woods.

64
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,982
I couldn't find a single trail.
All I could see were trees and rocks.

65
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,359
Park Woong-chul, you...

66
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,991
Where have you been?
And what happened to your face?

67
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,993
I told you. I got lost in the woods.

68
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,329
And this is...

69
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,292
It was a badger. It scratched my face.

70
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:37,796
What are you talking about?
Your anklet pinged you near Uijeongbu.

71
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,841
Well, I'm back now.
Isn't that what's important?

72
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,511
We're all adults here.
Let's respect each other's privacy.

73
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,139
You're back and that's what matters.

74
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,852
Let's drop it. Shouldn't you see a doctor?

75
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,645
It's just a little scratch.

76
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:58,400
Don't worry. I feel great right now.

77
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,193
What the heck are you thinking?

78
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,886
This is Lee Jung-moon
and he's a serial killer.

79
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,996
HANGANG HOSPITAL, ROOM 709

80
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,422
PARK SUN-JUNG

81
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,308
Who are you, mister?

82
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,061
That's my mom's room.

83
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,398
Hush. You'll wake her up.

84
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,859
She's not sleeping.

85
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:27,697
Mom, someone's here.
He's sitting out here.

86
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,908
Who's here, Nu-ri?

87
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,751
FROM OH GU-TAK

88
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,428
Captain Oh has told me a lot about you.

89
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,473
I guess he was here. Oh Gu-tak, that...

90
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,686
I mean, Captain Oh.

91
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,312
He visits me often.

92
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,815
He comes and plays with Nu-ri.

93
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,567
I like him.

94
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,113
I didn't know he visited.

95
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,825
I'll visit you often too.

96
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,537
You'll play with me too, right?

97
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,087
Thank you.

98
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,632
Sorry? For what?

99
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:31,720
I heard you were the one who saved me.

100
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,556
Captain Oh told me what happened.

101
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,213
Eat up.

102
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:23,063
You'll round up
the entire human trafficking syndicate?

103
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,106
Can you pull it off?

104
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,316
Not sure.

105
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,109
Then why try?

106
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,490
Because it needs to be done.
That's why I must try.

107
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:40,080
When I come here,
I let go of every fish I catch.

108
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,540
You catch them only to let them go.

109
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,502
Why go to such trouble?

110
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,629
Do you know what's funny?

111
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:53,009
Then ones that I let go
always bite my bait and get caught again

112
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,804
because they forget so quickly.

113
00:09:56,304 --> 00:10:00,433
They only think about
the worms in front of them

114
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,353
without realizing that
they'll be hooked once they bite.

115
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:07,774
These fools don't know
that they'll be caught again.

116
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,361
We humans aren't that different after all.

117
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,738
We don't look that far ahead.

118
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:17,784
We only see what's in front of us.

119
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,913
That's why life's a struggle.

120
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,416
That is why I've decided

121
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:31,214
that I will no longer
let go of the fish that I catch.

122
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,178
Good call.
It'll save each other the trouble.

123
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,849
Gu-tak.

124
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,730
Will you catch and release them?

125
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,858
Or will you just eat them?

126
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,320
Why would I release them?

127
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,658
I'm starving right now.

128
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:07,834
The fish you're after are big.
Don't bite off more than you can chew.

129
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,721
I assure you that I won't.

130
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,975
I'll make sure to chew every single piece.

131
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,407
Let's get ready to hunt.

132
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,293
You're dead meat.

133
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:58,635
These bastards are the underbosses of
the human trafficking syndicate in Seoul

134
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,262
that also trades human organs and flesh.

135
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,515
The police already know
who these pricks are

136
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,434
but have yet to round them up.

137
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,811
Why? Evidence.

138
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,397
They don't have solid evidence.

139
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,360
The organization
has them running in subgroups

140
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,071
and it's been impossible
to catch them red-handed.

141
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,866
So even though the police know they reek,
they can't do anything about it.

142
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,244
So far, at least.

143
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,997
You probably recognize
some of the faces here.

144
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,876
Here's one. This guy and this one too.

145
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:36,756
These three guys are like brokers
who supply products to everyone.

146
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,177
From the dealers at the bottom
to the big-box stores at the top.

147
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,680
Simply put, they're like wholesalers.

148
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:48,101
From the bottom-level dealers
to the big guys at the top,

149
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:55,400
I thought of a way
to round them up at once.

150
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,319
The Battle of Incheon.

151
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,946
"The Battle of Incheon"?

152
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,199
That's right. The Battle of Incheon.

153
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,412
What did General MacArthur do
when the North Korean army

154
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,706
reached the Nakdong River?

155
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:15,795
He hit Incheon, the city that sits
at the center of the peninsula.

156
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,715
That's exactly what we'll do.

157
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,259
First,

158
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,849
we'll hit these three bastards.

159
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:31,561
Hey, Mr. Rhee.

160
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,284
-Hey, stop right there.
-Get him!

161
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,042
I told you I'd come back...

162
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,711
for you.

163
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:02,508
What do you think will happen
after we get the wholesalers?

164
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,386
The dealers can't sell their products,

165
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,139
and the big-box stores
can no longer get products.

166
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,558
In other worse, the market will collapse.

167
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:14,562
Both the customers
and the market itself will be gone.

168
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,944
The low-level dealers
will begin dealing directly

169
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,489
with the big-box stores
which will breed chaos.

170
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,074
Chaos.

171
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,035
Like a chaotic wet market.

172
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:49,097
The state of disorder they're in
will bring things to order for us.

173
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,516
You see, that's the way of the world.

174
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,976
These arrogant bastards.

175
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,689
Show them no mercy.
Just bite them and chew them to pieces.

176
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,777
What do you think you're doing?

177
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,698
What does he want?

178
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:08,616
Damn it.

179
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,283
The tiger's been caught.

180
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,954
We didn't do anything. Why drag us here?

181
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,957
Tell me. What did we do wrong?

182
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,460
We only did what we were told.

183
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,670
What is this? This is ridiculous.

184
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,629
Shut up!

185
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,886
Shut your traps, you twerps.

186
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,975
Do you guys seriously think
that you did nothing wrong?

187
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,729
I should just send you morons to...
What's that place called?

188
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,940
You should be sent to
Chuncheon University of Education.

189
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,068
So they can become teachers?
You mean, the concentration camp?

190
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:31,115
In any case,
you morons need to be disciplined.

191
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,743
Keep your head and eyes down!

192
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,594
What are you looking at?
I'll gouge your eyes out.

193
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,033
HWANG KYUNG-SOON

194
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,372
Hwang Kyung-soon, age 58.

195
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,457
She controls all of Seoul.

196
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,877
Hwang Kyung-soon?

197
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,215
The name certainly rings a bell.

198
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,176
She was a famous pimp
in Cheongnyangni 588.

199
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:37,056
Yes, that's right. I remember her.

200
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,311
I see that she's aged.

201
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,439
She went to jail
following the demolition of 588.

202
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:49,360
But as soon as she got out,
she got into human trafficking.

203
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,613
As they say,
a leopard cannot change its spots.

204
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,951
Anyway, she started this business
seven years ago.

205
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,204
She aggressively grew her business
with a low profit margin.

206
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:03,082
And now, you can't do business
without going through her.

207
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,086
On top of that,
she has a number of cops in her pocket.

208
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,966
We have rats?

209
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:14,969
Do you know who?

210
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:22,893
Idiots. Do they love money that much?

211
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,980
No one cares when
their neighbor's daughter dies,

212
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,316
but they all gather around
and have a meeting

213
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,192
when the price of real estate drops.

214
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,447
You know, I don't blame those rats.

215
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,366
Blame this damned world we live in.

216
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,285
In any case,

217
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:44,081
this means that we need to move fast
before the cops on Hwang's payroll

218
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:47,001
catch a whiff and try to intervene.

219
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,464
Is it game over
once you have Hwang Kyung-soon?

220
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,507
Yes.

221
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,178
When will you strike?

222
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,765
As they say, strike while the iron is hot.

223
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,227
We'll strike tonight.

224
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,648
I'll tell you what we know so far.

225
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,776
Mr. Kang, we initially thought

226
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,112
you were the head
of the human trafficking ring in Seoul.

227
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,616
However, we learned
from the other members we questioned

228
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,076
that we were wrong.

229
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,329
Your boss.

230
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,998
Also known as Madam Hwang.

231
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,126
Who is she and where is she now?

232
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:30,503
Are you...

233
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,214
really cops?

234
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:35,883
I don't think you are.

235
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:39,845
I told you I'm Senior Inspector
Yoo Mi-young with the Seoul Police.

236
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:43,641
There are so many impostors these days.
How can I believe you?

237
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,520
If you really are cops,
let's talk at the police station.

238
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,356
I don't like this place. It stinks.

239
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,567
Unfortunately,
we can't transport you at the moment.

240
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,197
Then I can't talk either.

241
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,618
Okay. Don't talk then.

242
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,918
You'll regret refusing
to talk to me though.

243
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,732
I'll be nice and ask you three times.

244
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,235
Who is Madam Hwang?

245
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,612
How would I know?

246
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,326
Strike one.

247
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,581
Who is Madam Hwang?

248
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,332
I don't know.

249
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:57,798
Strike two.

250
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,217
This is your last chance.

251
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,512
The truth is,
I don't care who Madam Hwang is.

252
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,974
Let me ask you
a different question this time.

253
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,269
Earlier, you asked if we were real cops.

254
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,440
That woman is. She's a real cop.

255
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:18,569
Look at me.

256
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,168
Do I look like a cop to you?

257
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,158
No.

258
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,662
I'm not a cop.

259
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,833
Which means I can kill scumbags like you.

260
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:34,460
Get it?

261
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,464
And that's strike three.

262
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,341
Goodbye.

263
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,553
I'll talk!

264
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,430
I'll talk.

265
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:22,925
The human body is fascinating and special.

266
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,471
It has tremendous value.

267
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:34,728
I want to tell you how valuable it is,
so listen carefully.

268
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,064
Okay.

269
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,568
We use our eyes to see things.

270
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:45,239
Here's a question.
Do you know how much an eye goes for?

271
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,908
No, I don't.

272
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,953
It goes for 230 million won.

273
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,747
That's how much it's sold for.

274
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,334
That's a lot of money.

275
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:02,131
It's how much your dad owes me.

276
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:08,220
Your dad owes me 230 million won
which is a hefty sum.

277
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:12,641
But he's saying
he has no money to pay me back.

278
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,436
Is that good or bad?

279
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,238
Answer me.

280
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:30,701
Is it good or bad
if you can't pay back what you owe?

281
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,203
It's bad.

282
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:34,955
That's right.

283
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,167
It's very bad.

284
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:43,088
That's why your dad's eyes...

285
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:52,014
Hwang Kyung-soon owns
the building at 543 Yeongdeungpo.

286
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,558
It may look like an ordinary building,

287
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:57,603
but illegal activities
such as human and organ trafficking

288
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,522
are taking place
in secret rooms throughout the building.

289
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:04,109
Over a hundred ring members
practically live in the building.

290
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,320
Tonight,

291
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,949
we'll raid that building.

292
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,912
Our top priority is collecting evidence.

293
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,872
Arresting them comes second.

294
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:20,167
They'll try to destroy evidence
if we move in rashly.

295
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,461
If that happens, our hands will be tied,

296
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,422
so we must secure evidence
before we strike.

297
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:30,010
No one else knows about this operation
except for us, Commissioner Nam Gu-hyun,

298
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,929
and Commander Cha of the SWAT team.

299
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,556
A few officers have cushy relationships

300
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,978
with Hwang Kyung-soon,
so we need to keep this quiet.

301
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,396
How many years for this?

302
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,480
Ten years.

303
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,940
That's big.

304
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:46,735
You can't put the same shoe on every foot.

305
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:51,323
This job is a risky one,
so you all need to be on high alert.

306
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:02,042
Dad.

307
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:03,919
Young-joon!

308
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:13,303
From now on,
you will have to be your dad's eyes.

309
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:14,680
Okay?

310
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,766
Get started.

311
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,019
No, please...

312
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:24,523
Dad...

313
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,567
You can't go with him.

314
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,863
You're too young.
You shouldn't see stuff like that.

315
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,004
The SWAT team is on standby.

316
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,382
You should wait here.

317
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,885
-Detective Kim, you stay with her.
-Yes, sir.

318
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,012
Are you guys ready?

319
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,312
Let's go clean up this mess.

320
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,823
How may I help you?

321
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:17,618
I'm here to see Kyung-soon.

322
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,080
-For what?
-Why would a cop be here?

323
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,838
Leave your phones here.

324
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,257
-Why?
-It's our protocol.

325
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,651
I could use a little lift right here.

326
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,286
THEY'RE HERE

327
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,664
Mr. Lee.

328
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,960
Where can I watch the security footage?

329
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,053
You're here to meet Madam Hwang?

330
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:20,556
Follow me.

331
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:25,853
Excuse me.

332
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:30,274
Can my boys take a look around
while I'm meeting her?

333
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:33,569
It'll be easier for us to have your backs
if something happens.

334
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,653
Okay, sure.

335
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,621
We have two workshops.

336
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,456
Then I'll go alone.

337
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,168
Detective Park, Detective Lee,
meet me here later.

338
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,213
Sure, Detective Jung.

339
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,347
You two can follow us.

340
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,476
Something's off.

341
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,604
They're just being friendly.

342
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,992
By the way, which precinct are you from?

343
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:27,789
Yongsan.

344
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,087
Where is the workshop?

345
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,589
We're almost there.

346
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,257
Okay, so where is it?

347
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,094
I said, we're almost there.

348
00:28:44,904 --> 00:28:46,099
I need to take a leak.

349
00:28:46,648 --> 00:28:47,559
Go ahead.

350
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:57,986
OPERATION ROOM

351
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,011
Where are we going?

352
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,687
We've been busted.

353
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:37,985
What's going on?

354
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,280
Focus.

355
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,378
Hey, what the heck is happening?
We're supposed to be cops.

356
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,339
Who swings at cops with a knife?

357
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:41,923
They know we're lying.

358
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,010
-Our plan was leaked.
-But only a few people know.

359
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,637
The people who know are us four,

360
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:50,390
Commissioner Nam,
Senior Inspector Yoo, and Commander Cha.

361
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:52,059
If none of us leaked the plan...

362
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,529
-Hello?
-We've been busted. Call for backup.

363
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,198
What do you mean?

364
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,287
They knew we were coming.

365
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,915
I don't have time to explain.
Request backup now.

366
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,416
Okay, got it.

367
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,308
It's done, Madam Hwang.

368
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:34,893
Detective Kim.

369
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:39,106
I trust you'll take care of the situation.
I have to go.

370
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:56,289
Do you use this radio
to contact Hwang directly?

371
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,794
You won't be able
to leave this place in one piece.

372
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,004
Worry about yourself.

373
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,662
Hey, Hwang Kyung-soon.

374
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,206
Can you hear me?

375
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,335
Listen up.

376
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,512
I'll catch you with my own hands.

377
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,301
Oh, no. I gained more wrinkles.

378
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:39,476
Hey, where are you going?

379
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,313
The SWAT team is waiting outside.
We need to call them in.

380
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,607
How? Hwang's boys are guarding the lobby.

381
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,568
The basement. There must be a way out.

382
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:52,697
What about Oh Gu-tak and Tae-su?
Just leave them here?

383
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:56,201
There's nothing we can do from here.
We need to go get help.

384
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:02,958
What we need now is the SWAT team,
not two criminals.

385
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,225
Guns leave traces.

386
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,103
Use knives.

387
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:28,233
Hello, sir.

388
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,195
Is this all Madam Hwang can do?

389
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:34,406
We set everything up for her.

390
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:36,825
What is this mess?

391
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,326
My apologies, sir.

392
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:43,999
Yes, ma'am.

393
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,502
He just arrived. One moment, please.

394
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,592
Hello.

395
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,844
Please take care of them.

396
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,306
Of course, we'll clean up the mess.

397
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,392
Come up for a cup of tea when you're done.

398
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,853
I have something for you.

399
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:08,356
I hear people like
to invest in gold these days.

400
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,193
All right, Madam Hwang.

401
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,949
I trust you to take care of this.

402
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,707
Kids, I'm going to tell you something.

403
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:30,045
I want you to tell
the uncles exactly what I tell you.

404
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,756
Do you understand, my angels?

405
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,889
Hello. This is Madam Hwang.

406
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:45,393
Your tasks must be
keeping you busy at the moment.

407
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48,980
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I have
an important announcement to make.

408
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,650
Please listen carefully.

409
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,818
As some of you may already know,

410
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:58,698
a couple of criminals
have sneaked into our building.

411
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:03,995
These evil criminals
ruthlessly beat up your colleagues.

412
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:08,583
At the moment, they're hiding somewhere,

413
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:14,297
vying for an opportunity
to take all of us down.

414
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,258
Here's what we'll do.

415
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:23,056
To catch these criminals,
we need to take some special measures.

416
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:27,060
It's 9:08 p.m. right now.

417
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,688
As of this moment...

418
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,773
Block off all exits at once!

419
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,942
Arm up and go!

420
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,239
Seal off all the exits!

421
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:48,456
All the exits and entrances
will be sealed off.

422
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,293
All communication networks

423
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:56,172
including the Internet, office phones,
and your cell phones will be cut off.

424
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:01,302
There's only one reason
I must take such drastic measures.

425
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:06,015
My dear employees, I ask all of you.

426
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:12,105
Find and kill these criminals
who are hiding in our building.

427
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,567
They're impersonating cops,

428
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:19,988
but they're wicked criminals
who should be put in jail.

429
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:27,245
So even if you kill them,
there will be no problem at all.

430
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:34,794
For me and for the sake of the company,
get these bastards.

431
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:38,256
Kill them and rip them to pieces.

432
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:44,220
Bring their corpses
to my office on the 15th floor.

433
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:49,434
Those of you
who grant this earnest wish of mine

434
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:52,812
will be offered a permanent position

435
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:57,150
as well as a huge raise.

436
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,070
All right. Get started.

437
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,375
-Hit him.
-Die!

438
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:58,878
Let's go.

439
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,409
Where is Madam Hwang?

440
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,161
Please don't do this.
I'm just an employee.

441
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,789
Answer my question, you prick.
Where is she?

442
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:38,877
I know nothing. I was just told
that I could make lots of money here.

443
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,089
You work at a place like this
just because the job pays well?

444
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,133
I'm just a tech guy.

445
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,136
I have nothing to do
with the log business.

446
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,806
The mother-in-law who says nothing
is just as bad as the abusive husband.

447
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:58,980
The wife will get beaten to death anyway
because of scumbags like you.

448
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,444
I'll give you a chance to make it right.

449
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:10,867
I need to meet Madam Hwang.
Do you know how I can do that?

450
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:15,747
Damn it.

451
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:18,291
This way.

452
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:24,756
Hang in there. After a few stabs,
it just feels like a needle poke.

453
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,216
Here, this way.

454
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,178
Hey, be careful.

455
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,527
These bastards.

456
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,531
Come on.

457
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,244
Damn it. Sit down here for a moment.

458
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:09,842
Are you all right?

459
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:15,932
It feels like I got a flu shot.

460
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:26,234
There's something I wanted to ask you.

461
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:30,279
Do you remember that psycho
from the hardware store?

462
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:32,949
When we were chasing him,

463
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:36,077
why did you help me?

464
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,707
Instead of catching him
to get your sentence reduced,

465
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,291
why did you come to my rescue?

466
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:48,297
What would you have done
in that situation?

467
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:54,804
Do you know why I'm doing this?

468
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:59,392
Aren't we both putting up with all this
to get our sentences reduced?

469
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:00,893
No.

470
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,564
I want to know more about myself.

471
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,066
That's why I'm doing this.

472
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,529
Am I really capable of murder?

473
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:16,701
If I truly have murdered people,
can I save lives too?

474
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,953
Would I want...

475
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,540
to save lives?

476
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:30,381
Those are the questions I want answered.

477
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,844
You're a complicated person.

478
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:38,389
Just get your sentence reduced
and don't ask so many questions.

479
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:44,479
Anyway, stay put and wait here.

480
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,147
Let me check out the situation.

481
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:13,633
Wait.

482
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,850
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

483
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,321
We were never here.

484
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,741
Madam Hwang said she'd clean up the mess.

485
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:59,137
Woong-chul, I need you to kill someone.

486
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:07,478
You know who this man is, right?

487
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,857
This is Lee Jung-moon,
the Hwayeon-dong serial killer.

488
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:15,820
There's this man I know and he has a kid.

489
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,823
That kid was a victim of Lee Jung-moon.

490
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:23,411
You said you wanted to live
a decent life when you got out.

491
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,497
That was what you told me
the last time I visited.

492
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,084
This is your chance.

493
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:34,714
I'll give you two weeks.
Get rid of him and give me a call.

494
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:40,219
Then you'll be free
to do whatever you want.

495
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,725
But if it's not done within two weeks,

496
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,561
you'll be the one to die.

497
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,717
Aren't you here to back us up?

498
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:25,514
Madam Hwang and you guys
are all criminals,

499
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,227
but you guys have no money.

500
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:34,148
You should've saved up a lot of money.

501
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,334
Kill him.

502
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,158
Hey!

503
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:34,375
Let me ask you something
because I really don't get it.

504
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,502
Do you think this is normal?

505
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,713
I get that you love money,

506
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,674
but there are some lines
that shouldn't be crossed.

507
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:10,745
Hey.

508
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,664
I saved your life.

509
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:33,934
Hey, psycho. Are you all right?

510
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,020
Get up. Are you okay?

511
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,607
Have you seen Captain Oh?

512
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,941
No, I have not.

513
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:44,612
Do you think they harvested
his organs and turned him into a log?

514
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:51,327
I've already laid everything down
so I have nothing to lose.

515
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:54,246
What a bunch of fools.

516
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,248
Why would they choose this path?

517
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:58,459
How did you know we were here?

518
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,419
What are the security cameras for?

519
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,297
Jung-moon, are you okay?

520
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,802
They sealed off all the exits
and cut off the Internet and phone lines.

521
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:10,221
How can we get out?

522
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,974
I do have an idea.

523
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,520
If I tell you what it is,

524
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,035
will you do as I say?

525
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:28,989
There's an emergency elevator
around the corner.

526
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:34,870
Hwang Kyung-soon
had it built for her VIP clients,

527
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:39,542
but it malfunctioned a month ago
and hasn't been in use since.

528
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,670
What are you suggesting
that we do with a broken elevator?

529
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,423
We can just take
that elevator outside and get out.

530
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:49,677
We'll have to fight them on every floor.
Do you want to get beaten to death?

531
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,845
You little...

532
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:55,224
In any case, we have 30 seconds
until the elevator malfunctions.

533
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,811
We won't experience
any issues in those 30 seconds.

534
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:03,482
And it just so happens
to be on the third floor where we are.

535
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,152
Do you get what I'm saying?

536
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:09,405
Take the emergency elevator
all the way to the 15th floor,

537
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,575
capture Madam Hwang,
and take her hostage to get out.

538
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:13,742
Bingo.

539
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,203
There's one problem though.

540
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,998
The power has been cut off,

541
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:23,836
so someone has to go to the fifth floor
and put the power back on.

542
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,424
As soon as the power is back on,

543
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,094
we'll make our way up.

544
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,850
But if we can't get
the emergency elevator to work...

545
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:41,145
Or if we don't make it
up to the 15th floor in 30 seconds...

546
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:45,900
Then all we can do is wait to be killed.

547
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:50,529
We were never that attached
to the idea of being alive anyway.

548
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:09,423
But if we manage to pull this off
and all four of us make it out alive...

549
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:13,928
If there's someone up there
that answers our prayers,

550
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:16,555
then I'd say it's a fight worth having.

551
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:21,810
Life is short
so why not fight for our lives?

552
00:50:34,821 --> 00:50:36,367
ELECTRICAL ROOM
MECHANICAL ROOM

553
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:40,204
ELECTRICAL ROOM

554
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:01,100
Come on.

555
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:10,609
One, two, three,

556
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:14,154
four, five,

557
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:19,493
six, seven, eight...

558
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:35,467
Eighteen, nineteen,

559
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,305
twenty, twenty-one,

560
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,975
twenty-two, twenty-three,

561
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,476
twenty-four...

562
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:47,104
Twenty-five,

563
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:49,523
twenty-six,

564
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:51,400
twenty-seven,

565
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,652
twenty-eight,

566
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,571
twenty-nine,

567
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:57,615
thirty.

568
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,298
What the heck?

569
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,723
Hwang Kyung-soon, you've aged quite a bit.

570
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:26,935
Even if you catch me,

571
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,730
you won't make it out alive.

572
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,528
Then let's die together.

573
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,823
We've lived long enough, don't you think?

574
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,141
Commissioner. It's me, Yoo Mi-young.

575
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,457
Hang in there.
I'll take you to the hospital soon.

576
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:21,467
Make way or your boss dies.

577
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:28,849
I said, make way! You bastards!

578
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:34,855
I don't care even if I die.

579
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,982
Let me revise my offer.

580
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:44,198
The one who kills
these bastards will get my position.

581
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:47,910
So go ahead and kill them.

582
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:55,501
Kill them, you morons!

583
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:05,631
You bastards. Do you all want to die?

584
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:07,716
Don't move.

585
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,970
Don't even lift a finger.

586
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:17,351
If you do, I'll put a bullet
straight through your heads. Got it!

587
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,443
Let go.

588
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:28,320
-Hey!
-I said, let go!

589
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:41,750
Are you all right?

590
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:46,004
When was the last time you fired your gun?

591
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,382
No idea.

592
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,218
It's been ages.

593
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:56,181
I have to say, I prefer baseball bats.

594
00:57:57,391 --> 00:58:00,852
It's just like fishing.
It's all about the experience.

595
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:36,388
You'll celebrate
your 70th birthday in prison.

596
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,890
That is if you're still alive.

597
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:42,144
Why wouldn't I be alive?

598
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:46,648
I've been taking
such great care of my health.

599
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:54,781
Goodness. I wish I could just beat you up.

600
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:01,246
Get up. Get in the car.

601
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,337
You throw quite the punch.

602
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,841
There's nothing I can't do.

603
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:14,885
Let's go.

604
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:27,189
Hello. No, he's still alive.

605
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:28,940
Let's wait before we make a move.

606
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:44,039
Scars, but no glory.

607
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:48,168
Let's go. Let's go get some food.

608
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:10,524
BAD GUYS

609
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:14,736
-Have all the druggies been taken care of?
-We'll be free of drugs for now.

610
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,738
Who's getting the reduction?

611
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,366
Hey, psycho. You take it this time.

612
01:00:19,614 --> 01:00:20,575
Sure.

613
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:22,911
Or let me have it.
I'll have four years left.

614
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,746
You really are a greedy pig.

615
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,498
Look who's talking.

616
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:27,541
What happened?

617
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,875
A mass shooting.

618
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:31,378
You guys will have to
stay out a little longer.

619
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,501
Six shots, six dead.

620
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,883
The sixth shot was fired carefully.

621
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,677
How do you plan to catch the perp?

622
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,262
It's been two weeks.

623
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,013
Let's go. To die.

624
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:44,641
Can you do me a favor?

625
01:00:45,031 --> 01:00:45,892
Tae-su.

626
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:47,602
Catch that bastard.

627
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:50,188
It's just us two now.

628
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:53,942
They're helping us even if it means
they won't get their sentence reduced.

629
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,402
Let's catch this one.

630
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:56,408
Move.

631
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:03,994
