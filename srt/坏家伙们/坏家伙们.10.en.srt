1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,838
BAD GUYS

2
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,698
BAD GUYS

3
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,325
PREVIOUSLY

4
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,787
The high school girl. The daughter
of the lead detective on the case.

5
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,249
Even the day she died,
you were in front of her house.

6
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:43,335
I will catch that scumbag
and kill him with my own hands.

7
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,798
Then I'll kneel before Ji-yeon.
I'll beg on my knees.

8
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,426
I'll apologize to her
for being a terrible father.

9
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,388
How do you and Jung-moon know each other?

10
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,807
I was the lead prosecutor on his case.

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,142
You're a psychopath, Lee Jung-moon.

12
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,019
What was I doing in this car?

13
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:05,482
Every time you showed up in this car,
you killed someone.

14
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,194
If you want the truth,
help me one last time.

15
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,071
If you want to blame me, pull the trigger.

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,285
I don't know anything.
Dr. Kim ordered me to do it.

17
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,580
Take it. It'll help you relax.

18
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,583
Lee Jung-moon?

19
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,005
How long have you been watching me?

20
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,925
The guilt and remorse
of robbing someone of their loved ones.

21
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,885
Now that I know what it's like.

22
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,680
Don't leave me alone. Please.

23
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,607
The person who approached Kim Do-sik
in an attempt to get Tae-su

24
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,984
to take out Jung-moon.

25
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,277
The person who contacted

26
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,530
Lee Du-kwang and ordered him
to get Woong-chul to kill Jung-moon.

27
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:58,577
This person gave orders to get rid
of Woong-chul and Tae-su as well.

28
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,287
Were you the one behind it?

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,332
Answer me at once.

30
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,375
Oh Gu-tak.

31
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,836
Was it you?

32
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,942
Rompun. It's an anesthetic.

33
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:18,782
Lee Jung-moon, I knew you'd come find me.

34
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,490
There you are, at last.

35
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:09,082
THE DANCING KNIFE

36
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,879
So you fabricated evidence
to put Jung-moon behind bars?

37
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,130
EPISODE 10

38
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,174
It surely is interesting.

39
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,302
But I must say,
it's too cruel and disrespectful.

40
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,346
The puzzle is finally coming together.

41
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,018
Now, I get why Jung-moon went AWOL
and went to see Yang Yoo-jin.

42
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,606
You said I tried to kill you,

43
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,692
but I really don't remember.

44
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,989
And now, I know why
you were so sure that he'd go to her.

45
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,034
So you're sure Lee will try
to track down Yang Yoo-jin?

46
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:49,414
The pieces of the puzzle
are finally falling into place.

47
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:54,544
You think I got Woong-chul and Tae-su out

48
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:58,840
to use their connections
to kill Jung-moon?

49
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:02,135
I'm convinced that's why you did it.
It's not just a presumption.

50
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,391
If you're that convinced,
I won't try to explain myself.

51
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:12,687
However,
I didn't get them out to kill Jung-moon.

52
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:13,939
Then why?

53
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:18,151
I wanted to see.
That's why I got them out.

54
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:23,490
Is Jung-moon really
the Hwayeon-dong killer?

55
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:27,160
If so, was he the one
who killed my daughter?

56
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,580
I wanted to find out the truth

57
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:35,877
by observing him
while keeping him under my control.

58
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,172
I'm not quite following.

59
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,093
You fabricated evidence
to put him behind bars.

60
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,135
Why get him out...

61
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,054
It was sometime last year.

62
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:51,351
I didn't come out of my room for months.
I was alive but barely breathing.

63
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,230
Suddenly, I had this thought.

64
00:05:56,565 --> 00:06:00,193
Why did I conclude
that Jung-moon was the killer back then?

65
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,238
The kerosene?

66
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:07,492
Because he was caught
on one of the cameras near the scene?

67
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,786
Just because of that?

68
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:14,374
There were no eyewitnesses
who saw him kill any of the victims

69
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,878
so why was I so sure?

70
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,799
Did I let my emotions cloud my judgment?

71
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:30,432
I had these thoughts
constantly popping up into my head.

72
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,685
And those thoughts

73
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,232
led me to question whether or not
he really said what I thought he did.

74
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,070
Your daughter is beautiful.

75
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,825
Did he actually say that?

76
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,870
It got me questioning.

77
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,165
Did I make that up?

78
00:06:56,458 --> 00:07:00,128
Perhaps, he didn't say anything
when he walked by.

79
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,005
Maybe that's what actually happened.

80
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,841
But because I was so convinced,

81
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,678
perhaps I kept telling myself
that I had never been wrong

82
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,847
and that it had to be right.

83
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:15,185
So perhaps,
my brain made up such a memory.

84
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,355
Maybe I was so caught up
in my determination

85
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,025
to avenge my daughter's death
that I only thought about

86
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,444
finding someone to blame
rather than the truth.

87
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:33,203
I kept thinking such crazy thoughts
which kept me up for days.

88
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:39,709
So, you thought Jung-moon might not
actually be the Hwayeon-dong killer?

89
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:44,464
Is that why you visited him in prison?
You suddenly felt a pang of guilt?

90
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,469
I don't want to call it "guilt"
because it'd make me feel too miserable.

91
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,725
All of a sudden, I just felt bad for him.

92
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,983
Yang Yoo-jin says she feels bad.

93
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:15,036
I couldn't bring myself to say sorry.

94
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,623
I felt that I'd be wronging Ji-yeon
if I apologized to him.

95
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,419
So? What's your conclusion?

96
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,464
You observed him, fully knowing the risk.

97
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,633
What's your conclusion
regarding Jung-moon?

98
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,511
A psychopathic serial killer?

99
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,306
Or just an innocent victim
of your burning desire for revenge?

100
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,185
In your opinion,
which one is the real Lee Jung-moon?

101
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:44,482
The clouds I saw in the past
always brought rain without fail.

102
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,359
So far, that is.

103
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:51,781
But this time, I felt like I could see
some sun rays through the clouds.

104
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,119
So I thought,
maybe I really was wrong about him.

105
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,622
Just as I was beginning to think that,

106
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,210
it suddenly started pouring.

107
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:08,465
I had put my umbrella down
because of the faint rays of sunshine

108
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,925
only to get soaked.

109
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,053
Like an idiot.

110
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,391
I'm not sure
whether or not you'll believe me,

111
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:22,228
but the person who tried to get
Woong-chul and Tae-su to kill Jung-moon...

112
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,025
It wasn't me.

113
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,278
Well, I don't care
even if you don't believe me.

114
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:34,824
Where are you going?

115
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,370
I'm off to catch and kill Jung-moon.

116
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,497
No.

117
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,624
That's not going to happen.

118
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,629
I had no choice.

119
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,932
Senior Inspector Yoo.

120
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,643
Did you set me up?

121
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,479
The incidents from two years ago
that you told me about.

122
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,191
I had circumstantial evidence
deduced from your case file,

123
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,235
but there was no direct evidence.

124
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,028
But now, I have it.

125
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:13,947
Direct evidence.

126
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,205
Yoo Mi-young.

127
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,166
What a lowlife you are.

128
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,253
And you call yourself a civil servant?

129
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,506
Just follow them quietly.
They'll take good care of you.

130
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,883
You know my nickname, don't you?

131
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,428
I don't care who I bite.

132
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,526
Stop!

133
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,864
I will no longer tolerate your antics,
Captain Oh.

134
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,295
Don't you dare bark
if you don't have the nerve to bite.

135
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,173
-Captain Oh.
-Lee Jung-moon.

136
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:17,677
I will turn myself in
once I kill that scumbag,

137
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,722
so quit your antics now,
Senior Inspector Yoo.

138
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:38,448
Can't you just let me handle this?

139
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,951
Are you with Prosecutor Oh now?

140
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,418
I feel so bad for Commissioner Nam.

141
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:57,467
The person who tried to get Woong-chul
and Tae-su to take out Jung-moon.

142
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,386
It really wasn't you?

143
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,558
Earlier, you said

144
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:11,481
you didn't know why you were convinced
Jung-moon was the killer two years ago.

145
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,903
I think I know why
you arrived at such a conclusion.

146
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,865
You wanted to catch
the Hwayeon-dong killer

147
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,117
to clear your conscience. Am I wrong?

148
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:28,623
You sold your integrity when you accepted
the 50 million won from Lee Du-kwang.

149
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:32,460
I bet that had been weighing
on your conscience.

150
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,295
So you probably thought hard

151
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,757
to figure out a way
to clear your conscience in one blow.

152
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,928
Then you decided to solve
the Hwayeon-dong serial murder case.

153
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,890
You thought solving
the biggest homicide case in the precinct

154
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,018
would help you lighten your load.

155
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,437
Wasn't that what you thought?

156
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,899
Be honest with me.

157
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,154
You were never even interested
in finding evidence anyway.

158
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,075
From the get-go,
you just wanted him to be the killer.

159
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,203
Because putting him
behind bars as the perp

160
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,040
would help you lessen your burden.

161
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,334
That's why you framed him

162
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,170
which was very unlike you.

163
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:23,761
Don't resent Jung-moon.
You should resent yourself if anything.

164
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,724
Everything that has happened
in the past two years,

165
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:32,478
it's all on you, Captain Oh Gu-tak.

166
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,701
Once you're in hell,
even repentance feels like a luxury.

167
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,924
This is Patrol 1.

168
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,427
A person of interest
has been found murdered.

169
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,721
A key member of the East Side Gang.

170
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,891
I repeat. A key member
of the East Side Gang has been murdered.

171
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,564
Get ready for an outing.

172
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,618
Who do we need to catch this time?

173
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:40,880
So you're saying...

174
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,051
Lee Jung-moon did this?

175
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,637
Evidence is everywhere.

176
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,141
We have security footage
that shows him entering the building.

177
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,104
They must have tussled.

178
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:59,399
We found Jung-moon's
fingerprints and DNA everywhere.

179
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,693
And the murder weapon
has his prints all over it.

180
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:08,324
There's no doubt that Jung-moon
was the one who killed your boss.

181
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:14,705
You must've known
that something was up between those two.

182
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,420
The person
who ordered your boss to kill me.

183
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,588
Who is it?

184
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,133
I'll just ask him

185
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:27,760
myself.

186
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,936
Do you mind stepping out for a moment?

187
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,150
Step out for a moment, will you?

188
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,172
You still wear that ring?

189
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,425
I see that the plating has worn off.

190
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,721
I promised to buy you one
made of real gold once I became rich.

191
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,890
You can still keep that promise.

192
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,853
Just kill Lee Jung-moon,
and we can start over.

193
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,440
You can have a nice car,
fancy clothes, and good food again.

194
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,442
You can live the good life.

195
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,112
Jung-moon went to meet Lee Du-kwang
to find out who ordered the hit

196
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:14,116
but got into a fight and killed him.
Is that your interpretation?

197
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,119
No need for interpretation.

198
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,957
Lee Jung-moon killed Lee Du-kwang.
Just look at the facts.

199
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,168
Emotions get in the way
when you try to interpret things.

200
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,586
And you'll end up like me.

201
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:27,797
What happened?

202
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,552
Lee Du-kwang is dead? What happened?

203
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,637
Well, it's...

204
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,605
I heard that moron Oh Gu-tak
removed Jung-moon's anklet,

205
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,315
so you can't track him down now.

206
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,071
How did this happen? You tell me.

207
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,203
What I told you just now

208
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,456
is the reason Captain Oh
made you two and Jung-moon

209
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,667
join the Special Crime Investigation Team.

210
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,463
So he was the person who wanted me
to kill Jung-moon two years ago?

211
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,758
Because Jung-moon, that psycho,
killed his daughter?

212
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,011
He wanted revenge?

213
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,014
-Yes.
-Then here's another question.

214
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,890
This one is more important to me.

215
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,851
Answer truthfully.

216
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,729
This is regarding the recent events.

217
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,692
As you know, the man lying down there
was ordered to kill Jung-moon.

218
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,487
And even I was approached
to get rid of Jung-moon.

219
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:38,659
That person tried to get me and Woong-chul
killed as well, on top of Jung-moon.

220
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:43,456
Was that person...

221
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,376
Oh Gu-tak?

222
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,797
I lost so much because of that scumbag.

223
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,926
In fact, I have nothing left now.

224
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,222
I have to meet that bastard.

225
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,268
I have to meet him no matter what
so I can make him suffer

226
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,064
and do exactly what he did to me.

227
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,484
Now, tell me.

228
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,362
Was Oh Gu-tak...

229
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,573
behind everything?

230
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,533
I'm not 100 percent sure...

231
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:20,743
Yes, it was him.

232
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,831
Captain Oh Gu-tak ordered the hit.

233
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:32,588
We only have circumstantial evidence,
but my gut tells me that it was him.

234
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,756
Prosecutor Oh.

235
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,883
I don't know how you guys will take this,

236
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:39,261
but there are three dents
in his otherwise pristine record.

237
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,180
Guess what they are.

238
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,474
Park Woong-chul,
Jung Tae-su, Lee Jung-moon.

239
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,558
The three of you.

240
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:49,397
If it weren't for you guys,
he'd have a spotless record.

241
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,067
I bet he wanted to get rid of the dents.

242
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:57,321
So he got you two and Jung-moon out
and tried to kill you guys

243
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,534
because his painful memories
will fade away

244
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,911
once those responsible for them are gone.

245
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,125
Well, why don't we do this?

246
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:13,003
Just act according to the way
you're feeling right now.

247
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:17,717
Woong-chul. Jung-moon killed your boss,
so you must want to find him. Go for it.

248
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:23,264
Tae-su, you said you lost everything
because of Captain Oh.

249
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,434
So take away
exactly what he took from you.

250
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,313
So once we catch them,
we can do whatever we want?

251
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,443
I'll leave it up to you guys.

252
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,278
Remember this though.

253
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,991
This is a confidential investigation,
so no one else knows about it.

254
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,326
Except for Senior Inspector Yoo.

255
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,289
Any questions?

256
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,125
All right, then. Let's get to work.

257
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,343
-What are you thinking?
-What?

258
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,929
Why talk like it's a fact
when we're not sure yet?

259
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,391
I have to make up
for the mistake you made.

260
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:08,434
That's why.

261
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,186
What mistake?

262
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,688
Why did you let Oh Gu-tak get away?

263
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,816
We have to capture and interrogate him

264
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,361
in order to find out the truth.
Am I wrong?

265
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,493
What is the leadership quality
that a manager needs the most?

266
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,496
Keeping your team motivated.

267
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,792
I've given them motivation,
so they'll get him in a few days.

268
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,377
All we have to do is trust them and wait.

269
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:39,215
What if they really kill them?
Then what will you do?

270
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,592
Commissioner Nam no longer has your back,

271
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,512
so I believe I'm the only one
you can count on now.

272
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,515
Just keep your mouth shut and do as I say.

273
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,350
Don't worry about pointless things.

274
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:53,687
I don't think it's "pointless"
to worry about someone getting killed.

275
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,315
Let's stay focused
and only think about our goal.

276
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,612
Getting the team disbanded.
That is our goal.

277
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,741
Whether they die or not,
it's not our problem.

278
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,326
Right?

279
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,038
Is it that easy for you?

280
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:15,584
Prosecutor Oh. Were you always like this?

281
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,590
Once you've experienced traumatic pain,

282
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,636
you never think
about what kind of person you are.

283
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,390
You only think about
what kind of person you must become.

284
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,022
A female detective
came to see you once, right?

285
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,446
Was it about him?

286
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,616
You recognize his face, don't you?

287
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,577
He does look familiar.

288
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,955
I have to find this guy
as soon as possible,

289
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,292
but he's fallen off the grid.
And his phone is off.

290
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,751
I need your help.

291
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,754
You're good with the stethoscope.

292
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:02,882
Help me out.

293
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:08,053
When it comes to jobs that involve
wiretapping and bugging, I'm very picky.

294
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,681
-Find someone else.
-Mr. Lim...

295
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,268
died because of this man.

296
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,645
Jong-seok and Hyun-woo too.

297
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:24,236
This man meddled in our lives.

298
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,739
That's why they died.

299
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,535
The few people that were dear to me...

300
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,123
all died because of this man.

301
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,667
All of them.

302
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,797
Are you sure?

303
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,036
I'll be back, boss.

304
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:03,460
As you guys already know,
Boss passed away.

305
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,046
He was murdered, to be exact.

306
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,217
I don't have a way with words,
so I'll keep it short. Listen up.

307
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,762
Take a good look at that face.

308
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:17,016
That bastard killed Du-kwang.

309
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,476
-What?
-Who is this scumbag?

310
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,104
Don't worry about the funeral.

311
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,356
Return to your turfs at once.

312
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:28,277
Speak to every business owner,
waiter, procuress, and bouncer.

313
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,696
Bars, billiard halls. Knock on every door.

314
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:36,285
Anyone with a pair of eyes
that can recognize a face must see this.

315
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,246
The entire city of Seoul is
in the palm of our hand anyway,

316
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:43,250
so you guys will surely find him
if he's somewhere in Seoul.

317
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,463
If you see someone
who resembles him even just slightly,

318
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,256
call me right away.

319
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:56,764
Excuse me.

320
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,058
What's going on?

321
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:06,023
You guys can dine at fancy restaurants
in Seoul and drive nice cars

322
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,109
all thanks to Du-kwang.

323
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,527
And he was...

324
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,743
He was like a real brother to me.

325
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,953
So bring this bastard to me.

326
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:21,914
No matter what.

327
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,916
-Yes, boss!
-Yes, boss!

328
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:38,031
That's right.
Everything went without a hitch.

329
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:40,576
Yes, I told you.
Just hurry over here and...

330
00:27:58,427 --> 00:27:59,261
Hello.

331
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,306
Do you sell prepaid phones?

332
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,731
You scared the crap out of me.

333
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:15,277
What's going on?
Why are the prosecutors after you?

334
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:19,323
When you're stuck in the gutter,
sewer flies circle around you.

335
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,408
Anyway, did you find out anything?

336
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,748
Take a look. This is the car
you were in that day, right?

337
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,375
It was seen entering Seoul
from Gapyeong last night.

338
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:36,340
Kidnapped by the one he tried to kidnap.

339
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,636
He got you good, Jung-moon.

340
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,139
I need you to look into someone.

341
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,099
What, again? Who?

342
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,976
Is it too much hassle again?

343
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,646
Okay, fine. Who? Who is it?

344
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,147
His name is Kim Dong-ho.

345
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,026
He ran a psychiatric clinic
in Guro three years ago.

346
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,028
Do some digging.

347
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,989
If there's anything fishy,
find out everything about it.

348
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,574
What is going on, seriously?

349
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,284
You need to tell me!

350
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:11,208
Here, I got you one too.

351
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:15,212
Once you collect enough info on him,
call me with this phone.

352
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:16,672
I'm off.

353
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:22,511
Hello?

354
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:27,641
Hello?

355
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:29,941
What?

356
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,396
You got the wrong number.

357
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,942
I told you. I'm not Hwang Sung-sik!

358
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,069
I don't believe you.

359
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,863
Are you really not Hwang Sung-sik?

360
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,533
How many times must I tell you?

361
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,618
I am not. Don't you understand Korean?

362
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:49,204
Okay, fine. Why are you so angry?

363
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,582
All right. Sorry about that.

364
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:56,044
Did you get it?

365
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:09,224
Now, we can listen in on all his calls.

366
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:13,687
I thought you had to plant a bug
in the person's phone to listen in.

367
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:18,025
All cell phone calls
go through a base station.

368
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:21,695
So all we have to do is
snatch his calls through the base station

369
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:25,741
and locate him. Then it's game over.

370
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,837
Get up and greet your guest.

371
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:01,109
No, he's alive.

372
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,778
Let's wait and see.

373
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,724
Make sure he doesn't come
looking for me again.

374
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,684
Make no mistake. Do you understand?

375
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:48,708
Who are you guys?

376
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,930
Jeez, what the hell am I doing
with these kids now?

377
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,473
Hand out of the pocket.

378
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:17,853
Hey, have you guys seen this man?

379
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:18,979
No.

380
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,939
Look at it before you answer.

381
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:25,152
Did you just glare at me? You little brat.

382
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,322
Forget it. Go take some vitamins
and grow up, you punks.

383
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,424
Lee Jung-moon?

384
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,634
Hey, that's him. Get him!

385
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,750
Come on!

386
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,742
Hey, drag him out.

387
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,579
Hey, open the door!

388
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,417
Boss, what should we do?

389
00:33:26,065 --> 00:33:27,088
Open it.

390
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,715
Get out of the car, Jung-moon.

391
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,343
Just go.

392
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,095
What the...

393
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,266
Get them!

394
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,268
Hey! Stop!

395
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,686
Pull over. Hey!

396
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,523
I'm sorry. Let me get off!

397
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,360
Stop the car!

398
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,111
Please!

399
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,948
Jung-moon, please! Stop!

400
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,192
Lee Jung-moon!

401
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,154
It was you, right?

402
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,448
You killed Du-kwang.

403
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,660
Woong-chul wants to see you.

404
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,711
There you are, at last.

405
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,842
Are you sure? Where?

406
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:55,885
Wangsimni? I'll call you back.

407
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,346
-Wangsimni is pretty close, right?
-Yes.

408
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,015
Hurry. Step on the gas.

409
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:16,448
This way.

410
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,955
HOTEL
ROOM 506

411
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:29,057
Jeez, this pig! What the hell did he eat?

412
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,559
Oh, man.

413
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,645
Ouch! I nearly broke my back.

414
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,939
Gosh, my back...

415
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:38,775
It really hurts.

416
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,236
Boss, you're here.

417
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,655
What happened? Are they dead or asleep?

418
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:47,283
Well, neither. They were electrocuted.

419
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,077
Anyway, they'll wake up soon.

420
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,788
This bed is way too small for him.

421
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,456
Switch them.

422
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,083
Got it. Wait, what?

423
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,292
Is he really heavy?

424
00:38:56,376 --> 00:39:00,255
-He weighs about 180 kg.
-Oh, I see.

425
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:02,725
Just switch them.

426
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:04,551
Okay, boss.

427
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,356
Captain Oh resisted arrest
and is on the run at the moment

428
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,275
and Lee Jung-moon killed someone.

429
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,610
The other two are trying
to track them down,

430
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,280
but even if we wrap up the case now,

431
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,533
those responsible
will face disciplinary action.

432
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,534
I suggest...

433
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,954
If you disband
the Special Crime Investigation Team

434
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:37,959
and hold Captain Oh accountable
for his personal deviation...

435
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,628
Then it won't affect me.

436
00:39:41,384 --> 00:39:42,338
Is that it?

437
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,424
Yes, sir.

438
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,846
Mi-young.

439
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,891
Have you ever eaten a fallen apple?

440
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,062
From time to time,
you see people at markets

441
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:04,694
selling apples that fell from trees
due to wind or storm damage.

442
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:10,325
They look all beaten and bruised.

443
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,911
They're dimpled and ugly,

444
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:17,165
so they're carelessly
thrown into black plastic bags

445
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,918
and sold at half price.

446
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:26,716
I had never eaten
apples like that my whole life,

447
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:30,053
so I got curious and wanted to taste one.

448
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,389
One day, I bought one and tasted it.

449
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,060
I tried it and...

450
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,688
Do you know how it tasted?

451
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,526
It tasted just the same.

452
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:51,366
The ones that were knocked
to the ground after a stormy day

453
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,827
and were left lying around
in the mud for days

454
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:58,289
because they were all ugly and bruised

455
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,833
taste just as good

456
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:05,129
as the nicely packaged red apples
ripened to perfection

457
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:08,800
that you see at expensive grocery stores.

458
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,308
Commissioner Nam.

459
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:18,851
You and your metaphors.

460
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,564
Do you find it funny?

461
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,443
What's with the snide snicker?

462
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,863
Earlier, you basically told me

463
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:34,617
that I should just throw
the rotten windfall apples

464
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,787
down the sewer somewhere

465
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:42,000
and lie that I've never seen
or tasted them.

466
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,668
"I know nothing about them."

467
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:46,337
That's what you want me to say?

468
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,924
Tell me, Oh Jae-won.

469
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,718
Do you think they're subhuman?

470
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,680
To you, I guess
they're just things you can use

471
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,932
and toss once you no longer need them.

472
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:02,854
You're out of line.

473
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,939
Be respectful, Commissioner Nam.

474
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:08,526
You can't teach an infant
how to use the toilet.

475
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:12,864
I don't need to be respectful
to an impudent punk like you.

476
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:16,492
Should you wish to cut a deal with me,

477
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:20,496
have a heart first. Do you understand?

478
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:34,677
Mi-young.

479
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:40,141
Do you not regret your decision?

480
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:50,109
I guess I'm getting old.
Because I already lost my son,

481
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:55,656
it really hurts to lose you too.
You were like a daughter to me.

482
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:00,703
You can come back anytime
if you change your mind.

483
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,247
I'm not going anywhere.

484
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:12,590
I think I've come too far, sir.

485
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,426
I'm sorry.

486
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,736
KIM DONG-HO, MALE, PSYCHIATRIST

487
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,571
Hi. It's me, Chang-joon.

488
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,992
Hello?

489
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,871
Isn't this Oh Gu-tak's phone? Hello?

490
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,623
Did I dial the wrong number?

491
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,626
Which phone are you using now?

492
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,464
Turn off your phone
and use the one I gave you.

493
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:56,509
As they say, even walls have ears.

494
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,601
It's me, Chang-joon.

495
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:07,728
Is this really necessary though?

496
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,897
Are we in a spy movie or what?

497
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,191
I think this is a bit much.

498
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:15,403
I resisted arrest
and beat up those prosecutors.

499
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,488
Don't you think it's awfully quiet?

500
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,574
It's got to be one of these two.

501
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:23,161
Either they're tailing me quietly,

502
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:26,122
or I've gone deaf.

503
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,500
Do you think I've gone deaf?

504
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:32,336
Then we wouldn't be able
to talk on the phone.

505
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,589
Should I come to where you are?

506
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,509
No, it's not like
I can invite you over right now.

507
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:42,430
Let's meet somewhere crowded
and do some people-watching.

508
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,473
Okay, where?

509
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,270
Hongdae. It's a buzzing area
with lots of young people.

510
00:45:03,353 --> 00:45:04,285
Not yet?

511
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,746
No, not yet.

512
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,874
But so many people in the area
are on the phone at the moment,

513
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,710
so there will be some cross-connection.

514
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,712
Does he know we're onto him?

515
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,549
I don't think so. I'd call it an instinct

516
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,885
of a seasoned detective.

517
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:25,848
You must get him
as soon as he meets Park Chang-joon.

518
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,684
Prepaid phones can't be tracked.

519
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:30,645
Things will get messy if you lose him.

520
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:36,192
Where are you? Why aren't you here yet?

521
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:40,154
I'm here. I see you.

522
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:43,074
What? Where? Where are you?

523
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:48,204
Hey, do you wear that jacket
all year around?

524
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:54,585
Chang-joon. Let's fart to see
if we've got someone on our tail.

525
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:58,839
See that little park?
I see lots of youngsters there.

526
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,259
Meet me there, okay?

527
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:05,263
Jeez, I haven't even eaten yet.
Must you crack a fart joke?

528
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:08,849
Shut it. Just go ahead and fart, man.

529
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,434
Go.

530
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,897
Hey, don't move. It's a test.

531
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:31,289
Maybe I overreacted.

532
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,291
I'm coming now.

533
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:35,751
Go, now!

534
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,394
I don't think we have anyone on our tail.

535
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,646
Still, don't let your guard down.

536
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:59,150
Oh, right. I asked you
to do some digging on Kim Dong-ho.

537
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,318
Did you find anything?

538
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,236
He doesn't have a criminal record,

539
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,239
but his wife was murdered
by a serial killer.

540
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:08,284
I got everything on him
and his close acquaintances,

541
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,785
so you take a look.

542
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,455
I'm at the park now.

543
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,665
Okay, wait there. I'm almost there too.

544
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,420
I'm at the park. They're about to meet.

545
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,676
See the trash can in front of you?

546
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,428
Yes, I do.

547
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,096
Then toss what you brought.

548
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,682
And that's your cue to leave.

549
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,934
What? I don't even get to see you?

550
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,438
Why would you want to see
this pasty-faced old man?

551
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:40,608
Besides, being seen with me
won't do you any good.

552
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,776
All right, then.

553
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,405
I've tossed it.

554
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:48,657
Hey, be careful.

555
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:50,785
All right, you too.

556
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:54,205
Get regular checkups unless
you want to deal with a health scare.

557
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,957
Hey, Gu-tak. Wait.

558
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,667
Remember Detective Joo?

559
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:00,461
He called me.

560
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,963
He's at Seongdong Police Station,
near Wangsimni.

561
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:07,968
Anyway, he thinks Lee Jung-moon was seen
in the area about two hours ago.

562
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,096
What?

563
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:13,682
A car crashed into a tree.
While checking the surveillance footage,

564
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:16,060
he saw Lee Jung-moon
getting out of the car.

565
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,313
Then he dashed off
and some thugs ran after him.

566
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,524
But he's a lifer.

567
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,692
Joo is probably mistaken, right?

568
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:27,822
That means he might have managed
to escape from Kim Dong-ho.

569
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,699
Are you saying
it was really Lee Jung-moon?

570
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:34,745
Come on. You know something, don't you?

571
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:37,373
-What is going on?
-Babe, where are you?

572
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,916
I'm in Hongdae now.

573
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,418
I see. How long will you be?

574
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:43,712
Yes, I'm in Hongdae.

575
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,133
Yoo-jin.

576
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,518
How's it going? Do you like your place?

577
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:41,395
What do you think?

578
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:44,815
If you had been more cautious,
you wouldn't have been scammed.

579
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:48,527
-You know how I got that money.
-If you're here to provoke me, just leave.

580
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,451
What do you want from me?

581
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,281
RECENTS
1 NEW VOICE MESSAGE

582
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,204
First new message.

583
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:41,914
Jung-moon.

584
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,291
It's me, Yoo-jin.

585
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:49,046
You must resent me a lot.

586
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:51,006
I know.

587
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:53,634
I had no choice though.

588
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:55,511
Oh Gu-tak...

589
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,888
He threatened me.

590
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:02,518
He fabricated the whole thing.

591
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,480
I'm in Seoul now.

592
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:10,025
My address is...

593
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:17,992
Boss. It's me, Woo-seok.

594
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:25,666
Follow him. I'll be right there.

595
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,629
Hello?

596
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:33,048
Hey. It's me, Gu-tak.

597
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,344
Where are you?

598
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:40,222
Well, you know.
Somewhere in this tiny country.

599
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:44,018
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

600
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:47,688
Gu-hyun. Do you trust me?

601
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,189
I do, of course.

602
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:54,445
Who else would I trust if not you?

603
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:58,574
Thanks.

604
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:02,453
It's important to have
at least one person you can trust.

605
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,248
Gu-hyun.

606
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,710
Take care of yourself, okay?

607
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:13,047
So you won't fall ill out of the blue.

608
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,257
What are you saying?

609
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:19,470
I have you looking out for me.
I have you, Oh Gu-tak.

610
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:22,348
Hey, Gu-tak. Where are you now?

611
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:24,099
Gu-tak! Hey!

612
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:52,211
You got him?

613
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,217
Where is he?

614
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,720
That scumbag, Oh Gu-tak.

615
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:21,865
He just left.

616
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:42,594
Please just stay alive.

617
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:44,596
You will...

618
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,266
You'll die at my hands.

619
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:19,590
Jung-moon.

620
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,074
On your knees.

621
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,411
I said, on your knees.

622
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,421
Look at me.

623
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,058
So it was all you?

624
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,020
I heard you threatened Yoo-jin

625
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,981
to put it all on me.

626
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:20,818
Why did you do that?

627
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:22,277
What about you?

628
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:25,656
Why did you do that to me?

629
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,201
My daughter, Ji-yeon.

630
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:33,497
She didn't do anything wrong.
Why did you kill her?

631
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,083
Why?

632
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:40,212
I...

633
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:43,590
don't remember.

634
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:46,510
Fine.

635
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:48,595
Don't try to remember

636
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,558
because I remember exactly what happened.

637
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:07,698
Hey.

638
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:13,662
Get up.

639
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:17,332
Stand up straight before I rip you apart.

640
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,046
That little...

641
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,098
I'll take from you

642
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,059
what you took from me.

643
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:45,193
Did you think I'd let you get away
with what you did to Du-kwang?

644
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,322
You're dead meat now.

645
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:54,786
Get up.

646
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,253
I told you that I'd take care of it.
I said to let me handle it!

647
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:07,174
Why did you kill Du-kwang?
Why? Answer me, you bastard!

648
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,593
You piece of...

649
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:14,640
Did you really...

650
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,644
I told you that it wasn't me.
Why won't you believe me...

651
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:30,447
You know, we could've been friends.

652
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:32,532
Don't you think?

653
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,161
I wish...

654
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:40,290
I wish I actually killed them.

655
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:45,170
If I really killed all those people
and remembered killing them,

656
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:49,549
then it'd be much easier.

657
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:55,013
Aren't you sick of saying
that you don't remember anything?

658
00:57:58,850 --> 00:57:59,810
I am sick of it.

659
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,356
So I want to end it now.

660
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,443
I want it over.

661
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:11,488
Okay.

662
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:14,324
Then I will grant your wish.

663
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,257
Got anything to say

664
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:32,551
before you die?

665
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:45,522
What's your deal?

666
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:52,696
Can you only laugh
now that you're about to die?

667
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,410
No.

668
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,539
I'm just laughing
at how pathetic I look now.

669
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:18,221
Was it...

670
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,476
really not you?

671
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:26,938
If it really wasn't you,

672
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:30,067
convince me.

673
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:32,736
Convince you?

674
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,449
Just go ahead and kill me, you prick.

675
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:40,660
I have no energy to talk,
let alone convince you.

676
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,333
For old times' sake,

677
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:51,171
I'll make this quick and easy,
so don't resent me.

678
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,034
Jung-moon, you fool.

679
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,620
Try to remember.

680
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:26,873
Then I don't have to kill you.

681
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:29,960
I told you.

682
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:31,878
I don't remember.

683
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,672
Why don't you remember?

684
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,759
Beat your brains out if you have to!

685
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:44,432
I'm really sorry,

686
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:48,228
but I truly...

687
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:55,652
don't remember.

688
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:02,701
You approached us to kill Jung-moon.

689
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,911
That's why I was contacted for the job.

690
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,164
Am I wrong?

691
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,791
Yes, you're right.

692
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,169
It was all me.

693
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,505
Happy now?

694
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,550
I'm not playing with you, bastard.

695
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:21,386
Isn't that what you want to hear?

696
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,472
That I was the one behind it all.

697
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:29,603
I used you guys to kill Jung-moon

698
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:33,815
and that's why
everyone you cared about died.

699
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:37,736
That's the answer you want.

700
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,821
You scumbag.

701
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,867
Tae-su.

702
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:46,912
What I said just now...

01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,707
Think nothing of it.

704
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:04,304
Come on. Convince me.

705
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,518
I said, convince me.

706
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:13,313
Please!

707
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:22,906
Okay.

708
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:27,327
I understand.

709
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:42,425
Do it.

710
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:05,532

711
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,551
I'm sorry.
