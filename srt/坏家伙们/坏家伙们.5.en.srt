1
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,280
Oppa!

2
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,270
What's this?

3
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,680
Don't ask anything and just let me go.

4
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:53,290
<i>Reason for Murder</i>

5
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,540
<i>Episode 5</i>

6
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,350
<i>Yes, how can I help?</i>

7
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,280
People are dying here.

8
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,710
Crazy people busted in

9
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,860
and are beating my boys.

10
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,330
What are you doing?

11
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,340
I-I'm reporting to the police.

12
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,970
Yes, I'm a cop.

13
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,400
There was some trouble

14
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,330
<i>Excuse me? What are you talking about?</i>

15
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,390
Where did you call?

16
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,020
I called 114.

17
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,980
Why? To ask the number for Chinese takeout?

18
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,170
Remember!

19
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,150
Espionage 111, crime report 112,

20
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,540
In case of fire 119, narcotics 127.

21
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,830
What's the number for reporting narcotics?

22
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,760
127.

23
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,010
Take it.

24
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,090
E-Excuse me?

25
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,340
"I'm the exclusive narcotic distributor for Seoul area."

26
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,720
You report yourself, you bastard.

27
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,500
Here.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,340
Hello?

29
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,780
I'm calling to make a report.

30
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,450
Yes, drugs.

31
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,430
No, I didn't pick it up. Ah, seriously.

32
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,720
It's that... I'm... I make drugs.

33
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,300
Let's wrap up.

34
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,210
Are all the druggies cleared out?

35
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,620
There won't be any powder clouding the air for a while.

36
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,500
Who gets the reduction this time?

37
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,300
You guys figure it out.

38
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,020
Let's give it to the psycho this time.

39
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,140
Why?

40
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,380
You got 10 years for Mrs. Hwang with rock, paper, scissors.

41
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,770
Have you got no conscience?

42
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,740
Hey, psycho, you take it.

43
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,510
Whatever.

44
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,320
If you're not interested, give it to me. I have 4 years left.

45
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,930
You and that ugly face.

46
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,700
What are you doing?

47
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,120
Yes, I'll call you back.

48
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,710
Yes.

49
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,400
Commissioner Nam!

50
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,060
What brings you here? Have a seat first.

51
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,430
I heard you rejected the warrant my boys got

52
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,960
for catching Hwang Kyung-soon.

53
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,610
Well, have a seat first, Mr. Commissioner.

54
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,870
I'll explain it to you over tea.

55
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,900
Have a seat.

56
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,080
Don't touch me.

57
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,800
How dare you touch the uniform with that dirty hand?

58
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,830
Hello.

59
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,510
Mr. Commissioner, those words are out of line.

60
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,730
Aigoo, you've got a lot of cookie crumbs here.

61
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:04,180
Have you forgotten the weight of the handcuffs, Prosecutor Jang?

62
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,330
This isn't Jongno.

63
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,550
That's enough, Commissioner Nam.

64
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,290
What brings you here, Prosecutor Oh?

65
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,800
I'm here because of you, Mr. Commissioner.

66
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,960
How's your wrist? Try moving it.

67
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,740
Yeah, yeah.

68
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,460
Do you think this is the old days?

69
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,940
You think you can do anything with physical strength.

70
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,980
Shut up and answer. Prosecutor Jang, how's your wrist?

71
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,170
Yes, it's fine, Sir.

72
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,380
Alright.

73
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,920
Let's put the handcuffs on now.

74
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,570
S-sir!

75
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:52,100
I can't just sit and watch one rotten apple like you spoiling the barrel,

76
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,550
putting shame on other prosecutors.

77
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,730
He'll know the weight of the handcuffs now.

78
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,970
Special prosecutor...

79
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,040
Including Prosecutor Jang and the police,

80
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,820
our goal is to completely take out all the public officials related with human trafficking.

81
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,120
So you're putting back on your uniform you've taken off once?

82
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,710
It's difficult for a prosecutor in the field to investigate,

83
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,810
so I'm sure they needed someone who's bumming around.

84
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,100
Oh right! Prosecutor Bull!

85
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,160
Because you see the end of whatever case you're on without mercy,

86
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,890
so you're called Prosecutor Bulldozer, right?

87
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,920
I trust that

88
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:55,310
you'll wipe out this case like a bulldozer, Prosecutor Oh.

89
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,230
But Mr. Commissioner, I'm really curious.

90
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,740
Who's the hero of your work this time?

91
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,240
It says special crime division on the documents,

92
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,220
but I've never heard of such a division.

93
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,920
The human trafficking organization wipe out-

94
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,240
you know the police and prosecutors have been on it for 3 years, right?

95
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,180
They still couldn't clear it out.

96
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,090
This division took exactly 3 weeks. 3 weeks.

97
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,860
I'll ask you straightforward.

98
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,840
Who are the head and members of the special crime division?

99
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,260
I'm asking you directly like this,

100
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:43,050
do you think it's because I can't find out on my own or out of respect?

101
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,170
Why do you want to know?

102
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:54,120
I think I may be able to give some support.

103
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,020
Due to the system, it's the prosecutors that wrap things up.

104
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,920
You're saying that you'll wrap up

105
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,740
cases my boys solve?

106
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,790
I'll take care from prosecution to sentencing.

107
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,290
That's of course, if you trust me.

108
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,710
That's very nice of you, but it's not up to me.

109
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,140
It's up to the one in charge.

110
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,450
Who's the head?

111
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,110
It's Lieutenant Oh Gu-tak.

112
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,780
Ah, Detective Oh Gu-tak?

113
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,290
You know him?

114
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:41,700
Of course, I know Detective Oh Gu-tak well.

115
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,470
The police van will be here soon. Let's get going.

116
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,590
Yes, I'll be right there, Detective Oh.

117
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,580
Something must've come up?

118
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,560
No, it's just a case.

119
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,090
They can't do it without me even though I'm not the only cop.

120
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:14,100
Detective Jung, you're a very nice person.

121
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:23,990
I wish someone like you was

122
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,020
on my husband's case.

123
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,440
A few weeks later,

124
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,410
I got a call,

125
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:39,500
that the killer who killed my husband turned himself in.

126
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,130
<i>So I said that I</i>

127
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,680
<i>want to meet that killer.</i>

128
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,290
<i>I want see him, just once,</i>

129
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,780
<i>because I must ask him something.</i>

130
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:00,370
What did you want to ask?

131
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,540
The reason...

132
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:11,080
for killing my husband.

133
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:17,720
He was a good dad and a husband

134
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,220
who never

135
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,590
blamed anyone. He was that kind of person.

136
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,170
What the reason was for killing someone like him.

137
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,070
That killer who killed your husband...

138
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,980
That killer...

139
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,590
if he

140
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,700
sincerely regrets,

141
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,050
will you

142
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,270
accept his apology?

143
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,680
Apology...

144
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,720
is for when making a mistake.

145
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,770
Murder...

146
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,090
isn't a mistake.

147
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,960
It's a crime.

148
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,850
I will

149
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:39,790
never forgive that man.

150
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,140
Ever.

151
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:56,120
Well, thank you so much for all you've done, Detective Jung.

152
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,480
You don't have to come anymore.

153
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,280
Why not?

154
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,800
I'll be discharged tomorrow. I need to start working again.

155
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,510
Why don't you stay longer and get treated longer.

156
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:12,120
If I'm here, who'll make money?

157
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,830
Don't you get $1,000 transferred to your account every month?

158
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,060
What do you mean?

159
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,730
Who would do that?

160
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,070
<i>Where is she now?</i>

161
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,740
<i>I don't know.</i>

162
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,740
<i>I just transfer the money.</i>

163
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,530
What happened?

164
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,410
I need to kill someone.

165
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,780
What can I do for you to overlook this?

166
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,780
If you let me kill that scumbag,

167
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,340
I'll do anything.

168
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,830
So please...

169
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,930
Please let me kill that piece of trash.

170
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,290
If I can't kill him,

171
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,950
I can't see her

172
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,360
ever again.

173
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,600
Jung Tae-soo,

174
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,290
why do you keeping getting out of line?

175
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,730
Hey, I'm talking to you.

176
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,110
Let him go.

177
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,260
Let him go!

178
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,980
Excuse me?

179
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:47,100
Lieutenant Oh Gu-tak, are you a cop or a criminal?

180
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,150
Don't you know why you're here?

181
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,710
You're here to control them!

182
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:55,790
You're here to watch and control criminals.

183
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,050
Hey, Inspector Yoo.

184
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,490
You keep saying to control them but what did Tae-soo do?

185
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,000
Did he kill or run away?

186
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,280
He came to confirm something and left because he did. What's the problem?

187
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,030
It's not that simple.

188
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,620
They're criminals.

189
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,760
Are they not humans?

190
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,070
You disregard how people change and only see them with prejudice

191
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,690
because of past crime they committed.

192
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,070
Listen well.

193
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,180
You may be in process but they're at the end.

194
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:33,880
You're working, trying to make your way up.

195
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,600
But that's not the same for them.

196
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,550
Their nails and bones are getting crushed but

197
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,440
they're barely hanging in there to move up.

198
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,680
Why?

199
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,660
Because they're dead if they fall now.

200
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,530
If you can't show support,

201
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:53,590
at least don't push them down. Understand?

202
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,810
You're a public servant.

203
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,150
Yes, we're on our way.

204
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,660
Just wait a little bit.

205
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,690
The police van is there.

206
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,900
I'll search for that Lim Jong-dae or whatever,

207
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,270
so don't do anything stupid, Tae-soo.

208
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,360
Stop the car.

209
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,020
What's this case about?

210
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,900
It's a don't-ask murder.

211
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,490
So what case is it?

212
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,070
Random don't-ask murder. Why do you keeping asking?

213
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,950
I heard a similar case took place in Gaseongdong.

214
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,460
Do you think it's connected?

215
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,010
You guys stay out.

216
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,390
It's a 5 year case.

217
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,760
<i>12-caliber hunting rifle, 2 empty shells, double loaded.</i>

218
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,420
<i>Loading is small for hunting.</i>

219
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,150
<i>Then for trap shooting?</i>

220
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,460
<i>Where would I have made the shots?</i>

221
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,940
<i>Best for hiding and cover up.</i>

222
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,930
<i>Target at straight line. Perfect for shooting.</i>

223
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,620
<i>Right here.</i>

224
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,430
<i>First shot.</i>

225
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,590
<i>Second shot.</i>

226
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,240
<i>Third.</i>

227
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,860
<i>Fourth.</i>

228
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,410
<i>Then move.</i>

229
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,990
<i>Fifth.</i>

230
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,050
<i>Sixth.</i>

231
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:20,020
<i>Six shots, six hits! Zero error.</i>

232
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,490
<i>One shot, one hit.</i>

233
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,430
<i>Sniper.</i>

234
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,750
What did you find out?

235
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:38,150
Just... that he's good at shooting?

236
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,750
Hunting rifle kill 3 days ago.

237
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,530
It's like this one.

238
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,310
<i>Black hat, mask, khaki shirt,</i>

239
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,800
<i>fishing sack and hunting rifle.</i>

240
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,990
Six shots, six dead.

241
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,810
Right, since it's probably the same guy.

242
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,370
Fifth and sixth shot.

243
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,860
Even a brief pause between the two, too.

244
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,160
What do you mean?

245
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,680
Just as I said.

246
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,880
Two shots

247
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,650
<i>Load.</i>

248
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,720
<i>Two shots.</i>

249
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,940
Same interval between shots for reloading.

250
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,010
<i>Third.</i>

251
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,180
<i>Fourth.</i>

252
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,800
<i>Then reload.</i>

253
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,100
But this time, it's not consecutive.

254
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,460
One shot first,

255
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,320
then fifth.

256
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,270
<i>He made his sixth shot carefully,</i>

257
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,770
<i>as a hunter carefully takes his breath before</i>

258
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,390
<i>shooting down a game he's been watching.</i>

259
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,930
<i>Sixth.</i>

260
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,370
The witnesses of both cases made identical testimonies.

261
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:04,310
There was a pause between last two shots.

262
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,450
The reason?

263
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,190
We'll have to find out.

264
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:13,180
Psycho, did you just smile?

265
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,250
You... your smiling look doesn't suit you.

266
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,400
Keep that frown.

267
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,790
How do you plan to catch the killer?

268
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,950
I can't tell you.

269
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:34,590
I do things on my own.

270
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,710
Yes, this is Yoo Mi-young.

271
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,010
Yes, sir!

272
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,180
Yes.

273
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,550
Yes, thank you.

274
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,300
The geographic profiling result is out.

275
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,020
After the shooting, no escape route has been identified,

276
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,460
so the killer's residential area is probably Gangseo-gu.

277
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,830
There's a high chance the killer resides in Hwayeon, Yeonchung, Gaseong areas,

278
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,110
according to the profiler.

279
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,680
Hey!

280
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,190
I'm talking--

281
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,240
Hey, wake up!

282
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,850
I'm not sleeping.

283
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,890
I'm thinking with my eyes closed.

284
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,520
You have your eyes opened.

285
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,600
I'm not sleeping. I'm thinking with my eyes closed.

286
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,100
- You have your eyes opened.<b>- Ouch, what happened?</b>

287
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,070
What? what? Killer what? what?

288
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,070
Wipe that spit.

289
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,180
Look at this.

290
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,920
Same taxi was at both shootings.

291
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,330
Oh, oh that?

292
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,750
So the killer disguised as a taxi driver?

293
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,660
Then he probably didn't get pulled over or searched.

294
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:57,790
It's probably with a fake license plate. Can you run it through?

295
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,030
Of course I can't.

296
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,740
Then how do we catch him?

297
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,760
We'll have to set up a trap and wait.

298
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,190
Just follow me.

299
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,960
Jeez, always so feisty.

300
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,410
Why does this smell funny?

301
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,550
What are you doing here?

302
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,650
What is that?

303
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:01,540
What do you think? It's victims' information.

304
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,970
Is that needed? It's a random don't-ask kill.

305
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,550
Yes it's needed.

306
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,330
Why do crimes due to society's corruption

307
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:31,340
always end up with crazy bastards' craziness, dang it!

308
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,380
Jung-moon, let me ask you something.

309
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:49,390
Who were the victims of Hwayeondong case?

310
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,300
What was the reason for killing them?

311
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,090
Don't ask?

312
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,840
Why?

313
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,200
Do you still think you're not the killer?

314
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,240
What do you think?

315
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,240
What do you think, Oh Gu-tak?

316
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,450
I hope...

317
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:31,050
Darn. I don't know.

318
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,030
I too,

319
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,150
hope...

320
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,950
But I don't know either.

321
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,330
Hyun-woo, it's been a while.

322
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,360
Hyung!

323
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,560
It's not a hunting rifle with many loads but

324
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,900
a hunting rifle for trap shooting with few loads.

325
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,720
If it's for random killing,

326
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,810
isn't it better to use one with several shots in one load?

327
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:33,290
Did you search guns privately registered?

328
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,430
Fire.

329
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,820
The police say they have, but nothing stands out.

330
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:51,250
Firearm storage is at the district station.

331
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,230
Fire.

332
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:57,930
Murder with a private gun is difficult since of the check in and out documentation.

333
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,530
That's why I'm here.

334
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,750
What do you mean?

335
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,510
Fire.

336
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:13,320
The killer didn't use a private gun. That's my conclusion.

337
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,570
Shooting range place.

338
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,530
There are many guns here.

339
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,390
What are you saying, Hyung?

340
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,180
Shooting range guns are managed by the police, too.

341
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:28,400
Do you work with police permission?

342
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,690
Can I borrow a gun to kill someone?

343
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,240
Hey, Hyung, really...

344
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,250
What, I'm kidding.

345
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,490
Unregistered guns. Any shooting range has a couple of them, right?

346
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:43,740
Will you look up any missing unregistered guns at Seoul, Gyeonggi shooting ranges?

347
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,400
You'll be faster than me.

348
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,850
I'm taking off. Let me know.

349
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:00,410
Hyung, you'll injure your eyes shooting like that.

350
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:03,050
You safely, me, dangerously.

351
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,390
It's always been like that.

352
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:09,810
Aren't you curious how I got out?

353
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,120
Why don't you ask?

354
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,320
I heard from him.

355
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,420
Where is he now?

356
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,420
Isn't he at the pawn shop?

357
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,070
He's not there.

358
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,980
If he contacts you, let me know.

359
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:29,450
I have some business to take care of with him.

360
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,410
I'm not good at driving and I've never driven a big car.

361
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,090
What?

362
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,640
Start the car.

363
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,740
I guess I'll improve with practice.

364
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,800
I'm ready.

365
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:03,940
<i>If you don't take care of it in 2weeks,</i>

366
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,230
<i>you're dead, Woong-cheol.</i>

367
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,350
What's today's date?

368
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,130
Why? Is something up?

369
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,930
Hey! That question with a mere formality!

370
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:17,270
August... 17th. Two days after Independence Day.

371
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:20,930
Two weeks pass by so beautifully fast.

372
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:23,710
2 hours seemed like forever in prison.

373
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,360
- Yeah?<b><i>- Are you ready?</i></b>

374
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,960
Yeah, Inspector Yoo, I'm ready.

375
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,430
I'll call again when I find the car with that license plate number.

376
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:50,580
Both cases' sixth victims worked for the same company.

377
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,960
Gangseo-gu Magang-dong Samjin Electricity.

378
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:00,180
First case victim, Jung Chun-gil, 46,

379
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,530
production 1 team manager.

380
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,660
<i>He had diabetes,</i>

381
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:08,820
<i>so he jogged with his wife before work.</i>

382
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,690
<i>The shooting took place on the morning of August 13th.</i>

383
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:29,650
>Second case victim, Kang Seok-ho, 38 years old.

384
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,600
Samjin Electricity human resources manager.

385
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:38,130
<i>August 16th, he met Kim Mi-ae, girlfriend, at the park as usual.</i>

386
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,610
<i>Mi-ae!</i>

387
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:56,440
So? What's the conclusion?

388
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,260
Pause between last two shots.

389
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,990
He was careful with the last victims.

390
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,850
Last victims of two cases worked for the same company

391
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:10,790
and both shootings took place where victims often went.

392
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:15,900
Also, first victims were both someone related to them.

393
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,660
<i>Shoot their company at the first shot,</i>

394
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:24,190
<i> at the first shot,</i>

395
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:31,220
<i>force them to stay for a careful shot without any mistake.</i>

396
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,320
Then what about other victims?

397
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,000
Yeah, what is it?

398
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,520
Yeah, what is it?

399
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,160
<i>The suspect is located.</i>

400
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:53,740
Raccoon, passing Hwayeon Station.

401
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,440
Hwayeon 3-dong, Ujeongsan Station.

402
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,810
Okay.

403
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:01,810
Turn towards Hwayeon Middle School at the intersection.

404
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:04,180
Hey, left at Hwayeon Middle School.

405
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,590
Yes. But Hyungnim, are we following--

406
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,490
Shut up and drive. I'm on the phone.

407
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,440
What do I do? Just rear-end from behind?

408
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,760
The risk is too big. Hit at the signal.

409
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,330
Turn right at the intersection.

410
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:18,070
- Turn right.<b>- OK.</b>

411
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:26,040
Oh, Hyungnim! Isn't that it? 9875?

412
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,750
Yeah, get close.

413
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,430
Now.

414
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,230
Wait here.

415
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,910
Yes.

416
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,420
Hey!

417
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,930
Are you a turtle, putting your head right in?

418
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,060
What are you?

419
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,310
Hey, where's the fishing bag?

420
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,010
Where's the gun? Gun!

421
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:59,170
What are you?

422
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,720
Are you a gang?

423
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,860
Shut up and open the trunk. Don't want to?

424
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,420
Fine, I'll open it.

425
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,560
What?

426
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,040
Please let me go!

427
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,940
Why did you do that?

428
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,130
Why did you do that to us?

429
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,180
You crazy...

430
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,240
Help me, help me.

431
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:27,830
It's been 2 weeks. Did you finish the job?

432
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,550
I knew it.

433
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,100
Let's go then!

434
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,140
To die.

435
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,540
1 dead, 4 in critical condition.

436
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,750
Who's the victim who died?

437
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:48,360
Cho Gap-jin, 52. He's an ordinary salary man.

438
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,230
Which company?

439
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,750
Samjin Electricity production 1 team.

440
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,690
What happened to Woong-cheol?

441
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:04,230
I can't locate him with the anklet GPS.

442
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,130
Why are you so quiet, Inspector Yoo?

443
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,090
You're not saying control and all that fuss.

444
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:11,460
He's not the type who'd run while making an arrest.

445
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,100
Something seems different.

446
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,230
Let's trust him and wait.

447
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:19,030
Let's trust him.

448
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:25,890
Life can get nasty, right?

449
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:30,860
How did we get this far?

450
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,160
You did whatever I ordered you to do.

451
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,140
That's Park Woong-cheol.

452
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:41,780
Can I ask a favor?

453
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,340
What favor?

454
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,650
Can I use your phone?

455
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:52,190
Are you going to call the police? Begging for life?

456
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:56,440
There's something I need to pass on.

457
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,940
It's something only I know and if I die here right now,

458
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,550
we can't catch that bastard, Hyungnim.

459
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,220
You saw it too just now.

460
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:10,590
A human being can't do that to another human being.

461
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:16,930
You're about to die yet you need to catch him?

462
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:20,070
That scumbag that kills innocent people

463
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,750
must be arrested, Hyungnim.

464
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:26,390
Please, I beg you, Hyungnim.

465
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,490
You can kill me after that.

466
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,610
Okay?

467
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:39,320
<i>"Gun shooting in the city!"</i>

468
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,020
- Hyung.<b>- Oh.</b>

469
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,670
They lost an unregistered hunting rifle about 2 weeks ago.

470
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,410
12-caliber trap shooting.

471
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:57,310
Thanks, I owe you one.

472
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:01,570
But doesn't that seem weird?

473
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,580
What?

474
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:08,560
He didn't miss a single shot for the first two cases, yet this time, he's all over the place.

475
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,950
Four were injured because of strong emotions

476
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,430
and he even shot one person twice.

477
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:21,900
It's completely different from the first two.

478
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,330
What do you think?

479
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,460
I don't know.

480
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,300
Kiddo, don't get too serious.

481
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,130
Anyway, thanks. See you later.

482
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,160
Tae-soo Hyung.

483
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:44,540
Aren't you curious what happened to me? Why aren't you asking me anything?

484
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,570
I was waiting for you to tell me.

485
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,070
It didn't seem like something good.

486
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:54,250
I'm going to quit killing people.

487
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,510
That's why...

488
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:00,130
That's too much for security.

489
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,550
Who is it? That scumbag that took your leg?

490
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,300
It's Jong-seok.

491
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,080
Be careful.

492
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,060
There's no reason for Jong-seok and me to meet.

493
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:22,200
We swore not to meet again until one dies.

494
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,680
Even if we do run into each other,

495
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,610
one will be dead.

496
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,020
Anyway congratulations.

497
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,310

<i>Where are you?</i>

Why do you care? I have some business to take care of.

Business? What business do you have?

503
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:21,760
There's some business. Don't try to know too much.

504
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,730
The reason I personally called someone unfriendly like you is...

505
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,380
What... are you saying?

506
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,560
Are you deaf? Just listen carefully.

507
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,640
Before the last shot, the killer said...

508
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,920
<i>Why did you do that? Why did you do that to us?</i>

509
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,280
Us?

510
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,770
Yeah, us. Why did you do that to us?

511
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,790
Why are you telling me this?

512
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:53,720
I'm too dumb to understand,

but I think you'll know.

514
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,910
You're a dick but pretty quick on things, am I right?

515
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,770
That's it?

00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,520
Something's up, right?

Jung Tae-soo, right?

522
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,050
I'd like to offer you a job.

523
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,210
What job?

524
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:48,620
I'll pay you double of what the market price is.

525
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:53,900
I'll pay half first as a deposit and the rest after it's done.

Here. It's this person.

527
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,460
Please kill him as cruelly as possible.

No reason.

00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,620
I refuse.

Who ordered you to kill this person?

534
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:17,170
What happened?

535
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:22,960
Those you beat up disappeared.

536
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,580
You'll be released tomorrow.

00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:27,980

00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,920
Park Woong-cheol, he called me.

539
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,290
Where is Woong-cheol?

00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,540
I don't know.

But this is what he said.

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,690
Please catch that killer.

543
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,830
it seemed as if he can't,

00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:51,350
but he says that's more important.

545
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:53,640
I don't know why.

546
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,330
Go here.

547
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:05,840
The shooters used guns stolen from here I think.

548
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:07,630
Shooters?

549
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,350
It's just you and me.

550
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:23,030
They're giving up their reduction to help,

551
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,440
so let's end this case.

552
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,720
<i>They came often since about two months ago.</i>

553
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,100
<i>One seemed to be familiar with guns following hunters,</i>

554
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,720
<i>and the other didn't seem like he even held a gun in his life.</i>

555
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,830
<i>How often did they come? Those two?</i>

556
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:46,450
<i>Almost every day.</i>

557
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:54,090
<i>Jang Myung-jin, Ko Chang-sik.</i>

558
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,100
Yeah.

559
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,810
<i>We're ready.</i>

560
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:09,150
Don't rush things. Standby first.

561
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:17,100
<i>Open the door! Hey!</i>

562
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,150
Move!

563
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:13,120
That's the reason?

564
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,740
That's it.

565
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:18,750
That's all I can tell you.

566
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:24,960
I just did what Myung-jin wanted to do.

567
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,260
I can't shoot so I told Myung-jin to kill them all,

568
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:33,220
but he said he couldn't trust me unless I did it too so he feels secured...

569
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:35,330
Stop.

570
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:39,160
Enough. Scumbags...

571
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,930
Foolish bastards.

572
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:54,170
Jang Myung-jin, where is he now?

573
00:46:54,170 --> 00:47:00,890
I don't know. He said not to be in touch for a while.

574
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:06,170
How many were your initial number of hits?

575
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:11,900
It's not over yet, huh?

576
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,740
How many are left?

577
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:00,790
Once I help you this time, you'll let go of it quietly.

578
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:08,780
Don't worry, I'm not a low-life gangster.

579
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:14,630
<i>Listen, even if you see someone slightly similar, check him out.</i>

580
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,960
Get your head straight and be ready.

581
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,120
- Ok.<b>- Ok.</b>

582
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:35,110
12 o'clock from where I'm sitting, black hat. Check it out.

583
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:39,620
What is it? Did you catch him?

584
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:42,830
Now, you just need to take a walk

585
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:46,170
as if nothing's up.

586
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:50,000
Listen carefully. Otherwise, you'll get hurt.

587
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,460
Understand.

588
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:25,420
What was that?

589
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,800
It was a balloon. It's not him.

590
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,560
What is it? What?

591
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,930
<i>Did you catch him? Where?</i>

592
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:36,060
It's nothing, so calm down.

593
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,830
How can I calm down?

594
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:40,530
<i>Lower your voice, dang it!</i>

595
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:44,510
<i>Are you yelling at me?</i>

596
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:47,310
Which department are you affiliated with?

597
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:01,960
Jang Myung-jin!

598
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,060
Don't move!

599
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:54,640
- Don't come toward me!<b> - Ah! Help me!</b>

600
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,260
I understand why you're doing this.

601
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,160
Be quiet!

602
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,450
You guys were workers at Samjin Electricity.

603
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:06,360
But with CEO Lee Deok-ki's embezzlement, budget got short

604
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:10,350
so production 1 team Jung Chun-ki, Cho Gap-jin suggested firing 20 non-regular employees

605
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:12,930
to make up for the shortage.

606
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:17,180
Samjin Electricity HR manager Kang Seok-ho executed the plan.

607
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:32,320
<i>Why... why am I getting fired?</i>

608
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:37,550
<i>Don't ask that. There are reasons.</i>

609
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,770
Don't ask me. You said not to ask, too.

610
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:47,950
<i>We planned to make it look like a random don't-ask killing.</i>

611
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:51,850
<i>Then, the police can't find the motive, either.</i>

612
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:55,770
<i>Without motive, the police can't find out about us,</i>

613
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,380
<i>so we won't be caught.</i>

614
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,240
But this is wrong.

615
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,260
Killing other innocent people to cover your murder is wrong.

616
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:13,160
You lost your job, your wife died because you had no money,

617
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,830
and you had to put your daughter up for adoption.

618
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:20,620
Even so, this is wrong, Jang Myung-jin.

619
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:32,870
Do you know who those people were that you killed?

620
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:35,140
<i>Cho Yong-sun, 46,</i>

621
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:38,760
<i>day worker caring for his mother with Alzheimer's.</i>

622
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:43,070
Kim Cheol-ki, 57.

623
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:47,150
<i>a father who worked for his daughter's tuition.</i>

624
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:55,170
45 year-old Park Sang-kyu got fired recently just like you.

625
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:56,430
Don't come!

626
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:59,850
Kim Mi-jung, a 25 year old awaiting her marriage as a bride-to-be.

627
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:01,080
Don't come, bastard!

628
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,860
34 year-old Choi Joon-seok

629
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:12,530
was on his way from his wife's funeral,

630
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:19,880
just like you...

631
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:27,030
<i>Honey, please... please...</i>

632
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,480
Please!

633
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,410
If

634
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:46,340
you want to kill someone,

635
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:50,600
kill someone like me.

636
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:55,090
Someone who only hurt others by staying alive.

637
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:56,980
Kill someone like me instead.

638
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,680
What are you doing?

639
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,340
Why are those in difficult times hurting each other?

640
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:04,280
Others are responsible for this.

641
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,780
Why are those in a similar situation hurting each other?

642
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,940
Why?

643
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:17,630
Shoot!

644
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,400
Shoot right now!

645
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,690
Shoot!

646
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:25,620
Shoot me, you bastard!

647
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,010
Jung-moon,

648
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:49,990
that's not something you can resolve.

649
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:19,390
Jung-moon,

650
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:27,160
did that come from your heart or your head?

651
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:52,590
What is this? Why are you putting these around my wrists?

652
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:57,200
Embezzlement. That's a crime. A serious crime.

653
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,850
You said you'll let go of it.

654
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:04,130
I know.

655
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:08,280
But what can I say? I'm a low-life gang since I was born.

656
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,000
- You bast--<b>- Take him away.</b>

657
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:20,890
Yes.

658
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,990
I see why you like it here, Mr. Commissioner.

659
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:38,450
It's quiet enough to think

660
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:40,070
and to meet quietly.

661
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:44,580
I heard from Mr. Commissioner on my way here.

662
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,750
You want to be the prosecutor of our team?

663
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,150
Yes.

664
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:49,750
Why?

665
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:55,860
Bees can't pass by a flower. What do you mean, why?

666
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,190
You've got it wrong then, we're not flowers.

667
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:01,620
We're sewer.

668
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:05,350
Then I'll be a fly that can't pass a sewer.

669
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:13,750
You know there's a certain extent to a joke, right?

670
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:18,360
It was good to meet you. See you again later.

671
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:20,470
Why are you so closed?

672
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:24,030
Is it because your team members are criminals?

673
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:30,510
Why are you so surprised? I know more about you.

674
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:37,650
I know how they're related to you in the past.

675
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,070
It was 2 years ago, right?

676
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:44,370
There seems to be a lot that happened between you and them.

677
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:48,720
Do they know too? That because of that incident 2 years ago...

678
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:55,360
There's a certain extent to a joke to remain as a joke.

679
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:59,770
Think about my offer.

680
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:25,860
Aigoo.

681
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:32,170
Do you remember the first time you came to me?

682
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:37,020
You said you want to live like a human being,

683
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:43,050
that you don't want to die as a son of a Laundromat.

684
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,770
That's what you said.

685
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:49,420
So I let you live like a human being.

686
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:52,850
You drove a nice car, wore nice clothes, ate good stuff.

687
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:55,790
I allowed you to have a fancy life.

688
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:01,770
How can you do this to me?

689
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:04,340
Did I tell you to kill an innocent person?

690
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:07,460
Lee Jung-moon is a serial killer.

691
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,980
Serial killer.

692
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:15,630
It's all scratched up, Hyungnim.

693
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,580
When I gave that to you,

694
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:23,330
I promised to get you one

695
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:27,600
made out of real gold.

696
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:34,760
I forgot about that. It just came into my mind.

697
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,880
I'm sorry.

698
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,420
You can still keep that promise.

699
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:44,860
Kill Lee Jung-moon and let's start over.

700
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:51,420
Hyungnim, I'm sincerely thankful of what you've done to me.

701
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:54,930
But you know, Hyungnim...

702
00:59:55,660 --> 01:00:01,010
Living a fancy life doesn't mean living like a human being.

703
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:05,340
I had an extravagant life working for you.

704
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:09,750
Back then, I thought I was truly living a good life.

705
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:13,660
But you know what, Hyungnim?

706
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:16,380
That time...

707
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:20,020
I always had to look over my shoulder.

708
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:25,230
I always had dreams about those I had killed.

709
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:30,680
They asked why I had done that.

710
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,500
I had nothing to tell them.

711
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:40,860
I couldn't sleep well then, Hyungnim.

712
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,930
How about you, Hyungnim?

713
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:49,460
Do you sleep well at night?

714
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:51,730
- Park Woong-cheol, you bastard.<b>- Hyungnim.</b>

715
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:53,860
- You piece of--<b>- Hyungnim.</b>

716
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,720
Did you lose your head?

717
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,720
Du-kwang Hyung!

718
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:05,050
Please let your little brother sleep well at night.

719
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:07,550
Please!

720
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,590
Get the car ready!

721
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:17,730
We're burying Woong-cheol's today.

722
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:36,360
<i>Bad Guys<b>Who Catch Bad Guys</i></b>

723
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,570
<i>Are you really going to kill Woong-cheol?</i>

724
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,270
<i>We got Park Woong-cheol's location.</i>

725
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:41,560
<i>Where is Park Woong-cheol?</i>

726
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,830
<i>What is it?</i>

727
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:44,400
<i>Dang it!</i>

728
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,900
<i>Who is it, who told you to get rid of me?</i>

729
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:51,100
<i>I think Du-kwang Hyung's been kidnapped. It's probably someone he knows well.</i>

730
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:53,090
<i>I think this is acting rashly.</i>

731
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:57,610
<i>How old do you think I am to act rashly? You can get killed acting rashly, inspector Yoo.</i>

732
01:01:57,610 --> 01:02:00,310
<i>A curve ball with a big dip instead of a fast ball.</i>

733
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:02,690
<i>- Now, here's the first pitch.<b>- Let's go.</i></b>

734
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:05,990
<i>Unless you want a hole drilled into your body, stay still.</i>

735
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:07,730
<i>Where the heck is Son Moon-ki?</i>

736
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:10,360
<i>It's a coup, a mutiny.</i>

737
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:16,280
<i>The father kills the grandfather, the son kills the father. What a family.</i>

738
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,060
<i>Turn the car! Turn the car!</i>

739
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:20,400
<i>If you want to live, listen to me, dang it!</i>

740
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,380
<i>- You just need to be gone. You need to be finished.<b>- Du-kwang Hyung!</i></b>

741
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:26,800
<i>This wouldn't have happened if you had killed on time.</i>

742
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,830
<i>Goodbye.</i>
