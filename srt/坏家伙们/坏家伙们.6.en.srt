00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,689
BAD GUYS
<i>[Episode 6]</i>

2
00:00:31,185 --> 00:00:32,395
Gosh.

3
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:38,401
Do you remember the day
you first came here?

4
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,656
You said you wanted to live
like a human being.

5
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,577
You said you don't want to live
as a son of a laundry shop owner.

6
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:49,579
You didn't want to die like that.

7
00:00:51,706 --> 00:00:53,165
That's what you said to me then.

8
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:56,460
That's why I helped you live
like a human being.

9
00:00:57,086 --> 00:01:00,548
You drove a nice car,
you wore nice clothes, you ate well.

10
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:02,091
I let you live a rich life.

11
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:08,055
How can you do this to me?

12
00:01:09,557 --> 00:01:11,601
Did I ask you to kill an innocent man?

13
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:14,937
Jung-moon Lee is a serial killer.

14
00:01:15,313 --> 00:01:16,355
A serial killer.

15
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:22,194
You're still wearing that ring.

16
00:01:24,363 --> 00:01:25,948
Its coat is peeled.

17
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:29,368
When I gave you that ring,

18
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:34,749
I promised that I would buy you
a golden one once I earn enough money.

19
00:01:38,377 --> 00:01:40,880
I forgot about that promise all this time
and just remembered.

20
00:01:42,548 --> 00:01:43,382
I'm sorry, Boss.

21
00:01:44,717 --> 00:01:46,385
You can still keep that promise.

22
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,472
Kill Jung-moon Lee.

23
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:52,016
Let's start over.

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,936
You made me live a rich life.

25
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:58,314
I really appreciate that.

26
00:02:00,274 --> 00:02:01,317
But you know,

27
00:02:03,486 --> 00:02:05,196
living a rich life

28
00:02:06,155 --> 00:02:08,240
didn't necessarily mean living
like a human being.

29
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:12,286
I was so cool when I was working with you.

30
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:16,165
Once you're born as a man,
you should live a life like that.

31
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:19,627
But you know what, Boss?

32
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,463
When I was living like that,

33
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:26,801
there was not a single night
I could get a good sleep.

34
00:02:28,761 --> 00:02:30,596
Those guys that I killed

35
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,392
showed up in my dream

36
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:36,894
and asked me why I did that to them.

37
00:02:40,356 --> 00:02:41,899
I had nothing to say.

38
00:02:44,568 --> 00:02:47,405
That's why I couldn't sleep well.

39
00:02:49,782 --> 00:02:51,534
How are you these days?

40
00:02:53,577 --> 00:02:55,287
Do you get a good sleep?

41
00:02:57,289 --> 00:02:59,542
-Ong-chul Park, you bastard.
-Boss.

42
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,460
-You bastard.
-Boss.

43
00:03:01,585 --> 00:03:03,462
Have you lost your mind?

44
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:04,880
Doo-kwang!

45
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:07,925
Let me...

46
00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:11,762
Let me have a good sleep.

47
00:03:12,805 --> 00:03:14,014
Please!

48
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,396
Have the car ready.

49
00:03:21,355 --> 00:03:24,150
We're burying Ong-chul today.

50
00:03:39,248 --> 00:03:40,541
It's not too late.

51
00:03:41,584 --> 00:03:42,460
Change your mind.

52
00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:48,507
Go kill Jung-moon Lee with your own hands.

53
00:03:50,426 --> 00:03:51,802
<i>I'd like to know more about myself.</i>

54
00:03:53,345 --> 00:03:55,306
<i>I want to figure out
if I really did murder people.</i>

55
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,933
<i>If it's true,</i>

56
00:03:59,018 --> 00:04:00,519
<i>I want to know if I can save lives,</i>

57
00:04:01,812 --> 00:04:03,230
<i>and if I'm moved</i>

58
00:04:04,023 --> 00:04:05,274
<i>by saving people's lives.</i>

59
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,445
I'm doing this job

60
00:04:11,113 --> 00:04:12,281
for that reason.

61
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:24,668
It's over between you and me.

62
00:04:26,212 --> 00:04:27,046
Goodbye.

63
00:04:39,982 --> 00:04:46,070
DESPERATE CHASE

64
00:04:46,357 --> 00:04:49,193
EPISODE 6

65
00:05:21,058 --> 00:05:21,892
It's Tae-soo.

66
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:33,612
Hyun-woo. I need you to help me.

67
00:05:35,948 --> 00:05:38,033
Before he makes any move,

68
00:05:38,826 --> 00:05:39,952
we should

69
00:05:41,662 --> 00:05:42,872
kill him.

70
00:06:01,307 --> 00:06:03,309
You don't have to look so serious.

71
00:06:03,392 --> 00:06:05,227
We have Ong-chul Park's location.

72
00:06:18,782 --> 00:06:21,660
Are you really going to kill Ong-chul?

73
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:45,643
Where is he heading to?

74
00:06:47,311 --> 00:06:48,896
Jeongwang-dong, Siheung.

75
00:06:56,987 --> 00:06:58,530
Stop staring at me.

76
00:06:58,906 --> 00:07:00,324
What did you just say?

77
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:02,826
Watch your mouth, you jerk. I'm your boss.

78
00:07:03,953 --> 00:07:05,371
Do you think I don't know you?

79
00:07:05,913 --> 00:07:09,500
You used to work for me when I took over
Myungsik gang's nightclub.

80
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,752
What is he talking about?

81
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:14,546
Now I'm sure it was you.

82
00:07:15,506 --> 00:07:18,801
You made a bluff saying

83
00:07:18,884 --> 00:07:21,220
you'd cut Myung-sik's throat.

84
00:07:21,303 --> 00:07:22,596
But what you did was

85
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,974
only shake like a leaf
while hiding under a table.

86
00:07:25,557 --> 00:07:26,433
Right?

87
00:07:26,976 --> 00:07:29,019
You were just like that,

88
00:07:29,103 --> 00:07:31,313
but look at you now
with all the subordinates.

89
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,984
With hard work, the sky is the limit.

90
00:07:35,609 --> 00:07:38,279
-Stop it.
-Oh, that's right.

91
00:07:38,612 --> 00:07:41,323
You peed your pants
while hiding under the table.

92
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:44,702
You peed quite a lot
because you eat a lot.

93
00:07:44,994 --> 00:07:48,455
You kept insisting that you didn't pee,
and it was just beer.

94
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:51,959
You even dipped your finger in it
to make us believe you.

95
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:53,585
It was hilarious.

96
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:55,462
Shut your mouth, you idiot!

97
00:08:00,134 --> 00:08:01,135
You jerk!

98
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:10,936
There's something wrong with them.

99
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:17,276
There is no answer.

100
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:21,071
<i>The number you have dialed is...</i>

101
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:48,140
Life is so hard, isn't it?

102
00:08:53,812 --> 00:08:56,440
What the heck is going on?

103
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:59,276
We will figure it out once we find him.

104
00:09:00,277 --> 00:09:01,945
GWANGDEOKSAN

105
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:05,699
-The GPS signal has stopped.
-Where is he now?

106
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,409
He's at Gwangdeoksan.

107
00:09:30,682 --> 00:09:31,517
Stop it.

108
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:39,024
<i>Have Ong-chul kill this man.</i>

109
00:09:42,486 --> 00:09:44,822
What happens if he refuses to do it?

110
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,543
Untie the rope.

111
00:10:19,731 --> 00:10:20,566
Bury him.

112
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:53,348
The GPS signal just dropped off the grid.

113
00:11:12,784 --> 00:11:14,703
Are you sure it's really okay to do this?

114
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:17,915
Everything will be all right.

115
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:21,793
It should be fine.

116
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:06,338
Where is Ong-chul Park?

117
00:12:12,386 --> 00:12:15,013
<i>Where is he, you son of a bitch?</i>

118
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,140
Ong-chul Park, that jerk.

119
00:12:17,516 --> 00:12:19,184
He's so lucky today.

120
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:22,646
Watch your words, you bastard!

121
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:15,324
<i>Are you alive?</i>

122
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:20,412
Your comrades will arrive soon.

123
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:23,415
<i>And</i>

124
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,543
<i>you should go with them.</i>

125
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,630
Why didn't you finish me off?

126
00:13:31,298 --> 00:13:33,925
Why did you

127
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:35,844
bury me in soft soil?

128
00:13:36,345 --> 00:13:37,554
I did finish you off.

129
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,768
As far as I know, Ong-chul Park
died today.

130
00:13:44,061 --> 00:13:47,397
The Ong-chul Park who I used to know
is dead and buried below the ground.

131
00:13:48,106 --> 00:13:51,151
<i>Spend the rest of your life hiding.</i>

132
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:53,570
<i>If I ever see you</i>

133
00:13:54,571 --> 00:13:55,906
out in the open,

134
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,033
I will kill you.

135
00:14:03,372 --> 00:14:05,832
<i>Goodness, you are too naive.</i>

136
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:09,503
I have nothing more to say.
I'm hanging up.

137
00:14:18,345 --> 00:14:20,430
<i>-What happened?
-I'm sorry, sir.</i>

138
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:26,645
What just happened?
What do you think you are doing?

139
00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:28,021
What are you...

140
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:36,947
Damn it.

141
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:40,367
Boss.

142
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,870
What's going on? What was that?

143
00:14:54,464 --> 00:14:55,298
Doo-kwang.

144
00:14:56,717 --> 00:14:58,635
Doo-kwang, what's going on?

145
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:17,112
Doo-kwang?

146
00:15:20,115 --> 00:15:21,116
What happened?

147
00:15:21,825 --> 00:15:22,743
<i>Who are you?</i>

148
00:15:22,826 --> 00:15:24,286
-What happened?
-Let go of me.

149
00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:25,620
<i>Who sent you here?</i>

150
00:15:26,663 --> 00:15:28,623
<i>Who ordered you to kill me?</i>

151
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:30,500
Who?

152
00:15:54,316 --> 00:15:56,234
<i>Doo-kwang? Boss?</i>

153
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:00,155
Who are you?

154
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,210
It was you.

155
00:16:14,753 --> 00:16:16,338
Did your boss order you to do this?

156
00:16:21,635 --> 00:16:23,428
Did you think you could get away with it

157
00:16:24,513 --> 00:16:25,680
after stabbing me in the back?

158
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,775
<i>Doo-kwang?</i>

159
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:42,656
What's going on?

160
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:47,285
-I think he's kidnapped.
-Who?

161
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:50,372
Doo-kwang has been kidnapped.

162
00:16:50,455 --> 00:16:52,541
How would you know if he was kidnapped?

163
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,960
They wouldn't have beaten him up
if they wanted to kill him.

164
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,088
They would've just stabbed him instead.

165
00:16:59,005 --> 00:17:01,800
-I should find Doo-kwang.
-How?

166
00:17:02,384 --> 00:17:03,760
Hang on a second.

167
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:07,597
Doo-kwang. I should find him.

168
00:17:25,115 --> 00:17:28,785
I'm ashamed to say this,
but I need your help.

169
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:33,373
I really don't think
I can find Doo-kwang alone.

170
00:17:33,665 --> 00:17:35,709
Help me find Doo-kwang.

171
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,753
Please help me find him.

172
00:17:39,838 --> 00:17:43,008
I'm begging you.

173
00:17:44,134 --> 00:17:47,178
Why do you want to find him?
Because he saved your life?

174
00:17:50,682 --> 00:17:51,641
People deserve

175
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:55,854
a chance to lead a good life at least once

176
00:17:56,146 --> 00:17:57,564
before they die.

177
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,774
Don't you think?

178
00:18:00,942 --> 00:18:01,776
Right?

179
00:18:09,242 --> 00:18:10,076
What?

180
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,912
The kidnapped person is a boss of a gang.

181
00:18:12,913 --> 00:18:14,706
I don't think
it's something we can deal with.

182
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:17,167
No. It's something we have to deal with.

183
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:20,629
What do you think will happen in Seoul
if Doo-kwang Lee dies?

184
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:23,882
In order to prevent the worst...

185
00:18:24,507 --> 00:18:25,926
We should choose the lesser evil.

186
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,303
That's quite unpalatable.

187
00:18:28,511 --> 00:18:31,306
We should choose the best
to prevent the worst.

188
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:35,226
What's your plan to find him?

189
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:41,232
I'm sure the culprit is
Doo-kwang's acquaintance.

190
00:19:16,935 --> 00:19:20,397
"Did your boss order you to do this?

191
00:19:21,064 --> 00:19:23,608
Did you think you could get away with it
after stabbing me in my back?"

192
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,111
From what Doo-kwang said

193
00:19:27,946 --> 00:19:29,155
there's only one conclusion.

194
00:19:30,657 --> 00:19:33,326
It's a coup d'état. It's a mutiny.

195
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:34,285
Right.

196
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:36,955
It looks like an inside job.

197
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,082
But what's next?

198
00:19:39,374 --> 00:19:42,544
Considering the dominant power
in the market of the regions,

199
00:19:42,627 --> 00:19:44,087
those ten districts will be

200
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:47,674
managed by these ten underbosses.

201
00:19:49,175 --> 00:19:52,554
One of them might be the culprit.
Don't you think?

202
00:19:53,346 --> 00:19:55,598
We have no choice.
We should ask them directly.

203
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:59,144
So you want to ask them
if they kidnapped Doo-kwang Lee?

204
00:19:59,394 --> 00:20:00,645
No, that's not it.

205
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:04,816
If the underbosses find out
Doo-kwang Lee is kidnapped,

206
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:08,695
they will want to plant a flag
on the ownerless mountain.

207
00:20:08,778 --> 00:20:10,447
It means the start of a war.

208
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:14,576
We must track the culprit
who's hiding the fact

209
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:16,161
that Doo-kwang Lee is kidnapped.

210
00:20:16,786 --> 00:20:18,121
In this case,

211
00:20:18,204 --> 00:20:21,291
a breaking ball would work
better than a fastball.

212
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:25,378
First, spread a rumor
with Doo-kwang Lee's name.

213
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:38,767
<i>Gather all underbosses</i>

214
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,936
<i>and tell them Doo-kwang will discuss
important issues,</i>

215
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,938
<i>so they must attend.</i>

216
00:20:44,105 --> 00:20:46,149
<i>Gather all the underbosses?</i>

217
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:47,817
What's next?

218
00:20:48,234 --> 00:20:49,861
It's simple.

219
00:20:49,944 --> 00:20:52,655
Once the game starts,
you should throw a pitch.

220
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:55,658
Ong-chul, you will throw
the opening pitch today. Okay?

221
00:21:06,836 --> 00:21:08,880
<i>Here comes the first pitch.</i>

222
00:21:09,923 --> 00:21:13,468
<i>The culprit must have ordered
his right-hand man</i>

223
00:21:13,551 --> 00:21:15,136
<i>to attack his boss.</i>

224
00:21:15,428 --> 00:21:18,389
<i>It means he has Doo-kwang Lee
with him now.</i>

225
00:21:18,473 --> 00:21:20,475
<i>So the culprit can't come
with his right-hand man.</i>

226
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:23,311
An underboss who comes
without his right-hand man

227
00:21:23,394 --> 00:21:24,229
is the culprit.

228
00:21:25,438 --> 00:21:27,023
Ong-chul,
do you still remember their ranks?

229
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,691
Of course, I do.

230
00:21:31,277 --> 00:21:32,946
<i>Sang-gil Kang of Myeong-dong.</i>

231
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:35,240
<i>His right-hand man,
Sang-byung Kang. He's out.</i>

232
00:21:35,323 --> 00:21:37,158
<i>Soo-chan Jang of Yeongdeungpo.</i>

233
00:21:37,242 --> 00:21:39,494
<i>His right-hand man,
Seok-joong Jo. He's out.</i>

234
00:21:43,206 --> 00:21:44,707
<i>Heung-sik Jeong of Suyuri.</i>

235
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,502
<i>His right-hand man,
Moon-cheon Kang. He's out.</i>

236
00:21:47,585 --> 00:21:49,379
<i>Do-sik Joo of Hwayeon-dong.</i>

237
00:21:49,462 --> 00:21:51,881
<i>His right-hand man, Pil-jun Nam. He's out.</i>

238
00:21:52,924 --> 00:21:54,425
<i>The rest of them are new</i>

239
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:57,846
<i>or not someone's right-hand man.</i>

240
00:21:58,596 --> 00:21:59,722
<i>Those four men are out.</i>

241
00:22:07,814 --> 00:22:09,774
It's been a long time.

242
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:12,944
<i>One of those six is the culprit.</i>

243
00:22:15,321 --> 00:22:17,365
I suppose most of you

244
00:22:18,116 --> 00:22:21,494
hold a grudge against me.

245
00:22:21,744 --> 00:22:23,371
Please let bygones be bygones.

246
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,916
Try to project your mind into the future.
It's the 21st century.

247
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,002
Ong-chul, what are you doing here?

248
00:22:29,502 --> 00:22:30,670
I thought you were behind bars.

249
00:22:31,045 --> 00:22:32,338
Let's just say

250
00:22:33,006 --> 00:22:35,925
I left school during school hours.

251
00:22:37,468 --> 00:22:38,469
Where is Mr. Doo-kwang Lee?

252
00:22:40,221 --> 00:22:41,472
Where is he now?

253
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:44,767
He can't make it today.

254
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:46,477
Why not?

255
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:50,064
He has a business to run.

256
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,483
So I came here to relay his message.

257
00:22:53,484 --> 00:22:56,571
What does he want to say to us?

258
00:22:59,657 --> 00:23:00,658
<i>The second pitch</i>

259
00:23:00,742 --> 00:23:04,078
<i>should be a breaking ball like a changeup.</i>

260
00:23:04,621 --> 00:23:07,457
<i>The money they offer
to Doo-kwang Lee every month.</i>

261
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,958
<i>Tell them Doo-kwang wants to raise it.</i>

262
00:23:10,585 --> 00:23:13,922
You'd better help the boss
line his pockets

263
00:23:14,005 --> 00:23:15,131
with your money.

264
00:23:19,218 --> 00:23:21,554
So he wants to raise the tax? By how much?

265
00:23:23,306 --> 00:23:24,849
By exactly 30 percent.

266
00:23:25,016 --> 00:23:26,434
-Thirty percent?
-What?

267
00:23:26,517 --> 00:23:29,145
<i>Why would I talk
about the tax all of a sudden?</i>

268
00:23:29,228 --> 00:23:32,398
<i>You should make a blow
to see how they react.</i>

269
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,859
<i>Those who don't know
Doo-kwang is kidnapped</i>

270
00:23:34,943 --> 00:23:38,029
<i>would think Doo-kwang actually ordered it.</i>

271
00:23:38,363 --> 00:23:40,406
<i>They'd go nuts</i>

272
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,784
<i>saying it's ridiculous.</i>

273
00:23:42,867 --> 00:23:46,287
The person who kidnapped Doo-kwang,

274
00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:47,705
the culprit...

275
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:49,874
Won't be shaken by it...

276
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:53,628
Because he knows
Doo-kwang didn't order such a thing.

277
00:23:53,711 --> 00:23:55,964
He'd rather take a wait-and-see attitude

278
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:57,674
and try to grasp the situation.

279
00:23:57,882 --> 00:23:59,634
I need to feed my people!

280
00:23:59,717 --> 00:24:02,428
<i>Man-chun Bong of Hyehwa-dong goes nuts.</i>

281
00:24:02,512 --> 00:24:05,556
<i>Sang-man Lee of Yeonsinnae
just pours alcohol down his throat</i>

282
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,226
<i>as he's too timid to complain.
They are out.</i>

283
00:24:08,643 --> 00:24:11,604
<i>In total, six of them are out.</i>

284
00:24:14,524 --> 00:24:16,275
<i>Seok-jin Lee of Dongdaemun,</i>

285
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:18,444
<i>Kang-guk Cha of Sinchon,</i>

286
00:24:19,654 --> 00:24:21,406
<i>Moon-gi Son of Jongno,</i>

287
00:24:22,198 --> 00:24:24,993
<i>and Seong-hoon Kang of Itaewon.
It's one of those four.</i>

288
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,416
Gosh, you seem
to have a problem with that.

289
00:24:31,749 --> 00:24:32,750
Okay then.

290
00:24:33,793 --> 00:24:36,546
<i>It's time to throw the last pitch.</i>

291
00:24:37,338 --> 00:24:39,465
<i>Throw a forkball
to lure them into swing and miss.</i>

292
00:24:39,757 --> 00:24:42,093
Hello? This is Ong-chul, Boss.

293
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:45,263
Okay. How are things going?

294
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,182
They all seem to have a problem with it.

295
00:24:49,642 --> 00:24:51,102
How many of them do we have left?

296
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,147
I'll be there by four o'clock.

297
00:24:56,065 --> 00:24:57,525
Ong-chul.

298
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,611
Let's hunt out the culprit then.

299
00:25:01,738 --> 00:25:04,240
Take a close look at their faces.

300
00:25:05,742 --> 00:25:07,118
<i>All human beings tend to</i>

301
00:25:08,077 --> 00:25:10,163
<i>reveal emotions on their face.</i>

302
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,292
<i>You can tell when people expect others
to listen to them.</i>

303
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:17,712
<i>Or when they feel anger
and want to see who wins.</i>

304
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,884
<i>If they feel they are the weak,
they would just try to lump it.</i>

305
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:25,720
<i>But there must be someone
who knows the whole thing is a lie</i>

306
00:25:26,054 --> 00:25:27,764
<i>and you are deceiving them.</i>

307
00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:30,600
<i>He'd show distrust
and a sarcastic smile on his face,</i>

308
00:25:31,267 --> 00:25:33,102
<i>thinking he's the one
who's holding the trump card.</i>

309
00:25:43,362 --> 00:25:44,197
Moon-gi.

310
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,994
What?

311
00:25:51,037 --> 00:25:54,123
Doo-kwang wants to say hello to you.

312
00:25:58,002 --> 00:25:58,836
Does he?

313
00:26:00,004 --> 00:26:01,964
Tell him to take care.

314
00:26:03,382 --> 00:26:07,011
Now that I see your face,
I can tell you are not doing well.

315
00:26:07,845 --> 00:26:09,347
Do you still fight with other guys?

316
00:26:10,556 --> 00:26:12,266
Are you a bully or what?

317
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:14,685
Let's go.

318
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,498
Are you sure it's Moon-gi Son?

319
00:26:35,873 --> 00:26:39,293
Yes. Dong-sik Yoon,
his right-hand man didn't come today.

320
00:26:39,961 --> 00:26:42,797
And I saw him keep giggling
like a pushover.

321
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:46,467
Okay. What do you think is his next move?

322
00:26:46,717 --> 00:26:48,761
When they make a mutiny,

323
00:26:48,845 --> 00:26:51,806
they never let their subordinates
finish the work.

324
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:55,476
They just can't trust the subordinates
to take charge.

325
00:26:56,727 --> 00:26:58,521
I'm sure he will handle things himself

326
00:26:58,855 --> 00:27:00,773
when he kills Doo-kwang.

327
00:27:07,655 --> 00:27:09,073
Fuck it!

328
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,753
Hello? Boss, it's me.

329
00:27:24,672 --> 00:27:26,465
<i>Dong-sik. How's Doo-kwang doing?</i>

330
00:27:28,593 --> 00:27:29,677
<i>Keep up the good work.</i>

331
00:27:30,303 --> 00:27:32,972
<i>I will see you in the fish warehouse
at Daeheung Pier in Incheon.</i>

332
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:35,516
<i>We should finish him off soon.</i>

333
00:27:36,184 --> 00:27:37,768
<i>Are things going well there?</i>

334
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:40,730
<i>Yes. Once we kill Doo-kwang,</i>

335
00:27:40,813 --> 00:27:42,940
<i>we will take over the clubs
in other districts.</i>

336
00:27:43,482 --> 00:27:45,276
<i>I'm counting on you for this.</i>

337
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,445
<i>By the way, how long will you take?</i>

338
00:27:47,528 --> 00:27:49,071
I will take about 30 minutes.

339
00:27:49,906 --> 00:27:51,949
<i>I will arrive there around the same time.</i>

340
00:27:52,366 --> 00:27:54,160
<i>Okay. I will see you there.</i>

341
00:28:03,085 --> 00:28:06,797
Moon-gi Son is going to the fish warehouse
at Daeheung Pier in Incheon.

342
00:28:06,964 --> 00:28:09,217
Is Doo-kwang still alive?

343
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:10,468
Yes.

344
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:13,763
Did you hear that?
We will split into groups of two.

345
00:28:14,138 --> 00:28:16,515
Inspector Yoo and I will
attack Moon-gi Son.

346
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:19,518
You two go attack Dong-sik Yoon
and save Doo-kwang Lee.

347
00:28:19,727 --> 00:28:21,437
-Okay?
-Yes.

348
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,857
Would two be enough?
Courage and bravado aren't the same thing.

349
00:28:25,775 --> 00:28:28,694
If things go well, we call it courage.
If not, it's bravado.

350
00:28:29,654 --> 00:28:31,030
Ong-chul, go.

351
00:28:31,906 --> 00:28:32,740
All right.

352
00:28:39,205 --> 00:28:41,332
Only two of us are going in there?

353
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:44,502
No matter how hard I think,
it seems like bravado to me.

354
00:28:45,086 --> 00:28:47,213
Why would I act with bravado at my age?

355
00:28:47,755 --> 00:28:49,966
Meddling in others' business
can be deadly when you're my age.

356
00:28:58,933 --> 00:29:00,601
Hello? Mi-young Yoo speaking.

357
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,526
Do you want to start it now?

358
00:29:12,572 --> 00:29:14,865
Good luck with that, Detective Oh.

359
00:29:45,438 --> 00:29:47,940
-Hey!
-What are you doing?

360
00:29:49,317 --> 00:29:50,359
Boss!

361
00:29:53,988 --> 00:29:57,491
Stay still
unless you want holes on your body.

362
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,494
Where is Moon-gi?

363
00:30:02,163 --> 00:30:03,831
Where is he, you bastard?

364
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:07,209
Moon-gi!

365
00:30:26,103 --> 00:30:27,104
Why don't you quit drinking?

366
00:30:27,605 --> 00:30:29,440
Why would I quit it? It's great.

367
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:41,410
Hey, this whiskey tastes funny.
Is it a fake?

368
00:30:41,494 --> 00:30:43,579
Are you here to track down fake whiskeys?

369
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,998
If so, I will help you get actual results.

370
00:30:46,332 --> 00:30:48,751
You should've told me sooner
that you were on a hunt.

371
00:30:51,045 --> 00:30:53,047
Look at what you've done.

372
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:54,632
Hello?

373
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,885
Okay. Thank you.

374
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,726
Do you think I'm here
for a hunt, you jerk?

375
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:08,854
Then are you here say hello to me?

376
00:31:09,105 --> 00:31:12,650
I've come to see you because of your boss,
Doo-kwang Lee.

377
00:31:31,794 --> 00:31:33,671
Don't you need a weapon?

378
00:31:34,004 --> 00:31:35,715
Why would I need it? I have my own hands.

379
00:31:36,048 --> 00:31:38,843
I can't take care of you
even if you get beaten up.

380
00:31:40,469 --> 00:31:43,097
Psycho, be careful not to get stabbed.

381
00:31:46,392 --> 00:31:49,270
Where did you get that? Let's go.

382
00:31:51,188 --> 00:31:53,816
<i>What do you mean? What about Doo-kwang?</i>

383
00:31:54,608 --> 00:31:59,697
You plan to kill him
and take over his districts in Seoul.

384
00:32:00,489 --> 00:32:02,533
That's your plan, isn't it?

385
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:07,455
My men are going to the warehouse
where you locked him up.

386
00:32:08,205 --> 00:32:09,206
I'm sorry,

387
00:32:09,749 --> 00:32:12,001
but your whole plan is about to be ruined.

388
00:32:13,711 --> 00:32:14,545
Boss.

389
00:32:18,424 --> 00:32:19,633
What's going on?

390
00:32:23,387 --> 00:32:24,472
Damn it.

391
00:32:27,433 --> 00:32:28,267
What?

392
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:30,603
Hang on.

393
00:32:38,402 --> 00:32:41,864
<i>He's not here.
Doo-kwang is not in the warehouse.</i>

394
00:32:47,036 --> 00:32:50,539
I don't know if they already killed him
or sneaked away.

395
00:32:50,623 --> 00:32:51,624
The place is...

396
00:32:59,173 --> 00:33:00,090
What are you doing here?

397
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:02,176
Where's Moon-gi?

398
00:33:13,979 --> 00:33:15,606
Is this another mutiny or what?

399
00:33:15,689 --> 00:33:17,608
I said where is Moon-gi?

400
00:33:18,025 --> 00:33:19,693
<i>What on earth is going on?</i>

401
00:33:20,528 --> 00:33:22,863
It's simple.

402
00:33:23,447 --> 00:33:26,909
<i>It's like a man killed his father,
and his son killed the man.</i>

403
00:33:27,284 --> 00:33:30,246
What a lovely family.
I will talk to you later.

404
00:33:39,421 --> 00:33:40,965
I just saved your life.

405
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,979
Is this Dong-sik's plan?

406
00:33:55,396 --> 00:33:58,232
Did he order you to kill Doo-kwang
and Moon-gi?

407
00:33:58,315 --> 00:34:00,734
Just tell me where Moon-gi is now.

408
00:34:02,903 --> 00:34:04,154
Do as I tell you or else.

409
00:34:04,238 --> 00:34:06,365
They are such disloyal mobsters.

410
00:34:06,657 --> 00:34:07,491
Loyalty?

411
00:34:08,075 --> 00:34:09,827
They don't know anything about that.

412
00:35:09,219 --> 00:35:11,722
You should contact him first.

413
00:35:28,614 --> 00:35:29,865
Let's get it started.

414
00:35:30,866 --> 00:35:33,327
<i>The number you have dialed is...</i>

415
00:35:48,133 --> 00:35:50,552
Boss, things are messed up.

416
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:07,403
Let's wrap things up here, Dong-sik.

417
00:36:08,696 --> 00:36:10,531
<i>Let Doo-kwang go now.</i>

418
00:36:11,365 --> 00:36:13,993
You won't take over Seoul
even if you kill Doo-kwang.

419
00:36:14,785 --> 00:36:17,121
I got your people squared away.

420
00:36:18,622 --> 00:36:20,040
It's not over yet.

421
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,837
Damn it!

422
00:36:26,964 --> 00:36:27,798
Hey.

423
00:36:35,264 --> 00:36:37,141
By the way, what's his name?

424
00:36:40,811 --> 00:36:41,812
How did it go?

425
00:36:43,105 --> 00:36:45,024
It failed? What should we do now?

426
00:36:46,025 --> 00:36:49,028
We will kill Doo-kwang Lee
and leave the country.

427
00:36:50,904 --> 00:36:51,739
Let's go.

428
00:36:57,619 --> 00:36:58,454
Fuck it!

429
00:37:47,795 --> 00:37:49,546
-What?
<i>-Where are you now?</i>

430
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:53,050
Head to Suin Industrial Road,
the way from Incheon to Suwon.

431
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:54,426
What? What's the matter?

432
00:37:54,551 --> 00:37:56,470
Doo-kwang Lee called the police.

433
00:37:56,553 --> 00:37:58,305
<i>So we tracked his phone's location.</i>

434
00:37:58,388 --> 00:38:00,265
<i>He's on Suin Industrial Road.</i>

435
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:03,727
He just drove past Incheon Grand Park.
He's within one kilometer radius.

436
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,313
The car is within the radius.

437
00:38:08,816 --> 00:38:10,692
How long will it take
to get to Incheon Grand Park?

438
00:38:10,776 --> 00:38:11,777
Five minutes.

439
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:28,210
<i>We are close enough to reach the target.</i>

440
00:38:28,502 --> 00:38:31,839
Our car and yours are close enough
to reach each other now.

441
00:38:31,922 --> 00:38:33,924
We are within a one kilometer radius.

442
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:37,594
It's just numbers.
Maybe I could be right under your nose.

443
00:38:39,346 --> 00:38:41,807
<i>So be alert.</i>

444
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,475
<i>This is very important.</i>

445
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:45,519
<i>Listen carefully to what I say,</i>

446
00:38:45,602 --> 00:38:48,814
<i>and answer my questions right
if you want to live.</i>

447
00:38:48,897 --> 00:38:51,024
<i>-Do you understand?</i>
-Yes.

448
00:38:56,029 --> 00:38:59,825
<i>We're now looking
for the car where you are.</i>

449
00:38:59,908 --> 00:39:01,618
But it is a stolen car,

450
00:39:01,702 --> 00:39:04,663
so we can't run a check
on the registration number of it.

451
00:39:05,038 --> 00:39:07,040
We need your help here.

452
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:09,501
You must help us find the car.

453
00:39:09,918 --> 00:39:13,463
Do you remember the registration number

454
00:39:13,547 --> 00:39:14,381
of the car?

455
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:20,804
I don't know.

456
00:39:21,221 --> 00:39:23,599
What's the model of the car?
Do you remember?

457
00:39:23,682 --> 00:39:24,892
What's the color of the car?

458
00:39:25,726 --> 00:39:27,102
I don't know the model,

459
00:39:28,145 --> 00:39:29,062
<i>but it's black.</i>

460
00:39:29,313 --> 00:39:30,355
I'm sure it's black.

461
00:39:30,939 --> 00:39:32,065
Black?

462
00:39:33,317 --> 00:39:35,402
Does it have a large trunk?

463
00:39:36,945 --> 00:39:40,115
-Yes.
-A black car with a large trunk.

464
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:42,034
Maybe it's a mid-sized car.

465
00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:45,746
Doo-kwang, how many people kidnapped you?

466
00:39:45,996 --> 00:39:48,040
Three. There are three of them.

467
00:39:48,665 --> 00:39:50,834
Ong-chul, where are you now?

468
00:39:50,918 --> 00:39:52,002
I'm almost there.

469
00:39:59,134 --> 00:40:00,510
<i>Which one is Dong-sik Yoon's car?</i>

470
00:40:00,802 --> 00:40:02,971
<i>It's a black mid-sized car.</i>

471
00:40:03,055 --> 00:40:05,182
<i>There are three people in the car.</i>

472
00:40:05,265 --> 00:40:06,558
Doo-kwang is in the trunk.

473
00:40:07,184 --> 00:40:08,936
That's not enough.
We need more information.

474
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,612
Doo-kwang, let's find another way.

475
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:22,616
New cars these days have

476
00:40:22,699 --> 00:40:24,660
a lever for an escape in the trunk.

477
00:40:24,743 --> 00:40:27,454
<i>Does the car have that lever?</i>

478
00:40:28,914 --> 00:40:29,748
I don't think so.

479
00:40:30,499 --> 00:40:31,333
Really?

480
00:40:32,668 --> 00:40:35,337
It means the car is old.

481
00:40:35,462 --> 00:40:37,256
A black old car.

482
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:39,716
There's a way

483
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,511
to open the trunk without that lever.

484
00:40:42,594 --> 00:40:45,264
Once you open the trunk,
don't jump off immediately.

485
00:40:45,347 --> 00:40:47,641
You should wave your hand first.
Do you understand?

486
00:40:47,724 --> 00:40:49,518
I already know that.

487
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:51,687
Just tell me how to open the trunk,
you idiot!

488
00:40:57,442 --> 00:41:00,821
Do you see the handle of the trunk?

489
00:41:01,029 --> 00:41:02,322
There is a rod

490
00:41:02,406 --> 00:41:05,909
<i>which is connected to the key lock.</i>

491
00:41:06,493 --> 00:41:08,287
Yes. I found it.

492
00:41:08,662 --> 00:41:11,290
Ong-chul, he will open the trunk soon.

493
00:41:11,373 --> 00:41:14,001
Look for the car with an open trunk.

494
00:41:27,514 --> 00:41:29,391
Damn it!

495
00:41:43,405 --> 00:41:45,073
What's wrong, Doo-kwang?

496
00:41:49,286 --> 00:41:50,120
<i>He failed.</i>

497
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,248
What should we do now?

498
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,084
Taillights.

499
00:41:59,171 --> 00:42:01,131
He should break the taillights
so we can find the car.

500
00:42:03,717 --> 00:42:06,178
Doo-kwang, do you hear me?

501
00:42:07,137 --> 00:42:08,680
<i>Listen to me and focus.</i>

502
00:42:08,764 --> 00:42:09,931
Damn it.

503
00:42:10,015 --> 00:42:12,434
If you want to live,
listen to me, you son of a bitch!

504
00:42:19,983 --> 00:42:22,819
Do you see the taillights? Break them.

505
00:42:23,362 --> 00:42:25,030
Then we will find the car.

506
00:42:38,627 --> 00:42:39,961
I did it.

507
00:42:40,379 --> 00:42:42,798
Ong-chul, find a car
with a broken taillight.

508
00:42:43,006 --> 00:42:43,840
Doo-kwang is in there.

509
00:42:52,724 --> 00:42:53,558
That's it.

510
00:43:10,659 --> 00:43:12,828
Hey, the taillight of your car is broken.

511
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,954
The taillight?

512
00:43:16,164 --> 00:43:17,249
Shit.

513
00:43:24,047 --> 00:43:24,881
Make a right.

514
00:43:33,473 --> 00:43:35,225
What's that? Turn the car around.

515
00:43:36,685 --> 00:43:37,894
Turn it around now!

516
00:43:54,035 --> 00:43:55,162
Who is that?

517
00:44:04,087 --> 00:44:06,339
Hit him. Hit him now!

518
00:44:10,427 --> 00:44:12,345
What?

519
00:44:45,587 --> 00:44:46,755
Doo-kwang Lee?

520
00:45:30,465 --> 00:45:32,133
What if Ong-chul refuses to do it?

521
00:45:37,347 --> 00:45:39,099
Do you want me to kill

522
00:45:39,766 --> 00:45:41,351
both Ong-chul and Jung-moon Lee

523
00:45:42,269 --> 00:45:43,395
with my own hands?

524
00:45:57,367 --> 00:45:58,201
Jung-moon Lee.

525
00:46:09,963 --> 00:46:12,299
-What are you doing?
-I have to kill you.

526
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,301
I have to.

527
00:46:38,241 --> 00:46:39,951
Doo-kwang, what are you doing?

528
00:46:40,035 --> 00:46:41,036
Get off me!

529
00:46:41,619 --> 00:46:42,620
Doo-kwang.

530
00:46:49,711 --> 00:46:52,547
Doo-kwang, he just saved your life.

531
00:46:52,797 --> 00:46:54,257
What do you think you are doing?

532
00:46:54,549 --> 00:46:56,968
If you killed him right last time,

533
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,553
I wouldn't have done any of this.

534
00:46:58,678 --> 00:47:02,182
Doo-kwang, please don't do this.

535
00:47:03,516 --> 00:47:04,351
Ong-chul.

536
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:07,312
I have no choice.

537
00:47:08,104 --> 00:47:09,564
Doo-kwang, you can't do this.

538
00:47:10,273 --> 00:47:11,107
Doo-kwang.

539
00:47:11,191 --> 00:47:14,819
Put down the knife.

540
00:47:36,883 --> 00:47:38,593
<i>Where have you been?</i>

541
00:47:38,676 --> 00:47:40,387
I told you. I got lost in the mountains.

542
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:41,554
What are you talking about?

543
00:47:41,638 --> 00:47:43,932
The electronic anklet signal stopped
at Uijeongbu.

544
00:47:44,015 --> 00:47:46,601
Everything is fine now that I'm here.

545
00:48:20,301 --> 00:48:22,804
Thank you, Detective Gu-tak Oh.

546
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:40,655
Ong-chul.

547
00:48:42,365 --> 00:48:44,033
There's always a knife behind your back.

548
00:48:46,286 --> 00:48:47,162
Keep that in mind.

549
00:49:42,931 --> 00:49:46,393
TAE-SOO

550
00:49:52,969 --> 00:49:55,972
The prison van has just arrived. Let's go.

551
00:50:04,397 --> 00:50:05,232
Who is it?

552
00:50:07,025 --> 00:50:07,859
What?

553
00:50:08,193 --> 00:50:09,402
Who ordered your boss

554
00:50:10,737 --> 00:50:12,364
to kill me?

555
00:50:16,284 --> 00:50:17,118
Who is it?

556
00:50:20,455 --> 00:50:21,581
I don't know.

557
00:50:33,051 --> 00:50:34,261
Then I will go ask him

558
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:37,013
myself.

559
00:51:01,871 --> 00:51:03,456
Let's go, Inspector Yoo.

560
00:51:04,374 --> 00:51:06,209
How have you known Doo-kwang Lee?

561
00:51:10,964 --> 00:51:13,383
You said Doo-kwang called the police

562
00:51:14,092 --> 00:51:16,595
and they transferred the call to you.

563
00:51:17,012 --> 00:51:18,638
That's interesting.

564
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:21,433
I tracked down Doo-kwang's phone

565
00:51:21,516 --> 00:51:23,852
and found out he called you,
not the police.

566
00:51:25,437 --> 00:51:26,688
What's going on

567
00:51:27,814 --> 00:51:29,274
between you two?

568
00:51:38,742 --> 00:51:40,368
<i>There might be something</i>

569
00:51:40,493 --> 00:51:44,289
<i>between Gu-tak Oh and the gang boss</i>

570
00:51:44,372 --> 00:51:47,167
<i>named Doo-kwang Lee or something.</i>

571
00:51:48,001 --> 00:51:51,630
Why are you telling me all that?

572
00:51:51,713 --> 00:51:54,758
I think you should know about this.

573
00:51:59,012 --> 00:52:01,848
Mi-young, are you still on that issue?

574
00:52:02,682 --> 00:52:05,769
Are you still curious

575
00:52:06,019 --> 00:52:07,896
why Gu-tak chose those three guys?

576
00:52:08,188 --> 00:52:10,940
Is that why you are sticking to me
like this at this time of night?

577
00:52:16,738 --> 00:52:20,033
Do you know why police have ranks?

578
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:23,119
That's because police are supposed

579
00:52:24,412 --> 00:52:27,832
to know what they should know
and hear what they should hear.

580
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:30,877
They must see only
what they are supposed to see.

581
00:52:34,756 --> 00:52:36,883
Don't you think so, Inspector Yoo?

582
00:52:39,844 --> 00:52:40,679
What?

583
00:52:41,763 --> 00:52:43,556
Do you have a problem with that?

584
00:52:49,896 --> 00:52:51,022
Mi-young.

585
00:52:52,065 --> 00:52:54,234
Listen carefully to my words.

586
00:52:54,651 --> 00:52:56,361
Even if a dog bites its owner,

587
00:52:57,153 --> 00:52:58,530
the owner won't die.

588
00:52:59,447 --> 00:53:01,950
If you have a problem with your owner,
you should wait.

589
00:53:02,534 --> 00:53:05,745
Wait for the right time
and bite your owner

590
00:53:06,538 --> 00:53:07,580
when he is dying.

591
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:11,251
Until then, you should wag your tail

592
00:53:11,835 --> 00:53:13,962
so that your owner won't kick you
out of his house.

593
00:53:14,754 --> 00:53:18,216
Some day, you will get to bite his neck.

594
00:54:00,216 --> 00:54:03,011
Detective Oh, it's me.

595
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,629
If you killed him right last time,

596
00:54:38,046 --> 00:54:39,255
I wouldn't have done any of this.

597
00:54:52,727 --> 00:54:53,561
<i>Ong-chul.</i>

598
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:56,231
There's always a knife behind your back.

599
00:54:56,564 --> 00:54:57,816
Who is it?

600
00:54:58,399 --> 00:54:59,567
Who ordered your boss

601
00:55:02,195 --> 00:55:03,363
to kill me?

602
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,186
I'll give you the other half
once it's done.

603
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:37,730
This is the guy.

604
00:55:47,073 --> 00:55:47,907
<i>Who is it?</i>

605
00:55:48,491 --> 00:55:50,785
<i>Who has been trying to kill you</i>

606
00:55:51,035 --> 00:55:53,454
<i>for the past two years?</i>

607
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:55,623
<i>Jung-moon Lee.</i>

608
00:56:27,655 --> 00:56:28,990
Did something happen

609
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:32,410
while rescuing Doo-kwang Lee?

610
00:56:32,869 --> 00:56:35,622
What happened between you two?

611
00:56:40,251 --> 00:56:41,336
Nothing happened.

612
00:56:41,669 --> 00:56:43,922
That's not true.
The atmosphere has changed.

613
00:56:44,005 --> 00:56:46,507
Since that day the atmosphere has changed.

614
00:56:47,133 --> 00:56:49,052
I feel so uncomfortable around you guys.

615
00:56:52,805 --> 00:56:53,890
I guess you are right.

616
00:56:58,561 --> 00:56:59,854
You could cut this air with a knife.

617
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:01,814
Around us.

618
00:57:19,582 --> 00:57:20,583
What is it this time?

619
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:22,210
We have a case.

620
00:57:22,835 --> 00:57:23,836
What case?

621
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:30,927
We found Jong-dae Lim.

622
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,554
Where did you find him?

623
00:57:36,224 --> 00:57:37,350
RESTRICTED AREA

624
00:58:55,636 --> 00:58:56,888
What are you doing here?

<i>The culprit of this case must be
a professional killer.</i>

628
00:59:23,681 --> 00:59:25,516
Contract killers don't feel anything.

629
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,060
They have no feelings of guilt.

630
00:59:28,435 --> 00:59:30,562
<i>You're a psychopath, Jung-moon Lee.</i>

631
00:59:30,646 --> 00:59:33,065
Don't try to sound me out
by provoking me like that.

632
00:59:33,148 --> 00:59:36,110
Then, ask your boss
who ordered him to kill me.

633
00:59:36,193 --> 00:59:37,987
Someone came to me

634
00:59:38,237 --> 00:59:40,447
<i>and asked me to kill Jung-moon Lee.</i>

635
00:59:40,572 --> 00:59:41,573
Who ordered you

636
00:59:41,699 --> 00:59:42,783
<i>to kill Jung-moon?</i>

637
00:59:42,866 --> 00:59:43,701
<i>Ong-chul.</i>

638
00:59:43,784 --> 00:59:45,452
I never ordered them to do it.

639
00:59:45,953 --> 00:59:49,081
<i>They found fingerprints on the weapon.
It seems to be the culprit's.</i>

640
00:59:49,164 --> 00:59:51,000
I'm afraid this case won't be easy.

641
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:52,751
It's been a while, Tae-soo.

642
00:59:52,835 --> 00:59:54,294
Where is Jong-seok now?

643
00:59:54,378 --> 00:59:55,796
<i>Where can I see him?</i>

644
00:59:55,879 --> 00:59:59,466
You said you wouldn't do it,
so I found someone else.

645
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:01,802
Who is the person you found?

646
01:00:01,885 --> 01:00:03,303
You have someone in mind, right?

647
01:00:03,387 --> 01:00:04,221
<i>Keep that in mind.</i>

648
01:00:04,513 --> 01:00:06,640
If you want to live,
stay out of this case.

649
01:00:06,724 --> 01:00:08,225
<i>I didn't do it.</i>

650
01:00:08,308 --> 01:00:10,310
<i>That's not me. It's him.</i>

651
01:00:12,312 --> 01:00:13,480
Do you remember me?
