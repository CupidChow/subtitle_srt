1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,838
BAD GUYS

2
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,698
BAD GUYS

3
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:34,326
Where is Oh Gu-tak?

4
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,622
You want to let this mad dog off the leash
to catch the scumbag who killed your son?

5
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,584
Capture him and bring him to me
in one piece.

6
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,878
Let's round up a few crazy dogs.

7
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:47,506
We'll need Park's muscles
and Jung's skills.

8
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,258
Lee's got the brains.

9
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:53,470
If the three of them join forces,
they can catch anyone in the world.

10
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,347
Why did you decide to take this on?

11
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,974
I found something interesting.

12
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,892
Did they have something to do with...

13
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,561
I said, you're not my boss!

14
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,104
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

15
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,983
-I asked you first, you little punk.
-Don't raise your hand against me.

16
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,484
Listen to me.

17
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,945
If one of you manages
to catch the serial killer,

18
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,905
we'll knock five years off.

19
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,115
Hi, Jung-moon.

20
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,908
We're a team now.

21
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,410
Let's catch him first.

22
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,787
Why is he killing people?

23
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,082
He has an impulse
to smell blood when it rains.

24
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,417
Let's get started.

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,128
These robbery-murder cases took place

26
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:29,590
in northeastern Seoul
between July and November of last year.

27
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:30,716
Fifteen in total.

28
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,760
However, two of them survived.

29
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,471
-Are you Yoon Chul-joo?
-Who are you?

30
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,015
Help me track somebody down.

31
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,268
The victim was stabbed in the lungs,
and the knife was pulled downward.

32
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,270
He kills whenever it rains.

33
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:44,771
It's raining.

34
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,566
Is she that important to you?

35
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,151
You keep watch over her.

36
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,279
Are your ears plugged? Stop for a second!

37
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,405
It's you, isn't it?

38
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,240
Where did that scumbag go?

39
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,491
Look for a black cap!

40
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,160
Hey, get him.

41
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,621
Don't kill me...

42
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,373
Why do you girls always say that?
I'm going to kill you.

43
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,876
You're not human.
You're just a lowly beast.

44
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,004
Then you should die now.

45
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,173
That's enough, Tae-su.

46
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,966
You must not kill that scumbag.

47
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,761
Did you set this up?

48
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,555
Now that the hunt is over,
it's time to skin them.

49
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,683
The only thing that's left is to eat them.

50
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,725
Hello, 911. What's your emergency?

51
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,811
Hello, I've been kidnapped.

52
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,522
I'm at a house near Geumdang Intersection.

53
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,523
Who kidnapped you?

54
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,649
It's some guy.

55
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,111
Hurry. Please come fast.

56
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,741
Could you tell me again?
Where exactly are you?

57
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,910
This house is...

58
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,163
It's near Geumdang Intersection.

59
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,707
Right before Hope Church.

60
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,878
Please try to stay calm.
Could you say that again?

61
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,379
I locked the door, but...

62
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:15,797
Please hurry.

63
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,591
Hurry!

64
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,228
What's wrong?

65
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,773
Hello?

66
00:04:33,154 --> 00:04:34,107
Are you okay?

67
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,736
HUMAN MARKET

68
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,286
Never skip meals
no matter how busy you are.

69
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,789
EPISODE 3

70
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:53,668
I bet the criminals we're after
eat meat for every meal.

71
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,255
Here. This is for you.

72
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,634
They say an apple a day
keeps the doctor away.

73
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,679
Thank you, Mr. Commissioner.

74
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,479
Do you know why apples
should be eaten in the morning?

75
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:18,777
They say an apple
boosts your metabolism in the morning.

76
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,280
Because you peeled it,
it tastes even better, sir.

77
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,826
Does it? Enjoy.

78
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,828
Eat up...

79
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,833
so you can get some work done for once.

80
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,337
What do you mean, sir?

81
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:43,301
Our citizens' hard-earned money
is what puts food on your table,

82
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:49,516
so you need to do your job
and produce results!

83
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,561
My apologies, sir.

84
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,938
I'll get everything sorted out at once.

85
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,273
Four hours!

86
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,986
During the four hours that
the officers at your precinct wasted,

87
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,073
the perp killed the victim and ran.

88
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,494
If your men got there in time,

89
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:12,914
the perp would be in our custody,
and the woman would be alive!

90
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,543
According to the patrol officers
who responded to the call,

91
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,547
murder isn't
a rare occurrence in the area.

92
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,884
And there are rumors
that the Black Society recently moved in

93
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,513
which is why
they struggled to enter the scene.

94
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:29,514
They "struggled"?

95
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,062
How could you say that
as a member of the police force?

96
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,567
Get out.

97
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,113
I said, get out!

98
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,031
Yes, sir.

99
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,714
It's me.

100
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,383
Unleash...

101
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,094
those crazy dogs.

102
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,117
-How are things?
-Good, of course.

103
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,536
How's your shoulder? Can you move it?

104
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,623
Well, I can lift a spoon.

105
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,126
Look at you.
You seem to be in good spirits.

106
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,588
No reason not to be.

107
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,090
You must resent me.

108
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,677
Resent you?

109
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,974
That's too humane.

110
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,517
I don't resent people.

111
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,813
I just kill.

112
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,277
So are you going to kill me?

113
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,367
Tae-su, never make a U-turn in life.

114
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,537
If you make a haphazard U-turn,

115
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,249
you'll get lost
and won't make it out alive.

116
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,543
That's my problem,
so mind your own business.

117
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,172
Why are you here?

118
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,841
To keep my promise.

119
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,684
"Promise"? You're unbelievable.

120
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,770
You're the one that dragged us
back in here like dogs.

121
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,772
You want to release me again?

122
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,776
You think you can bank on me
whenever you need to?

123
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,696
You'll come with me anyway.
Don't make a fuss.

124
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,072
I'm making a fuss?

125
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,040
Say that again?

126
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:04,377
You're coming with me anyway
so shut your mouth and follow me.

127
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,012
How many people have you killed?

128
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,557
Save just as many lives as you took.

129
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,770
It's time you saved some lives
with those hands that have killed.

130
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,272
Then you'll be a free man.

131
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:37,077
Jung-moon, you're so hard to read.

132
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,288
What's on your mind now?

133
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,799
It'd be easier to make a monk eat meat.

134
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,803
So? Are you in or not?

135
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,264
Do I get to choose?

136
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,060
From the start,
it was always up to you people.

137
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,063
I was never given a choice.

138
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,483
I simply obeyed
what you people chose to do.

139
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,613
I'll take that as a yes.

140
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,700
You asked me what was on my mind.

141
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,791
You know what's funny?

142
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:33,383
Whenever I see you,
I wonder the same thing.

143
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,554
What are you thinking?

144
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,394
Dad, what are you thinking?

145
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,314
-What?
-What are you thinking about?

146
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,902
If my daughter leaves to study abroad,

147
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,281
who will make sure I don't skip meals?

148
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,951
Who will help me with my laundry
and keep the house clean?

149
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,120
Stuff like that.

150
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,664
I'm your daughter, not your maid!

151
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,377
"Will my daughter adjust well?"

152
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,670
"Will she eat well?"

153
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,882
"What if she meets a jerk
who breaks her heart?"

154
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,967
Think about stuff like that.

155
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:22,223
If anyone breaks your heart,
they will live the rest of their life

156
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,433
as a cripple.

157
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,727
You'll beat them up?

158
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,148
My goodness. You're a cop, not a thug.

159
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,485
Who would want to date you,
let alone marry you?

160
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:37,947
-I told you I'm not getting remarried!
-You should!

161
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,325
I want you to meet
someone beautiful and sexy.

162
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,243
Take her out to dinner and a movie.

163
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,621
You need to go on dates. Please!

164
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:50,919
I don't care about dating
someone beautiful and sexy.

165
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,047
I just want to watch you
grow into a beautiful lady.

166
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,673
I don't need to go on dates.

167
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,800
I'd much rather see you meet a nice guy

168
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:01,387
who will take you out
for dinner and a movie.

169
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,224
Dad, don't tell me...

170
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,768
What? Are you touched by what I just said?

171
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,144
No, it's not that.

172
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,314
Don't tell me you're planning
to live with me forever.

173
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,149
-I decline.
-You brat.

174
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,819
Don't talk to your father like that!

175
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,404
You little brat.

176
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,074
Anyway, don't be home late.

177
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,286
I'm making spicy sausage stew,
your favorite.

178
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,454
Really?

179
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,332
Let's eat.

180
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,930
Your daughter, Oh Ji-yeon,
was found dead that evening.

181
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,391
Is that why you did something like that?

182
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,771
Captain Oh, we're here
to discuss your suspension

183
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,399
and the disciplinary actions
we will be taking.

184
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,735
Do you have any objections
to our decision?

185
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,948
Any objections?

186
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,329
Let me ask you a question.

187
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,958
Are we beasts or humans?

188
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,672
The ones we must catch are beasts.

189
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,215
Brutes.

190
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,884
So what are we?

191
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,514
If we're human,
the beasts will eat us alive.

192
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,808
But if we turn into beasts,

193
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,770
people like yourselves
will have us locked up in a cage.

194
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,231
So what do you want me to do?

195
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,860
You're showing no remorse whatsoever,
Captain Oh Gu-tak.

196
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,902
Remorse?

197
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,908
I wish I felt remorse.
Then I wouldn't be getting suspended.

198
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,661
But you know what?

199
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,959
OH GU-TAK

200
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,212
I cannot afford to be remorseful

201
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:04,010
until I catch the bastard
who killed my daughter, Ji-yeon.

202
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,512
OH GU-TAK
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

203
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,166
Do you think they'll come?

204
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,919
What choice do they have?

205
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,463
They'll come. I'm sure of it.

206
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,591
How can you be so sure?

207
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:30,763
They've had a taste of hope
and hope is like a drug.

208
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,897
Are you guys ready to hunt?

209
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,400
You'll be working with us as members

210
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,195
of Seoul Police's
Special Crime Investigation Division.

211
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:32,116
Our job is to investigate
and solve cases that frontline officers

212
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,285
couldn't for various reasons.

213
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,955
Of course, everything about the division
and your involvement

214
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,415
will remain top secret.

215
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:43,586
Once the perp is caught,
you'll be sent back to prison.

216
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,006
But if we need you
to work on another case,

217
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,925
you'll be released and put in action.

218
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,471
With each perp caught,
your sentence will be reduced.

219
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,390
And once your sentence is reduced to zero,

220
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,684
you'll be a free man as promised.

221
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:12,114
When it comes to freedom,
protecting it is harder than getting it.

222
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,953
You see, I gave you guys freedom,
but it is your job to protect it.

223
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,580
Protect your freedom.

224
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:24,252
And to do that, you must hunt down
all the evil scumbags out there.

225
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,045
Bite them and rip them to shreds.

226
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:30,383
Take away their freedom
so you can protect yours.

227
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,093
Got it?

228
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,014
Go check out the scene first.

229
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,766
Senior Inspector Yoo.

230
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,061
It's over there.

231
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,570
Where is that woman?

232
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,321
She's in the hospital.

233
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,656
Which hospital?

234
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,825
I'll tell you once we wrap up this case.

235
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:58,536
How is she?

236
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:03,207
Not well, obviously.
You know what she went through.

237
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,423
If she dies,

238
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,050
you will too.

239
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:23,102
The victim, Shin So-jung,
is a 24-year-old college student.

240
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:27,023
Two days ago on July 26 at around 2 a.m.,

241
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,693
she was on her way home after her shift.

242
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,988
She was walking
through this alley, Geumdang 4-gil.

243
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,698
That's when it happened.

244
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,246
It only took him three minutes
to abduct her and lock her up.

245
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,457
This tells us two things.

246
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,461
First, the perp had been
watching her walk by his house.

247
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,884
Second, this wasn't his first rodeo.

248
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,752
He locked her in this room.

249
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,755
She was beaten,
so she was probably unconscious.

250
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,259
Then he started preparing
for his second act.

251
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,721
Did he dismember her?

252
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:47,395
However, an unexpected event occurs.

253
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,565
Once she regained consciousness,
she locked the door

254
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,109
and called the police.

255
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,736
Hello, I'm at a house
near Geumdang Intersection.

256
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,405
I've been kidnapped.

257
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,537
I locked the door, but he's trying to...

258
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,789
Please hurry.

259
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,960
But the perp caught on
and broke the door down.

260
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,379
He knocked out the victim

261
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:19,844
and dragged her to the bathroom
where he brutally murdered her.

262
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,817
Please don't kill me.

263
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,249
According to the lease agreement,
this is what we know so far.

264
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,836
Yang Shi-chul is 37 years old
and is from Gumi.

265
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,798
Yang chopped the victim's body
into more than 300 pieces

266
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,885
and fled the crime scene
which was his house.

267
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:04,764
Your mission is to catch Yang Shi-chul.

268
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,600
Since we know his full name,
this will be an easy job.

269
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,976
How many years?

270
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,520
Five years is our offer.

271
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,272
Okay, deal.

272
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,024
I'll get him before the day ends.

273
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,400
Something's off.

274
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,153
What now? You're the one that's off.

275
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,865
He didn't know that
she was calling the police in the room?

276
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,369
In this tiny house?

277
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,414
He could've been
flustered and preoccupied.

278
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,251
He found out that she called the police.

279
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,338
Then, Yang Shi-chul
or whatever his name is

280
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,841
took his time to chop her up
into 300 pieces before running away?

281
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:44,595
The story doesn't add up.

282
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,683
Agreed. It really doesn't add up.

283
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:56,065
This filthy bastard.
Looks like he never cleans.

284
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,108
This place stinks.

285
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,319
What do you mean it doesn't add up?

286
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,072
Are you saying
I'm wrong about this whole thing?

287
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,407
No.

288
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,536
Yang Shi-chul abducted the victim.

289
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,331
He dragged her into that room
and beat her up.

290
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,375
When she fainted, he locked her up.

291
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:20,422
However, we just came across
an unexpected variable.

292
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,758
What unexpected variable?

293
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,802
I just got a call from the NFS.

294
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,388
The body that was found...

295
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,099
was not Shin So-jung.

296
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,811
This is probably how it went down.

297
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,647
Yang went into that bathroom.

298
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:38,148
Why?

299
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,945
To dismember Jane Doe,
the unidentified victim.

300
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,532
That's when Shin So-jung
regained consciousness

301
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,492
and called the police.

302
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:53,080
Then what happened to Shin So-jung?
Where is she now?

303
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,459
Exactly. She might still be alive.

304
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,131
So we're not just after the perp.

305
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,091
We have to find the missing woman too.

306
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,968
Why is this so complicated?

307
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,636
Do we have any leads?

308
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,807
The body was cut
into more than 300 pieces.

309
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,852
To be exact, there were 356 pieces.

310
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:22,109
It's certainly not common. Right?

311
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:29,199
He didn't just cut the body into pieces.
Her organs are nowhere to be found.

312
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,577
And her face is severely disfigured

313
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,788
as if it was doused
with some kind of chemical.

314
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:39,001
That's why the dimwits
in the Violent Crimes Unit

315
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,086
assumed that it was Shin So-jung.

316
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:01,941
That's right.

317
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:08,489
There's only one
possible scenario for this case.

318
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:12,785
Goodness.

319
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,557
Organ trafficking.

320
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,601
I bet he sold the bones to hospitals.

321
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:40,813
Yang Shi-chul, that bastard, sold humans.

322
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,232
It's been two days.

323
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,443
Find Shin So-jung no matter what.

324
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,112
Find that woman first.

325
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:53,826
Then when you catch Yang Shi-chul,
you can chew him to pieces.

326
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,023
Hey. What's up?

327
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,415
Set up the workshop
as quickly as possible.

328
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,127
I'll take care of the meat
and the organs at once,

329
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,964
so contact anyone
who'd be interested in working with logs.

330
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,135
What? The product?

331
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,806
It's still fresh. Don't you worry.

332
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:02,811
We'll sell everything
as soon as the job's done,

333
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,271
so don't worry.

334
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,863
I heard you met the victim's father.
How is he?

335
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,533
What do you think? He's devastated.

336
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:05,290
Do you think the victim is alive?
It's already been two days.

337
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,000
When it comes to victims,

338
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,587
if you think they're alive,
you'll find them alive.

339
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,923
But they die if you think they're dead.

340
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,508
What do you mean?

341
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,885
It all depends on your determination.

342
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,097
Look for her believing she's alive.

343
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,058
If you get lucky, you'll find her alive.

344
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:24,935
Good luck.

345
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,271
Where are you going?

346
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,692
I need to deal with some bad apples.

347
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:37,990
Anything yet?

348
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,827
That man stood there for over 20 minutes.

349
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,745
Could he be a neighbor?

350
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,586
How would you react
if you saw someone being abducted?

351
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,213
You'd either run away in fear
or call the police.

352
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,007
But he did neither.

353
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:59,636
He just calmly watched
as if he expected this to happen.

354
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,139
Is he an accomplice?

355
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:09,563
Prosecutor Jang, isn't it
a bit too early for a place like this?

356
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,026
You have to come early
to get girls in good condition.

357
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,655
If you come late, you can't tell
if you're touching a girl or a dead squid.

358
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,161
Anyway, are you really sure?

359
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,788
I told you I could get you a hottie.

360
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,249
I'm good.

361
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,334
Why?

362
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:34,171
Do you feel bad because
they remind you of your daughter?

363
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,548
How old is your kid?

364
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:44,890
Oh, right. I forgot what happened.

365
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,727
I apologize for my oversight.

366
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,231
I always have a lot going on,
so I can be forgetful.

367
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,025
It's fine.

368
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,320
Let's drink.

369
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:02,783
Sure. Let's drink until we drop.

370
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:03,700
Cheers!

371
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,499
Yes, sure thing.

372
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:14,044
I'll wrap it nicely
like a bride on her wedding day.

373
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,301
I'll call you back. All right.

374
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,262
Hey.

375
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,349
Are they all new?
Why don't they recognize me?

376
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:31,186
-Must you beat them up every time?
-Why didn't you pick up?

377
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,355
You saw that I was on the phone.

378
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,856
I had to come all this way.

379
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,192
Here.

380
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,029
"Kidneys, organs. Call to inquire"?

381
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,156
What's this, boss?

382
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,075
Let's get to work. Come on.

383
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,368
What kind of work?

384
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,577
Come on. Let's go.

385
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,913
-I'm really busy today.
-Come on.

386
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,044
MIRAE TELECOM

387
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,326
MIRAE TELECOM

388
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,105
I need to know who used this phone.

389
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,399
It's registered
under a Southeast Asian name.

390
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:22,154
Then I guess it belongs
to someone from Southeast Asia.

391
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,323
Do you think I'm an idiot?

392
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,241
Just spit it out.

393
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,618
Who makes burner phones
using foreigners' names?

394
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,705
Look. We provide telecom services.

395
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,624
We don't deal with burner phones.

396
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,461
I got eight more registered.

397
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,380
Shut it. What are you talking about?

398
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,799
What do you think? Burner phones.

399
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:46,595
You won't talk?

400
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:49,639
I don't feel too well today,
but come at me.

401
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,642
Hey, come on.

402
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:54,811
Why you little...

403
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,068
You piece of...

404
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:09,993
Talk, or I'll whack you.

405
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,536
I'll talk.

406
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,579
Then talk.

407
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:16,083
In Gaebong-dong, there are people

408
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:20,420
who register burner phones for 3,000 won
using foreigners' passports.

409
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:25,509
It's a big business.
They're involved in human trafficking too.

410
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,719
-What's the address?
-I don't know.

411
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:33,392
Oh, I do have their number though.
Do you want it?

412
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:34,559
Write it down.

413
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,189
You drank quite a bit.

414
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,315
Yes, I did.

415
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,568
Ladies, leave us alone for a moment.

416
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,783
Where are you going?

417
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,285
Did you really have a lot to drink?

418
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:53,954
Yes. Why are you...

419
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,834
Oh Gu-tak! Are you out of your mind?

420
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:11,263
I don't have much time,
so answer my questions truthfully, okay?

421
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:12,639
Why are you...

422
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,353
Some of the scumbags who bribe you
are engaged in human trafficking.

423
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,439
What are you saying?

424
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:24,276
Yes! You're right! The log handlers.

425
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:28,697
I'm looking for someone, but I'm stuck.

426
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:34,119
So I need the information of those
that are involved in organ trafficking.

427
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:39,499
Please, Captain Oh.
They'll kill me if I tell you.

428
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,626
They're scary people.

429
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,672
They don't care who you are.
We're all just logs they can sell!

430
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:50,093
You're not the only prosecutor
who's been taking bribes from them.

431
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:54,890
You started drinking
early in the night and got wasted.

432
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:59,269
I even created an alibi for you.
So what's the problem?

433
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,833
You look like you have a neck brace.
Try to act natural.

434
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,503
Okay.

435
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,298
Did I sleep wrong last night?
Why is my neck so stiff?

436
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,761
Boss. Can I go see an acupuncturist?

437
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,554
Got a death wish?

438
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,515
Or maybe moxibustion?

439
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,602
Never mind.

440
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,898
-Do your job.
-Yes, boss.

441
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,112
Are you Yoon Chul-joo?

442
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,993
Me? You got the wrong person.

443
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:10,882
Oh, someone's calling me.

444
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:17,389
If you're not Yoon Chul-joo,
why do you have his phone?

445
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,724
Did you change your mind?

446
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,893
Sir, I have cirrhosis.

447
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,896
On top of that, I smoke and drink a lot,

448
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,856
so I'm all rotten inside.

449
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,359
I have high blood pressure
and I'm diabetic so...

450
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,404
You've got nice, thick flesh.

451
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,741
Right. I've been told
that I have soft skin.

452
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:39,202
But I rarely shower, so I stink...

453
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:40,829
Do you want to die?

454
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:44,165
You can't back out now. Follow me.

455
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,505
What do I do?

456
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:51,756
Just go.

457
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:21,661
Height, 170 to 175 cm.
He had a navy baseball cap on.

458
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:26,374
He wore a black V-neck T-shirt
under a gray shirt and cargo pants.

459
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,050
Let's begin.

460
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,489
Your nine o'clock. Go.

461
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,680
There are three alleyways. Which one?

462
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,059
Geumdang 2-gil. Your 12 o'clock.

463
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:20,613
You keep looking back.

464
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,659
Gosh, it's like a maze here.

465
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,703
Just follow me.

466
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,006
You'll see a fork up ahead.

467
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,967
Take Geumdang 4-gil.
It's at your one o'clock.

468
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,234
Hey, where did they go?

469
00:37:58,318 --> 00:37:59,778
What should we do?

470
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,655
He'll get all his organs extracted
and become a log.

471
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,491
It's not like I don't know that.

472
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,162
There they are.

473
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:19,214
Did he pass Geumdang 8-gil?

474
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,050
No, I don't see him.

475
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,260
Not after Geumdang 4-gil.

476
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:25,512
Hang up.

477
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,849
Hello? Jung-moon.

478
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,771
GEUMDANG 8-GIL

479
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:43,112
The accomplice
is hiding within this block.

480
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,870
How do you know Mr. Choi in Singil-dong?

481
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:52,288
I just know him.

482
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,416
Does he still only sell burner phones?

483
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,460
In this bad economy,

484
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,838
you can't make money
by just digging one well.

485
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:03,967
You have to do
whatever you can get your hands on.

486
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:08,012
Goodness. Mr. Choi is such a square.

487
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,015
Hey, you. Take it easy.

488
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,142
Who is she?

489
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,857
Why? Are you interested?

490
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:24,529
Then I'll get you a different one.
She's gone stale.

491
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,114
So I'm going to sell her.

492
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,075
With a couple more,
I'll sell them off as a bundle.

493
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:31,661
You'll sell her?

494
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,000
-To whom?
-I'm just the seller.

495
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,418
You should ask the buyer.

496
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:42,046
If she's lucky,
she'll be sent to a small-town brothel.

497
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,341
If not, she'll be sent
to a brothel on some island.

498
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,385
If she's really out of luck...

499
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:51,806
You know how it goes.

500
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:53,725
Logs.

501
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,685
Organ trade.

502
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:02,233
Anyway, forget about her.
I'll get you a fresh one.

503
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:05,278
This building is filled with girls.

504
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,698
Nationality, age, body type.
Just tell me what you want.

505
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,241
I'll get you one right away.

506
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,620
For a hot, steamy night.

507
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,331
I know you want it.

508
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,843
It's a little shabby, but have a seat.

509
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,222
All right, let's find this guy.

510
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,935
Yang Shi-chul...

511
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,062
Oh, look. Here it is.

512
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,320
Stale?

513
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,113
Fresh?

514
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:52,492
Are they a piece of meat to you?

515
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,877
If you're human, have a heart.

516
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:04,796
Seriously.

517
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,177
I'll get this prick and come back for you.

518
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,766
See if you can locate these two numbers.

519
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,685
One is 010-3045...

520
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,520
Whose number is this?

521
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,021
It's Yang's burner phone.

522
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,901
This is Senior Inspector Yoo Mi-young.
Track the location of...

523
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,578
LAMB SKEWERS

524
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:38,788
Boss! No.

525
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:42,291
Even cops are too scared
to enter this area after 10 p.m.

526
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:46,796
I'm not a cop, so I'll be fine.
Don't be such a wimp.

527
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:51,467
I can't let you go.
If we cross anyone, they'll kill us.

528
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,261
Then what? Just let Chul-joo die?

529
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,724
Do you know why gangsters
are called scumbags these days?

530
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:02,603
It's because they've all become
spoiled cowards, you sissy.

531
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:05,523
We're born empty-handed
and die empty-handed.

532
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,066
Hey.

533
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,360
What are you doing here?

534
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,239
What brings you here?

535
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,324
What about you? What are you doing here?

536
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,412
I'm here to take care of something.
What about you?

537
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,914
Clearly, I'm not here
for some lamb skewers.

538
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,543
Looks like we're here for the same reason.

539
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,170
Hey, Woong-chul.

540
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,631
Do you know what could happen
if things went south here?

541
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,217
You could get killed.

542
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:36,471
We're all going to die anyway
and I don't want to die a coward.

543
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:40,725
Do you have verbal diarrhea?
What's with all this talk?

544
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:44,771
If you have too much to lose
and don't want to die, just get lost.

545
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,650
You're indebted to your parents
the moment you're born.

546
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,111
Then to the bank and your children.

547
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:57,116
We're all indebted for life anyway,
so I have nothing to lose either.

548
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,868
So? Are you coming?

549
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,913
Shall I lead the way?

550
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,956
I am a cop after all.

551
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:44,664
Are you worried now?

552
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:50,294
If worrying could solve my problems,
I'd never have to worry.

553
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:55,091
Then give me a minute.
Let me take care of my business.

554
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,641
Hey, come here.

555
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,017
Who are you?

556
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:08,896
Sit down.

557
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,942
Hey. Where's the guy you took earlier?

558
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,486
Answer me!

559
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,256
Just think about the money, nothing else.

560
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:38,134
-Sorry?
-How much is your wife's surgery?

561
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,761
Just under 50 million won.

562
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,850
The stomach is 10 million
and the intestines is 1.9 million.

563
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:49,687
Then it won't be enough.
I'll come back another time.

564
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,358
A kidney is 50 million won.

565
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:57,236
A liver is 100 million.
That's 150 million won.

566
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,655
Buy her something nice with the rest.

567
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:02,867
Do it.

568
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,998
You'll know once you open me up,
but I'm all rotten inside.

569
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:12,960
I drink and smoke a lot.
I'm all messed up inside.

570
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,421
Hey.

571
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:21,052
Why would you eat in a place like this?

572
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,970
Boss!

573
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,973
Why are you lying on that thing?
Are you getting a massage?

574
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:28,976
Who are you?

575
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,395
Do you know what this place is?

576
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,773
It's a bathhouse, you little prick.

577
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,524
Do you think this is some show?

578
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:38,319
You're the one that's putting on a show.

579
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:43,199
I've done lots of bad things myself,
but you really need a good beating.

580
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,951
You nasty bastards.

581
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:48,955
Watch your mouth, you bastard.
Boys, shut him up!

582
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,854
Come at me.
I'll kill you all. Bring it on!

583
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,073
Rhee Man-hak.

584
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:09,160
I heard all the harvests
in this area move through you.

585
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:12,246
If that thing explodes,
everyone here will die.

586
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,372
Do you realize that?

587
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,001
Of course, I know that.

588
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,838
Aren't you afraid of death?

589
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:32,099
Tell me what you want.

590
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:36,479
I'm looking for Yang Shi-chul.

591
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:52,953
Hey, what's up?

592
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:57,750
Mr. Rhee?

593
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,424
Okay, got it.

594
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,010
And the workshop?

595
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:12,306
All right.

596
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:18,187
I'll bring the product.
Tell Mr. Rhee to meet me there.

597
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:19,897
You should come too.

598
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:22,400
Sounds good.

599
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:24,693
See you in a bit.

600
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,865
We're about to begin.

601
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:33,536
We've already set it all up,
so come to the workshop.

602
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:38,207
You know our situation,
so I hope you understand.

603
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,835
The workshop is located...

604
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,545
You piece of trash.

605
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:45,297
If the product is not good,
you're dead meat.

606
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:46,215
I have to go.

607
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,009
What about the woman?

608
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,095
She's alive.

609
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:55,433
They'll begin the work soon,
but they want me to come to them.

610
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:56,517
Where?

611
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,060
The workshop.

612
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:00,521
Those without
their own workshops go there.

613
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,441
Where is it?

614
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:15,578
Who are you?

615
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,124
Where is Yang Shi-chul?

616
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,375
Who the heck are you?

617
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:26,380
I'll ask you once again.

618
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:29,467
Yang Shi-chul.

619
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:31,677
Where is he?

620
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:06,295
Is someone inside?

621
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,755
You got this guy killed.

622
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:51,632
Okay?

623
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,470
Why won't you listen to me?

624
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:01,141
I located the one ending with 8425.

625
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:02,518
Where?

626
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,729
Yang is within a 1 km radius
of Mt. Seongnyong in Gapyeong.

627
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:14,280
We must find Shin So-jung alive.
Stay focused.

628
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:23,956
Damn it. What is this now?

629
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,003
DO NOT ENTER

630
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:47,980
Hey, Ji-sook.

631
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:50,858
Did you eat?

632
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:58,324
Something came up,
so I'll be away for a little while.

633
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:02,244
Don't skip meals
just because I'm not around, okay?

634
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:13,172
Ji-sook, I'm sorry
I can't take better care of you.

635
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,593
I know.

636
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:19,637
I love you so much.

637
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,809
I'll call you in a bit.

638
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:54,755
Help me!

639
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:08,060
Why won't you listen to me?

640
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:35,629
Let's get started.

641
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,687
Come here, you psycho.

642
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:56,316
You crazy bastard. Get up.

643
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,485
You need a good beating. Get up.

644
00:53:58,569 --> 00:53:59,570
You piece of...

645
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,157
Does it hurt?

646
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,576
Don't even call yourself human.

647
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:08,203
Don't move.

648
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,838
You bastard.

649
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:18,964
Oh, no. It's broken.

650
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:28,390
You bastard.

651
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,605
You piece of trash.

652
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:43,238
How could you do such a thing?

653
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:46,033
You piece of trash. You deserve to die!

654
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:51,622
Bastard.

655
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,245
Damn it.

656
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:42,941
Hey.

657
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:51,617
I see that your left eye is fine.

658
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:54,202
I guess you could sell it

659
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:56,788
and make some money
when you get out of jail.

660
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,083
But you know what?

661
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:04,630
I can't let you do that, you bastard.

662
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:15,807
Captain Oh.

663
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,646
We trusted she was alive
and we really did find her alive.

664
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:09,027
Doesn't it feel nice
to have saved someone's life for once?

665
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,157
You crazy dogs...

666
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:18,704
True happiness is

667
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:24,001
when your happiness
makes others happy too.

668
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:27,212
That's what makes us human.

669
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:32,259
Remember this feeling
and engrave it on your hearts,

670
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:35,262
so you can become decent human beings.

671
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,895
Tae-su, this is the hospital
where she is at.

672
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:52,487
Go on.

673
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,872
-Wait up.
-Where are you going?

674
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:04,207
I've got to take a leak.

675
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:13,175
Will we be sent back to prison?

676
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,679
You're not going anywhere.

677
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,098
We're just getting started.

678
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,525
Four years plus five years. That's nine.

679
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:31,985
I still have 19 years left.

680
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:36,364
Still, the universe must be on my side.

681
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,039
Who are you guys?

682
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:04,518
BAD GUYS

683
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:08,605
You'll round up
the entire human trafficking syndicate?

684
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:09,689
Can you pull it off?

685
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:12,526
I assure you that I won't.

686
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:18,156
These bastards are the underbosses of the
human trafficking syndicate in Seoul.

687
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:22,106
I thought of a way
to round them up at once.

688
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:25,122
Madam Hwang. Where is she now?

689
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:26,581
How would I know?

690
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:27,612
I'll talk!

691
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:30,043
Let's go clean up this mess.

692
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:31,253
How may I help you?

693
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,255
I'm here to see Kyung-soon.

694
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:36,758
I'll go alone.
Detective Park, Detective Lee.

695
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:38,218
Sure, Detective Jung.

696
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,511
-We've been busted.
-What?

697
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:43,181
They're impersonating cops. Get them.

698
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:45,100
Who swings at cops with a knife?

699
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,233
They know we're lying.

700
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:50,605
Bring their corpses to me.

701
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:53,900
All right. Get started.

702
