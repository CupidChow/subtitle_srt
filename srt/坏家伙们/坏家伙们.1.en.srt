BAD GUYS
<i>[Episode 1]</i>

2
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,498
Look at you doing interviews. You made it.

3
00:00:21,582 --> 00:00:23,000
No, not at all.

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,334
Take care.

5
00:00:25,544 --> 00:00:27,004
Wait. Here.

6
00:00:27,546 --> 00:00:28,380
Right.

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,174
Hello, I'm Gun-wook Nam from Homicide
Team Two, at Dobok Police Station.

8
00:00:31,258 --> 00:00:32,718
I'm 34 years old.

9
00:00:33,927 --> 00:00:39,224
I'm in charge of almost all of
the major cases in Dobok-dong.

10
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,562
<i>Over a half a year ago,</i>

11
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:46,773
<i>a series of incidents have happened
in the Southeastern Seoul.</i>

12
00:00:47,065 --> 00:00:50,152
<i>The culprit picked any woman
on the street on a rainy day.</i>

13
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:54,948
We uncovered his criminal patterns,
and now we're on a stakeout.

14
00:00:55,032 --> 00:00:57,659
<i>It looks like a serial murder case.
Aren't you afraid?</i>

15
00:00:57,743 --> 00:00:59,745
Have you ever felt this way?

16
00:01:00,078 --> 00:01:02,664
I may not be able to see my family again,

17
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,750
even though I'm looking
at their faces right now.

18
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,585
Look over there.

19
00:01:09,212 --> 00:01:10,714
Isn't that a knife?

20
00:01:11,173 --> 00:01:12,299
Damn it.

21
00:01:14,384 --> 00:01:18,263
<i>When you become a detective
you encounter those criminals</i>

22
00:01:18,805 --> 00:01:21,475
who you need to catch
even if it costs your life.

23
00:01:21,725 --> 00:01:24,770
<i>He's not a just petty criminal.</i>

24
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:28,315
<i>My son's face I'm seeing now...</i>

25
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:30,734
<i>My wife's face...</i>

26
00:01:33,654 --> 00:01:35,364
I may not be able to see them again.

27
00:01:37,074 --> 00:01:38,325
Stop, you bastard!

28
00:01:43,747 --> 00:01:45,457
<i>Me and my co-workers,</i>

29
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,585
<i>cannot risk our lives while on duty.</i>

30
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,588
If we die,

31
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:55,550
who will protect our family?

32
00:02:00,138 --> 00:02:01,431
Who will?

33
00:02:27,457 --> 00:02:28,542
Detective Nam!

34
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:34,506
Detective Nam!

35
00:02:46,226 --> 00:02:48,353
<i>People are shocked over
the news of Detective Nam's Murder.</i>

36
00:02:48,437 --> 00:02:52,649
<i>He worked at Dobok Police Station
and was murdered while chasing a culprit.</i>

37
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:54,985
<i>He was always eager to catch criminals</i>

38
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:58,363
<i>and had a strong sense
of responsibility to keep the public safe.</i>

39
00:02:58,447 --> 00:03:02,075
<i>Many people from all walks of life
mourned his death.</i>

40
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,328
<i>They also called for countermeasures
against violent criminals</i>

41
00:03:05,412 --> 00:03:07,289
<i>who have developed
more intellectual offenses...</i>

42
00:03:14,504 --> 00:03:15,922
Grandpa.

43
00:03:23,597 --> 00:03:24,765
Min-joon.

44
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:27,601
Do not

45
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:31,772
follow in your father's footsteps.

46
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:36,359
Understood?

47
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:38,320
Yes.

48
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:03,845
Gu-tak Oh.

49
00:04:05,263 --> 00:04:06,431
Where is he now?

50
00:04:07,516 --> 00:04:10,060
Why are you looking
for that Mad Dog all of a sudden?

51
00:04:16,435 --> 00:04:21,478
BAD GUYS

52
00:04:25,784 --> 00:04:30,372
EPISODE 1

53
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:48,348
{\an8}<i>We learned a lesson from the murder case
of a Dobok police officer.</i>

54
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:51,059
{\an8}<i>We, the police, are too naive
and predictable</i>

55
00:04:51,351 --> 00:04:54,104
{\an8}<i>to cope with the crimes
of antisocial and psychopathic killers.</i>

56
00:04:54,354 --> 00:04:57,065
{\an8}<i>A hundred thousand police officers
choose their job</i>

57
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:00,777
{\an8}<i>not to serve 50 million citizens,
but to obtain their own job security.</i>

58
00:05:00,861 --> 00:05:03,446
{\an8}<i>They're no different from the rest
of the 50 million citizens.</i>

59
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,950
{\an8}<i>Unfortunately, this is
the reality of Korean police.</i>

60
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:08,326
{\an8}<i>Then, what should we do?</i>

61
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,036
{\an8}<i>You're saying you can't catch those</i>

62
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,622
<i>violent criminals
with your current forces, right?</i>

63
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:14,791
<i>What kind of a backup plan do you have?</i>

64
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:18,962
<i>We should stop our ordinary citizens
from suffering from violent crimes.</i>

65
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:20,964
<i>You're right.</i>

66
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:22,549
<i>You have a point.</i>

67
00:05:22,883 --> 00:05:24,926
<i>Please share your plan,
if you have any, Inspector Yoo.</i>

68
00:05:26,136 --> 00:05:27,220
<i>A plan...</i>

69
00:05:27,804 --> 00:05:29,639
<i>Speaking of a plan...</i>

70
00:05:37,022 --> 00:05:39,274
Hey, what are you up to these days?

71
00:05:46,615 --> 00:05:48,867
You should go easy on the alcohol.

72
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,119
You're not young anymore.

73
00:05:51,202 --> 00:05:52,954
You must take care of your health.

74
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:55,498
You should say that to your wife, not me.

75
00:05:59,336 --> 00:06:00,754
Why did you want to see me?

76
00:06:01,713 --> 00:06:02,547
You...

77
00:06:03,632 --> 00:06:05,050
Don't you want to get reinstated?

78
00:06:07,302 --> 00:06:10,305
Why are you looking for Mad Dog
out of the blue?

79
00:06:10,472 --> 00:06:13,058
You know my son, Gun-wook.

80
00:06:14,643 --> 00:06:15,477
What about him?

81
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:18,271
Did his wife run away?

82
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:21,358
Other kids always insist

83
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:24,444
they don't want to follow
in their father's footsteps.

84
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,238
But my Gun-wook was different.

85
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:32,118
"Like my father,
I want to become a great police officer."

86
00:06:44,172 --> 00:06:45,090
A few days ago,

87
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:47,258
he died.

88
00:06:49,594 --> 00:06:51,763
He was stabbed to death.

89
00:06:52,597 --> 00:06:54,557
He died earlier than me.

90
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:58,311
How can this happen...

91
00:06:59,062 --> 00:07:05,235
So, you want to release a mad dog like me
and make me fetch Gun-wook's killer.

92
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:06,945
Is that it?

93
00:07:08,113 --> 00:07:10,615
Fetch one

94
00:07:11,992 --> 00:07:13,076
that's still fresh and alive.

95
00:07:13,535 --> 00:07:14,369
Then, what?

96
00:07:15,161 --> 00:07:16,913
You want to skin him on your own?

97
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:24,004
You...

98
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:26,881
If you handle this case well enough,

99
00:07:27,549 --> 00:07:31,219
I'll help you work off the anger

100
00:07:31,303 --> 00:07:35,056
and grudge buried deep inside you.

101
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:43,064
Beating up an innocent guy is violence.

102
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,859
But beating up a bad guy is

103
00:07:46,985 --> 00:07:48,945
justice.

104
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:55,345
I heard Gu-tak Oh's nickname is Mad Dog.

105
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:59,307
He considers brutality
and violence essential for investigation.

106
00:08:59,516 --> 00:09:02,018
Whenever he believes
the suspect is an evil culprit,

107
00:09:02,102 --> 00:09:05,730
regardless of his rank and power,
regardless of whose side he is on,

108
00:09:06,606 --> 00:09:09,692
Gu-tak Oh bares his teeth
and tears him apart.

109
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:11,236
That's why he's called Mad Dog.

110
00:09:13,196 --> 00:09:16,116
Some police officers
took bribes from gangs,

111
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:19,911
but they had to quit their job
when Detective Oh tracked them down.

112
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:24,999
He's not a boy at puberty.

113
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,836
He can take care of his own business.

114
00:09:28,837 --> 00:09:31,589
Just sit tight. It won't take long.

115
00:09:59,868 --> 00:10:01,870
<i>If you handle this case well enough,</i>

116
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,539
<i>I'll help you work off the anger</i>

117
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:09,836
<i>and grudge buried deep inside you.</i>

118
00:10:17,093 --> 00:10:17,927
What?

119
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:20,096
-What?
-No, nothing.

120
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:22,765
No! Why are you doing this?

121
00:10:22,849 --> 00:10:25,810
<i>Beating up an innocent guy is violence.</i>

122
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:27,854
<i>But beating up a bad guy is</i>

123
00:10:28,313 --> 00:10:30,356
justice.

124
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:37,238
What? What's wrong?

125
00:10:37,322 --> 00:10:38,448
No, nothing.

126
00:10:39,824 --> 00:10:41,576
Why are you doing this?

127
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,745
No!

128
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:46,498
Do I have to beat you up?

129
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:51,336
Son of a bitch!

130
00:10:56,132 --> 00:10:57,383
Who are you, you bastard?

131
00:11:06,184 --> 00:11:09,729
Detective Oh, please stop.
You may kill him for real.

132
00:11:12,398 --> 00:11:13,316
All right.

133
00:11:20,365 --> 00:11:22,617
Let's prepare three more mad dogs.

134
00:11:41,552 --> 00:11:44,389
When Dongbang gang conquered Seoul
two years ago,

135
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:46,307
how many days do you think it took?

136
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:49,102
Twenty five days.

137
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:51,104
One district per day.

138
00:11:51,521 --> 00:11:54,482
They conquered all the way
from Guro to Nowon district.

139
00:11:58,361 --> 00:11:59,320
This guy led the gang.

140
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:00,738
Ong-chul Park.

141
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:05,785
<i>As soon as Dongbang Gang dominated Seoul,</i>

142
00:12:05,868 --> 00:12:08,329
<i>he got caught and was sentenced
to 28 years in prison.</i>

143
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:10,873
<i>He's now a prisoner
in Daejeon penitentiary.</i>

144
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,084
Who is it?

145
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:14,460
What?

146
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:16,629
Who painted your face black and blue?

147
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:19,632
<i>How is he doing?</i>

148
00:12:19,882 --> 00:12:21,342
Is he likely to regenerate himself?

149
00:12:23,928 --> 00:12:25,221
Regenerate himself?

150
00:12:25,972 --> 00:12:27,265
Are you daydreaming?

151
00:12:28,141 --> 00:12:29,142
Son of a bitch!

152
00:12:31,477 --> 00:12:32,478
Go!

153
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:44,324
Should I approve him?

154
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:46,826
Let me hear about the rest of them first.
Who is next?

155
00:12:48,745 --> 00:12:49,579
Tae-soo Jung.

156
00:12:49,662 --> 00:12:51,080
A hit man.

157
00:12:51,497 --> 00:12:53,541
<i>Tae-soo Jung is a hit man.</i>

158
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:57,378
<i>No one knows who, why, where
or how he kills.</i>

159
00:12:57,587 --> 00:12:58,963
<i>His background is also unknown.</i>

160
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,423
Then, how come he got caught?

161
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:02,508
-In one murder case...
-He turned himself in.

162
00:13:03,593 --> 00:13:05,595
<i>Wearing a shirt stained
with the victim's blood,</i>

163
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:07,764
<i>he walked into the police station
and turned himself in.</i>

164
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:10,808
<i>What a crazy bastard.</i>

165
00:13:12,435 --> 00:13:14,437
<i>He was sentenced to 22 years.</i>

166
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,105
<i>He's now imprisoned in
Jeonjoo penitentiary.</i>

167
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,732
Who is the last one?

168
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:20,068
You must be very familiar with him.

169
00:13:20,777 --> 00:13:23,321
The culprit of the Hwayeondong
incident two years ago.

170
00:13:24,697 --> 00:13:25,782
Jung-moon Lee?

171
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:29,535
<i>He had an IQ of 165
when he was 12 years old.</i>

172
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:32,121
<i>He was the youngest member
of Mensa in Korea.</i>

173
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:35,333
<i>He also earned the youngest title
of Ph.D. in philosophy and math.</i>

174
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:38,711
<i>Which of his titles
do you think is most shocking?</i>

175
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:42,215
The youngest serial killer.

176
00:13:43,508 --> 00:13:50,264
<i>From December 2011 to August 2012,
he killed 15 people in total.</i>

177
00:13:50,348 --> 00:13:52,433
<i>But when I investigated the crime scene,</i>

178
00:13:52,683 --> 00:13:56,938
<i>no fingerprints, no single hair strand,</i>

179
00:13:57,271 --> 00:14:00,274
<i>and of course, no footprints.</i>

180
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,027
<i>To put it in a nutshell,
there's no trace of Jung-moon Lee</i>

181
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:05,154
<i>at the murder scene at all.</i>

182
00:14:06,489 --> 00:14:08,700
Oh, there's only one thing.

183
00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:11,369
The victim's body.

184
00:14:11,703 --> 00:14:14,580
-Is he a psychopath?
-You know PCL-R?

185
00:14:14,706 --> 00:14:18,710
It's a psychopath test.
He scored 38 out of 40 points.

186
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:20,336
Why should we choose these people?

187
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,173
No, I should rather say these beasts.

188
00:14:24,257 --> 00:14:27,135
Ong-chul Park's power,
Tae-soo Jung's technique,

189
00:14:27,218 --> 00:14:28,761
and Jung-moon Lee's intelligence.

190
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:33,599
If we can make use of all these three,
no criminals can escape from us.

191
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:37,603
Beasts enjoy socializing with others.

192
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:39,522
They will obey my orders.

193
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:43,109
<i>I think this is too risky.</i>

194
00:14:44,068 --> 00:14:49,157
You also said on TV that we can't catch
those violent criminals effectively

195
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,075
with our current forces, right?

196
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:54,454
But I never implied we should take
this kind of measure.

197
00:14:55,413 --> 00:14:58,332
In order to catch beasts,
setting other beasts free is...

198
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,625
Get one of them for me.

199
00:15:11,637 --> 00:15:12,472
What?

200
00:15:13,765 --> 00:15:14,599
You think it's gross?

201
00:15:15,475 --> 00:15:16,309
What?

202
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,647
It looks gross.

203
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:24,108
So, you don't even want to touch it.

204
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:26,903
Since you don't want to touch it,
you can't put it on a hook.

205
00:15:27,653 --> 00:15:28,696
Is that right?

206
00:15:29,197 --> 00:15:30,865
I'm not sure what you're trying to say.

207
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:34,243
Without this bait, we can't catch fish.

208
00:15:36,788 --> 00:15:39,332
I'll take care of everything.

209
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:41,876
Let's just give it a try.

{\an8}PRISONER TRANSPORT

00:15:56,015 --> 00:15:56,849
{\an8}PRISONER TRANSPORT

214
00:16:17,286 --> 00:16:18,913
Where am I going?

215
00:16:19,997 --> 00:16:21,707
Aren't I supposed to be transferred?

216
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:24,794
Are you mute?

217
00:16:24,877 --> 00:16:27,463
You should answer when I'm asking, punk!

218
00:16:27,547 --> 00:16:30,132
I memorized your face. You are so dead.

219
00:16:50,903 --> 00:16:53,739
Why are you drinking without any snack?

220
00:16:55,116 --> 00:16:59,161
Chief told me that you're the fishhook,

221
00:16:59,495 --> 00:17:02,415
and Ong-chul Park, Tae-soo Jung,
Jung-moon Lee are worms.

222
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:08,004
He explained a simple thing in a hard way.

223
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:10,423
It probably means you should put
the worms on a hook well

224
00:17:10,506 --> 00:17:12,466
in order to catch fish.

225
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:19,265
Let's work hard together.

226
00:17:19,765 --> 00:17:22,184
What handshake? That's embarrassing.

227
00:17:22,268 --> 00:17:23,352
Forget about it.

228
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:29,358
What are you doing now?
Are you trying to take a nap?

229
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:30,568
Then, what else?

230
00:17:31,277 --> 00:17:33,696
Should I play with you until they arrive?

231
00:17:34,363 --> 00:17:35,907
Wake me up when they get here.

232
00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:40,119
Also, don't even expect me
to use honorifics with you,

233
00:17:40,202 --> 00:17:41,746
just because you're higher in rank.

234
00:17:41,913 --> 00:17:44,582
When those punks with higher ranks tried

235
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:47,460
to boss me around,
I showed them who's boss.

236
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,134
Change.

237
00:17:56,594 --> 00:17:58,012
Why are you giving me civilian clothes?

238
00:17:58,095 --> 00:17:59,805
Are you trying
to make me look like a civilian,

239
00:18:00,056 --> 00:18:01,515
so you can bury me somewhere in secret?

240
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:06,854
Hey, you bastard. I'm asking you
why you gave me these clothes!

241
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:08,314
It's your day off.

242
00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:11,567
What kind of a day off?
Am I a soldier or something?

243
00:18:11,651 --> 00:18:13,903
Just change your clothes, okay?

244
00:18:15,613 --> 00:18:16,781
I just asked out of curiosity.

245
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:18,616
Why are you so annoyed?

246
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:24,872
Don't be annoying to me.

247
00:18:24,956 --> 00:18:29,835
Even without you,
my life is already annoying enough.

248
00:18:31,671 --> 00:18:32,880
If you don't mind,

249
00:18:34,006 --> 00:18:35,466
let's both keep smiling.

250
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:41,097
Okay, then. I'll change my clothes.

251
00:18:49,105 --> 00:18:54,360
{\an8}PRISONER TRANSPORT
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

252
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:39,905
Who are you?

253
00:19:41,991 --> 00:19:42,825
Who are you?

254
00:19:44,493 --> 00:19:47,246
I asked you first, you little boy.

255
00:19:47,496 --> 00:19:49,040
Don't raise your hand at me.

256
00:19:49,832 --> 00:19:50,791
You may get killed.

257
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:51,917
You...

258
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,130
Look here. I raised my hands.
What can you do?

259
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,007
Do you want to get beaten up?

260
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:01,510
-How dare you...
-Stop.

261
00:20:13,939 --> 00:20:15,816
Well, who are you, Miss?

262
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,778
I'm not a Miss. I'm Mi-young Yoo.

263
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:19,987
I'm a police inspector.

264
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:22,698
Both of you will be under my supervision.

265
00:20:22,948 --> 00:20:25,785
I guess the other one is running late.
Let's start first.

266
00:20:26,535 --> 00:20:27,369
Please follow me.

267
00:20:28,454 --> 00:20:30,790
Is she being confident or rude?

268
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:32,374
Is she kidding me?

269
00:20:37,963 --> 00:20:38,964
Gosh.

270
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:23,592
Please make yourselves at home.

271
00:21:32,143 --> 00:21:33,352
Shall we begin?

272
00:21:34,478 --> 00:21:38,065
What you see here are the case materials
regarding the serial murders

273
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:40,067
in Southeastern Seoul since last December.

274
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:42,194
The number of victims is eight so far.

275
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,030
Please take your time
to read the materials.

276
00:21:47,283 --> 00:21:49,743
Why are you showing them to us?

277
00:21:49,827 --> 00:21:50,953
Why do you think I am?

278
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:53,455
Because we want you
to catch the serial killer.

279
00:21:55,332 --> 00:21:57,543
Oh, dear. I almost bursted into laughter.

280
00:21:57,626 --> 00:22:00,671
Are you kidding me, Miss?
Do you think your life is so boring?

281
00:22:02,715 --> 00:22:05,092
Everything looks easy
because you're high in rank, right?

282
00:22:05,176 --> 00:22:09,388
Hey, gangster. Sit down
if you don't want to get hurt.

283
00:22:11,015 --> 00:22:12,391
Come here, so I can understand.

284
00:22:12,474 --> 00:22:13,726
Let her finish first.

285
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,063
Stop acting stupid.

286
00:22:20,482 --> 00:22:23,527
Why does this son of a bitch
keep talking to me?

287
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:25,404
What are you babbling on about?
Your breath stinks!

288
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,209
Stop it!

289
00:22:40,753 --> 00:22:42,046
Stop what?

290
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,424
It's just getting interesting.

291
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:48,594
Please continue.

292
00:22:50,554 --> 00:22:52,348
While you continue, please listen.

293
00:22:52,431 --> 00:22:57,394
I was told that if any of you
catch that serial killer,

294
00:22:57,478 --> 00:22:59,480
you will have a five-year reduction
in sentence.

295
00:23:00,189 --> 00:23:02,024
You were going to tell them this, right?

296
00:23:02,316 --> 00:23:05,069
Then, you could have just spit it out.

297
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:08,447
They pretend not to listen,
but they actually do.

298
00:23:09,448 --> 00:23:10,783
Isn't it right?

299
00:23:10,866 --> 00:23:14,912
Still, not everyone can get
his sentence reduced.

300
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:17,081
Only the one who catches the culprit.

301
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:19,375
If Ong-chul Park catches the culprit,

302
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,502
nothing for Tae-soo Jung.

303
00:23:24,546 --> 00:23:27,299
You know, we're living
in a competitive capitalist society.

304
00:23:27,383 --> 00:23:30,469
Please understand. Any further questions?

305
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:32,888
No questions?

306
00:23:32,972 --> 00:23:35,724
Then, you can continue with
what you were doing.

307
00:23:37,893 --> 00:23:39,770
Who are you, mister?

308
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:43,649
Come on, I told you to continue with
what you were doing.

309
00:23:45,526 --> 00:23:46,860
I'll deal with you later.

310
00:23:47,736 --> 00:23:48,988
Who is this guy?

311
00:23:49,071 --> 00:23:52,700
He's Detective Gu-tak Oh,
who will also supervise you.

312
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:55,327
I see, he's a detective.

313
00:23:56,161 --> 00:23:58,455
Mister, what are you planning
to do with us again?

314
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:00,708
-Are you suffering from dementia?
-Dementia?

315
00:24:03,168 --> 00:24:04,670
That sounds great.

316
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:08,215
It's such a torture
to live your daily life

317
00:24:08,298 --> 00:24:10,092
remembering every detail so clearly.

318
00:24:10,926 --> 00:24:14,304
-Is what he said true?
-Yes.

319
00:24:14,388 --> 00:24:17,182
You're going to legally release us
until we catch that punk?

320
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:18,392
Yes, correct.

321
00:24:18,475 --> 00:24:21,478
Of course there are some conditions.

322
00:24:21,562 --> 00:24:22,646
What conditions?

323
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,025
Alcohol, women and driving are banned.

324
00:24:26,108 --> 00:24:28,527
Violence and weapons are also banned.

325
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,779
Banned, banned, banned.

326
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:32,781
Technically everything is banned.

327
00:24:36,201 --> 00:24:38,245
But you know what? Just do everything.

328
00:24:38,537 --> 00:24:41,040
How can a human survive
without drinking alcohol?

329
00:24:41,123 --> 00:24:42,166
Detective Oh.

330
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:45,753
But there's one thing
that you should agree upon.

331
00:24:46,211 --> 00:24:47,588
Even if you feel humiliated.

332
00:24:48,297 --> 00:24:49,339
Inspector Yoo.

333
00:25:00,517 --> 00:25:02,394
What is this? Is this a watch?

334
00:25:02,561 --> 00:25:04,021
We should be punctual, right?

335
00:25:04,354 --> 00:25:06,148
You're degrading me.

336
00:25:07,274 --> 00:25:08,650
You don't like a digital watch?

337
00:25:09,485 --> 00:25:12,112
-It's a digital ankle bracelet.
-A digital ankle bracelet?

338
00:25:12,196 --> 00:25:15,449
The one that sex offenders wear?

339
00:25:15,532 --> 00:25:17,743
This can't be. How dare you...

340
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:21,121
If anyone sees this on me,
they'll think I'm a rapist.

341
00:25:21,205 --> 00:25:24,041
You're in no position to be picky.

342
00:25:24,124 --> 00:25:27,377
You mean, we criminals are not allowed
to decline an unjust offer?

343
00:25:28,003 --> 00:25:30,255
Seriously, you're driving me crazy.

344
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:32,508
I can't accept that, either.

345
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:36,178
We also need human rights.

346
00:25:39,515 --> 00:25:40,682
"Condemn the sin,

347
00:25:41,183 --> 00:25:42,309
but not the sinner."

348
00:25:53,737 --> 00:25:56,281
The sinner is the one
who committed the sin.

349
00:25:56,365 --> 00:25:59,535
How would it be possible
not to condemn the sinner?

350
00:26:01,036 --> 00:26:04,581
Tae-soo Jung, your sin is murder.

351
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:08,293
That's why you're condemned.

352
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:12,047
Ong-chul Park, your sin is

353
00:26:12,131 --> 00:26:15,676
violence, kidnapping, confinement
and so on.

354
00:26:17,553 --> 00:26:20,222
That's why you're condemned.

355
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,812
You should claim human rights and what not
when you're released later.

356
00:26:26,895 --> 00:26:28,939
At this moment,
even if I fed you burnt rice,

357
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:33,944
you should eat it up, feeling thankful,
unless you want to starve yourself.

358
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:38,448
The way you talk is quite irritating.

359
00:26:39,074 --> 00:26:39,908
Mister!

360
00:26:41,493 --> 00:26:43,203
Mister, what are you?

361
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:47,166
I'm using honorifics
and treating you quite well

362
00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:49,626
which, by the way, I'm not cut out for.

363
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:54,464
But, if you behave like this,
you'll be in trouble.

364
00:26:54,548 --> 00:26:56,592
Do you want to die?

365
00:26:56,675 --> 00:26:58,677
Ong-chul Park, you son of a bitch.

366
00:26:59,636 --> 00:27:02,347
If you can't bite, don't dare to bark.

367
00:27:02,764 --> 00:27:05,100
You may end up getting bitten and dead.

368
00:27:13,317 --> 00:27:14,610
Seriously...

369
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:18,614
Who the hell are you people?

370
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:20,449
Stop here.

371
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:27,122
Okay.

372
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:30,667
Detective Oh.

373
00:27:37,592 --> 00:27:38,510
Officer.

374
00:27:40,011 --> 00:27:41,012
What?

375
00:27:48,228 --> 00:27:49,145
Hurry up.

376
00:28:14,963 --> 00:28:17,299
Come on, seriously...

377
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:51,041
<i>That's what happened.</i>

378
00:28:55,629 --> 00:28:58,381
Gosh, seems like you had a hard time.

379
00:28:59,257 --> 00:29:02,427
Didn't he take any money from you?

380
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,304
-No.
-You're not hurt, right?

381
00:29:04,387 --> 00:29:07,557
My well-being doesn't matter much.
I'm sorry that punk got away...

382
00:29:08,141 --> 00:29:10,852
-Your shoulder looks seriously hurt.
-I'm ashamed.

383
00:29:10,935 --> 00:29:13,021
You should get treatment
as soon as possible.

384
00:29:13,104 --> 00:29:15,482
-I'm fine.
-No, you're not.

385
00:29:15,565 --> 00:29:17,984
You look hurt. Why don't you take a look?

386
00:29:26,284 --> 00:29:29,204
If you leave your injury untreated,
you'll suffer from aftereffects.

387
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:35,752
The wound here. Is it because of a blow?

388
00:29:36,086 --> 00:29:37,545
Yes, probably.

389
00:29:37,629 --> 00:29:41,591
If you take a blow,
you usually don't get a cut,

390
00:29:41,675 --> 00:29:43,385
but your skin pops open.

391
00:29:44,177 --> 00:29:45,595
Why did you get a cut?

392
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,181
You said he hit you with the toilet lid.

393
00:29:48,264 --> 00:29:49,641
Then, why is your head intact?

394
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:53,812
Is your head

395
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,190
made of diamond?

396
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,241
You punk. How much salary do you receive?

397
00:30:06,324 --> 00:30:09,494
Three or four million won
a month based on your experience?

398
00:30:09,994 --> 00:30:12,914
Jin-sook's mom, who lives downstairs,
runs a corner shop.

399
00:30:12,997 --> 00:30:15,834
Jong-min's dad, who lives upstairs,
runs a laundry shop.

400
00:30:15,917 --> 00:30:18,420
Hae-nam's uncle, who lives next door,
runs an Internet cafe.

401
00:30:19,045 --> 00:30:21,256
They all pay taxes.

402
00:30:21,756 --> 00:30:24,634
Your salary comes from the taxes they pay.

403
00:30:25,176 --> 00:30:28,972
If you're living off their money,
eating, drinking, and buying your clothes,

404
00:30:29,055 --> 00:30:31,516
you should not lie, at least.

405
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,727
Isn't that common courtesy
for our citizens?

406
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,770
I didn't lie.

407
00:30:35,854 --> 00:30:39,232
Your whole body is telling a lie,
but your damn mouth in denying it?

408
00:30:40,442 --> 00:30:41,735
Which one is wrong, then?

409
00:30:41,818 --> 00:30:44,195
-His mouth is wrong.
-I know.

410
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:45,655
His mouth is wrong.

411
00:30:46,114 --> 00:30:48,783
Then all I need to do
is get rid of his mouth.

412
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:52,787
I can catch him
only if you tell me the truth,

413
00:30:53,496 --> 00:30:55,582
How did Jung-moon Lee escape?

414
00:30:58,168 --> 00:30:59,878
This guy says he's going
to confess everything.

415
00:31:04,507 --> 00:31:05,508
He's going to tell.

416
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:08,219
All of a sudden, he started to beat me up.

417
00:31:08,303 --> 00:31:09,888
I had no other choice.

418
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:13,099
When did I beat you up?
I was just playing with you.

419
00:31:13,183 --> 00:31:14,684
Oh, here's your cap.

420
00:31:14,768 --> 00:31:16,144
Now tell us.

421
00:31:16,227 --> 00:31:18,938
How did Jung-moon escape?

422
00:31:19,022 --> 00:31:22,984
He said he wanted to go to the restroom,
so we stopped here.

423
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:26,362
-I'll go buy some cigarettes.
-Okay.

424
00:31:32,327 --> 00:31:33,328
Do your business.

425
00:31:36,956 --> 00:31:39,083
Number two? Come on.

426
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:43,338
We don't have much time. Hurry up.

427
00:31:50,637 --> 00:31:51,513
Scream.

428
00:31:52,472 --> 00:31:53,431
What?

429
00:31:54,891 --> 00:31:55,892
Scream out.

430
00:32:16,579 --> 00:32:18,498
Are you okay? Where did he go?

431
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,694
The key.

432
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:06,045
It's been exactly two hours
since Jung-moon Lee took flight.

433
00:33:06,796 --> 00:33:08,131
He could be anywhere in this country.

434
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:11,301
If we don't catch him right now,
we'll be in trouble.

435
00:33:11,384 --> 00:33:12,594
We didn't agree to join you yet.

436
00:33:13,469 --> 00:33:16,097
Why are you giving us orders?
That pissing me off.

437
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,015
We?

438
00:33:18,141 --> 00:33:19,893
What? Are you're in or not?

439
00:33:19,976 --> 00:33:21,019
How long were you sentenced?

440
00:33:22,687 --> 00:33:23,813
Twenty eight years.

441
00:33:24,105 --> 00:33:26,107
You don't want to waste
your whole life in jail, right?

442
00:33:26,691 --> 00:33:29,861
Then, catch Jung-moon Lee
even if it means risking your life.

443
00:33:31,154 --> 00:33:33,531
Is your offer still valid?

444
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,826
We'll reduce four years
for the one who catches him.

445
00:33:39,162 --> 00:33:40,330
Okay, I got it.

446
00:33:40,788 --> 00:33:42,999
Still, it's way too embarrassing
to wear this.

447
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,250
Give it to me.

448
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:47,462
If I wear this,
can I legally beat up people?

449
00:33:47,545 --> 00:33:48,755
As long as you don't kill them.

450
00:33:49,297 --> 00:33:50,548
I can't guarantee that.

451
00:33:51,507 --> 00:33:54,010
Consider this as a warm-up
before it gets real.

452
00:33:57,221 --> 00:33:58,890
Can you catch Jung-moon Lee?

453
00:33:59,807 --> 00:34:01,059
Thanks for the sentence reduction.

454
00:34:21,037 --> 00:34:22,789
<i>I'm pretty sure</i>

455
00:34:23,289 --> 00:34:27,043
that Jung-moon Lee went looking
for this girl, Yu-jin Yang.

456
00:34:27,293 --> 00:34:30,672
She could be his last victim.

457
00:34:30,755 --> 00:34:34,384
She gave a critical testimony against him,
resulting in his life sentence.

458
00:34:34,467 --> 00:34:37,220
She is the one that Jung-moon Lee loved.

459
00:34:38,638 --> 00:34:39,472
Wait for me.

460
00:34:52,902 --> 00:34:55,029
Is this Jung-moon Lee?

461
00:34:55,113 --> 00:34:56,781
Why? Does he look familiar?

462
00:34:56,864 --> 00:34:58,700
So, where is this girl now?

463
00:34:58,783 --> 00:34:59,826
I don't know.

464
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:03,496
As soon as Jung-moon Lee's sentence
was confirmed, she disappeared.

465
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:08,751
But I know someone
who may know her whereabouts.

466
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:16,801
{\an8}KOREA TAE KWON DO

467
00:35:17,176 --> 00:35:19,929
Hey, you should finish within an hour.

468
00:35:20,013 --> 00:35:21,014
Can you do that?

469
00:35:21,681 --> 00:35:25,059
I'll take care of everything.
You just handle the aftermath.

470
00:35:25,143 --> 00:35:27,186
Things tend to end up messy
when I get involved.

471
00:35:30,356 --> 00:35:33,276
Are you sure Jung-moon Lee
is really looking for Yu-jin Yang?

472
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:37,822
How come you know so much about his case?

473
00:35:39,282 --> 00:35:41,325
Is there anything
that you're hiding from me?

474
00:35:44,662 --> 00:35:46,289
Ong-chul Park and Tae-soo Jung.

475
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:48,666
Can we trust them?

476
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:51,169
In order to live
like a decent human being,

477
00:35:51,252 --> 00:35:53,463
what do you think is the most essential?

478
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:54,922
Desperation.

479
00:35:55,423 --> 00:35:58,259
It's hard to find someone
as desperate as them.

480
00:35:59,927 --> 00:36:00,845
Trust them.

481
00:36:00,928 --> 00:36:04,348
Are you sure they're ready
to become a decent human being?

482
00:36:07,268 --> 00:36:09,479
If you break the ankle bracelet,
you can run away.

483
00:36:10,146 --> 00:36:11,189
Need some help?

484
00:36:11,522 --> 00:36:14,525
We're live in such a small country.
Even if I run away, I can't go far.

485
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:17,028
I'll solve this case
and receive a sentence reduction.

486
00:36:22,408 --> 00:36:23,993
Me? Or you?

487
00:36:24,077 --> 00:36:25,119
Me.

488
00:36:27,955 --> 00:36:29,499
We're closed today.

489
00:36:32,251 --> 00:36:33,211
What the hell?

490
00:36:36,756 --> 00:36:39,092
Where is Sung-beom Ma? I need to see him.

491
00:36:49,393 --> 00:36:52,021
Gosh, you're drinking in daytime.

492
00:36:55,274 --> 00:36:57,151
What are you staring at?

493
00:36:58,694 --> 00:37:00,905
The girl who worked here two years ago.

494
00:37:00,988 --> 00:37:03,324
Her name is Yang...

495
00:37:04,325 --> 00:37:05,326
What's her name again?

496
00:37:06,244 --> 00:37:07,328
Yu-jin Yang.

497
00:37:07,703 --> 00:37:09,997
Oh, right. Yu-jin Yang. Where is she?

498
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,707
Are you the police?

499
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:13,042
I don't like the police, either.

500
00:37:30,935 --> 00:37:33,479
-Me?
-No, me.

501
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:41,070
We came to find someone.

502
00:37:41,988 --> 00:37:43,156
You know Yu-jin Yang, right?

503
00:37:44,198 --> 00:37:46,450
Mr. Ma said you took her away.

504
00:37:47,118 --> 00:37:49,162
You were going to sell her off
because she owed you.

505
00:37:50,204 --> 00:37:51,205
Hey.

506
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,126
Who are you?

507
00:38:54,352 --> 00:38:55,519
I won't ask you again.

508
00:38:57,855 --> 00:38:59,106
Where is Yu-jin Yang?

509
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:07,073
Fifty-two minutes.

510
00:39:08,491 --> 00:39:10,117
Where is Yu-jin Yang?

511
00:39:10,701 --> 00:39:13,120
She was sold off far, far away.

512
00:39:13,204 --> 00:39:14,997
I'm not sure at how much she was traded.

513
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:18,876
You know, she's like Chun-hyang
from the fairytale.

514
00:39:20,086 --> 00:39:21,379
No, was that Sim-cheong?

515
00:39:22,046 --> 00:39:24,507
The one who had to trade herself for rice.

516
00:39:25,591 --> 00:39:28,719
So where? Where is she now?

517
00:39:32,181 --> 00:39:33,641
BUSAN STATION

518
00:39:45,945 --> 00:39:46,988
To Yeonsan-dong.

519
00:39:51,033 --> 00:39:53,119
Hey, is this Baljjong?

520
00:39:53,202 --> 00:39:55,079
This is Ong-chul, you know.

521
00:39:55,162 --> 00:39:58,582
Ong-chul Park, you silly boy.
Who's Ong-chul Kim?

522
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:00,251
You're right.

523
00:40:00,751 --> 00:40:02,712
No, I'm not discharged from prison yet.

524
00:40:02,795 --> 00:40:05,089
I'm still in prison. Right. In prison.

525
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:08,592
But it's kind of hard
to explain my situation.

526
00:40:08,676 --> 00:40:10,928
You're still living in Busan, right?

527
00:40:11,012 --> 00:40:14,098
Are you still familiar with hostess girls?

528
00:40:24,984 --> 00:40:25,985
<i>Oh, you found her?</i>

529
00:40:26,777 --> 00:40:27,778
Write it down.

530
00:40:28,821 --> 00:40:32,533
Room 203, Hana apartment, Yeonsan-dong.

531
00:40:32,616 --> 00:40:33,617
Her phone number, hurry!

532
00:40:42,376 --> 00:40:43,544
Who is it?

533
00:40:46,213 --> 00:40:47,214
Here it is.

534
00:40:54,513 --> 00:40:55,639
Who is it?

535
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,558
<i>I'm here to read the gas meter.</i>

536
00:40:58,267 --> 00:40:59,435
Gas?

537
00:41:06,442 --> 00:41:07,401
INCOMING CALL

538
00:41:12,782 --> 00:41:14,408
INCOMING CALL

539
00:41:20,414 --> 00:41:21,415
Hello.

540
00:41:21,499 --> 00:41:23,501
-Is this Ms. Yu-jin Yang?
-Yes.

541
00:41:24,502 --> 00:41:26,754
<i>I'm Inspector Mi-young Yoo
from Seoul Metro Police Agency.</i>

542
00:41:27,421 --> 00:41:28,589
<i>You know Jung-moon Lee, right?</i>

543
00:41:31,133 --> 00:41:32,259
Jung-moon Lee is...

544
00:41:34,595 --> 00:41:36,764
<i>Hello? Ms. Yang?</i>

545
00:41:36,847 --> 00:41:40,267
<i>Jung-moon Lee is coming to you now.
Are you listening?</i>

546
00:41:40,351 --> 00:41:42,478
<i>Ms. Yang? Hello?</i>

547
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:46,107
It's been a long time.

548
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:52,196
<i>Hello? Ms. Yang?</i>

549
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:53,280
<i>Hello?</i>

550
00:41:55,783 --> 00:41:56,700
Hello?

551
00:41:56,909 --> 00:41:57,785
Hello?

552
00:41:57,868 --> 00:42:00,037
Ms. Yang!

553
00:42:13,968 --> 00:42:15,511
How...

554
00:42:15,594 --> 00:42:17,346
How did you know?

555
00:42:18,013 --> 00:42:19,890
How did you know I was here?

556
00:42:22,435 --> 00:42:23,394
Do you

557
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:26,856
feel sorry for me?

558
00:42:29,066 --> 00:42:29,900
Why?

559
00:42:30,609 --> 00:42:31,444
Should I?

560
00:42:32,987 --> 00:42:34,655
Why should I feel sorry for you?

561
00:42:35,072 --> 00:42:36,740
The detective

562
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,326
who was in charge of my case

563
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:43,080
told me that you feel sorry for me.

564
00:42:45,332 --> 00:42:46,167
Why?

565
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:48,210
Why are you feeling sorry for me?

566
00:42:48,294 --> 00:42:50,045
I don't feel sorry for you at all.

567
00:42:50,838 --> 00:42:54,216
Don't you remember? You tried to kill me.

568
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:57,011
Why should I feel sorry for someone
who tried to kill me?

569
00:43:08,606 --> 00:43:09,440
I have...

570
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:13,402
no memory...

571
00:43:15,237 --> 00:43:16,363
of trying to kill you.

572
00:43:19,783 --> 00:43:22,328
KOREA TAE KWON DO

573
00:43:32,838 --> 00:43:34,173
HANA APARTMENT

574
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,008
It must be that building.

575
00:43:36,383 --> 00:43:37,676
Who will catch him first?

576
00:43:38,677 --> 00:43:39,595
It's not you.

577
00:43:40,095 --> 00:43:41,889
If it's not me, it won't be you either.

578
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:43,849
-Shall we move?
-Let's go.

579
00:44:11,252 --> 00:44:12,336
You punk.

580
00:44:13,754 --> 00:44:15,548
Let me catch that bastard, huh?

581
00:44:15,965 --> 00:44:17,925
-Go for it!
-Goodness.

582
00:44:18,217 --> 00:44:19,468
What the hell are you doing?

583
00:44:26,392 --> 00:44:27,518
Jung-moon Lee?

584
00:44:33,148 --> 00:44:34,483
Did you get your face tanned?

585
00:44:41,407 --> 00:44:42,700
He looks quite tanned.

586
00:44:44,034 --> 00:44:45,035
Did I

587
00:44:45,828 --> 00:44:47,162
really try to kill you?

588
00:44:48,122 --> 00:44:50,040
What about those countless people
that you've killed?

589
00:44:52,543 --> 00:44:54,253
Do you remember killing them?

590
00:44:57,339 --> 00:44:59,925
You killed all of them, right?

591
00:45:02,845 --> 00:45:05,347
What? You killed them!

592
00:45:06,056 --> 00:45:08,559
These are all the people
you've killed, you bastard.

593
00:45:10,311 --> 00:45:11,895
I'm telling you one more time.

594
00:45:13,647 --> 00:45:14,481
I really...

595
00:45:20,404 --> 00:45:21,780
don't remember anything.

596
00:45:25,617 --> 00:45:26,660
I didn't kill them.

597
00:45:26,744 --> 00:45:30,331
That's why you're crazy, you psychopath!

598
00:45:30,706 --> 00:45:31,665
Trust me.

599
00:45:33,459 --> 00:45:35,127
I didn't kill anyone, Yu-jin.

600
00:45:36,795 --> 00:45:37,838
Yes, you did.

601
00:45:40,382 --> 00:45:41,383
I saw your face...

602
00:45:44,595 --> 00:45:45,721
that time.

603
00:45:47,806 --> 00:45:49,141
I sensed everything.

604
00:45:52,144 --> 00:45:53,062
Yu-jin.

605
00:45:55,105 --> 00:45:56,523
Happy is dead.

606
00:45:59,568 --> 00:46:00,736
You know what, Yu-jin?

607
00:46:05,449 --> 00:46:06,742
I'm so sad.

608
00:46:10,162 --> 00:46:11,413
<i>You told me that</i>

609
00:46:12,164 --> 00:46:14,291
ever since you saw your parents die,

610
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:17,252
you often don't remember things
that even happened an hour ago.

611
00:46:17,878 --> 00:46:21,048
Your doctor also said that
it might be caused by the shock.

612
00:46:21,465 --> 00:46:23,842
While you had no memory
of what you were doing,

613
00:46:23,926 --> 00:46:26,512
you were on a killing spree, you know?

614
00:46:29,223 --> 00:46:31,433
-No.
-Yes. I'm right.

615
00:46:31,934 --> 00:46:35,562
You're the one who killed them.
You're the one who tried to kill me.

616
00:46:35,646 --> 00:46:36,939
You! Jung-moon Lee!

617
00:46:39,483 --> 00:46:43,153
Aren't you the one
who killed your own parents?

618
00:46:44,905 --> 00:46:45,989
You killed them

619
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:47,783
but pretended not to remember it.

620
00:47:25,529 --> 00:47:26,488
I didn't kill them.

621
00:47:39,543 --> 00:47:40,419
That son of a bitch

622
00:47:40,836 --> 00:47:42,838
confused Hana studio apartment
with Hana apartment.

623
00:47:42,921 --> 00:47:44,548
Keep running!

624
00:47:44,631 --> 00:47:45,466
Damn it.

625
00:47:45,841 --> 00:47:47,134
I will kill him.

626
00:47:49,803 --> 00:47:53,056
It's because I got a cramp in my leg.

627
00:47:55,726 --> 00:47:57,728
Remember this clearly.

628
00:47:58,228 --> 00:48:00,230
Never forget

629
00:48:00,772 --> 00:48:02,608
that you killed me.

630
00:48:03,484 --> 00:48:04,526
Do you understand?

631
00:48:13,577 --> 00:48:14,828
-Here it is.
-Wait.

632
00:48:15,704 --> 00:48:16,622
Right.

633
00:48:18,373 --> 00:48:19,249
Let's die together.

634
00:48:29,676 --> 00:48:31,678
Jung-moon!

635
00:48:32,638 --> 00:48:34,431
Where are you?

636
00:48:35,224 --> 00:48:37,976
I'm looking for you!

637
00:48:38,977 --> 00:48:40,354
<i>You should answer me,</i>

638
00:48:40,437 --> 00:48:42,147
you bastard.

639
00:48:42,231 --> 00:48:43,732
What are you doing now?

640
00:48:44,942 --> 00:48:49,112
What if the hostage dies
while we're waiting to arrest the suspect?

641
00:48:49,196 --> 00:48:50,906
We need to save the hostage first.

642
00:48:59,581 --> 00:49:01,959
Hey buddy.

643
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:03,752
There you are.

644
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:07,881
What? Are you going to kill her?

645
00:49:08,674 --> 00:49:11,093
If you try to kill her,
you'll be in big trouble.

646
00:49:14,429 --> 00:49:17,349
If you get shot,
it will hurt you pretty badly.

647
00:49:19,309 --> 00:49:21,645
Do you want to the hard way
or the easy way?

648
00:49:33,198 --> 00:49:34,032
Okay, then.

649
00:49:34,866 --> 00:49:36,034
The hard way it is.

650
00:49:39,871 --> 00:49:40,872
Detective Oh!

651
00:49:57,472 --> 00:49:59,850
Ong-chul, that's Jung-moon Lee.

652
00:50:03,729 --> 00:50:04,688
Are you okay?

653
00:50:29,921 --> 00:50:31,298
What the...

654
00:50:32,591 --> 00:50:33,508
My car!

655
00:52:03,056 --> 00:52:04,266
Nice to meet you, Jung-moon.

656
00:52:23,034 --> 00:52:25,495
Don't hold a grudge against me
because of the shot earlier.

657
00:52:25,871 --> 00:52:27,497
The situation was bad.

658
00:52:27,998 --> 00:52:29,583
I had to pull the trigger.

659
00:52:34,212 --> 00:52:35,255
Jung-moon.

660
00:52:36,757 --> 00:52:39,676
Don't attempt to pump out water
in a flooded area.

661
00:52:40,177 --> 00:52:41,678
You'd better swim instead.

662
00:52:42,387 --> 00:52:44,639
You're more likely to survive that way.

663
00:52:45,515 --> 00:52:47,392
Get more details from that Inspector Yoo.

664
00:52:47,809 --> 00:52:49,978
If you want to be a part of our team,
join us at the pub.

665
00:53:04,075 --> 00:53:07,579
I insisted we should send
you back to jail.

666
00:53:08,413 --> 00:53:11,208
But Detective Oh said we need you.

667
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:13,168
I don't know why.

668
00:53:13,877 --> 00:53:15,629
So, let me ask you again.

669
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:19,800
Don't you want to live
like a decent human being?

670
00:53:28,361 --> 00:53:29,904
I was running frantically.

671
00:53:29,988 --> 00:53:32,448
Then, that bastard fell from the sky.
Right in front of me.

672
00:53:32,532 --> 00:53:35,994
He fell from the sky,
like Jack and the Beansprout.

673
00:53:36,077 --> 00:53:37,996
-Jack and the Beanstalk.
-Beanstalk?

674
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:40,707
Are you sure? Beanstalk?

675
00:53:41,124 --> 00:53:43,960
-I'm sure it's the beansprout.
-It's the beanstalk.

676
00:53:44,043 --> 00:53:46,212
How ignorant you are.
You're so uneducated.

677
00:53:47,046 --> 00:53:48,172
Seriously.

678
00:53:48,256 --> 00:53:49,841
Are you already finished?

679
00:54:16,451 --> 00:54:17,285
Sit.

680
00:54:21,914 --> 00:54:23,833
I hope you can catch
the criminal next time.

681
00:54:23,916 --> 00:54:25,084
Of course.

682
00:54:27,837 --> 00:54:30,631
You must feel great.

683
00:54:36,596 --> 00:54:38,765
What? Are you leaving me out
because I'm a woman?

684
00:54:44,937 --> 00:54:45,897
Let's work hard.

685
00:54:47,815 --> 00:54:49,484
From now on, we're on the same team.

686
00:54:49,942 --> 00:54:52,320
Teamwork?
I don't expect such a thing from you.

687
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:53,863
Care for teammates?

688
00:54:54,697 --> 00:54:55,698
That's bullshit.

689
00:54:56,532 --> 00:54:58,451
What I want from you is only one thing.

690
00:54:59,035 --> 00:55:01,370
Those villains who refuse
to live like a decent human being,

691
00:55:02,455 --> 00:55:05,708
attack and rip them to pieces like dogs.

692
00:55:08,503 --> 00:55:10,963
Don't you know why we,
mad dogs, are scary?

693
00:55:13,341 --> 00:55:15,134
Once bitten by us, they'll die.

694
00:55:27,271 --> 00:55:28,356
Let's drink.

695
00:55:28,439 --> 00:55:29,649
Let's drink today.

696
00:55:30,066 --> 00:55:33,486
From tomorrow, we should find
and knock down that beast,

697
00:55:33,945 --> 00:55:35,446
who's been killing so many women around.

698
00:55:36,948 --> 00:55:37,782
Got it?

699
00:55:38,533 --> 00:55:39,367
Let's do that.

700
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,832
<i>Why did you accept this project?</i>

701
00:55:46,582 --> 00:55:48,793
<i>Ong-chul Park, Tae-soo Jung,
and Jung-moon Lee.</i>

702
00:55:48,876 --> 00:55:50,586
<i>Why did you pick those three?</i>

703
00:55:52,046 --> 00:55:55,424
I did some research
before I started to work with you,

704
00:55:55,967 --> 00:55:57,426
and I found something interesting.

705
00:55:58,302 --> 00:56:01,055
They all went to jail
around the same time.

706
00:56:01,139 --> 00:56:03,266
Ong-chul Park in June 2012,

707
00:56:03,349 --> 00:56:06,227
Tae-soo Jung in July 2012,
and Jung-moon Lee in September 2012.

708
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:07,311
And one more thing.

709
00:56:07,687 --> 00:56:10,731
You were suspended from your job

712
00:56:52,064 --> 00:56:54,400
<i>Does that woman matter that much?</i>

713
00:56:54,483 --> 00:56:56,652
-Are you okay?
<i>-You killed me.</i>

714
00:56:56,736 --> 00:56:57,862
And the woman saved me.

715
00:56:57,945 --> 00:56:59,947
<i>What is the reason
the culprit murder people?</i>

716
00:57:00,615 --> 00:57:01,699
<i>Smell of blood.</i>

717
00:57:01,782 --> 00:57:04,035
Help me! My mom...

718
00:57:04,118 --> 00:57:05,703
This is not the first time, is it?

719
00:57:05,786 --> 00:57:07,788
<i>If I want to beat his record,</i>

720
00:57:07,872 --> 00:57:09,874
<i>I need to kill as many
as possible at once.</i>

721
00:57:09,957 --> 00:57:13,127
<i>Rainy days, smell of blood,
and compulsive crimes.</i>

722
00:57:13,211 --> 00:57:16,214
He's targeting the survivors
from the hidden murder cases.

723
00:57:16,297 --> 00:57:18,090
What is this a funeral?
Why is everyone so gloomy?

724
00:57:18,424 --> 00:57:19,967
<i>Aren't you going to catch him?</i>

725
00:57:21,511 --> 00:57:23,387
<i>Blood. He'll beat the record
if he kills one more.</i>

726
00:57:23,471 --> 00:57:24,972
And we have one survivor left.

727
00:57:25,056 --> 00:57:28,684
<i>You should protect her on your own.
Stop trying to hide yourself out of fear.</i>

728
00:57:28,768 --> 00:57:30,228
<i>I wish I could.</i>

729
00:57:30,686 --> 00:57:32,480
<i>Where did he go?</i>

730
00:57:32,563 --> 00:57:34,232
I'll definitely catch that culprit.
