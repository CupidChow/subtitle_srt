00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,796
BAD GUYS

2
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,657
BAD GUYS

3
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:56,306
The person who killed your daughter
was Jung-moon, wasn't it?

4
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,310
I must say, you're really something.

5
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,940
How could you get him out
and have him join the team?

6
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,695
I know everything now.

7
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,741
Your daughter was the last victim
of the Hwayeon-dong case.

8
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:19,496
And I know what you did to Jung-moon.

9
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,125
Woong-chul, Tae-su, Jung-moon.

10
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,377
I know why you got the three of them out

11
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,256
and how their pasts

12
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,425
intertwine with yours.

13
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,218
I know everything now.

14
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,388
But let me ask you one thing, Captain Oh.

15
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,976
The past is past.
The present is what matters.

16
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,648
The person who contacted
Lee Du-kwang and ordered him

17
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,817
to get Woong-chul to kill Jung-moon.

18
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:52,237
Get rid of Lee Jung-moon.

19
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,032
The person who approached Kim Do-sik

20
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,744
in an attempt to get Tae-su
to take out Jung-moon.

21
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,415
The plan was to get
either Woong-chul or Tae-su

22
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,043
to kill Jung-moon.
But when the plan failed,

23
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:11,089
this person gave orders to get rid
of Woong-chul and Tae-su as well

24
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,507
after killing Jung-moon.

25
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,762
If you refuse to take on the job,

26
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,264
then you're out as well.

27
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:25,437
The person behind all the unsavory events
that we had to deal with recently.

28
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,396
Are you...

29
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,484
that person, Captain Oh?

30
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:35,906
Answer me at once.

31
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,866
Oh Gu-tak.

32
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,702
Was it you?

33
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,848
Yes, that's right.

34
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,226
It was all me.

35
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,272
Is this the answer you want?

36
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,191
Captain Oh.

37
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,027
You said you found out
what happened two years ago.

38
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:17,572
That's right.

39
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,992
That did happen two years ago,

40
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,037
and that's why I got them out.

41
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,748
How...

42
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,752
How did you end up in this mess?

43
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,800
Did the things that happened two years ago
mess you up like this?

44
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:49,771
TROPICAL NIGHT

45
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,734
Gangseo Station's...

46
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,575
Hold on.

47
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:56,570
2 YEARS AGO

48
00:03:56,692 --> 00:03:59,322
Did that sound okay?

49
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:00,866
Okay.

50
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,201
I thought the "S" sounded funny.

51
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,411
EPISODE 9

52
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,250
Captain Oh Gu-tak,
Gangseo Police's Violent Crimes Unit 2.

53
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,380
Oh, I'm sorry.

54
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,676
I've never done this before,
so it feels really awkward.

55
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,054
-Anyway...
-Come on. It's nothing hard.

56
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,891
Hey. Why don't you do it, then?

57
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,394
Forget it. You don't have the face for it.

58
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,397
Sorry about that. Let's try that again.

59
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,652
The secret
to the highest clearance rate in Seoul?

60
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,739
You see, my nickname is...

61
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,367
Actually, is it okay
to mention my nickname?

62
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,581
People call me "Crazy Dog."

63
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,459
Once I smell something fishy,

64
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:58,548
I don't care who it is. I show my teeth,
bite hard and don't let go.

65
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,716
Hence the nickname.

66
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,302
I guess you could say that's my secret.

67
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,680
No amount of external pressure
or cajolery can make you give in.

68
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,642
You just do your job as a cop
which is catching criminals.

69
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,643
Is that it?

70
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,355
You see, making compromises
is not something we do.

71
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,815
It's what politicians do.

72
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,191
External pressure?

73
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,443
If anyone tries to pressure me,

74
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:21,571
I'll press charges against them
for obstruction of justice.

75
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,031
Cajolery?

76
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:28,411
You mean,
like offering me kickbacks or money?

77
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,206
Then it'd be a clear case of bribery.

78
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,125
If you've got nothing to do
for the next five years,

79
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:38,046
or if 20 million won
is chump change to you,

80
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,632
then go ahead and try to bribe me.

81
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,926
Is that like your guiding principle?

82
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,511
Or...

83
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,264
It's about respect.
For the law-abiding citizens.

84
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,516
Thanks to the taxes they pay,

85
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,768
people like us can make a living,

86
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,104
have money to buy food and clothes

87
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,730
and even move to a bigger home,

88
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,400
so we ought to be respectful
and do our job.

89
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,236
We're civil servants, after all.

90
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,615
TERMINAL NIGHTCLUB

91
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:19,921
You piece of...

92
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,923
You bastard!

93
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,220
My boss said not to knife you.

94
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,307
Just hand the business over.

95
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,143
Why did they dump this case on us?

96
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,312
Dong-il resigned this morning.

97
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,271
Why?

98
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,066
This is the 13th case, you know.

99
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,861
With the "Hwayeon-dong serial killer"
all over the news,

100
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,530
he couldn't take it anymore.
He's a softie, you know.

101
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,200
So what do we know about the victim?

102
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,869
Jin Young-eun, age 31.
An ordinary office worker.

103
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,872
And no evidence?
No fingerprints or shoe prints?

104
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,249
This wouldn't be a serial case
if we had those.

105
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,376
Come on now.

106
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,004
I was asking just in case. Jeez.

107
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:49,386
KOREA CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION

108
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,891
That scumbag...

109
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,811
Look how nicely he laid her.

110
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,897
As you can see,
the pattern is basically the same.

111
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,482
He stabs them in their side.

112
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,319
And he watches
as the victim bleeds to death.

113
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:10,490
Watching the victim slowly dying

114
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,703
makes the killer feel alive.

115
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,247
I bet he gets high off it.

116
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:18,915
What a pervert.

117
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,380
He clipped her nails?

118
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:30,885
Because his DNA or bloodstain
could be found under her fingernails.

119
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,595
But there's more.

120
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:36,975
Apparently, after she died,
he wiped her body with alcohol.

121
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,353
No wonder
we can't find a single fingerprint.

122
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,695
Hey, Chang-joon. How much more insane
do you think this world will get?

123
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:49,904
What do you mean?

124
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:53,074
The world wasn't such a scary place
when we were growing up.

125
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,577
At least back then,
I never encountered a crime

126
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,329
that I couldn't wrap my head around.

127
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,083
Are people going crazy
because this world is insane?

128
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,462
Or is it the other way around?

129
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,883
The world is changing fast, but I'm not.
And that drives me nuts.

130
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,634
Damn it.

131
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,431
Find out what he used to wipe her body.
Collect a sample for analysis.

132
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,309
Alcohol, I told you.
What else could it be?

133
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,394
It is our job to suspect everything.

134
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:25,106
Just listen to me and do as I say, okay?

135
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,024
I'm off.

136
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,362
Here's the equity transfer agreement
for the club.

137
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:35,033
And I got Myung-sik to sign a pledge
that he'll stay away from this area.

138
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,079
Well done.

139
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:44,459
We took over Seoul in exactly 25 days.
One district a day.

140
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,836
Woong-chul.

141
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,339
Which district do you want?

142
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:50,840
Sorry?

143
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,010
Yeongdeungpo? Yongsan?

144
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,554
Which turf do you want?

145
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:03,853
Could you give me some time to think?

146
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,148
You need time to think? About what?

147
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,320
All right.

148
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,406
Take your time and think about it.
Whatever it is.

149
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:16,908
Thank you, boss.

150
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,912
Don't tell me you're thinking of quitting.

151
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,123
Are you?

152
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,091
I meant to give it to you sooner.

153
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,385
I'm sorry it took so long.

154
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,512
You could've given it to me later.

155
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,721
Gosh, no.

156
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,307
You've been so considerate and patient.

157
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,727
-I'll pay you for this month as soon as...
-The thing is, Mr. Oh.

158
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,897
I'm really sorry to say this,

159
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:52,026
but I don't think
I can teach Ji-yeon anymore.

160
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,822
But why, all of a sudden...

161
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,866
The thing is...

162
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,993
Because of the lesson fee? My gosh!

163
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,453
Then please don't worry. From now on,

164
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,998
-I'll pay you on time...
-No. It's not about that.

165
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,585
I think you should consider
sending Ji-yeon to a school abroad.

166
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,881
Honestly, she's too talented
to stay in Korea.

167
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,427
I see.

168
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,774
Sweetheart.

169
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,028
You heard everything, right?

170
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,241
So? What do you think?
Do you want to study abroad?

171
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,453
-It'd be nice.
-And?

172
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,955
But you can't always do
everything you want.

173
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,791
As if you were ever that spoiled.

174
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,878
You've had to put up
with this old man all your life.

175
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:55,006
You told me to never call you an old man.

176
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,221
Sweetheart.

177
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,310
Other kids pester their parents to be
sent abroad or for more allowance money.

178
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,853
How come you never do that?

179
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,397
I hear other kids rebel
and say their parents

180
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,233
have done nothing for them.

181
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,946
Do you want an honest answer
or a funny one?

182
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,283
A funny one.

183
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,204
It's because you're dead broke.

184
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,877
How old is that shirt?
The sleeves will fall off soon.

185
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,087
What's wrong with this?

186
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,382
Don't you youngsters wear
worn-out clothes to look trendy?

187
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,509
Vintage and worn-out clothes
are different.

188
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,891
I want your honest answer.

189
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,688
How come you never ask me
for those things?

190
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,530
Because I don't want to hurt you.

191
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,286
It's not something I can get
even if I whine.

192
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:09,205
The mortgage, our living expenses,
and my lessons.

193
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,707
That alone is a lot.

194
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,418
So if your only child whined
about her allowance money

195
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,378
and studying abroad,

196
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,297
your life would be miserable.

197
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,841
The two of us eating together like this

198
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,468
is your only joy in life.
I know that much.

199
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,898
Sweetheart, when did you grow up so much?

200
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:40,278
Why are you asking me
when you're the one who raised me?

201
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,864
Let's eat. The stew will get cold.

202
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,206
No, just eat. I'll get it.

203
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,507
Captain Oh Gu-tak?

204
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:04,886
Who are you?

205
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,166
Nice to meet you, Captain Oh. Come on in.

206
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,878
Thank you for coming.

207
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,922
Let's eat first.

208
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:52,600
The two things I don't do with thugs
are using honorifics and eating with them.

209
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,354
But you're already here anyway,
so let's eat.

210
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,940
Are you trying to bribe me?

211
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,109
Is that why you wanted to see me?

212
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,861
Go ahead and hand over the money.

213
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,365
I'll get you locked up for bribery.

214
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:14,414
As of today,
I've taken over the entire city of Seoul.

215
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,416
What about it?

216
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,919
The other detectives tell me
that I won't be able to do business

217
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:25,049
unless I win you over, Captain Oh Gu-tak.

218
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,681
The things you did
to push Myung-sik's gang out.

219
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,059
Namely, arson, assault, vandalism,

220
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,145
incitement to commit murder,

221
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,397
attempted murder, homicide, and so on.

222
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,609
You want me to turn a blind eye
to such things and let you off.

223
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:47,196
That's why you called me here
to offer me a bribe.

224
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,199
I suppose you thugs consider it
good manners.

225
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,828
Please excuse me for a moment.

226
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,205
Bring me the briefcase.

227
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,303
It's 50 million won in total.

228
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,763
An amount you can certainly accept.

229
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:18,686
I guess 50 million won
is peanuts to you guys.

230
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,980
I don't even have five million won.

231
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,274
Well, this isn't so far out of your reach.

232
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,112
Oh, man. This is tempting.

233
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,200
I was actually in need of some extra cash.

234
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,785
If you want it, it's all yours.

235
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,087
You offered me a bribe, and I punched you.

236
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,672
So let's call it even.

237
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:50,384
I want to put you behind bars
for something bigger.

238
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,971
I'll come back for you
with something huge, okay?

239
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,726
I heard your daughter is studying piano.

240
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,313
It's expensive, isn't it?

241
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,609
I mean, the lessons and all.

242
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,153
And she'd have to study abroad later on.

243
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,866
You can't afford that
with your salary alone.

244
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,623
You're right. I can't afford it

245
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,793
which is why
I'm in such a foul mood these days.

246
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,754
So you'd better stay out of my sight.

247
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,174
If I see you again,
I will chew you to pieces.

248
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,810
What? You're a police commissioner.
You don't have 50 million won?

249
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,939
Oh, boy. Here's a cop with some integrity.

250
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,607
My goodness.

251
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,944
Hey, it's not like
I have money stashed away.

252
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:54,031
I've been deep in debt
since my son's wedding.

253
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,911
Wait until your daughter gets married.
Then you'll understand.

254
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,164
Look at you yapping away
when you're dead broke.

255
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,585
You little... Don't talk to me like that.

256
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,505
Have you tried asking your friends?

257
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,882
Of course, I have.

258
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:16,220
Forget 50 million.
They don't even have 5 million won.

259
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,681
Birds of a feather flock together.

260
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,184
They're barely staying afloat like me.

261
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,480
Well, anyway. I'll figure something out.
Let's just drink.

262
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:31,402
Man, I'll spend all my money on drinks
before I can borrow money from someone.

263
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,120
Anyway, do you know

264
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,873
-what Ji-yeon's piano teacher said?
-What?

265
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,293
She said Ji-yeon is too talented
to just stay in Korea.

266
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,382
I know that Ji-yeon gives her best
in everything she does.

267
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,928
Goodness. Your daughter is
a thousand times better than you.

268
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,263
You're absolutely right.

269
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,390
She is much wiser than I am.

270
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,059
I say I raised her,

271
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,479
but she's the one
who takes care of this lonely old man.

272
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,113
Anyway, that said...

273
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:21,160
I want to be
a dutiful father to her for once.

274
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,748
I will get the money together
so my daughter can study abroad

275
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,626
and become the best pianist in the world.

276
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,961
I will do that for her.

277
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:34,423
Then what? You want her
to become rich and famous

278
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,343
so you can mooch off her
for the rest of your life, right?

279
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,220
Well, that'd be nice.

280
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:50,022
Why did you two drink so much
in broad daylight?

281
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,401
Take him home safe and sound, okay?

282
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:54,902
Okay, Dad.

283
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:57,029
Geun-wook.

284
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,825
Remember what you promised me?

285
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,036
You said you'd quit being a cop,

286
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,747
once I made Commissioner. Remember?

287
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,583
-Yes.
-So?

288
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,503
Are you going to quit? What's your plan?

289
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,462
Well...

290
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,549
I meant the Commissioner General position,

291
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,468
not the Commissioner of Seoul Police.

292
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,266
Looks like you need
to step up your game, Dad.

293
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,351
-What?
-See you.

294
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:28,519
-Goodness.
-Captain Oh.

295
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,729
Captain Oh.

296
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,401
-Who are you?
-It's me, Geun-wook.

297
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,819
-Geun-wook?
-Yes.

298
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,322
Look who's here. It's Geun-wook.

299
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,701
-We're off.
-All right. Bye.

300
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,910
Wait, hold on.

301
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,586
Look at that brat,
messing with his father.

302
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,658
Hey, what's up?

303
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:28,954
We have the results for
the chemical composition analysis.

304
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,956
Okay, got it.

305
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,014
White kerosene?

306
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:52,186
The killer used white kerosene
to wipe down the victim's body.

307
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,188
Where can you get it?

308
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,273
Gas stations. Where else?

309
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,151
You can get it at any gas station.

310
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:03,322
White kerosene is commonly used
for those oil-fired heaters.

311
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,158
What else is it used for?

312
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,117
Well...

313
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:08,911
That I'm not sure.

314
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,707
Since no one would use
a heater in the summer,

315
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:17,461
you want to check all the gas stations
and find out who bought kerosene?

316
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,548
-It'll take forever!
-Is it too much of a hassle for you?

317
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:23,092
I told you. We don't have an easy job.

318
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,636
Fine. I'll just shut up
and do as I'm told.

319
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,471
I don't care however long it takes.

320
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:30,599
We'll check the security footage to see

321
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:35,020
if anyone who bought kerosene
was also at the crime scene.

322
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:42,027
If we get a match, we'll have
the killer right in front of us.

323
00:22:46,104 --> 00:22:47,032
Hello?

324
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,034
-Detective Oh Gu-tak?
-Yes, speaking.

325
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:52,872
I'm calling from Hwagok Patrol Division.
It's about your daughter.

326
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,750
Your daughter had accepted a job
at a karaoke lounge,

327
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,711
without knowing what the job entailed.

328
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,713
You know, those job ads.

329
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:04,842
I think she went there
because she read that the job paid well.

330
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,554
But she got there and realized
they were looking for a bar girl,

331
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,722
so she tried to leave

332
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,684
but got into an altercation
with one of the customers.

333
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:15,663
Sweetheart.

334
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,832
I'm here.

335
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,464
How are you feeling?

336
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:27,508
Are you all right?

337
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:38,477
Never trust ads
about those "high-paying part-time jobs."

338
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,312
It could be very dangerous.

339
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,608
Well, you've learned your lesson.

340
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:45,985
From now on, be careful...

341
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,069
Dad.

342
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,571
How come you're not angry?

343
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,409
Obviously, you know what happened.

344
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,828
So why aren't you mad at me?

345
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,711
You've done nothing wrong, Dad.

346
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:06,005
It's all my fault, so just let it out.

347
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,132
Swear and yell at me all you want!

348
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,432
I know why you went there

349
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,059
and why you couldn't tell me.

350
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:23,689
How could I get mad at you
when I know why you did that?

351
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,942
I've done nothing for you.

352
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:34,074
I'm going to get the money
to send you abroad...

353
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,452
No, forget it.

354
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,996
I don't want to study abroad.

355
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,289
I'll just...

356
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,499
I'm just going to give up.

357
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:46,128
No. I can get the money.
It's just 50 million won.

358
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:47,796
I can easily...

359
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,922
No!

360
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,218
I don't want to study abroad.

361
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,430
This experience gave me a reality check,

362
00:25:56,513 --> 00:26:00,601
so I know my place now.
I've learned my lesson,

363
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,686
so I'm just going to give up.

364
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,482
The more I dream,
the more miserable I become.

365
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,859
So I...

366
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,406
So I can no longer dream, Dad.

367
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:06,250
I'm telling you.
I only touched her thigh, but that girl...

368
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,710
-Gosh.
-Hey!

369
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:12,131
How dare you? You scumbag!

370
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,882
Let go. I said, let go!

371
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:15,717
You bastard!

372
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,846
How dare you lay a hand on my daughter?

373
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,931
Let go!

374
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,516
Let go, you idiots!

375
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:25,394
How dare you hurt my daughter?

376
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,564
Who are you to make my daughter
give up on her dreams?

377
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:48,876
Why...

378
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:55,174
Why must I feel this miserable
just because I don't have money?

379
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:58,385
Just why?

380
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,361
Didn't you say you never eat with thugs?

381
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:41,929
All the crimes you committed
in our precinct so far.

382
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,182
Arson, assault, vandalism,

383
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:48,185
incitement to commit murder,
attempted murder, homicide.

384
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:52,105
I'll let them all go.

385
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,693
However, there's one condition.

386
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,573
Your henchman
who spearheaded your takeover operation.

387
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:06,453
Your main enforcer
who executed all the criminal activities.

388
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,663
Park Woong-chul.

389
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,249
Just hand him over.

390
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,378
Make him take the fall for everything,
and that's it.

391
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,756
Pick someone else.

392
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,051
Woong-chul and I grew up together...

393
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,302
Hey, Lee Du-kwang.

394
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:27,724
Just be grateful and take the offer
before I change my mind.

395
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,366
I'll come back another time.

396
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,482
All right, then.

397
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,777
The moment you walk out of here
with this money,

398
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,364
you and I are in this together.

399
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:31,038
We're family now, Captain Oh.
Do you understand?

400
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,761
I'll tell you where we're headed.

401
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:51,600
Do you know about the Hwayeon-dong murder?
We've identified a person of interest,

402
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:55,520
so we're on our way
to his place to get him.

403
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,939
Could you tell me more
about the investigation?

404
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,734
Come on, I can't tell you.
It's confidential.

405
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,239
Edit it well and make me look good.
Then I'll tell you.

406
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:11,661
I believe it was
a little over a month ago.

407
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,831
We found out that
the killer used white kerosene

408
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:18,210
to erase his DNA that
might have been left on the victim's body.

409
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:22,464
So we combed through the security footage
from all the gas stations in the area

410
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:27,052
and compiled a list of people
who bought white kerosene.

411
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:31,264
Then we went through
the security footage from the 14 cases

412
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:36,228
to see if we could spot
anyone on the list.

413
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:40,315
After doing that for about a month,

414
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,943
we managed
to identify a person of interest.

415
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,986
He's the one we're about to meet.

416
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:02,587
Who is it?

417
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,923
Hello, I'm from the management office.

418
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,551
-The management office?
-Yes.

419
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,855
Where's Lee Jung-moon? Where is he hiding?

420
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:32,075
Lee Jung-moon, you're under arrest.
You're a suspect in the Hwayeon-dong case.

421
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,380
I'm sure you've seen this
in movies and TV shows.

422
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:49,009
We arrested you without a warrant

423
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:52,012
which means we have 48 hours
to request your warrant.

424
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,015
So just confess,
and we'll make this quick and easy, okay?

425
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,394
Hey, why do you look so pallid?

426
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,980
Are you hungry?
Should I order you some food?

427
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:07,819
Okay, let's get started.

428
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,781
It's all computerized these days,

429
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,368
but I still prefer this.
I hope you understand.

430
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:16,745
Name?

431
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:28,173
Fine. Let's forget about the formalities.

432
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,342
Jung-moon.

433
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,636
Why did you kill them?

434
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,934
The victims were all killed
in the exact same manner.

435
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:43,104
I'm sure you know
how they were killed since you did it.

436
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:49,528
All right.

437
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:53,281
Well, let's say it wasn't you.

438
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,659
Then how will you explain
the white kerosene?

439
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,411
It was for my girlfriend.

440
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,789
That's why I bought it.

441
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,627
Look at you! So you do talk.

442
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,755
I thought you were mute.

443
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:09,839
Anyway,

444
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,842
why did she need it?

445
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:16,221
She's an art major. Oil painting.

446
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,766
You have to clean your brushes well.

447
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:23,186
Kerosene removes the oil-based paint
and makes the job easier.

448
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:28,483
That's why I bought the white kerosene.

449
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:31,194
Are you sure?

450
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,906
Do you want to check?

451
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,576
Then just call her and ask.

452
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,245
Then what were you doing
at the crime scenes?

453
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,582
Why did you lurk around
the victims' homes every single time?

454
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:54,050
What's wrong? That you can't answer?

455
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:57,679
Just say it. You went there to kill them.

456
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,974
Lee Jung-moon.
You went there to kill them.

457
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,101
Right?

458
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,146
I...

459
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,190
don't remember.

460
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,109
What?

461
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,822
You asked me why I went there.

462
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,701
I don't remember.

463
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,545
Oh, boy.

464
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:38,011
My goodness. How easy is that?

465
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,889
You think you can get away with it
if you just play dumb.

466
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:48,229
Then let me help you
remember what you did.

467
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,784
Take a good look at this. Here!

468
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,120
December of last year.
Yoo Ha-na in Yeomcheong-dong.

469
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,458
This past January, Choi Hee-ju. Right?

470
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:11,628
You killed her in Yeomcheong-dong.
Remember?

471
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,588
No, I don't.

472
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:18,093
You don't remember?
Then I'll make you remember, you prick!

473
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,678
Here, look at this photo.

474
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,012
This one too!

475
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,765
Park Hee-seok in Sinwol-dong. Cho Won-hee!

476
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,685
Park Ji-won in Yeomcheong-dong.

477
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,937
You killed three people in March.

478
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,856
Was it too nice out
for you to stay at home?

479
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,776
I said, I don't know.

480
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,611
If you don't remember,

481
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:40,490
rack your brain until your memories
come flooding back, you bastard!

482
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,450
Retrieve your memories and tell me.

483
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:47,539
You need to tell me exactly what you did
so that these people can rest in peace!

484
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,832
Got it? You scumbag!

485
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,167
Here, look.

486
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:52,627
Take a good look.

487
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,797
Kim Hee-yeon. You killed her, didn't you?

488
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,881
Remember her?

489
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,012
I really...

490
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,349
don't remember.

491
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,830
Stare at their faces until you remember.

492
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:50,226
So he won't confess?

493
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,480
No. He was seen at every crime scene

494
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:58,193
and bought kerosene in the summer.
We have circumstantial evidence, but...

495
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,988
There's no eyewitness
or physical evidence.

496
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,158
So at the moment, we're relying...

497
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,077
on his confession.

498
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:13,583
This case will be
my last case in the field.

499
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,378
Do you understand?

500
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:21,674
He doesn't want the case
to get in the way of his promotion.

501
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:26,554
We've already wasted a full day.
How will we get a confession out of him?

502
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,014
What do you mean, how?

503
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:31,434
I'll smack him in the head
until his eyes pop out.

504
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:36,189
Hey, call Dr. Kim
and tell her we need her.

505
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,942
You mean, Kim Mi-sook? What for?

506
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,569
To do a polygraph test?

507
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:46,282
Did you book your flight? So when is it?

508
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,619
What? The 24th?

509
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:51,996
That's in two days!

510
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:53,957
What?

511
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,585
Hey, I'm not ready yet.

512
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,546
I mean...

513
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,050
You'll be away for months.
This is just too sudden.

514
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:06,803
-Just a moment, please.
-Sure.

515
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,263
Sweetheart.

516
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,807
I'll call you back later.

517
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:24,863
Detective, what's going on
with my boyfriend?

518
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,406
Take a seat.

519
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:33,329
Well, we'll investigate further
and make our decision soon,

520
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:34,873
so please be patient.

521
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,543
Miss, do you paint?

522
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:40,920
Pardon me?

523
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,382
Oh, I'm an art major.

524
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,676
So, like oil painting?

525
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,722
-Yes.
-When you wash your paintbrushes,

526
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,516
do you use white kerosene?

527
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,769
There's a cleaning solution
specifically designed for brushes,

528
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,688
but it's too expensive.

529
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,900
So people who can't afford it
do use kerosene.

530
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,484
And you use it?

531
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:05,737
Yes.

532
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,407
Did Jung-moon pick it up for you
since you two live together?

533
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,159
Yes.

534
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:16,205
From your perspective,
what's your boyfriend like?

535
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:21,878
Do you think
he's capable of killing someone?

536
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:25,006
No, never. He's not like that.

537
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,467
Okay.

538
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,766
What did I expect?

539
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,570
This is inadmissible in court.
Will it help?

540
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:49,280
The psychological pressure will.

541
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:54,118
If the results say he's lying,
he will confess. I'm sure of it.

542
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,748
Is your name Lee Jung-moon?

543
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,000
Yes.

544
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,546
-Truth.
-Just get straight to the important stuff.

545
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,839
We don't have time.

546
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:11,260
Mr. Lee Jung-moon,
have you ever killed a person?

547
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:14,973
Yes.

548
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:16,975
Truth.

549
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,894
What's with him?
Why is he confessing suddenly?

550
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:24,148
I'm going to show you a few photos.

551
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:28,987
If you killed the person
in the photo I'm showing you,

552
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,905
please say yes.

553
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,660
Yoo Ha-na.

554
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,787
Did you kill her?

555
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,997
No.

556
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,125
Truth.

557
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:48,589
Choi Hee-ju. Did you kill her?

558
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:51,551
No.

559
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:53,511
Truth.

560
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,642
This is Park Hee-seok. Did you kill him?

561
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:01,227
No.

562
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:02,979
-Truth.
-What?

563
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,940
Why does it say he's telling the truth?
What's going on?

564
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:08,818
No.

565
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:10,445
No.

566
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,031
No.

567
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:16,743
No.

568
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,497
All right. This is the last one.

569
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:22,790
Kim Hee-yeon.

570
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,542
Did you kill her?

571
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,178
No.

572
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,056
I did not kill her.

573
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,143
Truth.

574
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,523
Then who did you kill?

575
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,736
Who? Say it, you bastard!

576
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,448
What's the answer you want?

577
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,368
"I killed them all."

578
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,954
Is that what you want to hear?

579
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:07,752
Fine.

580
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,713
I'll give you what you want.

581
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,845
I killed them all.

582
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:22,975
Lie.

583
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,646
That sly bastard...

584
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,356
The Hwayeon-dong serial killer

585
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:30,024
is me.

586
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:33,611
Lie.

587
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:38,825
Since I am a murderer,

588
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,285
I'll gladly accept
any punishment you give me,

589
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,081
Captain Oh Gu-tak.

590
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:47,542
Lie.

591
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:56,634
Listen to me carefully, you scumbag.

592
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,885
We won't meet again

593
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,555
if you really are not the killer
like you say.

594
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,474
However,
if you are the Hwayeon-dong killer,

595
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:06,477
we will cross paths again.
And when we meet again,

596
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,147
I will kill you.

597
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:18,406
What's this?

598
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,284
I found out
whom Lee Jung-moon had killed in the past.

599
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:24,996
Some burglars broke into his home
and killed his parents.

600
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:28,082
Lee Jung-moon killed those burglars.

601
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,500
That's self-defense.

602
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:30,960
Take a look.

603
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,508
SCORE 38, INDICATES A HIGH DEGREE
OF PSYCHOPATHY

604
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,428
He's a psychopath?

605
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,222
Yes, he's a psychopath.

606
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:46,350
I plan to meet the prosecutor
who handled the case.

607
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:47,852
What? When?

608
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,479
We have to release him soon.
48 hours is almost up!

609
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,356
Calm down, will you?

610
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,610
Hey, it's not like we can't get him
once he's released.

611
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,321
He won't be able
to flee the country anyway.

612
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,198
Just keep a close watch on him.

613
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:01,782
Captain Oh Gu-tak!

614
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,036
Hey, sweetheart!

615
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:13,294
Why did you come all the way here?
I'll be heading home soon anyway.

616
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,378
Then leave with me.

617
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:19,634
I won't be able to see you for a while,
so I want to spend all day with you.

618
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,261
-Oh Ji-yeon.
-Yes?

619
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,721
Are you excited?

620
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,391
To tell you the truth,
I'm a little worried about Captain Oh.

621
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:28,517
But I am excited.

622
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,564
Don't worry about me.

623
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,358
Just go there

624
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:38,152
and learn and do all the things
you ever dreamed of.

625
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:40,071
Make all your dreams come true, okay?

626
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,572
Okay, I will.

627
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,079
Your daughter is beautiful.

628
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:01,676
Who is he?

629
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,013
Are you all right?

630
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,913
Goodness. How come she's not home yet?

631
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:44,260
Hello?

632
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,346
Who?

633
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:51,684
Hey, sweetheart.

634
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,687
Come home soon.
You have an early morning flight.

635
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,231
Something's come up,
so I have to step out.

636
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,150
Go ahead and eat when you get home.

637
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,818
I made spicy sausage stew.

638
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,282
Captain Oh Gu-tak?

639
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,122
Why did you want to meet me?

640
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,082
It's about Lee Jung-moon.

641
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,126
You know him well, don't you?

642
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:43,611
Dad?

643
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,280
Dad, is that you?

644
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:56,684
Gu-tak.

645
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,505
Are you not going
to hold a funeral for her?

646
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:10,883
You need to send her off.

647
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:16,972
It's already been ten days.
This isn't right.

648
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,809
Let's just drink.

649
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:24,605
You really have to
let your daughter go now, Gu-tak.

650
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:28,651
Come on. Let's just drink, Gu-hyun.

651
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:32,488
When your parents die,
you bury them in the ground.

652
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:36,617
But when your child dies,
you bury her in your heart.

653
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:40,120
So please, Gu-tak.

654
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,874
It's time you buried your daughter
in your heart and...

655
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,292
Damn it!

656
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,922
That's just what they say in books.

657
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:54,009
Cut the crap
because I don't want to hear it!

658
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,392
My daughter, Ji-yeon...

659
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:06,188
Because of this incompetent father,

660
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,817
my dear daughter died like that.

661
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:14,530
So how can I bury her in my heart?

662
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,453
I cannot...

663
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:26,333
I cannot bury Ji-yeon in my heart.

664
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,337
Not until I catch that scumbag.

665
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:37,678
Because my heart is filled with rage!

666
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,768
The scumbag who killed Ji-yeon...

667
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,522
I will catch that bastard

668
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:53,569
and tear him to shreds.

669
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,741
Then I will bury my daughter

670
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,786
in my heart.

671
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:06,415
So please,

672
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,210
enough of your ridiculous spiel.

673
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:13,756
Stop saying stupid things to comfort me.

674
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:16,759
Let's just drink, okay?

675
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:34,211
I'll begin the autopsy.

676
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:53,415
Dad...

677
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:55,918
Dad.

678
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,888
Where does she always go
all dolled up like that?

679
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:34,308
Who knows? I guess
she's seeing another man or something.

680
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:40,355
What's he doing here?

681
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,996
Remember what I said?

682
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,457
I told you we'd meet again
if you were the killer

683
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,459
and that you would die at my hands.

684
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,294
I'm not the killer.

685
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:05,255
Don't you dare lie to me, you bastard!

686
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:07,466
Gu-tak!

687
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:09,384
Get off me, you idiot!

688
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:12,220
That scumbag killed my daughter, Ji-yeon.

689
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,389
I must kill him with my own hands.

690
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:16,016
Let go of me!

691
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:23,565
Captain Oh, we're here
to discuss your suspension

692
00:57:23,649 --> 00:57:26,193
and the disciplinary actions
we will be taking.

693
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:29,529
Do you have any objections
to our decision?

694
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:33,784
Any objections?

695
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:38,664
You're showing no remorse whatsoever,
Captain Oh Gu-tak.

696
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:50,884
OH GU-TAK
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

697
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,855
So you work here?

698
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,482
Does Jung-moon know?

699
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:09,027
I bet you want to get out of this rut.

700
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:14,032
You want to become a successful artist,

701
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:17,369
but your father abandoned you
when you were little,

702
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:20,080
and your mother died of cancer
five years ago.

703
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:23,208
Talk about a crappy life.

704
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:27,754
What are you trying to say?

705
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,262
You want to continue to paint,

706
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:38,932
but you have no money.

707
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,351
That's why you work here.

708
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:44,021
You've accrued a lot of advance pay.

709
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:48,442
No wonder your boss wants
to just sell you off somewhere.

710
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:54,614
I think I can solve your problem for you.

711
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:56,742
Then you can continue to paint.

712
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,327
What do you want from me?

713
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,539
Work with me.

714
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:05,876
I could really use your help.

715
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,128
It must have something to do
with Jung-moon.

716
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:11,590
Then I can't.

717
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,385
Think carefully.

718
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:17,721
Will you live like this forever?

719
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:21,433
Will someone give you an award
for staying loyal to him?

720
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:25,312
Come on. It's not like
you guys are married.

721
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:28,774
So why would you ruin your life
because of him?

722
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:29,941
Don't be such a fool.

723
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:32,444
Let go of me. I said, let go!

724
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:36,990
There's a lot you can gain
from just giving him up.

725
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:39,785
You can stop worrying
about being sold off.

726
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:43,622
You can quit this job
and focus on your paintings.

727
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:47,375
I'll pay off your debt for you.

728
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:50,170
Do you not understand?

729
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:53,090
You can use this chance
to turn your life around, Yoo-jin.

730
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:06,186
Why haven't we been able
to arrest Lee Jung-moon?

731
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,355
The lack of evidence is to blame.

732
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,441
If we found his prints
on the murder weapon or at the scenes,

733
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,401
we wouldn't be having this talk now.

734
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:17,864
But you see,
forget fingerprints and shoe prints.

735
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:21,118
Do you know
what could serve as irrefutable proof?

736
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:22,452
A survivor.

737
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:28,208
Someone he tried to kill
but couldn't finish off.

738
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:31,378
If there's a survivor, it's game over.

739
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,879
Are you all right?

740
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:35,799
What happened?

741
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:38,927
Are you okay?

742
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:43,181
What happened? What is it?

743
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:44,474
Physical evidence

744
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:45,684
and a victim.

745
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:50,355
With those two things, we'll have
no problem arresting Lee Jung-moon.

746
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:53,316
Don't move!

747
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,735
But we'll need you to testify against him.

748
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:58,405
You'll be his victim and an eyewitness.

749
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,615
One day, Jung-moon told me

750
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:06,079
that he had murdered more than ten people.

751
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:08,915
He bragged about it.

752
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:14,963
That's how we'll tie him
to the Hwayeon-dong murder case.

753
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:18,175
Then he won't be able to get out of this.

754
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:20,343
The things you told me just now.

755
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:22,846
You can say that in court, right?

756
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,598
WITNESS

757
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:30,562
He told me that
he was the Hwayeon-dong killer.

758
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:33,231
He also said the cops

759
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:36,359
couldn't catch him
because he left no trace behind.

760
01:01:38,597 --> 01:01:39,487
Yoo-jin.

761
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,824
Why are you doing this to me?

762
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,165
I'll say this just in case.

763
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:53,752
Guilt, sympathy, compassion.

764
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,795
Don't even think about stuff like that.

765
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:59,216
Lee Jung-moon is the one
who should feel guilty.

766
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,968
Only have sympathy for yourself.

767
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,804
Here is the verdict.
The accused is sentenced

768
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:06,389
to life imprisonment.

769
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:01,695
Why is it that you want

770
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:05,448
to kill someone in jail?

771
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,035
I'm burning up.

772
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:15,542
Right here...

773
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:20,088
It's boiling hot.

774
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,508
I can't even sleep.

775
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:28,263
Every night feels like a tropical night.

776
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,605
So you just want this man dead?

777
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:42,944
Do you think that will put an end

778
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,614
to your long sleepless nights?

779
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:52,704
I know someone

780
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,499
who'd be a good match for the job.

781
01:03:58,335 --> 01:03:59,169
Jung Tae-su.

782
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:04,466
He turned himself in a few months ago,
so he's doing time in jail now.

783
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:09,304
He's at Cheongsong Penitentiary
where the man who killed your daughter is.

784
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:12,557
And he's number one in this field.

785
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:18,396
I don't know why he turned himself in,

786
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:22,567
but killing this guy

787
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,488
will be a piece of cake.

788
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:37,248
But before we take out this guy,

789
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:40,794
if there's anything
you want to hear from him...

790
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:43,338
Is there anything

791
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:46,508
you must hear him say?

792
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:55,767
"I am the one who killed your daughter."

793
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:02,816
That's what I want to hear.

794
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:08,822
If he's not the killer...

795
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,828
If he's not the one
who killed my daughter...

796
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,292
Then I really can't go on anymore.

797
