00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:31,900
Breakfast is ready.
(Boys become more familiar with each other after one night's rest.)

5
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,090
Breakfast is ready.

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,160
I feel it's a breakfast with bland porridge and pickles.

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,630
Yeah, porridge and pickles.

8
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:38,770
So you really couldn't sleep well last night?

9
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,730
Yes, last night.

10
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,600
I think the light was too bright.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Last night...

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,040
I slept really well last night.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,570
-Really? How could you sleep so well?

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,210
-It was about nine.

15
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,110
I was so tired yesterday.

16
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,440
We only slept for two hours.

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,220
Good morning.

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,420
You wear glasses today?

19
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,920
Yes, and it's a monocle.

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,420
I think this is worth a photo.

21
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,350
Good morning.

22
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,100
Is this porridge and side dishes?

23
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,460
I think so.

24
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,459
Porridge and side dishes.

25
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,760
Where's Chien Yu?

26
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,260
Where's Chien Yu?

27
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,520
Because no one woke him up.

28
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,640
(Love Casting)

29
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,700
It's precious to have this quite noisy
(Love Casting)

30
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,910
and lively...

31
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,470
It's not noisy. It's a lively breakfast.

32
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,260
Yes, I'm bored eating breakfast alone.

33
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,810

It's always like this. Yes.
(Having breakfast together to start a new day.)

36
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,240
It's always like this. Yes.

37
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,750
Sometimes I just have a cup of coffee in the morning

38
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,710
and quietly

39
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,680
watch TV for a while.

40
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,150
Really.

41
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,759
I fell asleep around 8:30 last night.

42
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:32,890
(The fatigue of the first day made the boys go to bed early.)
I fell asleep around 8:30 last night.

43
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,120
8:30?
(The fatigue of the first day made the boys go to bed early.)

44
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,940
So we were about the same.
(The fatigue of the first day made the boys go to bed early.)

45
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,690
So we were about the same.

46
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,660
For real.

47
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,190
Me too.

48
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,430
So you slept this early yesterday as well?

49
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,100
Yes. I played on my phone for a short while and slept.

50
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,200
So you stayed until

51
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,070
they gave you the phone.

52
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,900
Yi also fell asleep around eight or nine.

53
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,039
After taking a shower yesterday,

54
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,140
I collapsed onto the bed and passed out.

55
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,370
You didn't even touch your phone？

56
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,810
I didn't even have a phone.

57
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,340
I didn't even know when

58
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,910
and who put my phone in my room.

59
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,680
But it was good to sleep alone.

60
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,850
And you're the one with the most comfortable sleep...

61
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,690
Like passing out.

62
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,890
So in the morning,

63
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,150
at first, you were sleeping on this bed, and in the morning...

64
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,870
No, I used to sleep on this bed.

65
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,070
But then, I turned to like this.

66
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:11,730
(Adson's voice sounds envious.)

67
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,500
You slept comfortably alone.
(Adson's voice sounds envious.)

68
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,260
(Comparing each boy's sleeping posture.)

(Chris and Guei's room)

71
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,390
His feet were exposed.

(Chien Yu's room. Chien Yu's very carefree and bold)

74
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,190
Only he could sleep so freely.
(Chien Yu's room. Chien Yu's very carefree and bold)

75
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,740
Only he could sleep so freely.

76
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,380
I haven't had

77
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,150
porridge and pickles for a long time.

78
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,720
I haven't had breakfast for a long time.

79
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,420
Did you sleep well last night?

80
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,750
I think he slept well.

81
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,540
How did you feel it?

82
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,170
Because he mumbled something in his sleep last night.

83
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:48,860
I was there. Anyway...

84
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,800
I didn't understand him well.

85
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,600
But suddenly,

86
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,329
I didn't know if he was on the bed or at the edge of it.

87
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,100
He suddenly...Ahhh.

88
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,120
Adson was scared by that.

89
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,720
He only looks manly on his appearance.

90
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,990
He suddenly sat up...

91
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,920
And floated up.

92
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,420
That'd be horrible.

93
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,190
But he didn't kick me.

94
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,960
That was fine.

95
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,260
Was it hard to wake up him today?

96
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,530
No, he woke up earlier than me.

97
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,370
Really?

98
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,930
Actually, we were all awake.

99
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,370
But I was still waiting for the alarm at six.

100
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,240
Because I think when he woke someone up...

101
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,970
Get up.

102
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,670
Who could hear that?

103
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,910
But you got up.

104
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,880
He was afraid of shaking you.

105
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,980
Then you...

106
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,050
Yeah, normally,

107
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,210
for example, if you sleep next to me,

108
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,250
I would just...

109
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,250
"Get up."

110
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,450
But he said I shouldn't shake him, so...

111
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,720
Get up.

112
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,020
You can touch him like this. Don't shake him.

113
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,960
If you pat him,

114
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,520
it's fine.

115
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,390
Like this. Get up.

116
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,360
Don't shake me.

117
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,490
I feel uncomfortable when I'm shaken by others.

118
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,630
You can't stick to him.

119
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,700
You need to give him some space.

120
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,900
Yes, give him some space.

121
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,000
Sticking to him will make him angry.

122
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,730
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

123
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,500
It's alright. There is a dishwasher.

124
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,070
Yes.

125
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,210
No. That'll be boring.

126
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,640
-Don't try to run away. -I hate washing dishes.

127
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,980
Whatever. Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

128
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,580
Come on.

129
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:10,970
Count the numbers.

130
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:11,910
(The boys' little fun – even doing the dishes is decided by a game.)
Count the numbers.

131
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,750
Suppose it's 17 and 18?
(The boys' little fun – even doing the dishes is decided by a game.)

132
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,880
Or what?
(The boys' little fun – even doing the dishes is decided by a game.)

133
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,519
Then he goes with people on his right.

134
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,480
OK. Right.

135
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:17,850
(Worried)
OK. Right.

136
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,579
Okay, just right.
(Worried)

137
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:19,620
(Worried)

138
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,959
I may not lose.
(Worried)

139
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,959
Don't.
(Worried)

140
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,330
He doesn't like it.

141
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,530
You came up with this bad idea.

142
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,330
Why didn't you say your left side?

143
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,160
Count and count, at most one...

144
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,630
At least one, and at most 5.

145
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,670
At most one?

146
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,570
At least one, right?

147
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,600
Yes.

148
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,010
Just take them as...

149
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:38,340
As one and then five, six, seven.

150
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,670
(Out of the situation)
As one and then five, six, seven.

151
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,180
I want to ask them to wash the dishes directly.
(Out of the situation)

152
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,260
OK.
(Out of the situation)

153
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,650
OK.

154
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,110
19.

155
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:46,880
Can I start from me?

156
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,980
OK.

157
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,820
So I'm one, right?

158
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,580
Okay.

159
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,330
How tragic!

160
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,830
Why?

161
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,080
What luck did he get on earth?

162
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,420

00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,370
This is so unlucky.
(High-Five Addict)

165
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,970
Okay, go.

166
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,100
I just wanted to say...

167
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,610
I actually didn't know how to use the dishwasher.

168
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,180
Thank you.

169
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,480
You'll have a chance in the future.

170
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,980
We have a chance every day.

Gosh, it's Chien Yu again.
(Auntie Squad: Aben)

173
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,220
He's like the Cinderella.

174
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:20,780
(Auntie Squad President: Niki)
He's like the Cinderella.

175
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,050
You know the story.
(Auntie Squad President: Niki)

176
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:22,950
I think we can only expect

177
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,720
the eighth person to come and save him.

178
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,250
Really, the eighth.

179
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,550
(Aunt Squad: Poom)
Really, the eighth.

180
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,820
But I think they're getting closer, right?

181
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,170
Yes, obviously.

182
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:29,820
(Aunt Squad: Ernie chu. Kimi Hsia.)
Yes, obviously.

183
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,560
It's not as awkward as it was
(Aunt Squad: Ernie chu. Kimi Hsia.)

184
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,530
It's not as awkward as it was

185
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,360
on the first day.

186
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,000
But I think the boys who share the same room...

187
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,600
Niki, did you notice that

188
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,830
the roommates seem to be even closer?

189
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes, it's so natural.

190
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,700
For example, Pink and Fumi at the beginning,

191
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,970
they came in together.

192
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,940
Then they chatted as they walked,

193
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,070
"what are we having this morning?"

194
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,880
It's very natural and normal.

195
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,550
So do Chris and Guei.

196
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,180
After spending the night together, they argued that

197
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,980
their voices were so low when waking up him

198
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,390
or they'd be careful and keep a low voice.

199
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,550
Besides, when they were preparing the utensils,

200
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,890
Chris also took them for him.

201
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,020
I'm looking forward to their interactions if they later

202
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,060
have a mission or start to interpret

203
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,690
these BL dramas.

204
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,300
We’re dressed so similarly today!

205
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,830
Yes, you are all green.

206
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,970
I love green so much.

207
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,340
I look way more green.

208
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,070
What is this?

209
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,170
Our scripts.

210
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,140
(What kind of surprise will the script bring to the boys?)

211
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,240
The script?
(What kind of surprise will the script bring to the boys?)

212
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,970
They printed our photos.
(What kind of surprise will the script bring to the boys?)

213
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:19,840
Love Casting.
(What kind of surprise will the script bring to the boys?)

214
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,110
Then he doesn't need to act.

215
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,310
Chien Yu doesn't need to act.

216
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:22,930
So two copies of the script for one group?

217
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:23,640
(There are only three scripts on the table.)
So two copies of the script for one group?

218
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,450
(There are only three scripts on the table.)

219
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,590
No, one for each person.
(There are only three scripts on the table.)

220
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,900
(There are only three scripts on the table.)

221
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,690
What's your practice?

222
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,180
We're doing 'Kissing Balance'.

223
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,760
That's 'Practicing Balance'.

224
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,320
I know. I did it on purpose.

225
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,760
I want to give this to him.

226
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,190
I don't want this.

227
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,030
The photos?

228
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:39,760
Yes.

229
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,360
I'll steal your photos

230
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,560
and stick them on my notebook.

231
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,720
Can you understand it?

232
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,420
No.

233
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,220
What kind of practice is yours?

234
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,300
(A big problem for Yi's filming. He can't understand the Chinese script.)
What kind of practice is yours?

235
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:46,320
(A big problem for Yi's filming. He can't understand the Chinese script.)

236
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,170
I'll read it to you.
(A big problem for Yi's filming. He can't understand the Chinese script.)

237
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:47,220
(A big problem for Yi's filming. He can't understand the Chinese script.)

238
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,430
They gave you the English version.
(A big problem for Yi's filming. He can't understand the Chinese script.)

239
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:48,510
(A big problem for Yi's filming. He can't understand the Chinese script.)

240
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,610
Yours is Perfect Pitch.
(A big problem for Yi's filming. He can't understand the Chinese script.)

241
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,580
Yours is Perfect Pitch.

242
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,520
You need to sing.

243
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,840
We need to sing?

244
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,590
I don't know. I was just talking nonsense.

245
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,610
No, there's no English here.

246
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,450
Yes, there is.

247
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,580
I feel it's so hard.

248
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,020
Your B role needs to sing an off-key song.

249
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,220
What does it mean?

250
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,820
It means a badly out-of-tune song.

251
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,260
A very poorly sung song.

252
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,110
OK. Easy.

253
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,990
(The reluctant sound of dishwashing comes from the kitchen.)

254
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,670
Did this cup get washed

255
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,570
or not?

256
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,130
Here. This cup.

257
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,240
I don't know.

258
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,300
I guess it was not washed yet.

259
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,400
We are in the hall way.

260
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,510
Could this be running into each other?

261
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,920
Mine is exaggerated.

262
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,320
(Now you think the script is funny. You'll know more about it later.)

263
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,650
Confusion.
(Now you think the script is funny. You'll know more about it later.)

264
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,350
(Now you think the script is funny. You'll know more about it later.)

265
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,690
You're 'Yi' or 'Jia'.

266
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,760
'Jia' and 'Yi', that means A and B.

267
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,780
You know?

268
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,180
This is B.

269
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,860
This word is A.

270
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,120
I think it's funny.

271
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,210
He lifts his chin.

272
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,830
He also needs to say,

273
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,410
"You don't know what you'll miss".

274
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,240
It's just so imaginative.

275
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,810
Like I'm this A.

276
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,930
A is hiding.

277
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,420
Stop breathing.

278
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,510
(Adson translates for Yi Gao carefully.)
Stop breathing.

279
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:10,650
(Adson translates for Yi Gao carefully.)

280
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,600
You know?
(Adson translates for Yi Gao carefully.)

281
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,630
You know?

282
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,300
And...

283
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,890
Open the door and close the door's noise.

284
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:21,090
(Chien Yu doesn't have a script. So he can only join other groups for discussion.)

285
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,830
Yeah, why doesn't he have a script?
(Chien Yu doesn't have a script. So he can only join other groups for discussion.)

286
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,600
(Chien Yu doesn't have a script. So he can only join other groups for discussion.)

287
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,670
I'll think that there is

288
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,170
something wrong with this person.

289
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,300
We are on the grass.

290
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,960
Singing.

291
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,059
....The bathroom of the fourth floor.

292
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
Where are you?

293
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,770
We're on the grass.

294
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,580
(Lonely)

295
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,280
Poor guy.
(Lonely)

296
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:38,299
(Lonely)

297
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,309
Give him a male lead.
(Lonely)

298
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,030
The grass.

299
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,500
The grass should be...

300
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,130
That field over there is grass.

301
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,960
I saw them on the bed.

302
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
Really?

303
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,220
Shirtless.

304
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:54,870
Hold on, will it be my eighth person?

305
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,440
(Happy)
Hold on, will it be my eighth person?

306
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:56,510
Maybe.
(Happy)
Hold on, will it be my eighth person?

307
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,850
Maybe.

308
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,430
Who could it be?

309
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,670
It might be Uber Eat.

310
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,300
But...

311
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,470
Hello, Professor.

312
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,140
Don't need to call me a professor.

313
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,700
Wayne.

314
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,120
(BL drama veteran, Wayne Song.)
(Gained attention for his role as overlord Xiang Haoting in BL drama HIStory3 – That Day.)
(Representative works: HIStory3 – That Day, The Making of an Ordinary Woman, Miracle, Bloody Lucky Life, Cooking High School, Winning Shot.)

00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,100
(Representative works: HIStory3 – That Day, The Making of an Ordinary Woman, Miracle, Bloody Lucky Life, Cooking High School, Winning Shot.)
Wayne.

316

320
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,260
Wayne should be the eighth.

321
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,530
Did you match with each other somehow yesterday?

322
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,230
Yes.

323
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,630
And Chien Yu was alone, right?

324
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,530
Yes.

325
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,000
Then you'll be with me today.

326
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,970
Awesome!

327
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,370
With a senior?

328
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,770
Yes, that's great.

329
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:39,410
My gosh.

330
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,610
(Last night's loneliness, today's bonus)

331
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,240
Am I matching with Professor?
(Last night's loneliness, today's bonus)

332
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,680
Don't call me that.

333
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,180
I think we're just sharing.

334
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,190
I'll kneel down first.

335
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,120
We're using...

336
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,990
Sharing.

337
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,190
For example, today,

338
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,590
if the eight of us are a crew,

339
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,400
we might be filming together.

340
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,660
So you won't treat me

341
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,730
as a Professor in the film set?

342
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,560
Right?

343
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,770
We are partners.

344
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,100
If you have something to share,

345
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,600
you can just communicate.

346
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,740
I think we can just communicate with each other.

347
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,670
OK.

348
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,610
That's about it.

349
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,410
Then...

350
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,880
You know what BL means, right?

351
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,130
It stands for Boys' Love.

352
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,120
Let me ask you a question.

353
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,820
What is the difference between LGBTQ+ dramas

354
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,020
and Boys' Love dramas,

355
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,890
in your opinion?

356
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,520
Because I didn't watch a lot,

357
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,490
only a couple of them.

358
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,960
But I think LGBTQ+ dramas

359
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,030
seem to have a tendency of

360
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,330
(The difference between BL dramas and LGBTQ+ dramas.)
seem to have a tendency of

361
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,150
focusing on its 'color'.
(The difference between BL dramas and LGBTQ+ dramas.)

362
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,470
focusing on its 'color'.

363
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,370
Because we are boys,

364
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,600
only then...

365
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,740
can we lead to a series of stories later on.

366
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,520
But what makes BL differs is that

367
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,490
only because

368
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,010
I like you,

369
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,120
and you are you,

370
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,440
I simply like the personalities of you,

371
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,880
and the way you are.

372
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,750
This is more like Boy's Love.

373
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,660
Yes.

374
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,620
I think my analysis is...

375
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,810
Everyone can express.

376
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,460
I think

377
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,220
if it's Boy's Love,

378
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,280
it's more like...

379
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,310
Well...

380
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,970
In an idol drama we normally watch, there'll be a boy and a girl,

381
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,960
but here the subjects are different.

382
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,020
Now it's two boys.

383
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,000
I think the audience may be different too.

384
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,270
I think for Boys's Love, it will

385
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,080
attract more girls to watch it.

386
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,580
And LGBTQ+ dramas,

387
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,110
more male viewers will be attracted to watch them.

388
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,080
We'll want them to get immersed in that situation

389
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,150
and empathize.

390
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,720
If it's Boys Love,

391
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,090
it can allow girls to make a choice

392
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,390
and get them immersed in certain situations.

393
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,860
So in the character design

394
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,060
and the description of inner changes and struggles,

395
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,790
we might see some differences.

396
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,430
We really need to applaud.

397
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,680
This definitely deserves applause.

398
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,500
(A+ Student)

399
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,130
Amazing.
(A+ Student)

400
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,630
Flattered.
(A+ Student)

401
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,500
What you said just now

402
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,170
is quite similar.

403
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,440
What it emphasizes is not about a sex orientation

404
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,070
but a journey of self-exploration,

405
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,080
which will be magnified.

406
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,480
It can be romantic

407
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,540
and beautiful.

408
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,330
So it has another word

409
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,650
called "Dan Mei dramas".

410
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,420
"Dan" here refers to

411
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,810
indulging in something beautiful.

412
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,920
Okay, this is the BL drama.

413
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,460
Have you ever had a study life

414
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,530
where your environment was full of boys,

415
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,830
so you developed

416
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,930
some kind of bond between your good buddies

417
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,500
and that was beyond your understanding of friendship

418
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,300
or interaction?

419
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:21,840
I'm in the PE class.

420
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,540
(A typical E person always speaks first.)
I'm in the PE class.

421
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,810
So I don’t know if....
(A typical E person always speaks first.)

422
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,740
There were more boys,
(A typical E person always speaks first.)

423
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,210
and less girls.

424
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,580
We all lived together.

425
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,240
Whether it was pressure from training

426
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,350
or academic lessons,

427
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,050
or even from my family,

428
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,520
or others,

429
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,520
I felt I could rely more on them

430
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,820
and talk to them more.

431
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,550
You felt the bond that you were connected.

432
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,390
Yeah.

433
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:45,130
But that kind of feeling was not like friendship.

434
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,560
But you wouldn't feel like you were in love.

435
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,330
Exactly.

436
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,500
My college was full of girls.

437
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,810
All girls?

438
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,730
(An unexpected turn.)

439
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,070
That's another direction.
(An unexpected turn.)

440
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,370
It's not what we’d want to hear.
(An unexpected turn.)

441
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,910
Because I went to a nurses' school.
(An unexpected turn.)

442
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,370
Because I went to a nurses' school.

443
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,410
I joined the basketball team too.

444
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,050
I used to have friends to practice dancing together.

445
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,680
We used to get along very often.

446
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,890
We often interacted.

447
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,050
There was a layer of affection.

448
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,660
It was something more than just friends.

449
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,090
When I felt he was in a bad mood,

450
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,660
I’d want to ask him what happened to him.

451
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,530
I’d want to stay with him

452
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,760
and share his burden.

453
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,070
His ears are so red.

454
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,060
That’s what I was thinking as well.

455
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,130
(Before After)
That’s what I was thinking as well.

456
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,320
Right? And the more he talks,
(Before After)

457
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,340
Right? And the more he talks,

458
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,070
his ears turned red.

459
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,610
So you'll care about him more than you care about other friends.

460
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,910
Or when something happened to yourself,

461
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,660
you would think of him

462
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,750
immediately.

463
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,450
Can you go out with me

464
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,420
or

465
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,850
treat him

466
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,920
like family. That kind of friend.

467
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,390
I think the most precious thing is that

468
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,230
though you have experienced different things respectively,

469
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,520
you still resonate with each other about

470
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,430
(Tip 1 for Romantic Scene: Integrate Life Experience into Your Character.】
you still resonate with each other about

471
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,170
some stories and experience.

(Tip 1 for Romantic Scene: Integrate Life Experience into Your Character.】

473
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,970
I think you can try to put these things
(Tip 1 for Romantic Scene: Integrate Life Experience into Your Character.】

474
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,600
into the story later

475
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,940
in your rehearsal.

476
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,780
Can I ask when there're some scenes that are quite intimate

477
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,180
or something like

478
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,880
physical contacts

479
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,650
or get very close to each other,

480
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,450
will there be some preparations?

481
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,490
You must be a little shy

482
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:24,020
before or during these intimate scenes.

483
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,330
You will be nervous,

484
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,160
feel restrained and awkward.

485
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,930
But I think

486
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,780
to establish trust with your partner

487
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,950
is very important.

488
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,100
(Tip 2 for Romantic Scene: Trust Your Partner)
is very important.

(Tip 2 for Romantic Scene: Trust Your Partner)

490
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:35,810

(Tip 2 for Romantic Scene: Trust Your Partner)

492
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,510

because it's broad,

497
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,300
it means there can be many ways.

00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,080
You can use many methods

500
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,250
when you later operate it.

501
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,550
OK. For example, saying "I was just joking and talking nonsense".

502
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:47,610

when you are filming.

I think I can share a small suggestion

508
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,690
with you is that

509
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,050
you can try to find

510
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,320
what you like about him.

(Tip 3 for Romantic Scene: Find Your Favourite Part and Put Your Emotion into it.)

517
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,490
I won't say who can not play BL dramas for specific.

518
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,150
Because I think everyone can give it a try.

519
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,600
For example, I think...

520
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,700
Guei and Pink

521
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,990
can partner with each other.

522
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,360
I also feel Pink can be with Long as well.

523
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,690
Any combination could be fun.

524
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,850
I'm also looking forward to finding out

525
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,920
if they can match up

526
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,050
in the program if possible.

527
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,870
Then maybe

528
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,250
there’ll be

529
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,050
some distinct flames between them.

530
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,630
Go away!

531
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:40,720
(Wayne's wish has come true. The relationship between the three of them.)
Go away!

532
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:40,740
(Wayne's wish has come true. The relationship between the three of them.)

533
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,810
Go away!
(Wayne's wish has come true. The relationship between the three of them.)

534
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,070
(Wayne's wish has come true. The relationship between the three of them.)

535
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:43,900
Get in.
(Wayne's wish has come true. The relationship between the three of them.)

536
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,170
My spot.
(Wayne's wish has come true. The relationship between the three of them.)

537
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,670
What are they acting?

538
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,740
It's enjoyable.

539
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,540
So was that a BL drama being aired just now?

540
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,110
They were already acting, right?

541
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,010
I think they're rehearsing, right?

542
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:53,580
It's awesome.

543
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,520
I've already enjoyed that wonderful play.

544
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,620
Interesting. Each team has got

545
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,850
a script already.

546
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,560
What do you think their plot will be?

547
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,490
I'm wondering if it was assigned

548
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,930
based on their own role distribution back then.

549
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,930
-Like the cunning guy, good guy. -Yeah.

550
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,000
It's possible. I think it's possible.

551
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,970
It's about having them

552
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,340
act according to their own personalities.

553
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,000
Yes.

554
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,070
And I think what's great was their

555
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,210
explanation about BL.

556
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,410
I think BL is really

557
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,380
a broad and beautiful world.

558
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,080
You can freely pursue

559
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,780
to become the way you want.

560
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,450
So I think

561
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,450
it can really be very diverse.

562
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,050
That's why Wayne just said

563
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,290
everyone can actually play different roles.

564
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,890
Now our actors

565
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,990
have their own unique script respectively.

566
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,690
It includes "A Romantic Shot Together"

567
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,790
"Perfect Pitch"

568
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,560
"Practicing Balance",

569
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,860
and "Meeting".

570
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,530
Then they just talked about

571
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:48,070
Fumi and Pink got "Practicing Balance".

572
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:48,470
Yes.

573
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,230
The title of the BL drama is just like this.

574
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,570
(Practice Balance. Imagining its plot.)
The title of the BL drama is just like this.

575
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,710
It's very attractive.
(Practice Balance. Imagining its plot.)

576
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,070
Because after practising their balance,
(Practice Balance. Imagining its plot.)

577
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,540
it'll be practicing kissing.
(Practice Balance. Imagining its plot.)

578
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,180
You can kiss if you can't

579
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,480
keep your balance.

580
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,480
You can keep the balance, or can't keep the balance,

581
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,750
but for all of these, you can always kiss.

582
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,350
The result is gonna be the same.

583
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,589
Yi Gao and Adson got

584
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,589
Perfect Pitch.

585
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:07,150
Did he say he needs to play a tone-deaf?

586
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,819
(Perfect Pitch. Imagining its plot.)
Did he say he needs to play a tone-deaf?

587
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,160
Yes, he did tell him that.
(Perfect Pitch. Imagining its plot.)

588
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,790
Yeah, a tone-deaf person.
(Perfect Pitch. Imagining its plot.)

589
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,990
Then he started to teach him

590
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,060
to use abdominal breathing

591
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,010
and then hold him from behind.

592
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,630
-The place of abdomen, like this. -But I'm tone-deaf.

593
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,900
Where's the abdomen?

594
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,839
It's starting.

595
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,900
Is it here?

596
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,540
You're acting with yourself.

597
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,040
Excuse me, author,

598
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,010
What's the story of "We Meeting"?

599
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:28,780
"Chu", and then fall on him.

600
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,710
(Imagining We Meeting's Plot)
"Chu", and then fall on him.

601
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,450
And then it turns into "Practicing Balance".
(Imagining We Meeting's Plot)

602
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,350
Don't fall where you're. The ground is flat obviously.
(Imagining We Meeting's Plot)

603
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,220
How about we ask Poom to make a guess?

604
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,990
Another one is "A Romantic Shot Together".

605
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,320
How do you think the plot will develop?

606
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,090
I think they two look quite mature.

607
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,660
(Imagining plots of A Romantic Shot Together.)
I think they two look quite mature.

608
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,830
So I think the plot they'll play
(Imagining plots of A Romantic Shot Together.)

609
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,010
might have a mature and romantic atmosphere.
(Imagining plots of A Romantic Shot Together.)

610
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,670
They've been out of romance for quite a while.

611
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,660
They don't know what romance is anymore.

612
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,890
But the second they see Poom,

613
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,330
the romance sparks.

614
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,750
Oh my god, I can act anything.

615
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,380
All BL dramas, come to me, hurry.

616
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,900
Okay, we just guessed

617
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,590
various plot developments.

618
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,090
Let's see how they'll practice.

619
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,420
(The hard way to shoot begins.)

620
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,560
(Fumi Pink)

621
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,590
OK. Again.
(Fumi Pink)

622
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,230
Okay, one more time.
(Fumi Pink)

623
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,030
Good.
(Fumi Pink)

624
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,590
I'm sorry.

625
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,280
It's okay.

626
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,310
Because I have got no experience in acting.

627
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,340
Fumi: But Pink is quite experienced.

628
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,130
Since has got a degree in this field,

629
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,090
I think

630
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,040
I need more of his help

631
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,210
in many aspects.

632
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,750
Okay, it's gonna be far.

633
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,280
Okay.

634
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,250
It's okay. Again.

635
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,020
Okay.

636
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,290
Come on. This way. A bit far.

637
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,220
Okay, come again.

638
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:46,720
Okay.

639
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,070
Three, two, one.

640
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,520
Sorry.

641
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,980
It's fine. Never mind.

642
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,940
One more time.

643
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,930
Again.

644
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,530
Okay, cut.

645
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,380
You're just too caught up in your idol persona.

646
00:18:59,380 --> 00:18:59,800
(They didn't interact naturally, so filming was interrupted.)
You're just too caught up in your idol persona.

647
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,240
You should play that.
(They didn't interact naturally, so filming was interrupted.)

648
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,600
And you, OK, we...
(They didn't interact naturally, so filming was interrupted.)

649
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,470
I'll give you some versatile lines you can use.
(They didn't interact naturally, so filming was interrupted.)

650
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,670
Yes, you should act like it's for real.

651
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,810
If you're really playing frisbee with him,

652
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,110
you'll definitely trash-talk him, right?

653
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,240
Playing with buddies and friends

654
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,180
will definitely make you trash-talk them.

655
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,880
Darn it, you can't even get that? This is okay too.

656
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,980
Oh, what do you want?

657
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,730
You can just talk nonsense about that.

658
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,150
Okay, you might say, 'I'll throw it closer to you then.'

659
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,620
OK, I'll throw it closer to you.

660
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,390
Then he'll say, "Again",

661
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,120
and you'll say, "Fine".

662
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,260
Then stretch your hands.

663
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:23,920
OK.

664
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,040
But I didn't expect that the most difficult thing can be playing the frisbee.

665
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,820
We came to the grass outside,

666
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,500
and we've got our lines down.

667
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,010
But we need to practice using the frisbee.

668
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,030
So we kept running.

669
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,390
We sweated a lot during practice.

670
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,810
I was so tired.

671
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,510
Do any of our actors remember

672
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,410
the nervous feeling from your first shoot?

673
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:44,710
It can be very nervous when it's your first-time filming.

674
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,450
(The immature looks when boys shoot. It reminds Chu of the tension of his first shoot.)
It can be very nervous when it's your first-time filming.

675
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,020
Where are we now?
(The immature looks when boys shoot. It reminds Chu of the tension of his first shoot.)

676
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,450
People next to me would say,
(The immature looks when boys shoot. It reminds Chu of the tension of his first shoot.)

677
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,690
"Don't be nervous."
(The immature looks when boys shoot. It reminds Chu of the tension of his first shoot.)

678
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,350
Remember to say your lines.

679
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,760
I do remember everything, but I just can't do it.

680
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,790
It used to be like this.

681
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,830
Because the plot is developing,

682
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,490
and the shot keeps rolling.

683
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,360
They may take this shot first, and then that one.

684
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:02,900
Yes.

685
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,430
When you were acting, you may wonder

686
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,730
if you should say that specific line next.

687
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,670
Should I respond to that line then? You'll be nervous.

688
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,470
Hsia, did anything embarrassing happen

689
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,940
when you filmed the first time?

690
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,710
It's been a long time.

691
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,510
So when you were talking,

692
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,340
I was wondering how I used to be.

693
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,110
You forgot somehow.

694
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,640
But I remember

695
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,250
I used to shoot in the studio.

696
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,610
The kind with four cameras.

697
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,450
That could be very hard.

698
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,280
That was really...

699
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,150
The director just turned on the mic and yelled at people directly.

700
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,620
And everyone on set could hear

701
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,560
the director yelling at you.

702
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,720
And you need to...

703
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,630
It's all at once.

704
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,190
So remember your every position

705
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,820
and move clearly.

706
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,160
Yes, and I remember

707
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,330
when I first filmed,

708
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,170
I couldn't cry when there were crying scenes.

709
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,550
This is very normal.

710
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,790
I really applied herbal oil here.

711
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,540
It was so cold.

712
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,710
So that shot lacked a lot of coherence.

713
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,320
In the beginning, it was like,

714
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:46,800
(The first experience of Aben's crying scene: really crying miserably. )
In the beginning, it was like,

715
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:46,830
(The first experience of Aben's crying scene: really crying miserably. )

716
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,500
"Hsia, don't go".
(The first experience of Aben's crying scene: really crying miserably. )

717
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:48,550
(The first experience of Aben's crying scene: really crying miserably. )

718
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,350
We cut there because I couldn't cry out.
(The first experience of Aben's crying scene: really crying miserably. )

719
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:50,380
(The first experience of Aben's crying scene: really crying miserably. )

720
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,310
When it turned back, it became like
(The first experience of Aben's crying scene: really crying miserably. )

721
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,130
"Hsia!"

722
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,200
I really broke down,

723
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,490
because my eyes so hurt.

724
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,330
When you were filming, Poom,

725
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,120
did anything embarrassing happen cause you were nervous?

726
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,220
Yes, very nervous.

727
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,750
Super nervous.

728
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,610
When I first filmed,

729
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,200
(Poom: Meeting a big star on his first shot.)
When I first filmed,

730
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,280
(Poom: Meeting a big star on his first shot.)

731
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,520
I was so embarrassed and scared of everything.
(Poom: Meeting a big star on his first shot.)

732
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:08,650
(Poom: Meeting a big star on his first shot.)

733
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,130
Is this right?
(Poom: Meeting a big star on his first shot.)

734
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,000
(Poom: Meeting a big star on his first shot.)

735
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,730
What should I do?

736
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,710
I felt...

737
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,300
Since I also met some celebrities I saw on TV,

738
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,930
I was nervous, worried, and flustered.

739
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,090
That can really make you feel very nervous.

740
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,710
When you meet an artist or star

741
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,940
that you very admire,

742
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,220
you'll feel it's hard to perform well.

743
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,420
That's the point.

744
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,370
Because in this process,

745
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,010
your partner is very important in that scene.

746
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,730
Can he help you get into the scene?

747
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,430
And then

748
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,740
could you two perform well together?

749
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,530
Those with experience

750
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,730
or those without can support each other.

751
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,590
(Wayne Song, Chien Yu.)

752
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,190
I come up with a very cliché plot.

753
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,010
OK.

754
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,580
I may tell you...

755
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,980
I'll ask for your photos, but at the same time,

756
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,030
I'll tell you that my phone's capacity is full.

757
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,960
So I can't use Airdrop.

758
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,390
You may have to use Line to send it to me.

759
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,900
You know it's a bad trick,

760
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,200
and you may know my intention,

761
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,280
but you didn't reject me.

762
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,290
-I'll find it seems weird. -Yes.

763
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:14,830
Then...

764
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,710
(Chien Yu is getting better under Wayne Song's guidance.)
Then...

765
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,650
(Chien Yu is getting better under Wayne Song's guidance.)

766
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,750
Should I Airdrop you?
(Chien Yu is getting better under Wayne Song's guidance.)

767
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:17,780
(Chien Yu is getting better under Wayne Song's guidance.)

768
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,930
Or you won't have any photos.
(Chien Yu is getting better under Wayne Song's guidance.)

769
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:19,500
(Chien Yu is getting better under Wayne Song's guidance.)

770
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:20,990
Oh.

771
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,890
Okay.

772
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,530
I...

773
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,410
My phone capacity is full.

774
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,490
That can't work.

775
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,040
Well.

776
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,880
How about we...

777
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,020
Add you on Line?

778
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,160
Send me the photo.

779
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,450
OK.

780
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:45,830
So, your Line is...

781
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,000
(Really stuttering)
So, your Line is...

782
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,880
Everyone has a partner to perform the scene.

783
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,050
Am I doing a one-man show today?

784
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,370
I saw Wayne before.

785
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,130
He's famous on TV

786
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,740
and a great actor.

787
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,760
My grandma, my mom, my sister

788
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,160
all love to watch his dramas.

789
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,970
The Making of an Ordinary Woman.

790
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,140
That's why I said,

791
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,300
"Am I really acting with him as a partner today?"

792
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,490
I became very nervous.

793
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,940
He said it's okay.

794
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,210
Just relax.

795
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,960
Anyway,

796
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,310
we're just playing a short plot.

797
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,560
So don't be too nervous.

798
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,590
I was really relaxed at first.

799
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,360
But once i got to the set,

800
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,260
with so much equipment and so many people,

801
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,790
I started getting super nervous.

802
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,110
Then I started to walk so unnaturally.

803
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,660
Chien Yu is nervous.

804
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,770
Then you can first do this.

805
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,770
Take a selfie here.

806
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,670
All his limbs...

807
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,700
And then?

808
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,340
Here and take a selfie.

809
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,420
Then Wayne said,

810
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,890
"It's okay. Just relax.

811
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,750
Just act like this."

812
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,420
He'd do some small gestures, so I could feel

813
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,040
that you just need to act as the way you feel.

814
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,250
That'd be great.

815
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,410
So I'm grateful that

816
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,300
he could be my first partner in acting.

817
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,000
It's happy to have Wayne there.

818
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,460
It'll feel like your experience level suddenly skyrocketed.

819
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,150
Yeah, I think there are both pros and cons.

820
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,370
Because when you meet a professional actor,

821
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,930
you can actually feel more nervous.

822
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,330
Yeah, but he can teach you a lot too.

823
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,980
You'll have more experience.

824
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:01,940
I think it depends on the character.

825
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,970
If the character means to be a bit

826
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,630
nervous and stutters somehow,

827
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,880
then that nervousness can be used perfectly.

828
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,430
Yes.

829
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,430
But if you don't know how to use it,

830
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,170
it will result in a major NG.

831
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,100
Yeah, you could tell he was nervous.

832
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:19,600
He was holding his phone without moving, like this.

833
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,220
-It's so funny.
-He became a robot.

834
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,420
I thought it was a story with a robot.

835
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,410
So nervous.

836
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,770
But for Wayne, who can act,

837
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,550
his gaze immediately...

838
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,790
Very confident.

839
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:32,540
And charming.

840
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,470
Trying to flirt with him.

841
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,800
It felt like they were going to interact.

842
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,040
(Adson and Yi Gao)

843
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,470
I think you two shouldn't make it too complicated.

844
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,820
One of you is taking a shower.

845
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,550
Then,

846
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,670
you were already lying in bed watching him.

847
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,620
Did I hear it wrong? Showering?

848
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:50,380
Showering?

849
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,180
They are adults.

850
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,120
She said to take a shower.

851
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,860
Yes, she just said shower.

852
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,120
One is lying in bed and the other is taking a shower.

853
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,590
He's really taking a shower.

854
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,690
There's no door

855
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,360
and no windows.

856
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,400
Turns out, the window is just for filming convenience.

857
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,920
Okay, like this. Okay.

858
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,600
Okay, Adson, let's prepare the shower props.

859
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,270
Yi Gao, practice your lines.

860
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,370
Yes, thank you.

861
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,430
And action.

862
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,490
Adson.

863
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,510
He realised.

864
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:29,070
(Can't help but smile)

865
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,240
Take a rest.

866
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,630
Lie down.

867
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,160
That's good.

868
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,150
Bang, bang, bang, bang.

869
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,780
This is our first time filming.

870
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:49,370
And my partner is Adson.

871
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,730
At first, we thought

872
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,260
I should be the one taking a shower, and then he enters and watches me.

873
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,540
And then...

874
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,820
(Have to keep doing sit-ups even during break time)
And then...

875
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,500
(Have to keep doing sit-ups even during break time)

876
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,140
The director changed it.
(Have to keep doing sit-ups even during break time)

877
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:01,740
(Have to keep doing sit-ups even during break time)

878
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,540
Our roles changed.

879
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,910
So... like...

880
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,550
I didn't prepare

881
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,710
for this other role.

882
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,570
For his performance,

883
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,320
if I were to give him a score

884
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,670
from 0 to 100,

885
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:16,800
I would give him 120.

886
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,550
Because his reaction

887
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,260
was very natural

888
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
and really surprised me.

889
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,630
I showered for about half an hour.

890
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,650
I washed my body about six or seven times.

891
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,310
I washed my hair two or three times.

892
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,270
I'm super clean and fragrant today.

893
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,510
This is the longest shower

894
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,010
I've taken in the past 30 years.

895
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,120
Yes.

896
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,620
Scene 5 take one.

897
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,220
(When acting, you must be mindful of wardrobe malfunctions!)

898
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,120
Adson, be careful of the angle exposing too much.
(When acting, you must be mindful of wardrobe malfunctions!)

899
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,760
(When acting, you must be mindful of wardrobe malfunctions!)

900
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,000
I did wear...
(When acting, you must be mindful of wardrobe malfunctions!)

901
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:55,050
You're wearing it, but it leaves too much to the imagination.

902
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,420
Yes.

903
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,820
I would like to try acting

904
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,900
with Adson.

905
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:02,770
I think I can be both strong and gentle.

906
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:05,560
(Wayne is looking forward to working with Adson)
I think I can be both strong and gentle.

907
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:05,580
(Wayne is looking forward to working with Adson)

908
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,050
Yes.
(Wayne is looking forward to working with Adson)

909
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:06,120
(Wayne is looking forward to working with Adson)

910
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,110
If I meet someone as dominant as Adson,
(Wayne is looking forward to working with Adson)

911
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,900
If I meet someone as dominant as Adson,

912
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,930
when we're together,

913
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,420
if he becomes soft,

914
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:14,910
it'll be really interesting.

915
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,800
Wayne reminded me about many things

916
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,170
that were mistakes I had made before or

917
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,200
problems I faced in acting.

918
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,010
They were resolved.

919
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,530
Yes, I'm very happy.

920
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,910
This pair has chemistry.

921
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:33,050
I think it's good. They're pretty natural.

922
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,620
Just from a few shots, it already makes me want to...

923
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,620
And I can tell Adson has experience.

924
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,920
He is relaxed.

925
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,490
Yeah.

926
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,690
Having to act out a shower scene on the first try,

927
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,920
who can relax?

928
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,290
It's really hard.

929
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,380
Because no matter how good your physique is,

930
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,640
you'd still be self-conscious.

931
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,440
So while showering,

932
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,290
you'll scrub really hard, like this.

933
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,000
And look how many people were surrounding him,

934
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,040
watching him shower.

935
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,500
Even if I had to do it now, I'd still feel nervous.

936
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,440
Because you're very exposed and you'll be shy.

937
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,370
(Guei and Chris)

938
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,540
Three, two, one, go.

939
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:10,740
No.

940
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,480
At the start...

941
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,010
Let's not worry about this part first.

942
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,900
We start with stepping left.

943
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,040
On the right.

944
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,640
No, in the beginning.

945
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,430
this is like,

946
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,520
you're the first...

947
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,910
Didn't we say three?

948
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,670
So...

949
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,640
This is one, two, three.

950
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:25,960
Actually, this is just a rough reference.

951
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,300
(30 minutes later...)
Actually, this is just a rough reference.

952
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:28,480
Because when you go on set...
(30 minutes later...)
Actually, this is just a rough reference.

953
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,600
Because when you go on set...

954
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,110
I know. Yes.

955
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,970
It's just a reference for how you'll bump into each other.

956
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,840
And then go through the rest of the script.

957
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,840
Yeah, no need to...

958
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,550
Yes, it's the same.

959
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,480
You shouldn't stop.

960
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,430
So when we get close,

961
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,190
(Stuck in discussion about the position, causing the rehearsal to move slowly)
So when we get close,

962
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,350
do you move first
(Stuck in discussion about the position, causing the rehearsal to move slowly)

963
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,790
and then I move?
(Stuck in discussion about the position, causing the rehearsal to move slowly)

964
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,090
I don't think so.

965
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,440
Because we both step onto the stairs.

966
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,110
But look, if I do this,

967
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,920
I look stupid

968
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,200
and awkward.

969
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,500
But this is just a practice.

970
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,030
I think...

971
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,900
Because it's flat now.

972
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,070
If it were a staircase,

973
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,540
there wouldn't be such a problem.

974
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,000
Because you're going down.

975
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,450
He's trying to convince him, right?

976
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:09,610
(They can't reach a consensus)
He's trying to convince him, right?

977
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:10,380
(They can't reach a consensus)

978
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,580
No one wants to back down.
(They can't reach a consensus)

979
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:11,600
(They can't reach a consensus)

980
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,970
I think this is the scariest.
(They can't reach a consensus)

981
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,730
(They can't reach a consensus)

982
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,030
Just walking normally.

983
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,940
That's more normal, right?

984
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,900
Right?

985
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:26,710
I don't know.

986
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,770
I don't understand what you mean.

987
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,950
No, Chris.

988
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,110
It's that awkward, huh?

989
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:39,740
I think it's probably because it's the first time we're acting

990
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,990
so the positioning was a bit difficult.

991
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,920
I think it was a little difficult.

992
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,050
Okay, I understand.

993
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,540
So we should...

994
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,490
Okay.

995
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,490
Try it.

996
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,280
How to put it? Sometimes, when we're too in sync,

997
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,340
it feels like

998
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,520
I already know what you want to do.

999
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,540
It's like over-predicting.

1000
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,260
Yeah, it would look like both Guei and I knew what's going on.

1001
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,310
(On set, they're still stuck on blocking)
Yeah, it would look like both Guei and I knew what's going on.

1002
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:12,090
(On set, they're still stuck on blocking)

1003
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,540
We need the director to step in

1004
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,610
and coordinate.

1005
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,820
One more time.

1006
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,610
You guys are off-frame.

1007
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:29,960
(Due to positioning issues, rehearsals are progressing slowly)
You guys are off-frame.

1008
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:29,990
(Due to positioning issues, rehearsals are progressing slowly)

1009
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,020
No chemistry.
(Due to positioning issues, rehearsals are progressing slowly)

1010
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:31,690
(Due to positioning issues, rehearsals are progressing slowly)

1011
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:32,730
Okay, cut. One more.
(Due to positioning issues, rehearsals are progressing slowly)

1012
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:33,860
Chris, you were...
(Due to positioning issues, rehearsals are progressing slowly)

1013
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,600
Don't hesitate. Let's go.
(Due to positioning issues, rehearsals are progressing slowly)

1014
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:41,070
(Due to positioning issues, rehearsals are progressing slowly)

1015
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,600
Okay, both of you, take one step back each.

1016
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,940
Let's try the scene again.

1017
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,070
Take a step back.

1018
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,190
(Constant NGs, the two keep getting worse)

1019
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,140
Go up one step.

1020
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,340
Okay.

1021
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,570
What happened just now?

1022
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,820
Weren't you on the same step?

1023
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,610
There's one step between us.

1024
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,080
We couldn't agree on our steps

1025
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,290
He thought they should be more uniform.

1026
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:12,170
I felt I needed to move slowly

1027
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,560
and pace around more messily.

1028
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,880
Yeah. We argued for a long time.

1029
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,140
I was a little unhappy.

1030
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,760
Because I think...

1031
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:20,780
The way he spoke to me,

1032
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,610
the intensity of it felt like

1033
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,180
he was instructing me.

1034
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,850
But I felt like

1035
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:30,170
we should be exploring how to do this,

1036
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,190
instead of oh, I think you should do this.

1037
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,170
At that moment...

1038
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,750
Because I really dislike

1039
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,080
being spoken to in that way,

1040
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:40,130
I got a little annoyed.

1041
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,410
I think the reason we NG-ed so many times

1042
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,430
was because we're both perfectionists.

1043
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,210
At first, we weren't really meeting the director's expectations.

1044
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,900
Yeah, but later on we slowly started to get into the flow.

1045
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,240
When he tilts your chin up,

1046
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,940
that moment should have a bit of...

1047
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,280
Okay, let's go.

1048
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,550
No lack of chemistry this time, please.

1049
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,380
Guei, imagine you're trying to block him.

1050
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,040
Gloating!

1051
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:06,090
(Meeting scene - Adson and Yi Gao's version)
Gloating!

1052
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:06,120
(Meeting scene - Adson and Yi Gao's version)

1053
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,950
What are they doing there?
(Meeting scene - Adson and Yi Gao's version)

1054
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,260
Yes.

1055
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,490
They're spectating.

1056
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:13,960
They're acting too.

1057
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,860
Acting on their own.

1058
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:21,910
(The next scene is even sweeter)

1059
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,770
I think it was tough for this pair.

1060
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,370
Watching others like this... it's really...

1061
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,180
The last pair... really...

1062
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,650
They were supposed to act out a "meet-ing" moment,

1063
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:38,480
but instead,

1064
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,390
it was meeting-NG.

1065
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,110
They kept NG-ing.

1066
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,260
This is a communication issue.

1067
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:45,890
When we're filming,

1068
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,090
it's scary to work with people

1069
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,400
with a strong personal vision

1070
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,730
who tries to control you

1071
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,000
to do everything, right?

1072
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,070
Qiao Qiao, have you experienced it?

1073
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,070
Of course, because everyone has different personalities.

1074
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,600
But I think

1075
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,110
I learned some ways to deal with it.

1076
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,280
For example, if you were someone

1077
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,310
who insists on doing things your way,

1078
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,950
I would say,

1079
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:10,120
Director, let's try Chu's way first.

1080
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,140
Let's do it first.

1081
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,420
(When working with a strong-willed actor, you need to anticipate their thoughts while also showing your own presence)
Let's do it first.

1082
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,650
After that, I'll say,
(When working with a strong-willed actor, you need to anticipate their thoughts while also showing your own presence)

1083
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,190
Chu, can I have a chance
(When working with a strong-willed actor, you need to anticipate their thoughts while also showing your own presence)

1084
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,060
to try it my way too?
(When working with a strong-willed actor, you need to anticipate their thoughts while also showing your own presence)

1085
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,590
That way, both versions are available for the director to choose.

1086
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:22,430
But Guei is a good dancer.

1087
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,030
So I think

1088
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,670
from his experience,

1089
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,670
he felt that that's how he should act.

1090
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,700
I need to take this exact step to this exact spot.

1091
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,900
And Chris may have his own vision too.

1092
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,900
They were discussing for so long

1093
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,770
and they mentioned

1094
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,470
that they're both perfectionists.

1095
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,080
So they had some problems in the discussion.

1096
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,540
But I think

1097
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:41,050
they could become really good friends.

1098
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,020
Yes, they have similar personalities.

1099
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,720
So I'm looking forward to see

1100
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,350
their final result.

1101
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,120
It's possible that

1102
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,760
the result would be perfect because of how hard they worked.

1103
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,590
They did say later that they got into the flow.

1104
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,690
Yes, Guei said they got into it.

1105
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,760
Alright.

1106
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,130
One, two, three.

1107
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,530
Change your poses, alright?

1108
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,530
Okay.

1109
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,500
-I'll send it to you guys.
-Send it to me.

1110
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,470
Add me on LINE.

1111
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,070
Okay, everyone,

1112
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,510
you've all

1113
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,740
worked hard today.

1114
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,710
-Okay...
-You worked the hardest.

1115
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,940
No, I'm fine.

1116
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,320
Today is the second day, right?

1117
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:15,719
It's like the first day of shooting.

1118
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,020
-Filming.
-Yes.

1119
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,179
Did you run into any difficulties

1120
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,489
or obstacles while shooting

1121
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:22,620
your short dramas?

1122
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:25,960
I think I'm not used to

1123
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,130
the camera angles

1124
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,730
and positioning.

1125
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,560
So I really need to get used to it

1126
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,500
and pay attention.

1127
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,040
Fumi and I were throwing a frisbee.

1128
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,300
Every throw was different.

1129
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,739
He probably wishes the frisbee could be fixed.

1130
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:41,630
That would be ideal!

1131
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,880
But these unexpected moments

1132
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:44,449
make it fun, right?

1133
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:44,880
I believe some may be nervous,

1134
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,409
(The struggles during filming will become beautiful memories in the future)
I believe some may be nervous,

1135
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:47,909
while others were fine.
(The struggles during filming will become beautiful memories in the future)

1136
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:48,650
But

00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:49,530
We've arranged a
(The struggles during filming will become beautiful memories in the future)

1139
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:52,120
We've arranged a

1140
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,960
party

1141
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:55,350
for everyone to relax.

1142
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,760
To shake off

1143
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,560
any anxiety

1144
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,830
or exhaustion from today.

1145
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,100
Cheers to today.

1146
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,000
We worked hard.

1147
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:12,180
(Temporarily forget about maintaining our figures and just eat and drink freely!)

1148
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,780
Let’s temporarily forget about maintaining our figures.

1149
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,470
Maintaining a good figure is exhausting.

1150
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,030
Yeah, sometimes just eating a little

1151
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,160
can make your belly pop out.

1152
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,230
By the way,

1153
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,570
is anyone going into the water?

1154
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:45,680
You didn't go into the water that day, with Wayne?

1155
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,810
(Boy who didn't get in the water on Day One)
You didn't go into the water that day, with Wayne?

Yes.

1158
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:48,680
It was so scary.
(Boy who didn't get in the water on Day One)

1159
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,180
It was so scary.

1160
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,430
You can do it.

1161
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:52,820
Those who aren't getting into the water,

1162
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,250
you have to stand at the side and take photos for us.

1163
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,780
No, I'm eating first.

1164
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,720
Yes.

1165
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,720
This is a party.

1166
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,050
Parties are meant to be happy.

1167
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:06,710
What's Chien Yu wearing?

1168
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,380
What's that?

1169
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,570
He’s half-undressed.

1170
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,360
Yeah.

1171
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:16,850
Control your facial expression!

1172
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,670
(With Wayne joining, the water battle reaches a climax)
Control your facial expression!

1173
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,730
Hurry up. What are you doing?
(With Wayne joining, the water battle reaches a climax)

1174
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,380
Go!

1175
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:28,950
(Retreating backwards)
Go!

1176
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,250
(Retreating backwards)

1177
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,900
Watch your back.

1178
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,320
(Chris gets attacked from both sides)

1179
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,820
Go down!
(Chris gets attacked from both sides)

1180
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,400
Let him go down!

1181
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:48,910
Come on.

1182
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,490
(Wayne and Guei vs. Pink and Chien Yu)

1183
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,040
Come on.

1184
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,910
Let go!

1185
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:56,940
Guei, come on.

1186
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,830
(Challenge)
Guei, come on.

1187
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,990
(My neck is about to break!)

1188
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,320
Take off his pants!

1189
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,110
Hurry up!

1190
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:08,540
Be careful. Stay safe.

1191
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,090
(Will Guei, who has a size advantage, successfully pull off Pink's pants?)
Be careful. Stay safe.

1192
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,860
(Will Guei, who has a size advantage, successfully pull off Pink's pants?)

1193
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,890
(Seems like Guei's used up all his strength)
(Will Guei, who has a size advantage, successfully pull off Pink's pants?)

1194
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,930
(Seems like Guei's used up all his strength)

1195
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,260
Actually, boys are quite childish.

1196
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,460
Okay, go on.

1197
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,430
But Pink is surprisingly manly.

1198
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,770
He held on for quite a long time.

1199
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,000
(No matter how tired we were yesterday,)

1200
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,500
(we'll always face challenges together)

1201
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,520
(It's ok)

1202
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,170
(Only excitement remains)

1203
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,310
(A crazy summer!)

1204
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,350
Every time I play this kind of games,

1205
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,080
I don't want to lose.

1206
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,130
I don't want to be the one who falls.

1207
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,690
I feel kinda bad for Chien Yu.

1208
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,530
He was the one supporting me as my "horse".

1209
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,560
We were playing so intensely on top

1210
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,720
while he had to keep holding me up.

1211
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:50,610
I feel like

1212
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:51,790
it was very tiring.

1213
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,240
I was afraid he'd get hurt.

1214
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,060
All I could hear was

1215
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,210
Wayne's cries.

1216
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,720
Hurry up, Guei, I can't hold on any longer!

1217
00:37:58,810 --> 00:37:59,760
I can't hold on any longer!

1218
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,810
I thought it was pretty funny.

1219
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,980
And I think Wayne Ge is really down-to-earth.

1220
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,050
Even though

1221
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,010
we only spent a few hours together,

1222
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,880
he treated us like his buddies.

1223
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,540
I think he's such a great senior.

1224
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,000
(Premiere Screening)

1225
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,880
Are you looking forward to it?
(Premiere Screening)

1226
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,970
I feel so awkward.

1227
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,470
I’m looking forward to your frisbee scene.

1228
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,160
I’m looking forward to Adson.

1229
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,990
You should ask Pink.

1230
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,350
I scrubbed until my skin was almost peeling.

1231
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,280
I washed it about six or seven times.

1232
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,550
Like, my torso.

1233
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,720
So you're complaining?

1234
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,470
No.

1235
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,500
Actually, I feel that

1236
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,380
it's really hard to shoot outdoors.

1237
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,280
It's different.

1238
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,130
So I think I was lucky.

1239
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,310
I kept showering,

1240
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,540
so now I smell very good.

1241
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,110
Why did the camera cut to us?

1242
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,010
Is that all?

1243
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,790
I want to watch what they filmed.

1244
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,190
The films are going to be really, really exciting.

1245
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,410
And most importantly, before each short film plays,

1246
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,750
the guys will introduce it in their own words.

1247
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,210
To capture the vibes they want to convey.

1248
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,810
-Great.
-Ready?

1249
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:54,920
Let's watch.

1250
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,970
(Full of anticipation)
Let's watch.

1251
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,260
Hurry!

1252
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,510
Adson's physique—you have to see it.

1253
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,500
Very sexy.

1254
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,750
Hello?

1255
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,360
How’s my singing?

1256
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,510
Good.

1257
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,370
Looks good.

1258
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,330
Looks good?

1259
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,440
Sounds good.

1260
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,030
(Perfect pitch)

1261
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,680
They're good.

1262
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,570
It's cute.

1263
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,400
It was really fun to watch.

1264
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,820
We all read each other's scripts.

1265
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,160
When I read it,

1266
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,650
I thought it would be funny.

1267
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,380
But after actually watching it,

1268
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,640
the romantic tension is strong.

1269
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,180
Especially...

1270
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,340
Yi's expressions, he looks so shy.

1271
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,550
It was fun to watch.

1272
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,760
He said that and then he

1273
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,390
slowly scanned down

1274
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:37,020
to my towel area.

1275
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,790
And you're very aggressive.

1276
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,790
It was good.

1277
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,690
But I'm curious.

1278
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,660
Was it decided from the start that

1279
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,630
you'd be the one showering

1280
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,970
and you'd be the one watching?

1281
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,030
In the beginning, we chose

1282
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,090
Yi to be the one taking a shower

1283
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,740
and I was the one peeping.

1284
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:55,980
We thought it would create an interesting contrast.

1285
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:58,110
But later, we discussed

1286
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,650
and felt that

1287
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,960
it was better to stick

1288
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,700
to our usual labels

1289
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:04,930
(Shota) (CEO)
to our usual labels

1290
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:05,020
(Shota) (CEO)

1291
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,490
for this role.
(Shota) (CEO)

1292
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,720
I think it would
(Shota) (CEO)

1293
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,410
(Shota) (CEO)

1294
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:09,910
make the scene better.
(Shota) (CEO)

1295
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:10,410
make the scene better.

1296
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,970
But I think Yi was very natural just now.

1297
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,460
He's really cute.

1298
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,290
He had this adorable, clueless look.

1299
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,710
He made me...

1300
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,790
Nervous, you know?

1301
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:20,920
(Shy)
Nervous, you know?

1302
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,410
(Shy)

1303
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:23,480
Were you really nervous?
(Shy)

1304
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:24,870
A little.

1305
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,940
Or were you nervous

1306
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,750
about seeing his body?

1307
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,830
When I heard

1308
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,720
his voice, it made me nervous.

1309
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:34,880
Because this is Yi's first time

1310
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:37,780
filming this kind of drama.

1311
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,320
And it's his first time seeing himself on screen.

1312
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,150
I think...

1313
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,790
he gave me the impression that...

1314
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,860
When the director gave instructions

1315
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,790
on what to do,

1316
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:46,530
he could immediately adjust.

1317
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,830
Actually, we filmed...

1318
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,430
We went through many takes quickly.

1319
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,300
He set the bar really high from the start.

1320
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,770
Yeah.

1321
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,670
So stressful.

1322
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:56,840
We’ve watched one episode already.

1323
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,970
The first one is already so impressive.

1324
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:00,510
It's like a cute little rom-com.

1325
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:02,710
Do you think this film was okay, Niki?

1326
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,640
Does it meet the standard for a BL drama?

1327
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,750
It totally has that contrast between a Shota character and a dominant CEO type.

1328
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:11,380
But I think they actually made it look really natural

1329
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,750
and cute.

1330
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:15,220
Because Yi's feelings were very natural.

1331
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,160
His nervousness...

1332
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,090
Like we said,

1333
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:20,260
he was already a little nervous.

1334
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,430
And then it worked perfectly with the role.

1335
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:23,230
Chu, what do you think?

1336
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:24,200
Like Adson said,

1337
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,670
he has given his 120%.

1338
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,730
Yes, if you can

1339
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:31,400
take your real emotions and channel them into the performance,

1340
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,920
I think that's... very commendable.

1341
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:35,710
He's really great.

1342
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:40,060
Once you fully step into the character,

1343
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,480
you don't have to

1344
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:43,310
force or plan out every little detail.

1345
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:43,980
Naturally.

1346
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,390
Even in their off-screen interactions,

1347
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:49,120
Adson naturally put his hand on him.

1348
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:49,690
Yeah.

1349
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:51,960
When he was reminiscing,

1350
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,190
it was like he really thought of...

1351
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,630
Yes, he got shy.

1352
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,030
When he thought of Adson's body,

1353
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,490
he felt shy.

1354
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,550
Yeah. Poom, do you like their dynamic?

1355
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:01,640
Very much.

1356
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,040
I like their roles too.

1357
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:04,670
Because

1358
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:09,230
I didn't expect them to be so playful.

1359
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,550
Especially...

1360
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,200
Adson.

1361
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,490
Because the first time I saw him,

1362
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,650
I thought he was very composed.

1363
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:19,420
But he's surprisingly humorous.

1364
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:21,250
Second,

1365
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,550
the way they interact off-screen.

1366
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:23,720
They're cute on the screen.

1367
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,410
Their interaction off-screen is very charming too.

1368
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:25,560
(Adson's performance contrasts sharply with his usual tough image, surprising the Auntie Squad)
Their interaction off-screen is very charming too.

1369
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,160
Because when they are together,
(Adson's performance contrasts sharply with his usual tough image, surprising the Auntie Squad)

1370
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,690
I think they are inexplicably cute.
(Adson's performance contrasts sharply with his usual tough image, surprising the Auntie Squad)

1371
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:29,290
Really.
(Adson's performance contrasts sharply with his usual tough image, surprising the Auntie Squad)

1372
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:31,230
Because Adson always had this cool aura.
(Adson's performance contrasts sharply with his usual tough image, surprising the Auntie Squad)

1373
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,390
But when he showered, he was like la la la.
(Adson's performance contrasts sharply with his usual tough image, surprising the Auntie Squad)

1374
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:33,200
But when he showered, he was like la la la.

1375
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,310
Yeah, he was singing.

1376
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,850
Actually, I think their short film

1377
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:41,140
fits our show name, Love Casting.

1378
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:43,500
Yes, because they were cast perfectly.

1379
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,810
It suits them.

1380
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:47,280
So naturally, they look cute.

1381
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,120
Speaking of which, we have two handsome guys here today.

1382
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,120
Should we get them to demonstrate

1383
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,320
this scene?

1384
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,450
Showering?

1385
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:55,450
Yes.

1386
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:59,000
Are you nervous?

1387
00:44:59,350 --> 00:44:59,910
Okay.

1388
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,060
(Action!)

1389
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,610
Music.

1390
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:29,580
(The audience is really excited)

1391
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:29,610
How’s my physique?
(The audience is really excited)

1392
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:32,180
How’s my physique?

1393
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,240
Very good.

1394
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:40,590
Oh gosh!

1395
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,240
Very good.

1396
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,110
They look so good.

1397
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:49,710
They have chemistry.

1398
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:52,580
That was so fun to watch! Let’s move on to the next film.

1399
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:54,010
(Next casting)

1400
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,780
Let’s watch the frisbee scene, the most exhausting one.
(Next casting)

1401
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:59,440
(Next casting)

1402
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,810
(Direct pairing)

1403
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:02,520
Is this our friend?

1404
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,220
(The highly anticipated eighth boy appears)
Is this our friend?

1405
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,010
(The highly anticipated eighth boy appears)

1406
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:06,790
The eighth one?

1407
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:07,790
Really?

1408
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:09,160
Really?

1409
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:09,930
I know him.

1410
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,190
He's famous.

1411
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,610
He's a top.

1412
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:15,860
So this balances everything out.

1413
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:17,440
So I’m curious

1414
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:17,470
what their pairings will look like in the future.

1415
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:19,250
(His arrival)
