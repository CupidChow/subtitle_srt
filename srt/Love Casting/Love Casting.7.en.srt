Me?

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,370
Didn't you say you'll sleep with me for another night?

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,090
Okay, one more night.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,070
I found my baby.

00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,070
Baby?

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,430

Just hold his hand.

16

Here.

17
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,040
Are you tired today?

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,740
Yes.

19
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,680
I was wondering why you weren't back yet.

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,250
In the last episode, we already started seeing some wild developments.

[Auntie Squad: Chu, Ernie Chu]

30
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,490
An iconic moment was born in our show.

31
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,620
That ten-finger handhold.

32
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,570
Yes.

33
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,820
So now there are two pairs

34
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,730
that we think are developing steadily.

35
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,360
Hopefully we'll see even more variety,

36
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,760
or deeper emotional exchanges.

37
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,490
And maybe some on-screen feelings will become real?

38
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,140
Yes, like Pink and Guei.

39
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,240
Because they're sharing a room.

40
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:16,770
Yes.

41
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,810
I really think

42
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,670
they have such lively conversations at night.

43
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,810
Yes. And Guei said

44
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,080
in Pink's eyes, he saw

45
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,980
and felt something.

46
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,420
We need that follow-up,

47
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,850
like, give us a bit more.

48
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,789
Yeah, I hope he really figures out what that something is.

49
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:33,590
Another super cute pair

50
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,390
is our Robert and Chien Yu.

51
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,720
They really feel like an old married couple.

52
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,430
I really like this pair.

53
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,030
Because they've already skipped the ambiguous stage.

54
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,530
So for this episode, we're really looking forward to Chris and Adson.

55
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,770
Hopefully there'll be some new developments.

56
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,729
Maybe the age difference will bring something interesting.

57
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:47,370
Yes.

[Are they going to fight?]

149

Alright, cut.

151
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,790
What were you thinking in that scene?

152
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,260
[Max asks the boys to explain their characters' mindset]

153
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,650
What were your goals?

154
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,040
I imagined him coming in

155
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,400
because I saw him open a door.

156
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,020
He was doing this because...

157
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,880
he felt... I felt like he was trying to

158
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,700
win me back.

159
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,580
But we...

160
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,450
I felt like our relationship is over.

161
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,320
But I still love him.

162
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,930
So at first, when he touched me,

163
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,159
I accepted it.

164
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,159
But then, because I had already made up my mind

165
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:41,409
and decided that we're done,

166
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,659
so I pulled away.

167
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,000
What I was thinking was,

168
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,730
I'm someone with a super busy job.

169
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,200
I want to get warmth and comfort from him,

170
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,510
but he's had enough.

171
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,680
I think we had that emotion.

172
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,950
And we both knew that

173
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,070
this relationship was already unhealthy.

174
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,520
What I saw was

175
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,450
that you weren't receiving each other's emotions.

176
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,310
[They were totally out of sync, unable to accept each other's emotions]

177
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,430
You came in with the energy of wanting to attract him,

178
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,220
but that isn't the real goal.

179
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,580
You acting cutesy with him or him acting cutesy with you

180
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,520
doesn't make a scene.

181
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,230
The scene is about what you need from the other person.

182
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,040
For example,

183
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,790
you want to act cute with him, right?

184
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,990
But your real purpose is to make him love you.

185
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,180
That's how it works.

186
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,200
This is not the only thing you need.

187
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,460
Otherwise, the scene can't continue.

188
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:33,990
So you have to control him.

189
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,570
You want him to hug you,

190
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,810
you want him to love you,

191
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,980
and get close to you.

192
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,620
That should always be in your mind.

193
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,550
Not just walking in and acting cute with him.

194
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,480
In filmmaking, that's not how a scene works.

195
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,210
We should define...

196
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,500
This is just what I learned.

197
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,070
We should define

198
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,020
what we need from the other person,

199
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,740
and what can we do to achieve our goal.

200
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,360
Like this.

201
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,480
[Max demonstrates himself]

202
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,660
Action.

203
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,050
So smooth.

204
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,809
[Conquered]

205
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,190
I think Max is...

206
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,430
well...

207
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,360
it's weird to say this,

208
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,070
but when I act with him, I think he's very charming.

209
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,240
I think he's good at flirting.

210
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,240
In that situation,

211
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,770
you could really feel

212
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,480
as if I had

213
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,500
that kind of ambiguous relationship with him.

214
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,450
He kept telling me that he loves me,

215
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,720
but softly,

216
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,920
that's why I got... a little...

217
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,420
a little bit flustered.

218
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,770
He perfectly demonstrated how to win a guy over in 20 seconds.

219
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,990
Yes.

220
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,130
Without even speaking.

221
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,960
Touching his head...

222
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,970
and the assertiveness in his body language was so clear.

223
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,500
Yes, very assertive.

224
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,400
I think he's very assertive but

225
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,410
he's also warm and wrapping him in love.

226
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,170
It's very intense.

227
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,820
Yes, an intense love.

228
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,930
Yes, he completely surrounded him like this.

229
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,350
Yes, and he kept smiling

230
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,050
like he was trying to infect the other person.

231
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,730
I really want to see your demonstration.

232
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,540
Is that okay?

233
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,450
One of you is angry,

234
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,360
and the other one comes in trying to make up.

235
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,340
[The plot is ready]

236
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,700
Alright, earlier we had Max

237
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,230
acting with one of the trainees.

238
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,430
Now let's have Chu and Poom demonstrate on set.

239
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,830
We’re shipping this CP up close.

240
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,840
[Chu x Poom]

241
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm sorry.

242
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,700
I'm sorry.

243
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,350
Sorry.

244
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,520
Rub your noses together.

245
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,800
Are you okay?

246
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,120
Yeah, I'm okay.

247
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,240
Sorry.

248
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,160
That was a totally different kind of scene.

249
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:46,810
So good.

250
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,180
Good.

251
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,140
Cut!

252
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,110
That felt so emotional.

253
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,050
How is it this kind of direction, it was...

254
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,120
so different from earlier.

255
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,650
There were different layers.

256
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,120
It felt like they’ve been dating for a while.

257
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,350
Very deep feelings.

258
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,160
Not awkward at all.

259
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,860
And Chu cried, he really shed tears.

260
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,110
I didn't.

261
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:06,930
You did.

262
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,330
It was on another level

263
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,970
and you showed us

264
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,500
some subtle expressions and body language.

265

[Chosen numbers: 6 and 8]

268

There's nothing special about this scene.

269

You walk into the scene

270
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,970

271
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,070

He doesn't want to get it dirty.

280

He was.

289
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,130
The best moment was

290
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,170
when Pink took initiative.

291
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,100

Okay.

566
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:18,590
I wanted to show that I was worried and scared.

567
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,690
Then he would come over to comfort me.

568
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,530
His acting was really great and natural.

569
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,200
He gave me all his energy.

570
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,840
It made it easy for me to perform.

571

I gave you guys the moves,

572
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,670
but actually, a scene has many moves.

573
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:38,260
So let me show you first.

574
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,780
What happens if we combine all the moves?

575
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,450
You'll have to choreograph it yourselves.

576

So good.

584
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,710
Every move he did…

585
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:43,040
He made me feel like

586
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,510
he really touched me emotionally.

587
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,810
I honestly felt like

588
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,680
I almost really fell for him.

589
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,990
He was seriously flirting with me.

590
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,620
He made me realize what it's like to have a

591
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,060
really good co-actor.

592
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,020
I felt that whenever he stepped in,

593
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:02,330
he would guide our co-actor.

594
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,770
He wasn't in a rush to do anything

595
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,500
or impose his own way.

596
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,000
Even if he wasn't the one to start,

597
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,470
he would wait for you to give him something,

598
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,410
and then he'd immediately respond.

599
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,380
I think over the past few days, all of us have sometimes

600
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,380
been too focused on sticking to our own things,

601
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,750
and it felt like we weren't even doing the same scene.

602
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,480
But today, I saw a lot of strengths

603
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,020
in him in this area.

604
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,390
Amazing.

607
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,500

609
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,910

I have to watch it again

611
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,990
and use it on my husband.

612
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Even I want to learn it.

613
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,770
One day, catch him off guard

614
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,970
and just smoothly slide in like that.

615
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,470
Yeah, and hold his hand.

616
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,770
Exactly. What I think is impressive about him

617
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,710
is that he first took his hand,

618
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,480
like "Let me teach you."

619
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,680
And while teaching, he just smoothly slid up.

620
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,530
Oh my god.

621
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,260
It was such a moment.

622
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,820
And the student surpassed the master.

623
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,020
Our students even invented a new version of wall-kabe—

624
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,660
floor-kabe.

625
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,860
Because normally it's wall-kabe,

626
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,190
but theirs is floor-kabe.

627
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,990
It's somewhere between romantic and comedic.

628
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,160
Because with floor-kabe,

629
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,860
it's hard to look cool.

Yeah, Chien Yu is perfect for it.

635

But I think just now

636

they gave a great demonstration of one thing.

637
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,780
If the CP doesn't match,

638
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,110
it's going to end up like the tragic scenes we just saw.

639

Because we saw many scenes we wanted to see,

640

I had no experience with LGBTQ.

But when I started performing,

650

I realized it had nothing to do with LGBTQ.

There's one more thing I want to tell you.

654

Natural expression is the most important.

The more natural it looks, the more attractive it will be.

656
