00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,110
So they want to keep

186
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,980
pairing us together.

187
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,080
Because up to this point,

188
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,220
I've only roomed with Pink and Robert.

189
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,490
Right.

190
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:01,970
[Up until Day 5, Chien Yu has only shared rooms with Pink and Robert]

191
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,159
Yes.

192
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,409
Yes, he hasn't switched roommates.

193
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,640
Even the production crew is surprised.

194
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,630
It's been five nights.

195
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,380
Yes.

196
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,120
I slept alone on the first night.

197
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,060
So I want to get to know the others more.

198
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,530
I didn't even get a chance.

199
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,220
I'm not unhappy.

200
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,900
Because with him, I think we have a little...

201
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,140
Nah.

202
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:11,900
I was actually guessing that

203
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,740
I might room with Pink.

204
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,320
Because I talked to him today.

205
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,240
But in the end, fate still brought me back to Chien Yu.

206
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,150
[So far, Robert has only ever roomed with Chien Yu]

207
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,500
This time, I'll be rooming with Yi again, just like on Day 1.

208
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:26,590
[Adson is looking forward to sleeping with Yi tonight]

209
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,780
From the first day up until now.

210
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,820
We've always had good chemistry,

211
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,720
I think.

212
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,650
And we're both kinda weird.

213
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,890
We're both Aquariuses.

214
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:33,240
Not weird,

215
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,560
we both have our own quirky, independent styles.

216
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,159
So I think living with him again

217
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:41,330
will be fun.

218
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,060
Everyone is chatting, right?

219
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,840
Where did they go?

220
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,050
Everyone seems to love the tatami room.

221
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,240
Chien Yu and Robert already give off strong couple vibes.

222
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,980
I think that CP energy is like,

223
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,040
even if they want to get to know other people,

224
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,310
or explore different choices,

225
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,450
the CP energy is too strong.

226
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,680
Whenever people see the two of them together,

227
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,490
they're happy.

228
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,620
Yeah.

229
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,990
So I think when they interact,

230
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,220
or if they still have a chance

231
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,090
to act in a project together again, it would be appealing.

232
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:22,690
Yeah.

233
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,830
They are also suitable for the classic bickering couple type.

234
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:29,340
[They're proof that enemies make the best lovers]

235
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,600
When they talk,

236
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,370
they always end up in that kind of dynamic.

237
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,370
They already have amazing chemistry.

238
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,870
Yeah, it's already like this without acting.

239
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,740
But the most interesting thing is that Yi chose Adson.

240
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,740
After he changed the pairings,

241
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,510
he said this was the best situation and best CP in his mind.

242
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,780
Because during the process, he's tried, in practice,

243
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,950
or in classes with Max,

244
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,220
or being paired with various people.

245
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,650
In the end, he chose Adson.

246
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,250
Yeah.

247
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,570
But I have to say, the scene he did with Adson...

248
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:57,890
[After interacting with the other boys, Yi decides to room with Adson tonight]

249
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,610
The bath scene...

250
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,460
Yes, the bath scene was really great.

251
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,530
Their chemistry, their teamwork, was enjoyable to watch.

252
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,760
But I think the reason why they look so good together,

253
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,990
how I'd explain it is that

254
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,790
Yi has this childlike innocence.

255
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,120
He likes to try many things.

256
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,620
Yeah. And Adson is like a big brother.

257
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,980
So when Yi tries something,

258
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,090
like when he took an egg

259
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,350
and hit Adson's head with it,

260
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,800
Adson was just like oh.

261
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,650
He didn't do much.

262
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,210
He even pointed it out to the others, like, look, he hit me with an egg.

263
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,690
And the egg was still on him.

264
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,320
Yeah, so between the two of them,

265
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,970
one can take care of Yi

266
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,039
and the other can be willful.

267
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,809
Now that you mention it,

268
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:43,570
I have so many images of them in my mind.

269
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,140
Yeah.

270
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,500
Like when Yi was pressing down on Adson on the bed.

271
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,180
Yes.

272
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,780
And when they were in front of the bookshelf,

273
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,180
pretending to kiss.

274
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,820
Yes. And when others were rehearsing,

275
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,790
they were copying and acting the same things out.

276
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,020
The same scenes.

277
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,990
Those clips could be cut into an entire episode.

278
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,220
Yes, they are quite cute.

279
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,190
I think they also have strong couple vibes.

280
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,230
And Robert and Chien Yu also give off strong CP vibes.

281
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,800
The others are still figuring each other out.

282
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,500
But Guei and Pink also have a pretty good vibe going.

283
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,230
I think both of them are okay too.

284
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,840
In their last rehearsal clip,

285
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,470
the way they looked at each other had strong couple vibes.

286
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,370
I think Pink

287
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,210
has a strong presence.

288
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,680
For example, when he tried it on Adson,

289
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,140
it wasn't really obvious.

290
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,850
But his balance of softness and strength

291
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,220
when paired with Guei, is quite complementary.

292
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,180
It's a good match.

293
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,690
[Day 6: The final chance for an outing together]

294
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,500
[Cool and stylish]

295
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:58,670
[Three cars, each headed to a different destination. The boys are free to choose whichever one they want to get in]

296
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,190
No way you're making someone else drive, right, Adson?

297
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,230
No, Adson must be driving today.

298
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,400
We just said that.

299
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,430
He wants someone else to drive.

300
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,360
He wants to take the front seat.

301
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,470
No, he's choosing a car.

302
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,840
[After hesitating, Adson walks back to the driver's seat of the first car]

303
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:41,070
[Who will ride with Adson?]

304
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:05,500
[Guei walks straight to the driver's seat of the second car]

305
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,750
Which one will Chris choose?

306
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,640
It's you.

307
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,380
[Chris picks the second car, sharing a ride with Guei again]

308
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,560
Nice.

309
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,070
He can't see inside, you only know when you get in.

310
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,570
Wait, could there be no room for your bag?

311
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,520
Maybe.

312
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,350
I was going to take the front seat

313
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,710
but then I was like nah, forget it.

314
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,810
Passing this.

315
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,330
Why don't you take the front seat? You don't want to navigate?

316
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,260
That's right, it's great to sit in the back and scroll on my phone.

317
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,400
Did he choose the third one?

318
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,540
I think he will choose the back seat.

319
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,530
Yeah.

320
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,570
Yes.

[Chien Yu picks the third car. He's currently the only one in it]

322

I'm not driving this by myself, right?

323
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,790
Should I get in?

324
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,240
What's going on? I'm the only one in here.

325
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,750
I can't drive.

00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,440
[Panic ensues]

327
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,520
I can't drive.

328
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,600
[Fumi walks straight to the front passenger seat of the third car]

329
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,350
We have to hide!

330
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,110
I didn't even look.

331
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,290
I said I won't look.

332
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,150
I thought I was cool.

333
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,650
I said I won't look! I want the last one.

334
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,270
But I realized,

335
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,830
only Adson and Chris...

336
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:43,830
Who's Adson with?

337

Guei and Chris, right?

338
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,390
But they seem to have drivers.

339
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,340
But we don't seem to.

340
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,170
None of us can.

341
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,190
Can you drive?

342
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,260
I...

343
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,690
Let's hide. Don't let him see us.

344
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,660
Okay, duck down.

345
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,430

346
00:12:59,450 --> 00:12:59,990
Robert.

347
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,620
He can probably drive.

348

[Will Robert head to the third car where Chien Yu is?]

349
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,820

He's going to faint.

352
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,180
How could they split up this CP?

353
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,350
There are only two days left.

354
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,830
They don't know who's in it.

355
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,560
They're choosing randomly.

356
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,800
It's really a matter of probability.

357
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,830
And in the third car,

358
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,430

359
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,700

Can he see inside?

366
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,910
I don't know if he can.

367
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,600
We were just talking about him, and he's back.

368
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,490
We were just talking about you.

369
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,280
We said, Pink left us.

370
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,760
You walked away and then you came back.

371
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,260
Yes.

372
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,260
I also walked past and came back.

373
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,860
I wanted to see who's inside.

374
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,660
Can you see?

375
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,560
Yes.

376
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,330
Really?

377
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,130
You couldn't?

378
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,000
You just got in without looking?

379
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,630
I couldn't see.

380
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,430
I didn't.

381
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,170
Because I was far away,

382
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,540
so I couldn't see at all.

383
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,970
No, these are tinted windows, they're heat-reflective, you can't see in.

384
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,040
What's he even trying to see? He was the first one, he couldn't see anything.

385
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,910
He's so funny even when he's not trying.

386
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:06,210
[The last one, Yi, carefully checks who's in each car]

387
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,390
[Come on]

388
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,670
[Calling him over]

389
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,680
What if it's just the two of us in this car?

390
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,180
Will we be so lonely?

391
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,010
Who's left after him? Just Yi, right?

392
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,340
Yi can't drive, right?

393
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,710
How can he peek?

394
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,180
That's right. This is cheating.

395
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,570
I need to stop him.

396
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,890
Why are they hiding?

397
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,460
This car feels like it's gonna be fun.

398
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,400
What are they doing?

399
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,320
He left.

400
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,580
Where did he go? Did he walk away?

401
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,770
[Which car will Yi choose?]

402
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,760
One, two.

403
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,820
Come on, baby.

404
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,560
What's up?

405
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,350
You want to drive?

406
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,650
What's wrong?

407
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,920
[A series of miscommunication begins]

408
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,460
That one's got a lot of people.

409
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,220
Are you guys going on a date?

410
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,220
Yes, we want to.

411
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,960
You guys want to date?

412
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,670
[Bye]

413
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,710
The first car then.

414
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,290
See?

415
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,630
Two against two.

416
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,990
Two against two.

417
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:23,880
Nice.

418
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,540
I knew you would choose me.

419
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,500
Everyone I've wanted to choose so far hasn't disappointed me.

420
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,300
I love you.

421
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,330
I love you too.

422
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,180
You look handsome today.

423
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,350
You too.

424
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,480
Like Ken.

425
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,520
Yours is big.

426
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,450
No.

427
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,450
Your outfit is really stylish. Like, some people wear it,

428
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:48,900
[Only Pink can pull off Pink's style]

429
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,290
say you or me,

430
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:44,820
it would look disgusting.

431
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,420
So disgusting.

432
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,160
What are you guys doing?

433
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,480
Just say you're gross, why drag me in?

434
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,500
No.

435
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,310
They're heading out.

436
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,280
This is fun.

437
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,480
Even picking cars is this entertaining.

438
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,250
Because they're close now.

439
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,920
It's just a bunch of goofy guys hanging out.

440
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,720
Yes.

441
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,490
Childish kids.

442
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:19,260
But today is their last day together.

443
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,020
He's crying.

444
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,230
Poom, your favorite CP got split up.

445
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:28,130
[Robert and Chien Yu have finally broken their streak, riding in separate cars]

446
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,859
It's okay.

447
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,670
So sad.

448
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,700
It's okay. The day after tomorrow, they'll be making their confessions.

449
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,440
So before that, of course there's going to be

450
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,610
some ups and downs, or a bit of build-up

451
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,610
so the feelings will be stronger.

452
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,910
Today is the sixth day.

453
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,850
So it's their last day together.

454
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,420
It's really fast.

455
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,050
So today is very important.

456
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,920
Tonight, right?

457
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,190
They're spending a whole day together.

458
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,920
Every minute and every second is precious.

459
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,990
Their time together in the cars, spending the day,

460
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,510
then splitting rooms at night.

461
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,160
And then tomorrow, they’ll be filming the confession scenes.

462
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,120
We'll see which couple ends up having the strongest connection.

463
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,140
Now, Robert and Chien Yu are separated.

464
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,890
But they seem to be steady.

465
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,270
They're in different cars, but...

466
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,570
Robert and Chien Yu.

467
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,040
But sometimes when you get separated,

468
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,710
you unexpectedly realize

469
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,880
that there are some other good partners out there.

470
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,640
[Absolutely not]

471
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,920
But there are also people like Yi

472
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,790
who's gone around in circles.

473
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,790
Because you need to notice

474
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,490
how, in their daily life,

475
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,620
he's almost always with Chien Yu.

476
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,760
They were inseparable.

477
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,400
But today, when he got in Adson's car,

478
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,470
he felt different, right?

479
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,510
Even though it's been five days for everyone else,

480
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,880
it's only been three days for me.

481
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,350
In the next two days,

482
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,420
I really hope to have

483
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:48,810
[Robert hopes to interact more with the other boys]

484
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,820
more interactions with the other six.

485
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,820
Because I've only shared rooms

486
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,430
with Pink and Robert.

487
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,260
So I want to know more about others,

488
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,820
but I didn't have a chance.

489
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,890
I'm not worried.

490
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,440
He doesn't like it.

491
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,630
[I'm not worried]

492
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,660
He won't agree.

493
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,760
He's not worried.

494
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,700
He thinks they'll still end up together.

495
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,220
They'll still end up together and he won't fall for Adson.

496
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,330
That's right.

497
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,940
Okay, let's keep watching.

498
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,900
Where do you think we might go?

499
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:25,910
[Robert, Adson, Pink, and Yi are in the same car discussing where they might be going]

500
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,450
Didn't he say hiking?

501
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,180
Really?

502
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,920
I think he lied to us.

503
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,620
Yeah, how could we all go hiking?

504
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,820
Hiking?

505
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,800
Yeah, hiking.

506
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,790
He said it was fun.

507
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,630
Maybe we're going to an amusement park?

508
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,960
I don't think so.

509
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,930
10 minutes is quite close. There's no mountain ahead.

510
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:38,760
Yes.

511
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,830
11 minutes.

512
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,560
Amusement park?

513
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,620
Is there an amusement park here?

514
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,800
There isn't an amusement park in Yi Lan.

515
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,000
Yi Lan, I don't think so.

516
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,140
Yi Lan does have the arts center,

517
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,110
the National Center for Traditional Arts, but it can't be that near.

518
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,490
Maybe we're going to play volleyball,

519
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,940
like on the beach.

520
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,810
Really?

521
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:56,870
I think so too.

522
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,600
Maybe.

523
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,120
It's the second last day.

524
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:04,410
[Fumi and Chien Yu are in the same car]

525
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,610
So fast.

526
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,540
It just passed so fast.

527
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,520
Really.

528
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,120
Yesterday I suggested to the production team

529
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,690
for us to get together later in the evening,

530
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,600
maybe have a few drinks and have deep talks.

531
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,770
Don't you think that would be such a...

532
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:15,730
The last...

533
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,030
Yeah, we need...

534
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,740
A farewell or...

535
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:23,110
Or maybe something that would help ease into the confessions the next day.

536
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,870
Why?

537
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,710
Because I think, for me personally,

538
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:37,780
[Chien Yu hopes to connect with more of the boys on the last night to help with his final choice]

539
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,280
I think at night,

540
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,490
like late at night,

541
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,620
people tend to let their guard down so it's easier to talk.

542
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,650
Indeed.

543
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,320
Yeah, and you can see

544
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,920
their softer side.

545
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,020
Yes, indeed.

546
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,720
The final part of the show is definitely going to be confessions, right?

547
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,910
[Chris and Guei are in the same car]

548
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,810
Yes, it should be a choice or...

549
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,130
I don't know what to do.

550
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,960
I have no idea.

551
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,420
[Struggling]

552
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
I...

553
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,800
I kind of have an idea... but I'm not totally...

554
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,740
sure yet.

555
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,300
Because I think...

556
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,940
But what if we all don't match?

557
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,740
We should at least get along well.

558
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:03,420
[Chris and Guei are both struggling to choose who to confess to]

559
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,370
Yes, that's right.

560
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,620
I was thinking about this.

561
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,120
Do you already have someone in mind?

562
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,830
I feel most comfortable with Adson.

563
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,760
But we're weird together.

564
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:13,260
[Guei is considering Adson as one of his confession choices]

565
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,760
No, it's not.

566
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,490
Really?

567
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,540
No.

568
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,360
Then who do you think I have the best chemistry with?

569
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,930
I think it's me and Adson.

570
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,200
I mean, just based on looks, putting everything else aside.

571
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:27,860
[Guei thinks that if judging by looks alone, Chris would best match with either Adson or himself]

572
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,930
You mean me with you guys?

573
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,700
Me with you, or you and Adson.

574
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,760
Really?

575
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,580
I think it's really fun between me and Adson.

576
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,580
Yeah, it should be good.

577
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,600
Because we can...

578
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,880
He will tease me, but I will tease him too.

579
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,950
We can also talk about

580
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,920
serious and weird things.

581
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,720
From their first night.

582
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,890
Yes, from their first time sleeping together.

583
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,060
Yes.

584
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,990
They can finally had a good conversation.

585
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,450
Very opinionated people.

586
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,000
I really want to act with him.

587
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,230
Because I didn't have the chance to act with him.

588
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,820
I think he's someone who could tell me

589
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:02,140
[Chris expresses regret at not having had a chance to act with Adson]

590
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,370
how to handle a scene.

591
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,270
Yeah.

592
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,310
But I really think

593
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,640
the most entertaining pair

594
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,250
in the entire show is the one with Chien Yu.

595
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,210
Yes, they're really funny.

596
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,420
They are really...

597
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,880
Their fights are really funny.

598
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,070
Flirty banter.

599
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,590
Yes, really.

600
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,760
They give off super strong couple vibes.

601
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,660
Really.

602
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,060
I think when you like someone,

603
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,730
or if you want to get along with someone,

604
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,630
you don't have to be connected

605
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,260
all the time.

606
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,700
I thought it would be tiring to keep that connection,

607
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:35,590
[Fumi and Chien Yu share their views on relationships]

608
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,070
and later on, you'll just run out of things to talk about.

609
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:35,040
Yeah, sometimes I think we still need to give ourselves

610
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,910
-and others some space...
-Space to be alone.

611
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,280
Something really important to me is,

612
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,710
if it's a friend where

613
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,780
we haven't been in touch for a long time,

614
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,420
and we didn't text or talk,

615
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,150
but when we meet up,

616
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,920
we can still talk like nothing changed

617
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,920
and talk about a lot of things,

618
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,390
this kind of friend is really important to me.

619
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,530
Really.

620
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,530
Up to now, I've only had one friend like that.

621
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:58,230
Really?

622
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,200
I think so.

623
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,860
How did you sleep last night, Robert?

624
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,130
I slept... pretty well.

625
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,750
Chris wouldn't go back to the room.

626
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,880
Chien Yu said you seemed unhappy.

627
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,240
Was it because the conversation went on too long and kept you up?

628
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,310
Yes.

629
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,630
I lost a little bit of sleep.

630
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,580
Just a little?

631
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,050
Yes, a little.

632
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:20,180
Actually, I only lost like half an hour or an hour of sleep.

633
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,890
Were you super annoyed?

634
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:22,590
No.

635
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,290
No.

636
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,990
Martial arts studio.

637
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,130
Wait, can I not go?

638
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,200
Can I play ball instead?

639
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,830
[A serious-looking man watches the two of them intently]

640
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,590
Welcome.

641
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
Hello.

642
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,830
Let's move this way.

643
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,600
Hello.

644
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,770
We've already prepared your karate uniforms.

645
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,580
Over there.

646
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,370
Okay.

647
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,050
Alright, next, before class begins we have a ritual.

648
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,820
Seated meditation.

649
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,120
That means...

650
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,680
Come on. Follow me.

651
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,050
Kneel with your left knee, then your right.

652
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,570
Overlap the back of your feet,

653
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,220
then sit down and keep your back straight like this.

654
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,410
For boys, knees apart. For girls, knees together.

655
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,030
Open your legs like this.

656
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:10,730
[Karate practice begins and ends with a greeting]

657
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,760
No, you need to overlap the back of your feet.

658
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,910
Press the back of your foot down. Yes, sit on them.

659
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,160
Like this.

660
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,440
Overlap them like that and sit on them.

661
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,610
Chest up.

662
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,360
Close your eyes now.

663
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,670
At this point, the instructor would say,

664
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,940
we're getting ready for class.

665
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,350
We need to focus.

666
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,610
Let's take a deep breath.

667
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,110
Wait. Let me switch legs.

668
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,610
Close your eyes. Inhale, exhale through your mouth.

669
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,970
Inhale, exhale.

670
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,360
Inhale, exhale.

671
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,940
Then come again. Okay, open your eyes.

672
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,720
Next, when we bow, you start from here.

673
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,900
Bow to each other.

674
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:38,800
Osu.

675
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,610
Osu.

676
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,830
You say osu when bowing to each other.

677
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,830
In the world of karate, osu is

678
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,600
a respectful term used for elders.

679
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,870
When you're asked to take something,

680
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:46,800
or when you greet the coach,

681
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,260
you must say "osu."

682
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,820
Right, when saluting, you say "osu."

683
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,710
Alright, now stand up.

684
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,010
Stand up.

685
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:54,930
Alright. Now attention.

686
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,330
Salute.

687
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,520
Okay, now let's get ready for warm-up.

688
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,080
Okay.

689
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,850
Okay.

690
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,010
Martial arts training.

691
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,760
Sometimes, because of the needs of different scenes,

692
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,720
you have to do many kinds of training.

693
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,500
Osu.

694
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,430
Are you two going to fight?

695
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,360
Fight.

696
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,130
Osu.

697
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,000
Have you learned it before, Chu?

698
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,120
I learned Taekwondo.

699
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,500
Taekwondo?

700
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,670
That's amazing.

701
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,170
Can you kick, jump,

702
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,140
and break wooden boards?

703
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,110
Can you show us a couple of moves?

704
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,940
Let us see. Yes.

705
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,740
A couple of moves?

706
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,910
The kicks in Taekwondo are really powerful.

707
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,580
Will my pants rip?

708
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,110
I don't think so.

709
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,120
I'm okay with it if they rip.

710
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:36,080
[It seems everyone is looking forward to Chu's pants ripping]

711
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,750
Yeah, we want to see them rip.

712
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,120
So what if they rip?

713
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,190
Like this.

714
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,790
Is it okay for you to do it here?

715
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:38,720
I'm going to kick now.

716
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,360
Okay.

717
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,960
That seemed pretty powerful.

718
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,490
This was a spinning kick.

719
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,690
I always thought the sound of the kick

720
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,060
was added in post-production.

721
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,100
But when you kicked just now, there was already that "whoosh" sound.

722
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:48,930
The sound of wind.

723
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,930
And you can pull it back very strongly.

724
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,000
When we used to compete, we'd grab the sleeves.

725
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,610
Because when you punch, you need to make that sound.

726
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:57,870
So when we throw punches...

727
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:00,440
We would prepare in parallel.

728
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,810
Then like this.

729
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,980
There was the sound.

730
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,850
Right, so we would deliberately grab the sleeves like this

731
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,740
to make the sound louder.

732
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,590
It's to scare the opponent.

If you had practiced more earlier,

769

00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,890
Yes, exhale, inhale, exhale.

922
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,460
And with each exhale, go deeper. Down.

923
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,360
We will do this stretch 20 times.

924
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,920
It's a dynamic exercise.

925
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,880
[20 times is too much]

926
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,490
I'm about to get a cramp. Is that normal?

927
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:00,840
[Cramp]

928
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,000
Take it slow, and continue after the cramp is gone.

929
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,630
Now bend your leg, hook your ankle.

930
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:07,300
Knee bent, hook your ankle.

931
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,770
Push your foot like you're pressing the brakes and reaching to the sky.

932
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:14,210
Both hands go forward and push your thighs outward.

933
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,920
Keep your breathing steady.

934
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,890
[Little hands struggling forward]

935
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,050
Good. Five,

936
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,860
four...

937
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:26,820
Feel the stretch in your inner thighs.

938
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,620
Yes.

939
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,230
It's very sore.

940
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,140
Very tight.

941
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:34,140
Yes. Push your thighs further out.

942
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,430
Further?

943
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:37,350
[I can't]

944
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,120
I can't.

945
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,940
Okay, let's stop here.

946
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,160
Four...

947
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,770
three...

948
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,370
two...

949
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,580
one. Breathe in and lift your body.

950
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:52,380
Good.

951
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,800
[Finally]

952
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:53,780
I'm already sweating.

953
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:54,460
Side.

954
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,750
Cross the leg behind and lift it sideways.

955
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,150
Step behind, then lift straight up.

956
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,860
Yes.

957
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,520
Make sure your foot goes straight up.

958
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,340
[It's just the first move]

959
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,150
Okay.

960
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,490
Go straight up.

961
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,650
Alright, switch sides.

962
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
Switch sides and do it again. Come on, cross behind.

963
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,300
No, face that way, then switch feet.

964
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:10,630
Yes, cross behind.

965
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,980
Then lift up your foot.

966
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,120
[Self-added sound effects]

967
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:13,909
Cross behind and lift your foot.

968
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:14,659
It hurts.

969
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:15,889
When lifting the foot, come on.

970
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,070
You lifted your foot wrong.

971
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,900
You lifted your foot wrong.

972
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,590
Yes, cross behind first, step behind.

973
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,860
Lift it up, give me that foot.

974
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,650
I think Chris has difficulty telling left from right.

975
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,600
Just go straight up here. Straight up.

976
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,900
Okay?

977
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,710
[Guei and Chris have weak inner thigh muscles]

978
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,460
I think this exercise is cool.

979
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,770
Actually, I've always wanted to try it.

980
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,330
In my impression,

981
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:37,940
it's more like wrestling

982
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,770
or taekwondo.

983
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,969
You might get hurt.

984
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:43,440
I think I learned it seriously

985
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,810
and it was fun.

986
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:49,080
It's just that I'm not coordinated.

987
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,150
So the movements

988
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,250
might look a bit funny.

989
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:55,670
[Robbing while kicking]

990
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,690
I might need more time to learn it.

991
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,810
Next, split kick.

992
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:58,480
Next, we'll do split kicks.

993
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,130
Okay.

994
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:03,120
I brought the split kick helper for you.

995
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,690
[These two are not surprised by the coach's instructions]

996
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,320
So we'll do it over there.

997
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,990
What's a split kick helper?

998
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,590
Now we'll put this plate on the floor.

999
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,800
[A little flustered]

1000
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,770
Then place both feet on the plate.

1001
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,700
You might need to move over a bit.

1002
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,700
Otherwise, you'll bump into each other.

1003
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,270
Okay.

1004
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,810
It's okay now.

1005
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,730
Are these pants okay?

1006
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:17,520
No problem.

1007
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:20,500
First, grab the mat with your hands.

1008
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,640
When your feet start to slide apart,

1009
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,240
try to keep your feet close to the mat.

1010
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:23,910
Okay.

1011
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,940
Slowly slide them apart. You can slowly slide them apart by yourself.

1012
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,100
Slowly. Be careful.

1013
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,440
Keep your feet near the mat.

1014
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,880
Actually, it's really slippery.

1015
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,780
Move forward.

1016
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,150
I can't do it anymore.

1017
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,100
Me too.

1018
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,570
Move forward. Not like this. To the side.

1019
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,490
Hold on.

1020
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,360
Hang in there.

1021
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,190
Can you do it?

1022
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,130
No.

1023
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,460
It's sliding apart, right?

1024
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,110
Count it yourself.

1025
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:45,220
Count to 30, and we're done.

1026
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:48,730
Okay?

1027
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,010
It's sliding apart, right?

1028
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,300
Feels good, huh?

1029
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:53,730
Quite comfortable.

1030
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,930
[Uncomfortable]

1031
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,710
Let them go, teacher.

1032
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,080
Make it five seconds.

1033
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,740
Chris is shaking his head. He's uncomfortable.

1034
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,740
How do we get up?

1035
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,180
How do we get up?

1036
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,380
Just stand up directly.

1037
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,720
Or pull your feet back and squeeze them together.

1038
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,620
Then you'll be in a squat position, and then you can stand up.

1039
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,250
[My back]

1040
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,590
Is my face red now?

1041
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:13,590
Yes.

1042
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,360
Okay, now let's put these away.

1043
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,560
Then we'll do the next move.

1044
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,580
Okay, now move your knees to the left.

1045
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,330
We're going to do a twist.

1046
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:25,020
Both hands go behind you.

1047
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,040
Your feet should stay planted firmly.

1048
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,500
Is there a problem with the angle?

1049
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,770
Yes, your right leg's thigh...

1050
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,940
Try not to let the right thigh slide forward.

1051
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,880
So, use your left foot to hold it in place.

1052
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,900
Now, move both hands backward.

1053
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,190
I can't help but want to follow along and do it too.

1054
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,160
This feels so good.

1055
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:45,230
Yes, you'll feel really good later.

1056
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,760
Okay. Then...

1057
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,020
I think you're all doing well with your movements.

1058
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,690
Elbows on the floor.

1059
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,600
I can't get my elbows on the floor.

1060
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:53,980
You can do it.

1061
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,130
Why can you do it?

1062
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,030
Let me help you.

1063
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,900
I can do this.

1064
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,540
How can you touch the floor?

1065
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,240
Put your right hand here.

1066
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,530
Good, after placing it, you need to use your left shoulder

1067
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,660
to reach for your elbow.

1068
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,580
Left shoulder to reach? How?

1069
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,040
Don't move your hand.

1070
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,360
[The teacher is trying to adjust Chien Yu's body, which is as stiff as a rock]

1071

Move your shoulder to...

1072
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,710
Your hands are too far apart.

1073
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,530
Do they need to be vertical?

1074
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,820
Yes, and then try to pull it to your left as much as you can.

1075
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,520
You're good at twisting.

1076
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:24,620
[Fumi's lower body flexibility isn't great, but his upper body twisting is excellent]

1077
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,590
Yeah.

1078
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,660
But your hip external rotation is not okay.

1079
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:28,130
Is it normal to feel a stretch in the waist area?

1080
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,900
Yes, you need to open up that area.

1081
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:34,970
[You can watch and practice these stretches at the same time]

1082
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,370
This way, when we go into the air later,

1083
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,840
it will be less likely to cause injury.

1084
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,170
Okay, now you can extend your left hand.

1085
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,480
Put your right hand...

1086
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,880
Put your right hand...

1088
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,680
Put your right hand here.

1089
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,540
Do it.

1090
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,380
Yes, slowly go down!

00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,510
There's still the other foot.

1105
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,620
I just want to loosen one side.

1106
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,690
No, God gave us two legs.

1107
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,860
[Please spare us...]

1108
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:29,670
So we have to fix them.

1109
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,370
I think this group looks really painful to watch.

1110
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,600
In just the warm-up, they are already like this.

1111
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,560
It looks really painful.

1112
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,570
Practicing yoga really makes your whole body tighten up,

1113
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,010
all tangled together.

1114
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:41,270
And it's really painful for the people with stiff muscles and bones.

1115
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,100
Yes.

1116
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,070
Because actors often have to be in different...

1117
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,080
Like earlier, there were martial arts and aerial yoga.

1118
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,810
It's really important to understand how to use your body.

1119
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,510
This way, you won't just stand there nervously

1120
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,630
[Actors need to develop their bodies and know how to use them to help with their performances]

1121
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,280
and get through your lines,

1122
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,850
with no natural movements.

1123
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:56,320
You just said Fumi needs to stretch properly, right?

1124
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,950
Everyone has their own range of flexibility.

1125
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,920
But when I looked at Fumi,

1126
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,060
I wanted to tell him to come find me.

1127
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,060
I could teach him some...

1128
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,760
or I could send him some simple videos to watch.

1129
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,030
At least he needs to have a normal range

1130
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,800
of flexibility in his hamstrings.

1131
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,770
Because they're already very tight even before he bends much.

1132
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:21,910
[This show not only brings the joy of shipping but also teaches health tips]

1133
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:18,470
This tightness starts from the hamstrings and runs all the way up to the hips and lower back.

1134
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,210
So the lower back will be more prone to pain.

1135
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:20,880
Yes.

1136
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,550
I see.

1137
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,680
And it's not just Fumi.

1138
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,880
All four of us here have pretty much the same problem.

1139
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,250
Yeah, I think I have it too.

1140
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,480
I think I have it too.

1141
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,520
But do you think this pair has chemistry?

1142
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,460
It doesn't seem obvious right now, does it?

1143
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,160
It doesn't seem like it, right?

1144
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,830
It feels more like two good friends

1145
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,370
doing aerial yoga together.

1146
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:39,600
Yes.

1147
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,160
I don't think they have any chemistry.

1148
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,540
They're just really good friends.

1149
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,640
But the dynamic between Chris and Guei earlier

1150
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,570
was more interesting.

1151
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:47,170
Because usually,

1152
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,800
when they do things together—

1153
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,540
whether it's baking cookies or rehearsing a play—

1154
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,580
they're always bickering with each other.

1155
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,440
"This should be like this, that should be like that."

1156
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,650
But earlier, there was a big boss

1157
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,980
dealing with them,

1158
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,480
so they ended up being unexpectedly harmonious instead.

1159
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,750
They have a goal.

1160
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,420
They have a goal, and they are moving forward to reach it.

1161
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,950
So, Poom, have you

1162
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,420

that you find quite fun?

1165
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,930
I have learned some.

1166
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,730
I used to be in a physical education department,

1167
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:16,770
so I have learned these basic stretching poses.

So can you touch your legs like this?

1170
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,810
The most flexible I can be

1171
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,370
is like this.

Good, good.

So, what was your major in the physical education department?

1182
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,690
I majored in sports science.

1183
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,160
Sports science.

1184

[The third round of playing with water: splashing each other]

1285
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,610
You want a fight?

1286
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,060
Okay, wait.

1287
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,250
[Truce]

1288
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,020
Okay, okay.

1289
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,910
[A brief pause before the big battle]

1290
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:01,050
[Strategizing]

1291
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:00,380
Okay.

1292
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,050
Why?

1293
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,790
Do you remember what you did yesterday?

1294
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,720
I'm sorry.

1295
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:06,670
Is it okay?

1296
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:10,330
Okay.

1297
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:10,490
[Pretending to make peace]

1298
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,420
So cruel.

1299
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:31,630
He took off his clothes without hesitation.

1300
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,590
This is so cruel.

1301
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:45,460
This slow-motion is so funny.

1302
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,260
Yeah.

1303
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:51,820
He was literally shoved into the water.

1304
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:54,240
Their group is really hilarious.

1305
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,870
This episode ends in such a youthful way.

1306
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:59,240
Really. This episode ends with playing water, so youthful.

1307
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,040
And we totally predicted it.

1308
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,550
The boys' routine is: after skipping stones,

1309
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:04,810
they start moving stones

1310
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:16,370
[Auntie Squad perfectly predicted the boys' water-playing moves]

1311
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:06,220
and then splash water.

1312
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,510
Splash water.

1313
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:10,420
That emotional rollercoaster is just like this:

1314
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,740
you can't win in skipping stones,

1315
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:14,660
then you get mad and start throwing big stones into the water,

1316
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:15,890
venting your frustration, and feeling really good.

1317
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,680
Then the water splashes up and wets your clothes.

1318
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:18,290
Since you're already wet—

1319
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:19,660
alright, I'll splash you then.

1320
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:21,960
It's one set after another.

1321
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,900
So happy.

1322
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,700
So cute. I think the last day

1323
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:26,960
turned out to be unexpectedly peaceful.

1324
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:29,450
They all went on a trip where they worked up a sweat.

1325
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:31,870
I think after that,

1326
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:33,840
and after all the physical activity,

1327
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,580
they really need to think about

1328
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:38,080
who they want to spend the last night with.

1329
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,000
Oh, my.

1330
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:41,020
So fast.

1331
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,320
I feel so reluctant.

1332
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,780
Yeah, it feels like

1333
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:47,160
my child is getting married.

1334
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:47,960
Feeling so warm inside.

1335
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,090
Yeah, oh my gosh.

1336
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:52,530
Because I think after this, they really need to communicate.

1337
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:53,230
Yeah.

1338
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,190
"Can we really become a couple?"

1339
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:58,300
And will Robert and Chien Yu, who are supported by Poom,

1340
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,280
last until the end?

1341
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:02,100
After watching their interactions today,

1342
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:08,870
[Will Robert and Chien Yu be able to confess to each other and become a couple in the end?]

1343
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,440
don't you think Robert is also a good match with the others?

1344
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,810
No, of course.

1345
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:07,430
Of course not?

1346
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:08,590
Yes.

1347
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,190
Come on.

1348
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,880
Come on.

1349
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:13,890
Come on, Robert.

1350
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,520
Come on.

1351
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,050
Come on.

1352
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:16,920
Fight till the end.

1353
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,120
Even though they are separated today

1354
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,090
and sent on different schedules,

1355
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:22,850
he still believes they will end up together in the end.

1356
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,210
Yeah.

1357
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:25,410
[Poom's sole support]

1358
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:27,020
And I think the other pair

1359
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,930
is Adson and Yi.

1360
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:29,970
Yes, Adson and Yi

1361
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:31,270
seem to have chemistry.

1362
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:37,700
[Will Yi and Adson, who always play together, end up becoming a couple?]

1363
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:33,690
I think in the last few episodes,

1364
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,950
we should set up a betting pool.
