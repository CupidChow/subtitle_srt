I don't think he'll give it to either of them.

150

He'll give it to someone else.

151
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,490
That way, he won't offend anyone.

152
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,210
He may have

153
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,950
other reasons and methods.

154
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,850
I think this is better.

155
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,290
So he won't give it to Guei or Adson.

156
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,020
I think he'll give it to someone else.

157
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,740
Anyway, he'll take a detour.

158
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,340
Will he give it to Pink?

159
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,830
Did he and Pink...

160
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,660
But them as a couple was a failure.

161
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,100
They really can't.

162
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,330
But when he was making cookies,

163
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,240
he also asked Guei

164
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,340
if he likes spicy food.

165
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,510
So he made it for someone.

166
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,980
He did say the chili one is going to be given to Guei.

167
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,680
But will he really give it to Guei?

168
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,980
Maybe because of what Adson did,

169
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,510
he might change his mind, right?

170
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,250
Poom. What do you think?

171
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,220
I would encourage him to give it to Adson.

172
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,990
He thinks it's Adson.

173
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,890
I think so too.

174
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,350
I think you're still supporting our favorite couple.

175
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,260
I think he's a sinful man,

176
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,100
because he received two.

177
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,270
I think he'll give it to someone else.

178
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,010
Or he will just give Adson's cookies to Guei

179
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,070
and give Guei's cookies to Adson?

180
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,310
This is so bad.

[Yi's handmade cookies will be given to Adson, Guei, or...]

182

183
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,610
No.

184

Yes.

186
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,920
He rushed there.

187
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,580
Yes, it's Guei.

I made you a giant chili pepper.

189
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,460
A giant chili pepper.

190
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,660
So I need to give it to you.

191
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
You have to eat it all.

192
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,190
[Why does it feel like a punishment?]

193
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,000
No problem. I'll remember to tell you.

194
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,360
Okay.

195
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,180
Okay.

196
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,720
Because when I made it, I said this chili pepper is from

197
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,150
my mom's recipe.

198
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,580
You know my mom's recipe.

199
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,770
Mom, okay.

200
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,520
Yes, so...

201
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,020
It's for me.

202
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,480
But I also want to try it.

203
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,540
Okay, no problem.

204
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,420
Then we will take one bite at a time.

205
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:41,990
Okay.

206
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,390
Okay.

207
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,060
Okay.

208
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,610
Okay.

209
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,380
Okay, bye.

210
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,159
Bye.

211
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,920
Okay, bye.

212
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,540
I didn't expect him to give it to me.

213
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,800
Yeah. So I feel

214
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,600
a little flustered.

215
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,909
I thought the cookies are

216
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:00,910
for ourselves.

217
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,050
But suddenly we need to give it someone.

218
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,550
From the start, I wanted to give it to Adson.

219
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,850
I cracked an egg on his head

220
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,390
and it broke,

221
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,790
so I wanted to say sorry.

222
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,630
I've said it several times that

223
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:23,730
the chili pepper I made is for Guei.

224
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:30,660
[Yi gave Guei the cookies he was going to give to Adson]

225
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,800
So I knocked on his door

226
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,670
and gave him my cookies.

227
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,980
I wanted to see Chris gives his to Adson.

228
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,480
Yes, because they are big and little cutie.

229
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,480
I call them big and little cutie

230
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,020
because they are the oldest and the youngest.

231
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,850
They already have a nickname.

232
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,450
Yeah, I like to give them couple nicknames.

233
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,510
And Pink.

234
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,310
Pink must have given his to Guei.

235
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,420
Really?

236
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,190
Isn't he always...

237
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,870
They are a good match now.

238
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,370
They're pretty good now.

239
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,260
I think Pink and Guei should be giving each other.

240
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,170
I didn't expect this.

241
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,600
Yes, they share the same room,

242
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,060
so Pink knew that Guei didn't give it to him.

243
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,380
This is too awkward.

244
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,310
Really?

245
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,710
I think the two of them kind of pick each other

246
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,560
when choosing a room.

247
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,220
Although they don't really want to eat that cookies,

248
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,120
they would still want the other person to give it to them.

249
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,060
They would want the other person to give it to them.

250
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,620
Poom. If you make the cookies

251
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,660
to a good friend of yours,

252
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,100
but your friend didn't give you the cookies.

253
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,290
He gave it to someone else instead.

254
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,460
Will you be angry?

255
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,850
It's okay.

256
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,300
Are you okay with that?

257
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,640
Saying it's okay with a wry smile.

258
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,950
[Feeling sad]

259
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,080
You don't look fine.

260
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,780
There's no way you won't get mad.

261
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,560
I'm sure you you will feel, 'How could this be?'

262
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,890
It's okay. We share the same room.

263
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,360
He may think since we sleep together,

264
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,100
he can share and give it to others.

265
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,520
Although I said that, I still feel...

266
00:09:59,050 --> 00:09:59,750
Still...

267
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,650
Yeah.

268
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,010
You might act it's nothing, but still...

269
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,840
I won't act like it's fine. I'm sorry.

270
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,970
I'll just say sorry, I don't want to eat this either.

271
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,600
Just say no.

272
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,110
What's wrong?

273
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,150
Why does it feel like there's a tense atmosphere?

274
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:24,260
[Chien Yu's handmade cookies will be given to...]

275
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,890
Just knock on the room?

276
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,270
Knock on the room and go in. Is that so?

277
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:36,320
[Now Yi received two packs of cookies.
At least one boy won't receive any]

278
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,540
This part.

279
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,460
Gosh.

280
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,570
Who do you want to give it to?

281
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,960
You mean this?

282
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,680
Yes.

283
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,800
Wait. Let me see who this is.

284
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,410
Why is Chien Yu wandering outside?

285
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,910
He's picking.

286
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,350
Okay, I have a question.

287
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,740
Am I the first one?

288
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,550
Am I the first?

289
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,850
Does it matter?

290
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,400
Because I really want...

291
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,250
Fumi and Yi.

292
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,750
I'm so nervous.

293
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,800
Wait!

294
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,600
Next is...

295
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,250
Can I say who I'm hesitating between right now?

296
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,940
Can I say who I'm hesitating between right now?

297
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,750
Sure.

298
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm just...

299
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,960
I don't know whether I should give it to Pink or Robert.

300
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,480
It's Robert.

301
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,620
It must be Robert. He is just pretending...

302
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,750
He's having his own inner drama.

303
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,530
Stop pretending.

304
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,790
Touch your heart.

305
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,120
Touch my heart?

306
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,480
Your heart is so big.

307
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,370
My heart is beating.

308
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,420
I am really nervous.

309
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,020
I have to follow my heart.

310
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,480
Gosh, this is too...

311
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,080
It's so scary.

312
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,630
See?

313
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,560
Poom. Your favorite couple.

314
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,800
It's so funny.

315
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,310
Come to the door.

316
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:17,990
Okay.

317
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,520
I don't know what to do.

318
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,470
[Pretending to be calm]

319
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,830
Do I not need to bring my gift?

320
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,060
I guess it's not necessary.

321
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,650
And then?

322
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,730
Well, this is

323
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,930
for you.

324
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:32,640
Yes.

325
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,740
Wait. Why do I suddenly feel shy?

326
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,930
Isn't it yours?

327
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,020
Okay, I think...

328
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,490
Because he really makes me feel

329
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,660
like I'm being taken care of.

330
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,530
Like it's okay for me to be a child for once.

331
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,130
I think I can do this

332
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,160
when I'm with him.

333
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,230
I think it’s great.

334
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,170
So I decided to give him cookies.

335
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,880
I'm a little shy.

336
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,580
It's sunburn, not blushing.

337
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,620
[Trying to cover up]

338
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,530
I got sunburn.

339
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,510
Me too.

340
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,330
Okay, thank you.

341
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,600
Give me a hug.

342
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,350
Okay.

343
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,980
Should I go in?

344
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,190
This pair looks nice.

345
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,990
Poom. Congratulation.

346
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,020
He supports them

347
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,910
all the way.

348
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,030
We wanted to separate them.

349
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:28,500
[Poom always supports Chien Yu and Robert]

350
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,640
They really complement each other’s personalities.

351
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,560
No, I think we did nothing wrong.

352
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,860
Because we didn’t know

353
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,020
what Robert was like.

354
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
Yeah, but later we found that they really complement each other.

355
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,160
Robert really tolerates everything about him.

356
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,070
But he's not that kind of person who is only gentle to him,

357
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,750
he's also a little naughty and playful.

358
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,320
He will take care of him,

359
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,520
but at the same time, he wants to tease him sometimes.

360
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,690
With him, Chien Yu can be treated like a child

361
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,830
and be taken care of,

362
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,800
but at other times, their interactions are like friends.

00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,270
Their personalities constantly shift back and forth.

364
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,970
And Robert doesn't care about the details.

365
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,400
He won't be annoyed or take it to heart

366
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,740
just because he said something

367
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,870
or did something.

557
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,750
cookies with my name.

558
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,040
I was moved again.

559
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,620
So I made yours right away.

560
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,500
Otherwise, I wanted to make Iron Man.

561
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,000
Why do I feel more shy now?

562
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,000
Please accept this.

563
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,260
Okay, thank you.

564
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,480
It's different from others.

565
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,500
Thank you.

566
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,130
It's pretty.

567
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,360
I don't know what to do.

568
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:11,020
You can go in now.

569
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,090
Let's

570
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,230
go in.

571
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,670
I'm so shy. I've never been like this.

572
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:18,920
I suddenly feel...

573
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,380
Hold on. I'm...

574
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,210
I'm so shy.

575
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,170
I didn't expect

576
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,710
he would give me the cookies.

577
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,640
After I gave him the cookies,

578
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,880
we went inside together.

579
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,080
I told him that

580
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,110
don't give it back to me

581
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,820
just because I gave it to you.

582
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,620
Then he said no, actually

583
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,450
after spending time

584
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,020
with me,

585
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,820
it felt like it wasn't just him taking care of me,

586
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,860
but I was also taking care of him.

587
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,290
So I think this feedback

588
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,490
is very precious to me.

589
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,230
This pair is so cute.

590
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,030
And I think

591
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,740
the others giving gifts are

592
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,070
They can give is to whoever?

593
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:56,170
not as serious as a confession.

594
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,740
They're the only couple.

595
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,870
Just like what Robert said to Chien Yu,

596
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,560
it was a sincere confession.

597
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,760
It's different from everyone else.

598
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,050
I think my jaw literally dropped just now

599
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,120
when Robert said that.

600
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,620
Because I never expected

601
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,090
someone with his carefree personality

602
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,390
to mention such a small detail

603
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,490
like saying he was also being taken care of.

604
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,230
Their feelings suggest that

605
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,930
during their time together...

606
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,620
when they're interacting with each other.

607
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,870
And he can feel that the other person cares about or is looking after him.

608
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,230
There are feelings of first love.

609
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,450
[Little Baby]

610
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,400
And he said that while looking at Chien Yu.

611
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,200
[Aben melts already]

612
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,940
I feel so dizzy.

613
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,810
The theme music of First Love is coming out.

614
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,950
It's the feeling of a heart-flutter. Yeah.

615
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,620
I’m just totally filled with pink love hearts right now.

616
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,120
And there's one person who's more pink and has more love hearts than me.

617
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,320
It's him.

618
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,120
Poom.

619
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,790
Chien Yu and Robert. Yeah.

620
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,390
Every time I see this pair, I feel very shy,

621
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,460
especially when they gave each other gifts.

622
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,100
Yeah, really.

623
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,500
Because the two of them are really true. Yeah.

624
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,790
Yeah.

625
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,110
Some other pairs are more subtle.

626
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,450
Chris gave his to Pink.

627
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,110
I think it's just...

628
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,110
I don't know.

629
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,080
I think it's just a gift exchange.

630
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,040
Yeah.

631
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,280
Not so much like...

632
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,420
Yeah, like Robert and Chien Yu.

633
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,480
It's a bit pity.

634
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,920
When he knocked on Pink and Guei's door,

635
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,990
I was expecting them

636
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,260
to maybe have some new interactions.

637
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,530
I thought he wanted to give his to Guei.

638
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,660
Or he could tell Guei that

639
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,320
actually, when we first acted together, we had some conflicts,

640
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,320
but after these few days, I really understand you now.

641
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,340
That'd be so touching!

642
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,970
Just recalling the past.

643
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,370
That's your script.

644
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,110
Yeah, how come there's no such part?

645
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,280
Can we call them back to perform this scene?

646
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,740
Because I want to watch this part.

647
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,420
It'd feel so touching,

648
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,480
because now they’ve gradually gotten into

649
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,820
that state while acting.

650
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,960
They're very familiar with each other.

651
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,790
And all the way until now, they’ve really grown.

652
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,890
This CP really gives off a sense of growth.

653
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,900
But among all the boys,

654
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,840
in the scenes we just watched, I feel sorry for Adson the most.

655
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:09,770
[Adson didn't receive any cookies]

656
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,390
He was really a bit serious about it.

657
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,740
He was talking to himself, you know?

658
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,810
Because while others were giving gifts, he was in his room.

659
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,860
The cookies...Yeah.

660
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,990
You heard that.

661
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,730
He's really Santa Claus.

662
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,350
He only sent things out.

663
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,520
But he didn't receive anything.

664
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,710
He's such a poor boy.

665
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,970
[Popularity King]

666
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,010
So the Popularity Kings are Chris and Yi.

667
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,530
Adson and Fumi didn't receive any.

668
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,370
[No cookies]

669
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,510
It seems like there will be a shocking development later.

670
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,660
Let's take a look.

671
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,380
Great.

672
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,670
Is it steak?

673
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,530
All steak?

674
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,370
Then I can only eat chicken.

675
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,370
Is this steak?

676
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,030
Yeah.

677
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,030
Is this steak?

678
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,400
Yeah.

679
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,360
Okay.

680
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,780
Then I'll have steak.

681
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,300
You got two too?

682
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,800
You got two too.

683
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:03,240
[Smile disappears]

684
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,160
I see.

685
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,060
It looks like this is a tragic love story.

686
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,280
All my guesses were wrong. I thought

687
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,480
only one of them didn't receive any.

688
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:11,800
My guess should be right.

689
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,920
His guess seemed to be right.

690
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,080
What? What was your guess?

691
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,360
[All as usual]

692
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,510
I guessed about everyone...

693
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,570
After sending them off, then we were guessing.

694
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,710
Can I guess?

695
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,910
What I said was that

696
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,540
I knew I gave mine to Yi, and Yi gave his to me,

697
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,280
and then...

698
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,980
So you two exchanged gifts?

699
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,640
Yeah.

700
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,000
Because I said I would make chili for him.

701
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,810
You really guessed it right.

702
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,670
And I also guessed that

703
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,830
since you all wrote down the names, you might exchange gifts with each other.

704
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,560
Did you exchange gifts?

705
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,700
Yeah, we exchanged gifts.

706
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,430
Yeah, because I also knew that

707
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,230
he gave his to Chris, and Chris gave his to him.

708
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,120
Really?

709
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,860
Yeah.

710
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:40,630
You exchanged gifts with each other too?

711
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,370
Then I was thinking that Adson would give his to Yi.

712
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,940
You, you can...

713
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:47,060
[Yi tries to comfort Adson]

714
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,440
Adson gave his to Yi.

715
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,200
Share.

716
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,660
Okay.

717
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,860
Adson, you gave yours to Yi, right?

718
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:50,440
Yeah.

719
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,070
Then I guessed that Fumi should have given his to Chris.

720
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,980
I was secretly observing everyone.

721
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,280
You're amazing!

722
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,250
I'm going to buy a lottery ticket.

723
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,580
Anyone wants bread?

724
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:06,390
[Looks like Adson doesn't want to talk about cookies anymore]

725
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,610
Me.

726
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,160
Wanna some?

727
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,880
Sure.

728
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,780
Mine is chicken. Do you want chicken?

729
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,270
Do you want to share it with me?

730
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,260
Or do you want to have steak?

731
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,760
I can share it with everyone.

732
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,530
How about we split it?

733
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,490
Then you share half with him.

734
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,090
Adson, do you want half each?

735
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:20,940
Is yours chicken?

736
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,640
Then I can give you half. Wait for a second.

737
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,970
I'll cut it for you first.

738
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,210
I'll cut half for you.

739
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,870
Because he gave his to Pink...

740
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,230
I almost called him Pinky again.

741
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,380

742
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,520
You can call me Pink.

743
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,710
Why did you give it to Chris?

744
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,170
Yeah, I'm surprised you gave yours to me.

745
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,030
No, I actually was observing it over there just now.

746
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,260
I think...

747
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:44,490
At least, when you were making the cookies, you were very focused.

748
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,150
And I think you did a very good job.

749
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,010
I really want to eat yours.

750
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:53,530
I originally thought it would be Yi and Adson.

751

I...

756
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,710
Because you also received two.

757
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,980
I wanted to give them to Adson at the very beginning

758
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,760
because I cracked the egg

759
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,240
on his head.

[Finally laughed]

this chili is for you to eat.

763
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,860
So I must...

764
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,680
Give it to me.

765
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,400
fulfill this promise.

766
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,890
I'm very scared now

767
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,400
because it really looks very strong.

768

I got hit on the head by his egg.

769
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,730
Then give... Nothing.

770
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,440
Because I happened to have fun with him,

771
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:39,400
and we made some cookies together,

772
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,690
I was like,

773
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:45,000

Both fate and feelings are present.

777
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,910
There are feelings.

778

Besides,

779
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,100
it's weird to take his body

780
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
and give it to someone else.

781
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,560
You're right.

782
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,660
That'd feel funny.

783
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,880
Because I wanted to say that you were making Chien Yu,

784
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,670
and he also made your name,

785
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,150
if you exchanged gifts,

786
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,570
and let's say I received these, I'd get jealous.

787
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,270
That'd be petrifying.

788
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,410
It's weird.

789
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,410
I'd say you gave me something with someone else's name, not mine.

790
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,160
This is the so-called "borrowing flowers to present to the Buddha".

791
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,790
At that time, I just thought, "How about I make it?"

[Robert and Chien Yu's homemade cookies are only suitable for giving to each other]

00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:29,180
Yeah.

926
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,350
And giving cookies isn't that simple.

927
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,640
Because I just learned about a shocking development.

928
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:34,430
What?

929
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,040
There might be a big fight starting soon.

930
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,880
What do you mean?

931
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,480
Because the "Popularity Kings" are the ones who receive the most cookies,

932
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,150
they're Yi and Chris, right?

933
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:41,660
Yeah.

934
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,120
Tonight, who they'll sleep with

935
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,480
is up to these two people to decide.

936
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,110
This is very unfair.

937
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:51,070
[Tonight, the sleeping partners for the boys will be decided by the Popularity Kings–Yi and Chris]

938
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,230
They're already the Popularity Kings, but they can still choose.

939
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,360
It should be Adson and Fumi.

940
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,700
Yeah.

941
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,830
No. They would be so miserable.

942
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:57,460
Poor them.

943
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,330
What I want to tell you is that

944
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,510
they all seem to be getting along so well, right?

945
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,470
But I think that's how guys could be like.

946
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,910
Even though everyone gets along well,

947
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,950
and there's no one they particularly dislike,

948
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:09,940
there's always a little bit of distraction involved,

949
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,540
like what Adson just showed,

950
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,659
"No one gave me anything."

951
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,449
Come one. Let's guess.

952
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:17,280
So cruel.

953
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,420
I think the safest

954
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,389
are Robert and Chien Yu.

955
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:24,380
But could Chris just separate them apart?

956
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,659
Did you say that Chris and Yi would just directly...

957
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:28,980
Separate them.

958
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,000
Impossible.

959
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,659
I don't think it's possible.

960
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:34,620
I feel like no one is going to interfere with them anymore, right?

961
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:40,870
[Robert and Chien Yu are inseparable]

962
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,969
They'll be put together.

963
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,489
Because they are just...

964
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:40,409
Unless they don't want each other.

965
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:41,610
I don't think so.

966
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,440
Look, they even put each other's names on the cookies.

967
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,679
This is to be applied to Poom's side.

968
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,429
Yeah.

969
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,780
Yeah, this is for Poom.

970
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,000
Your ship.

971
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:53,080
He support them. His ship.

972
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,690
And the point is Yi and Chris

973
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,949
can also choose who they want to sleep with.

974
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,190
Because Yi always said he likes new experience.

975
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,240
He wants to be closer to everyone.

976
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:04,300
So if we exclude these two,

977
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:08,170
it seems that Chris is the only one who hasn't really...

978
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,000
True, he hasn't cooperated with Chris yet.

979
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,240
I think he might have the chance to choose Chris.

980
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,240
If he follows through with his original intention...

981
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,210
Then it seems like Chris and Yi

982
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,490
haven't had much interaction either.

983
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,210
Only when they were pulling the scallions.

984
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,880
Harvesting, pulling, and washing the scallions.

985
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,770
They did when they were pulling scallions.

986
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:24,690
Yeah, they were in the same group.

987
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,460
They had four of them in a group.

988
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,520
I think these two

989
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,320
should give it a try.

990
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,640
After all, he did smash an egg on his head.

991
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:34,110
Won't he feel really sorry?
-You mean Adson?

992
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,510
Yi will then choose him tonight.

993
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,030
I'm just guessing.

994
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,300
It's really hard to figure him out.

995
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,460
Among them,

996
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:43,760
there's one pair that I've always hoped would have some interaction.

997
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,700
There's the pair who are good friends from the start.

998
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,710
I feel if they might cause a little trouble.

999
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:50,230
[Yi becoming the biggest variable in the Auntie Squad's prediction of the sleeping pairings]

1000
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,740
And with Yi being so unpredictable, he's definitely going to mix everyone up.

1001
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,390
I think I'll pick Pink and Adson,

1002
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,730
and then Fumi and Guei.

1003
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,650
Why?

1004
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,270
They've never been paired together.

1005
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,400
It's just a sense of novelty.

1006
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,640
Yeah, Fumi and Guei have slept together before.

1007
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,630
But Pink and Adson haven't.

1008
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,600
Not yet.

1009
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,660
Okay, then these are just our guesses.

1010
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:07,530
Alright, let's leave it at that.

1011
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,260
This pair.

1012
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,130
I think this'll do.

1013
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,700
Alright, let's predict that Yi and Chris might use

1014
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,170
this method to help them assign their rooms.

1015
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:16,840
Yeah.

1016
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,140
But we were just guessing aimlessly

1017
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:25,160
[Auntie Squad predicts who sleeps with whom]

1018
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,840
because these two are just too hard to predict.

1019
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,820
Because Yi might act unpredictably

1020
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,220
and mix up all the pairs.

1021
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,230
But could it be a case of "destruction before rebirth"?

1022
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,460
Then in the end, Robert'll end up with Adson?

1023
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,720
How did this plot even start?

1024
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,460
Will it develop like this?

1025
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,740
Because we're already in Episode 8.

1026
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:41,910
Sometimes, the plot takes an amazing twist by episode 8.

1027
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,290
[The following result is indeed unexpected]

1028
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,680
You mean they're many hidden scenes, right?

1029
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,100
Yeah, let's see

1030
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:49,570
what their final choices will be like in the end.

1031
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,250
[Tonight, who'll sleep with whom?]

1032
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,470
I think because there are two days left...

1033
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,430
That we should sleep with those we haven't slept with?

1034
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,950
Then who do you want to sleep with?

1035
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,030
I want to sleep with someone I've never slept with.

1036
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,610
Isn't that Yi then?

1037
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,840
Okay, so you can first...

1038
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,420
Or we can... random.

1039
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:18,000
[Chris and Yi are picking from the shuffled cards
to decide tonight's sleeping arrangement]

1040
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:14,670
Okay.

1041
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,210
Okay.

1042
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,220
Or you can... you know?

1043
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,130
I think you can just draw, and then...

1044
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,510
Smart.

1045
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,460
Am I the first one?

1046
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,040
What a coincidence!

1047
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,990
Impossible.

1048
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,400
Not bad, not bad.

1049
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,230
I was quite surprised today.

1050
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,660
I was the first to be drawn, and then it was Yi.

1051
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,420
Because I really want to be with Yi...

1052
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,200
Well,

1053
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,430
I can't exactly say "sleep with him," but...

1054
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,300
Yeah, alright,

1055
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,770
I want to sleep together with him. Yeah.

1056
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,080
Good.

1057
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,910
I think they might have slept together.

1058
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:09,900
They?

1059
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:10,810
They have.

1060
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,800
Wow, fate.

1061
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,850
Or do you want to change?

1062
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,860
We can change.

1063
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,170
I don't want them to sleep together again.

1064
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,390
He has slept with him as well.

1065
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,340
Okay.

1066
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,610
They haven't slept together yet.

1067
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,770
Then there's no need to change.

1068
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:41,290
[Result of the random card draw: Robert and Chien Yu still sleep together]

1069
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,410
Little baby.

1070
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:45,150
Look, it's down to just the two of them—Robert and...

1071
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,810
Robert and Chien Yu. Yeah, fate.

1072
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:50,530
They just directly did that.

1073
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,800
No, you can just let them sleep together again.

1074
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:56,230
Yeah, look. He said they'd sleep one more night again.

1075
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:05,320
[Up until now, Auntie Squad's predictions are all accurate]

1076
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:02,530
What do you think?

1077
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,260
I personally want to see him sleep with Chien Yu.

1078
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,910
Or you don't think it's necessary?

1079
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,940
Or he and Robert?

1080
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,690
Like this.

1081
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,650
And then Robert.

1082
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,350
Can we do this?

1083
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,880
No, it should be like this.

1084
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,000
Our guesses were originally correct, but now everything's a mess.

1085
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,870
What are they doing?

1086
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,070
You want to... I want to change.

1087
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,150
Okay. If you win, then we'll change it.

1088
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,940
Rock, paper, scissors.

1089
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:46,400
[If Yi wins 
Robert and Chien Yu'll sleep together]

1090
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,800
Okay, let's not change.

1091
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,410
Okay.

1092
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,050
Okay.

1093
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,540
This is fate, okay? Don't mess with fate.

1094
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,900
Yeah, it's destiny.

1095
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,800
Yeah, this is destiny.

1096
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,550
All in.

1097
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:04,170
We got it all right!

1098
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,930
Really?

1099
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,940
It looks like we know them very well now.

1100
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,900
Did we invest in the right stock?

1101
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,680
Yeah.

1102
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,900
It's too exaggerated.

1103
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,850
How do you think they will pair us up?

1104
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,650
That’s probably based on who gave gifts to whom.

1105
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,020
Then they'd pick one themselves.

1106
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,080
I think they'll mess everyone up.

1107
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,010
Me too.

1108
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,010
He'll mess everyone up.

1109
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,050
I think he will.

1110
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,990
Who hasn't slept with whom so far?

1111
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,120
I slept with the three of you...

1112
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,610
I haven't slept with many people.

1113
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,440
You two slept for two days.

1114
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,260
I also slept with Chris for two days.

1115
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,650
[Adson doesn't want to sleep with Chris anymore]

1116
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,700
I don't want to sleep with him anymore.

1117
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,670
No more sleeping with him.

1118
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,430
It's not that I don't like sleeping with him. I'm just saying two days are enough.

1119
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:43,020
But I want to see them sleep for the third day.

1120
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,940
I want to see you two sleep until the eighth day.

1121
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,490
After the eighth day's shooting, continue.

1122
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,050
Then continue to sleep together until...

1123
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,110
Yeah.

1124
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,930
Yeah, sleeping together until Chien Yu moves to Taipei.

1125
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,640
He said he doesn't want to keep taking the high-speed train back and forth again.

1126
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,680
I think Yi would want to give it a try with everyone.

1127
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,120
Chris should have his own direction.

1128
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,740
I think they won't separate you two.

1129
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,440
Yeah.

1130
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,080
I think the probability is fifty-fifty. I really can't be sure.

1131
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,300
Yeah, fifty-fifty.

1132
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:13,600
Yeah, I'm not sure about it. I think it's possible.

1133
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:17,620
But I think, because they actually get along pretty well.

1134
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,800
It’s just that at that time,

1135
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,370
the tone between you two really matched well.

1136
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,320
Who're you talking about?

1137
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,780
And you two often give off

1138
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,950
the vibe of a couple playfully teasing each other.

1139
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,800
Big couple.

1140
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,760
Big couple.

1141
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:32,850
Really big couple.

1142
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:35,350
He didn't deny the idea of couple either.

1143
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:38,740
Yeah, he just said "big couple", and then stopped there.

1144
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,800
I can only laugh for him, otherwise, no one else will.

1145
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,150
But your laugh is sincere.

1146
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,330
No, because it's too...

1147
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,170
It's really big couple.

1148
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,170
Big couple.

1149
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:49,440
There're still 2 nights left, right?

1150
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,250
Then I...

1151
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,580
I want to change.

1152
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,690
I like this.

1153
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:06,600
This is what I think it's CP.

1154
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:09,920
What? What are you thinking? Don't think.

1155
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,460
Didn't we just guess all of them correctly?

1156
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,940
All our guesses were correct just now!

1157
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,660
I'm going to buy a lottery ticket.

1158
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:18,200
Yi really messed up all the arrangements.

1159
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,030
He completely messed everything up in the last 10 seconds.

1160
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,920
Let me have a drink of water to calm down first.

1161
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,010
Well, Chu,

1162
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,960
may I ask, according to Yi's train of thought, what did Yi change?

1163
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,570
Aren't you good at guessing his thoughts? Come on.

1164
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,990
I need to have a brain storm now.

1165
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,070
You guys have a talk first.

1166
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,640
[Chu has given up on trying to guess what Yi is thinking]

1167
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:38,050
He said there are two nights left,

1168
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,440
because it's the fifth day.

1169
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:42,320
So he needs to change it.

1170
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,920
Because originally, he was with Chris.

1171
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:46,650
Yeah,

1172
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,930
who is he going to switch with?

1173
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,090
He'd change himself, right?

1174
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,540
-I saw he seems to have changed the front.
-He changed himself.

1175
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,970
Yes, because he changed the first one.

1176
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,950
The first one is Chris and him.

1177
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:56,540
Yeah, he changed himself.

1178
00:42:55,250 --> 00:43:00,850
[Who'll sleep with Yi  
Auntie Squad is guessing]

1179
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,740
Changed to whom?

1180
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,660
Who else could he have changed to?

1181
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,090
Changed back to Adson?

1182
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:03,740
Could it be...

1183
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,450
I hope so. If that's the situation...

1184
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,750
Because the two nights left...

1185
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:08,860
He just said that he feels

1186
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:12,260
this is the CP that matches his idea of it.

1187
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,450
Yeah, he did say that.

1188
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:17,870
At the ending part, he said

1189
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,010
that's the CP in his heart.

1190
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,180
Guei was originally with Fumi...

1191
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,160
I think let's just forget about guessing the others.

1192
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:26,100
Let's just guess who Yi thinks can be his best CP.

1193
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:27,300
[Yi will sleep with Adson tonight]

1194
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:26,950
Poom, then do you feel...

1195
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,680
Adson.

1196
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:30,260
Poom, what do you think?

1197
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:35,890
I think it can be any match.

1198
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:38,210
But please don't let Chien Yu and Robert get affected.

1199
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,970
He just doesn't care about anyone else.

1200
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:45,330
He only cares about his CP.

1201
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,090
As long as my CP has a happy ending.

1202
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,980
This is a show for eight people.

1203
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:52,210
He's really suited to be an auntie. He's very suitable for that role.

1204
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,900
Yeah, he is.

1205
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:56,730
I finally know why Poom is here.

1206
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,640
Yeah.

1207
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,630
He's also an auntie.

1208
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,260
Okay, Niki, make a guess.

1209
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,270
Who do you think his best CP is?

1210
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,140
Because of guilt, will he still choose Adson?

1211
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,100
I think I hope he could still choose Adson.

1212
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,010
But I feel like I have no idea what’s going on in his head.

1213
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,090
I can't figure it out.

1214
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,610
If he really wants to make a little breakthrough,

1215
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:16,840
he might actually separate his CP.

1216
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,220
Could it be that he chose Robert?

1217
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,480
Because I just mentioned, I said that he might have said that.

1218
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,600
I vaguely remember that he might have said something.

1219
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,190
He said he cared about Robert a bit.

1220
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,590
Yeah, because I think he would still want to try

1221
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,790
[Auntie Squad can't figure out Yi's thoughts at all]

1222
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,490
what he never triesd.

1223
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,260
I think it's impossible.

1224
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:34,610
[Don't break up my CP]

1225
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:33,620
Auntie is angry.

1226
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,710
I think it's impossible.

1227
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,540
OK, now we are divided into two groups.

1228
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,960
It's possible that Yi's best CP could be

1229
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,650
with Robert,

1230
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:42,550
[No]

1231
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,450
and another possibility is that he might be up with Adson.

1232
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,640
I choose Adson.

1233
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,680
We'll have to watch the next episode for the answers. I'm so nervous.

1234
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,510
How can I go home and fall asleep like this?

1235
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,150
Look at Poom.

1236
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,560
You're exaggerating.

1237
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:57,430
He'll be mad until Episode 9.
