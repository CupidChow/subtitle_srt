Yes, that was our prediction.

18

Yeah, because it feels like these two

And they've already opened up to each other.

21
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,920
Yes, because earlier, Guei said that

follow a progression?

A little, but I think, for the first script we did,

87
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,300
all four of us were ambiguous.

88

It's possible.

94

Then why did you choose Misunderstanding?

95

Why didn't you want to pick Third Party?

101
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,240
Because if there was a third party, I might just break up.

103

why did you want to have a misunderstanding with me?

104

It doesn't necessarily have to be...

112

The misunderstanding doesn't have to lead to a breakup or anything.

113

Misunderstandings can be broad.

There are many possibilities...

115
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,250
It depends on how the script unfolds.

116
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,690

[Boys' Room Tour]

187
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,990
Welcome to my humble abode.

188
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,270
Their bed...

189
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,330
There's tatami!

190
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,030
There's a door now.

191
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,260
You guys have tatami.

192
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,300
They have bathtubs.

193
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,400
We have tatami.

194
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,030
This bathtub feels more luxurious.

195
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,430
Japanese-style.

196
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,750
Welcome!

197
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,000
This is great.

198
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,950
Nice to meet you.

199
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,910
Are you Japanese?

200
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,610
Please.

201
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,780
I look forward to learning from you.

202
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,590
Amazing!

203
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,920
I'm "Dragon".

204
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,950
I'm Fumi.

205
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:15,790
Fumi.

206
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,060
What's "Dragon" in Japanese?

207
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,060
Ryuu.

208
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,690
Ryuu.

[The boys have developed an inside language only they understand]

210
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,530
I'm Ryuu.

211
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,670
Ryuu-san?

212
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,000
Ryuu-san.

213
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,990
Are we going to keep kneeling here?

214
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,250
No one wants to stand up.

215
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,480
They sat down, spoke some Japanese and stood up.

216
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,990
These boys are really funny.

217
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,400
Are you going to do the first scene?

218
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,220
You do it.

219
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,380
No, you can do it.

220
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
These two aren't sharing a room

221
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,840
and they're matched together again.

222
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,970
Is it the other way round?

223
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,270
You should suppress me.

224
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:06,830
[Sweet punchline]

225
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,210
One, two.

226
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,980
What is this scene?

227
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,790
Is this something we can watch without paying?

228
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,350
Did we already paid to unlock this content?

229
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,540
[So happy]

230
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,520
This is too good.

[If you could choose, who would you want to share a room with?]

232
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,870
I think...

233
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,880
Robert!

234
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,770
Because he's new,

235
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,500
so I want to understand him

236
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,440
and know him better.

237
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,340
His English is also good.

238
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,140
Because he used to be in the US.

239
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,280
But

240
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,750
Pink is also great.

241
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,620
Because both of us...

242
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,090
because he doesn't speak much English,

243
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,290
and I don't speak much Chinese.

244
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,830
So we haven't talked much, these two days.

245
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:57,330
I think this will make us closer.

246
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,290
[Are you worried about the language barrier with Yi?]

247
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,500
No.

248
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,270
Because I think...

249
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,370
when I first met him,

250
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,300
he...

251
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,710
he didn't feel distant.

252
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,680
He was pretty cute

253
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,640
and his Chinese isn't great,

254
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,810
so he doesn't fully understand everything.

255
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,410
But I think

256
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,980
he's not very distant.

257
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,850
I feel like

258
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,880
he's easy to get along with.

259
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,660
What's wrong?

260
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,250
Why did it suddenly...

261
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,380
The vibe changed suddenly.

262
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,480
Yeah, what's going on?

263
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,240
Did the power go out?

264
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,490
All of a sudden?

265
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,320
The power is out, I think.

266
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,460
Is there a mission?

267
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:31,820
The power went out.

268
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,590
And did you hear...

269
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,630
Is it someone's birthday?

270
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,460
Was that thunder?

271
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,430
There's really a power outage.

272
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,230
[The guesthouse's power system was struck by lightning, plunging the scene into darkness]

273
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:39,970
Lightning strike?

274
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,630
That's dramatic.

275
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,000
It's too dramatic.

[The boys excitedly gather in the living room to chat]

277
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,300
They're really the chosen ones.

278

This is exciting.

279
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,470
The lightning strike caused a blackout.

280

[The Auntie Squad is still in shock]

281
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,990
What a dramatic development.

282
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,650
Wait.

283
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,090
So that's the end of the episode?

284
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,520
It ends here.

285
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,480
They already said.

286
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,810
That's right. They can't shoot with the blackout.

287
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,220
That's crazy.

288
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,020
Even an idol drama scriptwriter

289
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,890
would find this too dramatic

290
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,460
and unlikely.

291
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,200
But it really happened. A lightning strike! That's cool!

292
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,360
Lightning strikes rarely cause blackouts.

293
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,920
To explain,

294
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,010
the guesthouse's electrical box was hit by lightning,

295
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,670
so the electricity went out.

296
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,770
Although they were struck by lightning,

297
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,340
they were still very happy and excited.

298
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,750
Everyone was like, oh, a power outage!

299
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,580
This is how it's like when blackouts happen when we're young.

300
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,820
The adults are nervous but the kids are having fun.

301
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,650
The kids are happy.

302
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,150
But just now,

303
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,820
because we were originally looking forward to Guei and Adson

304
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,520
finally being assigned to the same room.

305
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,800
But Adson's true partner

306
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,560
showed up again to wrestle with him.

307
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,560
That was...

308
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,430
Wasn't that supposed to be

309
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,060
paid content?

310
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,380
[Smiling uncontrollably]

311
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,970
What were they doing?

312
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,600
They're just close.

313
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,340
You're right. Is he his true partner?

314
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,870
Because in the end, he still went back to the person

315
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,470
he feels most comfortable with.

316
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,680
You're right.

317
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,110
But when Guei and Adson

318
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,150
were assigned to a room,

319
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,480
everyone still ended up going over to hang out with them.

320
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,220
I think they have...

321
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,350
A big brother vibe, right?

322
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:10,610
[Adson and Guei are like the big brothers of the group]

323
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,940
Yes, because Guei's personality...

324
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,900
he's good at taking care of others.

325
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,240
And Adson is the oldest,

326
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,150
so everyone gravitates toward them.

327
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,780
But if there's a power outage,

328
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,580
would something unexpected happen?

329
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,000
I don't think anything dramatic would happen between Adson and Guei during the blackout.

330
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,450
Because they're both very manly.

331
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,450
They'll just take care of themselves.

332
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,420
No.

333
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,090
Isn't Guei a contradictory guy?

334
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,220
Yes, when he was jumping...

335
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,660
He was afraid of water.

336
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,190
He's afraid of heights and water.

337
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,330
He's not afraid of the dark? Right?

338
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,630
He didn't say he's not afraid.

339
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,970
He might be scared once he experiences it.

340
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,200
Yes.

341
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,230
He just didn't say it.

342
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,700
And Adson is the type who would

343
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,540
check on everyone

344
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,440
and then slip and fall himself.

[The above comments are purely speculation]

That's right. He's very clumsy.

Poom, in a drama,

349
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,420
if your partner was afraid of blackouts,

350
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,820
afraid of thunder and afraid of the dark,

351
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,160
how would you comfort him?

352
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,500
It's okay. I'm right here with you.

The ninth person.

I've seen him before.

He acted in Dead Ringer.

00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,170
You just got up?

373
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,900
Yeah, we just got up.

374
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,180
[Run three laps]

375
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,770
Run three laps.

376
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,740
It's too cool around here.

377
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,670
-Strict coach.
-So sudden.

378
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,540
Teacher, please.

379
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:51,590
Do you want to ride?

380
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,210
Is this okay?

381
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,310
I want to ride it.

382
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,830
Yeah.

383
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,600
They came out for a walk and immediately got called back to film.

384
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,620
I have the scripts

385
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,320
you're going to perform today.

386
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,770
I know last night, you've already picked

387
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,760
your partners and teams.

388
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:11,730
That's right.

389
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,950
I'll distribute the scripts now.

390
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:15,920
Okay.

391
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,580
Okay.

392
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,530
Okay, mine.

393
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,520
Thank you.

394
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,520
[Kevin starts to distribute today's scripts]

395
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,610
Misunderstanding.

396
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,980
Thank you.

397
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,040
Misunderstanding.

398
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:24,960
Third Party.

399
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,760
Third Party.

400
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,560
-Okay.
-Third Party.

401
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,200
Heartbreak.

402
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,480
Two.

403
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,380
Thank you.

404
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,590
Okay, and finally, Separation.

405
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,390
There's another one at the back.

406
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,980
How were these photos printed?

407
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:39,970
They look good.

408
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,600
You can open your scripts now and take a look.

409
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,550
Okay.

410
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,490
It's a lot.

411
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,020
[The boys couldn't wait to start reading the script, except for two of them...]

412
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,590
It's so long.

413
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,890
Any problems?

414
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,890
[What's going on?]

415
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,190
What does it mean?

416
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,050
It's blank.

417
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,240
It's just the two of them.

418
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,940
Because I see that everyone else's has words.

419
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,510
Did you two realise that

420
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,870
your scripts are blank?

421
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,930
Yes.

422
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,430
Yeah, because what did you choose?

423
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,570
Separation.

424
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,440
Separation.

425
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,570
Let's start the separation now.

426
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Because you chose separation,

427
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,160
we have to separate you.

428
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:14,770
That's right.

429
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,450
Today's scripts are not one-on-one scenes.

430
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,490
[Today's scripts require 3 people per group. Pink and Yi will be separated and assigned to other groups]

431
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,310
They're three-person performances.

432
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,670
Three people?

433
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,420
I have three more scripts.

434
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,520
I'll choose first.

435
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,190
Since I'm the guest.

436
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,030
Sure.

437
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,400
I'll choose...

438
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,270
I choose Misunderstanding.

439
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,000
And the other two are...

440
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,960
[Chien Yu is so lucky to work with a professional actor again]

441
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,230
Heartbreak and Third Party.

442
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,120
Yi, you choose first.

443
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,170
Do you want to join the Heartbreak group or the Third Party group?

444
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,840
-Heartbreak is...
-Us.

445
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,460
Third Party is us.

446
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,620
Third Party is them.

447
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,240
Heartbreak and Third Party.

448
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,270
Heartbreak.

449
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,570
Heartbreak.

450
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,350
Why?

451
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,640
Because I want to feel...

452
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,630
I want to feel a lot of emotions.

453
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,940
You like emotional scenes.

454
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,280
[Yi decides to join Fumi and Chris in the Heartbreak group]

455
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,950
Okay, Heartbreak is yours.

456
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,010
Thank you.

457
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,820
Then Pink, you can act with the Third Party group.

458
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,130
[Pink joins Guei and Adson in the Third Party group]

459
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,920
[Lost in thought]

460
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,420
Okay.

461
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,520
Now, we're going to separate.

462
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,040
I'm reluctant to leave.

463
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,000
We slept well last night.

464
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,930
Yes.

465
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,210
It's a pity.

466
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,750
I slept with him yesterday

467
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,090
[Pink is a little reluctant to part with Yi for the performance]

468
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,980
and we talked a lot.

469
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,420
I think we really get along.

470
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,650
And I think he...

471
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,050
My first impression of him was that he was very cute.

472
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,020
I had a good impression of him from the beginning.

473
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,160
And I wanted to try acting with him.

474
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,980
Are they looking forward to acting with each other?

475
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,730
Pink, Guei, Adson. Who will play the third party?

476
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,750
It's pretty obvious.

477
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,050
Pink? Yes.

478
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:48,270
[Who among Guei, Adson, and Pink will play the third party in the short film?]

479
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,310
I think Pink is perfect for the third party.

480
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,410
Yes, but I'm curious about

481
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,990
how they will arrange the roles.

482
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,650
I think... Niki, come, let's brainstorm.

483
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,980
Yes, in a BL drama, how would they typically assign the roles?

484
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,330
Pink, Guei and Adson.

485
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,300
I think Pink will be the third party.

486
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,130
He looks the part, right?

487
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,100
Yeah, it feels like...

488
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,740
As you guys said, he can be both the dominant and submissive type.

489
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:09,010
He looks shy on the outside

490
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,390
and acts like he's okay with anything.

491
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,760
But in fact, he has strong opinions.

492
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,540
He also has an assertive side.

493
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:19,210
And he and Guei, while shrimp fishing...

494
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,030
they talked a lot too. Yes.

495
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,200
They have great chemistry.

496
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,950
But I would rather see him and Guei competing.

497
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,970
Both of them wanting Adson. Yes.

498
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,690
Do you know why?

499
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,130
Because Adson looks manly,

500
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,820
but he's actually an innocent and naive type.

501
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,700
His bathing...

502
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,820
That scene is imprinted in my mind.

503
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,700
It's going to be hilarious. I can't wait.

504
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,410
As for Yi, he joined Chris and Fumi's group,

505
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,950
how will the story develop?

506
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,390
Heartbreak?

507
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,150
Yes.

508
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,080
Could it be that...

509
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,850
My first thought was that someone would pass away.

510
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,250
Like a heartbreaking farewell that could involve death.

511
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:02,280
[The Heartbreak group's story involves someone passing away?]

512
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,560
That tragic?

513
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,600
Would there be such intense emotions?

514
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,560
I don't know either.

515
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,130
You're saying they were originally a trio,

516
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,829
and the one of them dies?

517
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,720
I think this often happens in BL dramas.

518
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,710
The point isn't that he left,

519
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,410
it's that

520
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,410
he comes back as someone else.

521
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:16,810
You mean...

522
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,540
Like Professional Body Double?

523
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,079
Yes, we need to ask him.

524
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,240
We need to ask Poom.

525
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,220
Because he has played a role like that before in Professional Body Double.

526
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,890
He came back as another person,

527
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,220
that kind of heartbreak.

528
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,990
How do you portray that kind of feeling where you can't tell the truth?

529
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,820
When I realized I was the third party,

530
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,510
I still remember

531
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,830
I felt like I didn't exist.

532
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,500
Because the person I've always had a crush on

533
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,900
doesn't love me as much as I love him.

534
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,270
I was hurt.

535
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,460
Really, because that plot...

536
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,960
I really want to see them reenact it.

537
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,610
Yeah.

538
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,380
And Robert

539
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,280
is in a group with Kevin Chu.

540
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,940
Kevin Chu is here.

541
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,850
You know him, right?

542
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
Yes I do.

543
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,820
Yes, I know him too.

544
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,300
But I know

545
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,530
he used to be on the Hong Kong swim team, so he has an amazing physique.

546
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,990
I tend to notice shallow things.

547
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,220
Sorry.

548
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,790
If a show has some scenes showing skin,

549
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,260
I will notice.

550
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,520
Or if someone had a really good physique, I also notice.

551
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,630
But I think his addition makes things interesting.

552
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,240
Since he's in the group with Chien Yu and Robert,

553
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,070
it might create some unexpected chemistry.

554
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,760
Because their theme is Misunderstanding.

555
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:31,360
[Chien Yu, Robert, and professional actor Kevin Chu will portray Misunderstanding]

556
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,880
I'm looking forward to see

557
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,610
how Kevin Chu will guide them

558
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,370
and how their scenes develop.

559
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,300
Can't wait—let's watch!

560
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,300
[Kevin, Chien Yu, Robert]

561
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,260
Wait, Robert.

562
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,050
You'll walk down the stairs there,

563
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,830
okay?

564
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,390
Okay.

565
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,170
So, from there, you’ll see from a distance what’s happening.

566
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,020
Hitting my baby?

567
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,100
Yeah, they’re hitting your baby, and you rush over!

568
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,260
It’s this kind of misunderstanding?

569
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,770
A misunderstanding about hitting someone.

570
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,210
Okay, what should I do later?

571
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,220
You grab Kevin by the shoulders like this

572
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,030
and pull him away.

573
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,250
Kevin, I want you to move over there.

574
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,340
-Okay.
-So I swing like this.

575
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,280
Be careful of that.

576
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,350
Okay, I can do that.

577
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,120
Go this way,

578
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,650
okay? Actually, it's like this.

579
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,320
But you have to be very serious about it.

580
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,660
Very serious about getting hit.

581
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,290
I think they fit the roles well.

582
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,550
But Chien Yu doesn’t seem like someone who would get hit.

583
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,210
He's so muscular.

584
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,200
Look at his muscles.

585
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,930
Can they cover his muscles?

586
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,630
Let's do it again.

587
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,230
One more.

588
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,620
So, the first few were slow.

589
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,960
No, just at the beginning.

590
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,180
At the beginning,

591
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,970
You might slow down, but you don't have to move slowly.

592
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,070
I'm afraid I'll really hit him.

593
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,080
You mean him? It's fine.

594
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,220
But sometimes...

595
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,520
Okay, nevermind, I shouldn't say it.

596
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,500
One wrong punch and...

597
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,860
I can give you guys one last chance.

598
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,170
I'll trouble the cameraman.

599
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,420
Can you do it?

600
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,230
Okay.

601
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:51,930
Can you do it?

602
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,700
Yes.

603
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,400
Watch your position.

604
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,460
Your position is very important,

605
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,370
or else the others might get stuck.

606
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,010
Kevin, are you okay? I made you fall too many times.

607
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,910
You don’t have to actually fall, just move out of frame.

608
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,460
No, I'm just acting.

609
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,970
I think he really did a great job.

610
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,880
Because right from the beginning, from the very first take,

611
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,180
he was already deeply in character.

612
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,280
He had a scene where he needed to fall.

613
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,680
[Robert admires Kevin’s dedication]

614
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,680
Under the scorching sun.

615
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
Then he said,

616
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,620
it's okay, it's acting. And he just did it.

617
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,950
Today, there was a scene

618
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,920
where you had to keep hitting,

619
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,920
and pretend you have something on you.

620
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,090
Kevin was afraid of hitting me

621
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,190
and hurting me.

622
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,160
I said Kevin, it’s okay. Hit me hard.

623
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,660
Only when you hit me hard will my emotions come out,

624
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,660
and my reaction will be more natural.

625
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,470
Help me get the bug off… wait!

626
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,460
Don't move!

627
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,100
Don't move.

628
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,050
What are you doing?

629
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,660
That shot looked really cool.

630
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,780
He's helping me.

631
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:50,980
At this moment,

632
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,130
you need to protect your baby, right?

633
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,170
Baby?

634
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,960
So you need to pull him behind you

635
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,000
and shield him.

636
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,480
He's a big baby.

637
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,370
Okay?

638
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,460
Okay, go on.

639
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:05,590
Wow, I actually got butterflies.

640
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,900
Because Robert,

641
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,930
he had a scene where he had to run down the stairs,

642
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,600
and see me getting hit from a distance.

643
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,730
He thought I was getting bullied.

644
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,540
He thought I was being bullied by Kevin.

645
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,100
So he rushed over angrily and said,

646
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,740
"What are you doing?"

647
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,240
Then he grabbed me and pulled me behind him.

648
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,280
I really felt like

649
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,310
he was so cool when he rushed over.

650
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,480
I was really flustered.

651
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,750
Oh, my. Is it because of me?

652
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,150
My heart was just fluttering.

653
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,320
I told him, that scene really

654
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,730
gave me chills.

655
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,480
And Robert said, right? You felt it, huh?

656
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,930
There was one take where the director didn’t call cut,

657
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,090
so I had to keep acting.

658
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,260
And in the end, the scene naturally turned into

659
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,400
this ambiguous, shy moment.

660
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,930
Robert and I just

661
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,630
went with the flow and kept acting.

662
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,650
That turned out to be the best one.

663
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,380
So they were really on point just now.

664
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,670
Because with one wrong move, if they had actually punched,

665
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,330
Kevin’s face would've been ruined.

666
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,290
But I think Robert

667
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,880
was very cool in that scene, right?

668
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,390
I think it's because Chien Yu,

669
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,540
because he's so muscular,

670
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,030
he's never been...

671
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,480
he's never needed to be protected.

672
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,000
So when he first felt like

673
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,980
someone wanted to protect him,

674
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,400
he got butterflies.

675
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,090
It was such an adorable contrast.

676
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,090
So cute.

677
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,380
I think this ties back to what he shared before

678
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,640
about his relationship with his mom.

679
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:31,470
[Chien Yu felt moved by Robert's protective actions in the scene]

680
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,010
And he's a person

681
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,620
who also wants to be protected.

682
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,640
So at that moment, he got that,

683
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,560
so he was very touched.

684
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,590
Yes, because he said

685
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,890
he wanted to protect his mother

686
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:34,860
from being bullied.

687
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,430
So he trained hard to get strong.

688
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,410
Yeah, and he said,

689
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,760
"Mom, I've grown up. I can protect you now."

690
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,230
But now, when he finally has to stand on his own,

691
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,470
someone else steps in to protect him.

692
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,800
His joy just now, you know...

693
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,200
He wasn't acting at all.

694
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,470
He couldn't hide it at all.

695
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,870
Even through the screen,

696
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,570
you could feel it.

697
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,740
It's amazing.

698
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,380
It feels like someone can protect me.

699
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:59,460
Which role did you choose?

700
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,370
[Adson x Guei x Pink]

701
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,320
I want Kevin to

702
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,990
look at our faces.

703
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,220
Faces? Is he a fortune teller?

704
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,880
I think any of you could play it.

705
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,420
But have you guys already discussed it?

706
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,450
Yeah, we tried different combinations.

707
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
We think we have the best combination

708
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,530
to show you, Kevin.

709
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,330
The best combination.

710
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:22,510
Yes, with us playing the roles that suits us best.

711
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,100
Okay.

712
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:23,830
Do you want to try it?

713
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,510
Sure, you can try it first.

714
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,740
Okay, we'll show you.

715
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,900
Okay.

716
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:34,570
[The three take turns auditioning for the third party]

717
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,260
Let me hide here.

718
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,820
Go over there.

719
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,490
What are you doing?

720
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,980
I want to sit in the middle, not on the side.

721
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,420
Why are you sitting so close?

722
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,470
Why are you squeezing in over here?

723
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,000
The first combination you guys tried

724
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,190
seemed to be more subtle.

725
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,020
[Kevin Chu suggests letting the third party be conveyed through space]

726
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,730
It's not that obvious.

727
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,270
Right?

728
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,310
Come on.

729
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,080
Okay.

730
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,870
I think Pink's addition

731
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:11,040
is perfect for our script.

732
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,810
And Pink said

733
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,980
he wanted to act in a third party storyline.

734
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,320
So when he joined us,

735
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,190
the chemistry between the three of us just clicked.

736
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:35,890
[Aben's prophecy comes true.]

737
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,680
You called it.

738
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,130
He fell down while walking.

739
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,130
Did you watch the trailer first?

740
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,420
Why do you keep guessing right?

741
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,860
And he fell so naturally.

742
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,920
He's perfect for comedy.

743
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:44,950
I want this.

744
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,120
I want Adson...

745
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,870
Adson, let me give you more scenes. Here.

746
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:48,930
Move his butt like this.

747
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:49,370
No.

748
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,460
Get up.

749
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,430
You were crawling like this. It was really funny.

750
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,720
And they are holding hands, right?

751
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,430
Just when you're about to go down,

752
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,100
push their shoulders apart.

753
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,670
Then their hands will naturally let go.

754
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,030
So you need to react in that moment.

755
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,470
-Okay?
-Push them apart?

756
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,710
Yeah, so at that moment, your hands…

757
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,820
when he pushes your shoulders…

758
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,000
Just when I'm about to go down, push them apart.

759
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,710
Push them apart.

760
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,270
So you both have to move aside at that point.

761
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,400
Okay?

762
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,760
You two, don't hide too close to the sofa.

763
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,950
Come on, Pink. Get this right.

764
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,260
You're way too tucked into the sofa. I can't see you at all.

765
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,830
How could you do it?

766
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,060
There's no space over here.

767
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,040
This plot twist is so fresh. I'm really looking forward to it.

768
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,330
Totally unexpected.

769
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,800
Here, you shouldn't be smiling—you should look disappointed.

770
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,370
He's not holding your hand anymore.

771
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,370
Alright, one more time. Hide again.

772
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,240
Is this hide-and-seek?

773
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,250
They were hiding together…

774
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,940
and then got separated.

775
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,730
Maybe.

776
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,440
I really want to know what they're doing.

777
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,940
I've been kneeling for so long

778
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,940
that my legs are completely numb and I've got no strength left.

779
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,140
Is your butt numb too?

780
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,680
I've lost count of how many times my butt hit the floor.

781
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,150
[Adson's butt is sacrificing itself for the art]

782
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,640
You got pushed and your butt hit the floor, right?

783
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,180
And before that, I had to fall on purpose.

784
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,110
I tried three times,

785
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,930
with three different vibes.

786
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:13,330
One was calm and composed,

787
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,700
one was really into the game,

788
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,040
and the other one was serious

789
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,240
but with a bit of humor.

790
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,750
I think all three were fun.

791
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,280
All of them make sense.

792
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,680
It just depends on which one the director prefers.

793
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,350
Although the AC was on in the room,

794
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,750
the corner behind the sofa

795
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,710
was really stuffy.

796
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,060
The three of us were packed together. It was super hot.

797
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,190
And the relationship between us was kind of complicated.

798
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,990
But our hands were sweaty.

799
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,190
By the end, our hands were all sweaty and clammy.

800
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,260
Honestly, it was pretty funny.

801
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,300
I think Pink has a great trait,

802
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,930
which is that his gaze was full of love.

803
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,030
When I looked at him,

804
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,770
I felt like he conveyed a lot of emotions to me.

805
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,200
So I really got invested in the moment.

806
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,440
So when I held his hand,

807
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,210
I genuinely wanted to grip it tightly.

808
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,100
[Their hands were held tightly because of genuine emotions]

809
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,780
Guei just kept doing it over and over.

810
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,350
Because of the lights beside us and other things,

811
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,980
our hands were sweating the whole time.

812
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:10,190
[The heat in the shooting space and the nervousness of the first handholding made Guei and Pink's hands sweat non-stop]

813
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,250
The two of us were like...

814
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,170
"Cut." And we kept...

815
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,950
"Cut."

816
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,050
In the end, we didn't care anymore.

817
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,320
Our hands were all sticky,

818
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,260
covered in each other's sweat.

819
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,200
So cute.

820
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,200
I think the development

821
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,200
is going pretty well.

822
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,420
Yeah, because I never guessed

823
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,580
the third party would be…

824
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
You guessed it earlier.

825
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,680
Adson.

826
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,840
You mean in the game?

827
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,680
Yeah, the part we didn't expect in the game.

828
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,020
But in the end, Pink's gaze…

829
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,010
Yes.

830
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,220
Pink's gaze naturally expressed his feelings, which is not easy.

831
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,720
He really needed to find something he liked

832
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,790
so he could feel it.

833
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,580
And he really moved Guei.

834
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:40,550
[Pink's true feelings moved Guei]

835
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,520
Yeah, and Guei received it.

836
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,330
The two of them just naturally…

837
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,600
And their hands were sweating, and they kept wiping their hands shyly.

838
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,830
But what was Adson doing?

839
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,110
Adson was…

840
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,250
Why did he play the third party like this?

841
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,860
I thought he was trying to intentionally ruin something.

842
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:51,860
In these two parts, we've already

843
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,240
figured out Adson's role.

844
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,460
He's a comedy actor.

845
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,780
He's on the comedy route.

846
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,980
[The Auntie Squad suggests Adson should consider pursuing a career in comedy in the future]

847
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,650
He's a comedy actor.

848
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,230
I think there's another reason.

849
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,200
Adson is the oldest in the group,

850
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,390
so I think he just wanted to create

851
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,440
a good atmosphere for everyone.

852
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,490
That's why he kept making fun of himself,

853
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,310
trying to make everyone happy.

854
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,160
Yeah.

855
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,550
It feels like it's his personality.

856
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,580
I think part of his nature

857
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,250
is really like that.

858
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,430
But falling is really hard to act out.

859
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,750
He did a pretty good job though.

860
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,410
It's easy to get hurt.

861
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,670
No matter what position he fell in,

862
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,650
it looked very natural.

863
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,080
Yeah, I think he's really good at falling.

864
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,310
He once fell like this.

865
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,900
He was quite amusing.

866
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,120
But falling by accident

867
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,150
or filming scenes like these can easily lead to injuries.

868
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,950
Right, I once filmed a horror movie,

869
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,330
where I got possessed.

870
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,520
I had to act as if I had no consciousness

871
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,560
and was possessed,

872
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,690
in a crazy state.

873
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,880
I had to slam into the wall.

874
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,210
[Sounds painful]

875
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,660
I kept slamming into the wall,

876
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,070
just repeatedly slamming.

877
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,400
Because at that moment, I had to really show

878
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,640
that my character's soul was gone,

879
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,810
and that she was possessed by someone else.

880
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,680
So I just kept slamming into the wall.

881
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,810
Even when they called cut, I didn't stop.

882
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:12,360
[When an actor gets into the role, they forget the physical pain]

883
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,450
At the time, I didn't feel any pain.

884
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,610
After that scene,

885
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,580
I actually had a huge bump on my head.

886
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,590
A real lump.

887
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,430
And I needed to put ice on it.

888
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,070
But I didn't feel pain at that moment.

889
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,910
There was some adrenaline running through me.

890
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,260
-You were really in character.
-I felt like I wasn't myself.

891
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,430
I didn't feel anything.

892
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,530
It was pretty fun.

893
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,570
Actually, I've always liked you.

894
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:24,380
[Yi, Fumi, Chris]

895
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,060
I can't see him.

896
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,260
Actually, I've always liked you.

897
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,610
I'll let you see him.

898
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,860
Let's spin around together,

899
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:35,830
and then you can see him.

900
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,770
I think by then, he would be like...

901
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,150
Hug him like this.

902
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,380
And he would be like...

903
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,880
Because you won't be able to see me like that.

904
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,970
Yes.

905
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,510
I want to spin.

906
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,610
Let me spin once.

907
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,240
Actually, I've always liked you.

908
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,640
[Yi looks disengaged]

909
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,290
No, you should do it like this.

910
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,290
Actually, I've always liked you.

911
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,040
[Very intense spinning]

912
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,100
Great.

913
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,200
But the emotions might be...

914
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:07,460
[Sweet and witty words]

915
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,240
Three, four.

916
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,980
Four.

917
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,540
Are you excluding me?

918
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,130
I'll be in the middle.

919
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
What film is that?

920
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,770
Yeah.

921
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,670
Yi would go to Adson,

Right? So you're searching.

it should be easier.

the director said something

1031

that almost

1032
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,420
made me cry.

1033

[Fumi needs to act out the frankness in his straightforward confession]

you've finally got this opportunity,

1038
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,530
and if you don't speak up,

1039
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,250
you won't get a chance with him,

1040

1041

At that moment, I felt like I wanted to cry.

1042

During the rehearsal with Yi,

1043
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,659
I felt like although he seemed this way,

1044
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,070
in many ways,

1045
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,179
I actually think he's very sensitive.

1046
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:42,980
When I was rehearsing with him,

1047
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,080
I think there were many layers

1048
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,350
in the details of his performance.

1049
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,179
During the rehearsal,

1050
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:50,650
I got more opportunities

1051
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,820
to interact

1052
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,719
and spend time with him.

1053
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,870
Although Yi was the one who intruded between Chris and Fumi,

1054
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,970
surprisingly, Fumi and Yi

1055
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,640
seemed to have a more natural dynamic

1056
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,250
during the rehearsal.

1057
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,150
I think Chris put too much pressure on himself.

1058
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,590
Yeah.

1059
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,850
Sometimes, the more you try to perform well,

1060
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:20,180
[The more an actor tries to perform well, the more likely they are to make mistakes]

1061
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,150
the more you focus on yourself,

1062
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:20,250
which makes you less natural and less relaxed in acting.

1063
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,390
Because he might have already planned

1064
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:24,830
that in this scene, he would do this first, and then that,

1065
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,760
and he wanted to execute every step perfectly.

1066
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,360
So, once something wasn't performed the way he expected,

1067
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,280
or his co-actor didn't act as he expected,

1068
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:32,280
he'd get flustered.

1069
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,380
I think Yi,

1070
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,740
despite the language barrier,

1071
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,110
tried really hard to understand

1072
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:42,650
what he was supposed to do.

1073
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:45,220
Also, there's one problem I think

1074
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,820
is often encountered in the early stages of acting,

1075
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,890
which is expectations.

1076
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:51,690
Yes.

1077
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,670
For example, Chris was supposed to be startled.

1078
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,150
But he already knew

1079
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,590
the script said he would be startled.

1080
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,630
So the reason for many NGs in the earlier takes

1081
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,760
was due to his expectation.

1082
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,460
He knew he was going to be startled.

1083
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,610
So in many takes,

1084
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,510
he only reacted

1085
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,770
after being startled.

1086
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:12,610
Yes, he knew it was coming,

1087
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:14,080
so he got more nervous.

1088
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:17,050
I think the scene where he's startled

1089
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,950
is one of the difficult ones.

1090
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,290
Because sometimes,

1091
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,660
like...

1092
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,380
like with Chris,

1093
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,000
as you just said,

1094
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,980
he might appear awkward.

1095
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:36,650
I can understand that because he's never acted before

1096
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,000
and hasn't learned how to.

1097
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,430
Got it.

1098
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:43,370
Have you ever had an experience where you kept getting NGs during filming?

1102
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,910
I'm telling you, this is really my nightmare.

1103
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,180
Because whenever I think about it,

1104
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,450
I get frustrated. "Why couldn't I do it well?"

1105
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,680
Which film was it?

1106
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,360
[Don't recall the past]

1107
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,220
I think it's better not to say directly what it was.

1108
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,330
I can't bring myself to talk about it.

1109
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,080
He's traumatized.

1110
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,770
He can't bring himself to talk about it.

1111
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,490
I don't know what happened to you.

1112
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,860
We really don't know what happened to him.

1113
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,710
[Everyone is confused]

1114
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,930
But seeing him like this,

1115
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,430
maybe by the 12th episode,

1116
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,460
he'll talk about it.

1117
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,470
You should mentally prepare yourself.

1118
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,770
I think this must still be

1119
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,250
a psychological burden for him.

1120
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,520
When he thinks about it, he is like this.

1121
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,250
No.

1122
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,420
Acting is a long road.

1123
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,330
As long as I keep making progress,

1124
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,180
that's fine.

1125
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:23,980
So serious.

1126
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,840
Okay.

1127
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,730
So, I think during this process,

1128
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,220
their interactions with each other

1129
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,550
will affect the final presentation

1130
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,960
of their performance.

1131
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,030
Like when Chris and Yi were pulling scallions together,

1132
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,590
they had a great time,

1133
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,240
making heart gestures and doing other fun things.

1134
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,230
So, I think that maybe when he was acting with Yi,

1135
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,230
he wanted to perform better,

1136
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,130
which made him a little nervous.

1137
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,170
Sometimes, that happens.

1138
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,770
Yeah, so we can pay more attention

1139
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,740
to the details of their interactions

1140
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,890
and see how that affects the drama

1141
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,980
and whether it leads to something more than just acting.

1142
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,640
After watching the eight contestants today,

1143
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,070
I think everyone is really putting in a lot of effort

1144
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,210
and has the desire

1145
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,040
to become a great actor.

1146
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,180
You can't become

1147
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,480
an experienced actor all at once.

1148
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,680
But being brave enough

1149
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,850
to communicate with your co-actors

1150
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,520
is very important.

1151
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,220
So I think

[Coach Kevin is reminding the boys not to forget their original aspirations]

get a massage, relax,

1161
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,070

1164
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,950
He actually said all this with such seriousness.

1165
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,420
He said, "I brought two massage therapists

Yes.

They need to massage each other.

1175
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,440
But actually, it's really important for acting.

[Actors must be able to perform physical contact naturally when filming a gay-themed drama]

you can't hide that.

It's hard.

00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,290
There are many intimate scenes in Professional Body Double too.

1184
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,220
Did you need to break through some psychological barriers,

1185
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,400
or how did you prepare for them?

1186
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,800
Actually, there were a lot,

1187
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,730
but first of all,

1188
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:21,800
we needed to discuss and know

1189

the boundaries each of us can accept.

[Communication is important before filming intimate scenes, knowing each other's limits]

For example, some people don't like too much physical contact.

1193

Through communication, we would know each other's boundaries.

Control the pressure a bit

because calves can be quite sensitive.

1217
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:36,480

I usually give massages to my family,

like my dad or grandpa, but it's just for their necks.

1222

"So this is what foot hair feels like."

1285
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,850
But why does it seem like it's not a privilege?

1286
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,840
Why is the camera shooting Guei?

1287
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,710
Yes.

1288
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,480
Now let's exchange.

1289
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,550
You can get down slowly.

1290
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,450
No, it's very Thai style.

1291
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:29,920
You don't feel anything?

1292
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,190
Yi is used to the Thai style.

1293
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,380
Is the pressure okay?

1294
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:33,790
When applying the essential oil,

1295
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:37,210
after applying it, put your palms on his back.

1296
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:38,730
Actually, he's a bit shy.

1297
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:39,780
Yes, very funny.

1298
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,320
I was standing in front of his head,

1299
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,450
massaging his back, like this.

1300
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,390
Then my private parts were facing him.

1301
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:48,750
We kept giggling.

1302
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:49,910
Your nails are in my flesh.

1303
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:52,420
I'm not, I'm just like this.

1304
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,150
Your nails are in my flesh.

1305
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,760
You need to lift your fingers like this.

1306
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:57,370
I am.

1307
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,450
He's already lifted them.

1308
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:00,050
Yeah.

1309
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,670
When I was massaging Robert,

1310
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,370
I was very serious.

1311
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:05,470
But I have to say,

1312
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:06,350
he did it really terribly.

1313
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:09,740
And he really used his nails,

1314
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:12,350
[Chien Yu is complaining about Robert's massage skills]

1315
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,580
like this, digging into my flesh.

1316
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,410
After the massage,

1317
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:15,410
I saw a line here.

1318
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:18,720
I was like "How much do you not want to be paired with me?"

1319
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,820
I think he really wasn't trying at all.

1320
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,790
And I noticed other groups seemed to be having fun too.

1321
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:24,720
Everyone was almost falling asleep by the end.

1322
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:19,500
That's all?

1323
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,330
That's all?

1324
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:21,370
It's a very healing...

1325
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,970
Yeah, it ended with the massage.

1326
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,590
Yeah, it's a really stress-relieving ending.

1327
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,270
After watching, I really want to get a massage.

1328
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,300
The key is the intimate contact.

1329
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,660
This is a very intimate contact.

1330
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:33,290
Because giving a massage

1331
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,870
isn't just about pressing hard.

1332
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:38,810
The key is to understand how the other one feels.

1333
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,080
Whether it hurts anywhere,

1334
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,280
or what sensations pressing a certain spot brings.

1335
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,100
It's about the delicate care.

1336
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:44,300
Yes. So, have you noticed any pairs

1337
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,050
that seemed especially in sync?

1338
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,810
I think Chien Yu is really good at massaging Robert,

1339
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,840
but Robert can't massage him properly.

1340
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,540
Even though he was complaining about Robert,

1341
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,040
I felt like there was something

1342
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,680
between them. I don't know why.

1343
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,650
I don't know why.

1344
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:04,370
[Chien Yu and Robert's interaction is worth observing]

1345
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:00,950
Because he was protected.

1346
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,050
Maybe it started...

1347
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,850
back when they were filming.

1348
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:05,390
I feel like those two might actually be able to...

1349
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:06,020
because I think Robert

1350
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,490
was teasing him.

1351
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:08,120
Yeah.

1352
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,960
He was really cute and always overreacting,

1353
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,280
like "Ahh, it hurts! Ahh!"

1354
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:14,800
Robert was like a typical stupid straight guy

1355
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:17,060
who liked to mess around with him.

1356
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,370
The more you scream, the more he wants to trick you.

1357
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:22,200
I feel like they probably have some interesting developments ahead.

1358
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,410
So, it seems like the two of them are getting closer and closer.

1359
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,980
Niki, what do you think about Chris and his partner?

1360
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,780
Isn't there something subtle between Chris and Guei?

1361
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:30,880
You mentioned the pair I wanted to talk about.

1362
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,310
Wasn't everyone...

1363
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:40,650
[There's something subtle between Guei and Chris]

1364
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:34,310
Because Chris was screaming the whole time.

1365
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:36,620
We only saw his upper body, and he was constantly screaming.

1366
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,490
Everyone's attention was drawn to him.

1367
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:42,510
Four people were giving him a massage like crazy.

1368
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:45,500
And then the camera panned to Guei.

1369
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:47,300
Right, I was just wondering why it suddenly...

1370
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,270
Maybe it's because he really cares about him.

1371
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,800
I think there are two pairs that are really interesting.

1372
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,840
One is Yi and...

1373
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,050
One is Yi and Adson.

1374
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,040
Whenever one of them was doing something,

1375
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,540
the other would try to find him.

1376
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,680
They would subconsciously find each other

1377
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,800
[Queen of BL is observing]

1378
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,580
and start playing around—

1379
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,380
like fake kissing and stuff.

1380
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:08,420
The other pair is Chris and Guei.

1381
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,820
At first,

1382
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:13,890
they didn't seem to get along,

1383
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:16,160
but after they were separated,

1384
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,190
at different moments,

1385
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:20,730
they seemed to care about each other.

1386
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:22,230
What's that called again—

1387
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:23,760
when two people get closer through arguments?

1388
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,370
Enemies-to-lovers?

1389
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:26,430
Yes, something like that.

1390
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:30,290
Guei and Chris are that type.

1391
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,620
I'm looking forward to it.

1392
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,670
Maybe after going through different performances,

1393
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:35,940
they'll end up back together

1394
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,380
and things will develop naturally between them.

1395
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:39,610
Or maybe they'll really part ways.

1396
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,790
This episode is over. That's it.

1397
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:44,240
That's it? So, do we have any massage services here?

1398
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:45,280
No, right?

1399
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,100
No.

1400
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,410
Let's look forward to more development in the next episode.
