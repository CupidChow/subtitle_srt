00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,220
Oh my god.

377
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,600
Too many.

378
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,970
I know.

379
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,080
We are going to fry it later. This will all spill out.

380
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,750
This should do.

381
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,870
Interesting.

382
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,520
After their hard work,

383
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,950
they can have the delicious food.

384
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:08,670
Yes.

385
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,430
But just now,

386
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,430
since the level of closeness varies,

387
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,450
Robert was slightly left out.

388
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,580
Yes, I think so.

389
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,570
Yes, because they fed him,

390
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,390
pushed for him and made for him.

391
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,190
Robert is too good.

392
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,010
He already finished it and is waiting on the side.

393
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,540
Yeah, a little bit.

394
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,320
He can't intervene.

395
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,730
Are you the person who peels shrimp for others?

396
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:29,780
He doesn't

397
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,560
look like that kind of person.

398
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,550
His expression says it all.

399
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,460
What's your zodiac sign?

400
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,160
Taurus.

401
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:40,890
You too, right?

402
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,100
Me too.

403
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,940
Really? When was he born?

404
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,030
Which year were you born?

405
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,460
1996.

406
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,440
I'm 1997, one year younger than you.

407
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,520
He is younger.

408
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,560
I'm April 21.

409
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,390
Are you going to check if you two match?

410
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,200
You two talk so seriously.

411
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,630
Hello, Taurus.

412
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,280
That means you should go away.

413
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,120
Yes, I'm in an awkward position.

414
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,320
He's on a blind date.

415
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,450
I'm not good at peeling.

416
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,560
I can peel it if you want me to.

417
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,260
I just don't like peeling, but I can.

418
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,980
Got it.

419
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,060
Okay.

420
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,700
Okay.

421
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,000
Accidentally learned that Poom is Taurus.

422
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,170
Write it down.

423
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:24,870
He doesn't peel shrimp.

424
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,270
He doesn't know how to peel shrimp.

425
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,970
I need to practice peeling shrimp.

426
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,270
So the team who peeled shrimp is interesting.

427
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,240
We see

428
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,300
different combinations.

429
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,220
They will lean toward to the other person while talking.

430
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,530
Yes. And I saw Pink

431
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,820
helping Guei pick up the fish meat.

432
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,380
And Guei gave the shrimp to Pink.

433
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,620
But Pink fed Chien Yu shrimp.

434
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,590
It's a special relationship between the four of them.

435
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,500
The four of them are very close.

436
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,200
Yes.

437
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,230
But the atmosphere of that team is much better.

438
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,230
Yeah, because they had a competition

439
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,670
and they knew each other well.

440
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,240
There is no other person that they don't know.

441
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,910
So the atmosphere is good.

442
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,610
Yes.

443
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,150
This is my face.

444
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,680
You just said...

445
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,440
My face

446
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,430
He is playful.

447
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,220
Yeah.

448
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,300
Everyone has to press theirs.

449
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,810
Let's...

450
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,920
Yi, I'll record it for you.

451
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,140
Okay, Yi. Let's go.

452
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,220
Let's go.

453
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,440
Looks professional.

454
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,160
How many do you want?

455
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,690
I don't want it.

456
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:29,650
You don't want it?

457
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,470
I don't want yours.

458
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,450
Which two are yours?

459
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,870
Yi is really cute.

460
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,630
Yes, he's cute.

461
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,020
Okay. It looks great.

462
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,850
It looks great.

463
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,290
It looks great.

464
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,410
Look at mine, it looks like a heart.

465
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,680
But your heart is broken.

466
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,340
Yes, it's broken.

467
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,470
I made it for you.

468
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,240
It's none of my business.

469
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,700
Yours is broken.

470
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,460
Put it back.

471
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,210
Keep recording. I'll record first.

472
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,550
I'll put on my gloves later.

473
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,390
Flip here first?

474
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,510
Yes, yours.

475
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,430
It's hot.

476
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,800
Robert's outfit is so sexy from this angle.

477
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,520
A scheming battle suit.

478
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,680
-He’s wearing a net.
-Yeah.

479
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,140
The light will...

480
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,440
But it's cool.

481
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,720
Yes, these two look good.

482
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:19,770
This is mine.

483
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,820
Come on.

484
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,530
Our chef is here.

485
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:27,850
Start from the first one.

486
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,480
You start from one, two, three, four.

487
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,200
Okay.

488
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,760
Be careful, it'll splatter.

489
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,710
This is his scallion pancake.

490
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:34,830
I'm sorry.

491
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,880
I've never seen a boss wearing sunglasses before.

492
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,750
How many? How many?

493
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,290
I want three.

494
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,390
I'll come and get them at 5 p.m.

495
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,380
It will be NT$600.

496
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,960
NT$600 for three?

497
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,980
I don't want it then.

498
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,250
Like a...

499
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,980
You know? Like a...

500
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,070
Like the Danish thing?

501
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,880
Inside has jelly?

502
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,840
There is...

503
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,760
Jam cookies.

504
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,860
Yes.

505
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,810
Right?

506
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,860
There needs to be enough oil so that when it's fried, the outside becomes crispy.

507
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,510
Heart.

508
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,510
What are they doing?

509
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,410
Yes.

510
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,820
[Two worlds between them]

511
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,600
But we're broken.

512
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,280
So, do I have to flip it again?

513
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,700
Move it a bit closer,

514
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,060
since there's less oil over there.

515
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,300
Move it closer.

516
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,210
Be careful.

517
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,010
Adson is really...

518
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,670
It took them so long to make it. Don't burn it.

519
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,820
He is really funny.

520
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,120
Yes, I can't listen to his briefing

521
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,450
if he's the CEO.

522
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,650
Burnt?

523
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,650
Burnt in Burnt in Taiwanese Hokkien.

524
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,590
I don't know.

525
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,620
Burnt.

526
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,160
Burnt.

527
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,660
It sounds like you're cursing, right?

528
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,540
Yes.

529
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,730
Have a chat with Robert.

530
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,820
It's hot.

531
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,530
It's really hot.

532
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,990
I have a conclusion now.

533
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,520
Pink knows everything.

534
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,340
But Adson, what can you do?

535
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,860
He can just pretend to be cool.

536
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,830
But you mentioned earlier that

537
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,700
Robert was still left out.

538
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,830
I can't help but want to say...

539
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:07,740
[Chris, Adson, and Yi interact happily, but there is no room for Robert]

540
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,200
Don't just talk among yourselves like this.

541
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,300
Yeah, they are just one day apart, really.

542
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,670
He didn't say anything.

543
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,920
Yes, because he's wearing his battle outfit.

544
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,970
I didn't realize it until I was halfway there.

545
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,700
Wait. Can I see through things?

546
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,950
I saw everything.

547
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,290
I accidentally saw the curve of his body. It was sexy.

548
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,900
But I really like that outfit.

549
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,270
It's cool, isn't it?

550
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,210
It feels cool.

551
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,010
You either look at their muscles or their clothes.

552
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,080
We are hoping to see you

553
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,670
wearing a complete see through suit in the next episode.

554
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,420
I'll go back and work on it.

555
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,050
Cut more holes myself.

556
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,040
Shimmering in and out of view.

557
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,940
I think these practices and experiences...

558
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:42,850
Don't think that

559
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,740
how we became a travel show.

560
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,530
No, they need to explore

561
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,030
their life experiences and emotions through this process.

562
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,700
Next they need to practice.

563
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:59,530
[In the upcoming drama class, the boys will learn to express their emotions]

564
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,160
It's about how to naturally

565
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,470
express different emotions,

566
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,610
like sadness or happiness.

567
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,380
It's really hard.

568
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,280
Yes, it's really hard for us when we start acting.

569
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
Right. Because when I started acting,

570
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,080
I couldn't express my emotions.

571
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,040
When they ask me to laugh.

572
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,970
Hahaha.

573
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,620
It was really awkward.

574
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,620
And everyone thinks it's hard to cry.

575
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,820
Laughing is actually the hardest.

576
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,150
It's hard to smile.

577
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,980
It's harder to smile sincerely than cry.

578
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,370
Sometimes it's awkward.

579
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,990
You can tell when it's a fake smile.

580
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:27,580
[Drama class: Expressing your own emotions]

581
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,480
Close your eyes and think about

582
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,300
what you have experienced,

583
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,180
whether it's challenges, setbacks,

584
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,060
or something you can't get over.

585
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,600
Repeat these four sentences,

586
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:45,250
I'm sorry, please forgive me, thank you and I love you,

587
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,460
with your true feelings.

588
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:50,570
So that you can convey your feelings to your friends.

589
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
I love you.

590
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,080
Please forgive me.

591
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,290
Thank you.

592
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,920
Please forgive me.

593
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,700
Thank you.

594
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,540
Not bad. They're all really serious about it.

595
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,260
Yes.

596
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,180
There are genuine feelings.

597
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,010
I'm sorry.

598
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,170
I love you.

599
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,560
I love you.

600
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,910
Please forgive me.

601
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,550
I love you.

602
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,130
I'm actually quite nervous.

603
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,970
Because I rarely accept other people's emotions,

604
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,840
especially through eye contact,

605
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,720
unless I'm the one involved.

606
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,610
It caught me off guard for a moment.

607
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,720
I'm sorry.

608
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,670
I'm sorry.

609
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,840
Please forgive me.

610
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,420
I love you.

611
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,450
I love you.

612
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,040
I'm sorry.

613
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,570
I've always wanted to find a chance...

614
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:48,280
I've always wanted to act.

615
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,570
I'm just doing it with pure intentions.

616
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,980
I wanted to give up several times.

617
00:20:51,320 --> 00:21:02,910
[Adson once considered giving up acting]

618
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,480
But after I gave up,

619
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,480
not even a month passed,

620
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,710
I started thinking, how could I not act?

621
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,790
I'm the kind of person

622
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,640
who only shares good news with family and friends.

623
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,250
Because there's no need

624
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,480
to bring these emotions to others.

625
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,910
I hope to

626
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,900
bring others

627
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,980
happiness.

628
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,600
Yeah, so I have many unhappy...

629
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,760
Many unhappy emotions,

630
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:38,160
I actually hope to keep them buried in my heart.

631
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,250
Don't...

632
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,580
Don't give it to others.

633
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,140
So I feel that

634
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,170
I'd rather process these emotions on my own

635
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,480
than bring them to the people around me.

636
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,170
I've never seen him like this.

637
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,910
He is expressing his true feelings.

638
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:05,560
Yeah.

639
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,510
I think drama class is about

640
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,840
digging into your inner life experiences

641
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,580
and using them as motivation for your performance.

642
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,050
That's the reason

643
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:15,980
I like acting.

644
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,000
Acting is more like

645
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,220
an emotional release

646
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,440
rather than a job.

647
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,800
Immersing yourself in a character

648
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,840
and experiencing a different life.

649
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,410
So I can understand Adson.

650
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,810
He suddenly got into that state.

651
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,610
In the process of acting,

652
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,850
or after the drama class,

653
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:33,680
you'll start to realize

654
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,180
what you've been neglecting

655
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,450
and didn't pay attention to.

656
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,690
And for many people,

657
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,920
the source of their pain is their family.

658
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,670
Yeah. I feel that he is under a lot of pressure.

659
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,600
And he's the oldest

660
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,890
among these boys.

661
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,700
He also has acting experience.

662
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,530
Well... I think what he said...

663
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:55,200
about, at the beginning, whether an actor should just take on any...

664
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,970
Because a lot of the time,

665
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:04,870
[Adson's situation is the journey that every actor goes through]

666
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,110
your source of income might be really unstable.

667
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,930
You wonder if you should give up,

668
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,390
and then there's the pressure from your family...

669
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:02,760
When I was watching just now,

670
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,330
I felt so bad for him.

671
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:04,930
Yeah.

672
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,960
Poom, have you ever given up on your dreams—

673
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,370
like acting or any other job?

674
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,630
Not yet.

675
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,940
Because I feel like, if I want to do something,

676
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,770
I just want to give it my all.

677
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,890
Ever since I became an actor…

678
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,410
well, I started out doing bit parts.

679
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,910
Sometimes, in a drama,

680
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,710
I only had two lines.

681
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,120
But I felt happy just to be acting.

682
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,090
I just wanted to keep going as much as I could.

683
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,490
Really? Amazing.

684
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,690
I think what he said is great.

685
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:37,190
Because in situations like Adson's,

686
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,200
I feel like you shouldn't give up any opportunity.

687
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,000
Sure, actors don't get to choose,

688
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
but just like now, you're on this reality show,

689
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,070
Love Casting.

690
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,100
You never know which director or producer

691
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,210
might notice you.

692
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,410
It's hard to say.

693
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,380
It's an opportunity.

694
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,240
Yeah.

695
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,490
A lot of times, opportunities come

696
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,880
when you least expect them,

697
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,210
or when you're still holding on,

698
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,450
and then at that final moment, someone sees you.

699
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,180
Yes.

700
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,230
I'm sorry.

701
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,490
Thank you.

702
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,500
Please forgive me.

703
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:18,830
I'm sorry.

704
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,120
I'm really good at talking to myself,

705
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,500
but I'm really bad at

706
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,700
praising myself

707
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,790
or acknowledging myself.

708
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,900
Because ever since I was a kid,

709
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:35,020
[Fumi has always been holding himself to high standards and just can't let himself off the hook]

710
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,710
I've always been too hard on myself.

711
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,440
Of course it has something to do with my growth environment.

712
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,350
I grew up in an environment

713
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,080
where I had to

714
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,680
hold myself to high standards,

715
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,940
demanding a lot from myself.

716
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,870
So, this has really caused me a lot of pain.

717
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:43,940
I love you.

718
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,630
When the teacher was

719
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,530
talking about these four lines,

720
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,980
I almost couldn't hold it in anymore.

721
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,470
When I was a kid—

722
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:18,440
[The knot in Guei's heart]

723
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:10,490
it was either kindergarten

724
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,350
or elementary school. I forgot.

725
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,150
And...

726
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,240
Our school had a sports day.

727
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:22,180
And there was a race.

728
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,440
I was running the final leg of the race.

729
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,980
My parents were cheering for me

730
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,370
from the sidelines.

731
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,100
Well...

732
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,480
Anyway, I was

733
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,560
about to win,

734
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,620
but I was passed in the end.

735
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,930
I was so angry,

736
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,540
thinking it was because my parents

737
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:42,980
were cheering for me and distracting me

738
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:46,140
that I lost focus and ended up losing.

739
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,150
After class,

740
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,910
I threw my lunchbox at my mom.

741
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:53,780
Well...

742
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,270
I can't forget her expression that day.

743
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,080
Every time I think about it, I feel so guilty. Yeah.

744
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,800
There were so many moments like that.

745
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,130
I've never forgiven myself.

746
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,940
Please forgive me.

747
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,270
Thank you.

748
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,000
Thank you.

00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,960
I love you.

750
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,000
The person I wanted to wish well

751
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,940
was an old friend of mine.

752
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,410
Maybe because of some issues or the difference in our circles,

753
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:40,510
I felt like he had changed,

754
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,050
like I didn't know him anymore.

755
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,250
But I've never talked to him about it.

756
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,260
I just chose to end our friendship unilaterally

757
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:50,710
[Chris's unsaid goodbye]

758
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,850
and stop keeping in touch with him.

759
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,860
I thought I had let it go.

760
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,090
But during that segment just now,

761
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,520
when I really...

762
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,220
treated him as that person,

763
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,200
I realized that

764
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,000
saying goodbye to him brought up a lot of emotions.

765
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,490
I'm sorry.

766
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,250
Thank you.

767
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:28,900
Since I was little, my mom didn't get along

768
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:29,990
with my father's side of the family.

769
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,960
It was because our family's

770
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,560
financial situation wasn't great.

771
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,890
My mom often worked two or even three jobs

772
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,670
to support me and my sister.

773
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,440
Because she was rarely home,

774
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,010
my grandmother misunderstood her,

775
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:49,910
thinking she might have a lover outside or something like that.

776
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,580
I really wanted to help my mom clear things up,

777
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,620
but I was too young back then and couldn't do anything.

778
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,760
I didn't know what to do.

779
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,990
And I felt like I had

780
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,420
let my family down,

781
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,390
especially my mom.

782
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,060
It was like she had to face pressure

783
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,330
from her in-laws,

784
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,730
from money, from life, all on her own.

785
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,830
I feel like... I've grown up now,

786
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,260
but why can't I

787
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,970
help carry some of the burden for her?

788
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,330
Dear Ms. Chen, my mom,

789
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:21,180
[Chien Yu's love for his mother]

790
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,470
I really love you.

791
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,090
Even though I'm not always good with words,

792
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,870
I want you to know

793
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,300
that I really want to ease your worries.

794
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,230
Because I want you to know

795
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,630
that your boy has become a man.

796
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,050
He's working hard to help share your burden,

797
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,350
whether it's through money, emotional support,

798
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,320
or anything else.

799
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,470
You just need to know that I love you very much.

800
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,420
Love you.

801
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,900
I've participated in some talent shows before.

802
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,950
After they aired, there was a lot of feedback,

803
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,590
good and bad,

804
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,420
across various platforms.

805
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,960
As for the malicious criticism,

806
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,430
it really got to me.

807
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,750
I couldn't let it go and kept thinking about it.

808
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:01,820
[Pink cares a lot about online hate comments]

809
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:00,100
At that time, I didn't know what to do.

810
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,130
I just wanted to escape.

811
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,300
I wanted

812
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,450
to try to forgive.

813
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,480
"Can you please let yourself go

814
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,280
and stop holding on to those who

815
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,060
speak ill of you

816
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,090
or maliciously attack you?"

817
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:19,480
Mom, Dad, I'm happy right now.

818
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,750
I'm in good health.

819
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,770
Don't worry about me.

820
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,940
We can have a good meal together

821
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:34,410
[Yi's message to his distant parents]

822
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:33,470
because it's been a long time since we ate together.

823
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,180
So I gave myself two years

824
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:46,250
[Yi gave himself two years to pursue his acting dreams]

825
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,750
to chase my dreams

826
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:46,370
and work hard on my acting.

827
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:50,660
If I fail, I'll have to go back to Canada

828
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,970
and make money.

829
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,430
Yeah, so I feel a little pressure.

830
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:01,960
But I'm satisfied with this period.

831
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,890
Because I sacrificed a lot to do this.

832
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,890
So I want to tell myself:

833
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,480
[Yi's message to himself]

834
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,470
Work hard. Work harder.

835
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,210
And...

836
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,600
Work hard, you know? Work harder.

837
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,020
Yi, you have to work harder.

838
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,130
He's talking to himself.

839
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:24,830
Yes.

840
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,300
Because it's been tough for him.

841
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,010
He moved from Canada to Thailand to pursue his career,

842
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:31,840
and now he's also working in Taiwan.

843
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,880
So, he's far from home.

844
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,630
When you're far from home, you really have no one to rely on.

845
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:39,050
I think being far from home really makes you feel lonely.

846
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,120
You will get homesick.

847
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,750
Sometimes when you pick up the phone,

848
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,150
before you can say anything,

849
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,050
you just say, "Mom" and start crying.

850
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:45,520
Yeah.

851
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,360
I think this part is very touching.

852
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,330
Everyone shared

853
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,800
their inner thoughts so honestly.

854
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,730
And I was just thinking,

855
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,090
if I had a son,

856
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,620
I would want him to be like Chien Yu.

857
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,070
I think he's amazing.

858
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,070
He's such a great son.

859
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:04,190
[Qiao Qiao hopes to have a son as thoughtful as Chien Yu]

860
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,470
Yes, he's kind, right?

861
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,610
I hope I have a son like him in the future.

862
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,270
He's great.

863
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,110
Good boy.

864
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,910
I think he remembers a lot of little details,

865
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,650
and he looks at everyone

866
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,450
and his family with a kind heart.

867
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,990
Yes. And he really cares about his mom

868
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,600
and really wants to do something for her. He's great.

869
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,600
What's even more precious

870
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,710
is that he has the courage to tell his mom,

871
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,300
"Mom, I love you," in front of the camera.

872
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,600
Actually, I always thought that Guei...

873
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:27,560
This kind of activity is more about emotional expression.

874
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,500
I always thought Guei couldn't do it.

875
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,930
He seemed like he couldn't get into it.

876
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:31,840
Yes, because he's more...

877
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,470
You know, he's a Taiwan style handsome guy.

878
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,060
Taiwan style handsome guys care about their image and wouldn't dare to say it.

879
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,930
But unexpectedly, in the end, he opened his heart.

880
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:53,190
[Guei let down his guard and truly faced his emotions]

881
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,650
He said he couldn't forgive himself.

882
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,310
I realized that he remembers

883
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,220
a lot of small details.

884
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,620
He also reflects on himself a lot.

885
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,020
When he's at his most introspective,

886
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,420
he really thinks deeply about himself.

887
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,730
It's a side of him we've never seen before.

888
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,860
There was an important point mentioned earlier—

889
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,660
that these class segments

890
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,270
and moments of sharing their inner thoughts

891
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,840
are actually quite helpful when it comes to acting.

892
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,870
Some people can use these life experiences

893
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:09,820
[Releasing true emotions helps actors get into character]

894
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:10,010
to push themselves into certain emotions.

895
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:10,640
I'm really happy,

896
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,360
because it feels like

897
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,280
we're watching these boys grow.

898
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,210
Right? In the first episode,

899
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,450
they were still a little shy.

900
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:17,950
Yes.

901
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:18,950
Now, in the fourth episode,

902
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,570
they're already revealing their inner world

903
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,840
honestly and openly.

904
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,170
And the teacher is really weird.

905
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,140
What's with those four lines?

906
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,350
Audience, try it for yourselves.

907
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,230
It's ridiculous.

908
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:30,880
I'm sorry.

909
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,250
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

910
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,550
And when you look at someone's eyes...

911
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,930
That power is scary.

912
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:35,770
Thank you. I love you.

913
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,800
When you say these four lines,

914
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,140
if there's someone beside you, look at them.

915
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:45,410
[Please use "I'm sorry," "Please forgive me," "Thank you," and "I love you" to cleanse your soul]

916
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,810
If there's a dog, look at the dog.

917
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,340
If there's no one, take a mirror

918
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,110
and say it to yourself.

919
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,500
You can even say it to food.

920
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,690
Say "I love you" to a bag of chips.

921
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,120
"Thank you for being eaten by me."

922
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,170
I think these four lines can really evoke

923
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,320
a lot of different emotions for actors.

924
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,140
I think it's a...

925
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,070
it's a cycle.

926
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,890
In life, we always need...

927
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:06,060
we always need a chance to apologize,

928
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,000
then be accepted and forgiven...

929
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,240
by the other side.

930
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,500
Then we can say "thank you,"

931
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,020
and only then can we say "I love you."

932
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,110
At this moment, is there

933
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,580
a person's face appearing in your mind?

934
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:19,150
Can you say these four lines to them in front of the camera?

935
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,270
Or do you need to say them to Poom?

936
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,590
Or say them to Poom.

937
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,080
You just met.

938
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,910
You just randomly called someone again, didn't you?

939
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,590
I'm sorry. I love you.

940
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,980
I can do this.

00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,250

943
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,350
I really want to act.

Poom. I love you.

945
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,310
Yes, but I think...

946
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,740
the focus of these four lines is to...

947
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,130
understand yourself.

948
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,950
When we say these four lines,

949
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,590
we would look into our own hearts.

950
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,590
Because many things

951
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,650
are sealed deep inside us for a long time,

952
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,090
and only when we have the chance to forgive ourselves

953
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,360
can we say it out loud.

954
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:57,000
["I'm sorry," "Please forgive me," "Thank you," and "I love you"—these four lines are a process of reconciling with ourselves]

955
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:54,160
After being forgiven, we can also thank ourselves.

956
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,700
We can even say, "I love myself."

957
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,600
Yes, did you hear that? It's not asking you to confess your feelings to someone.

958
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:01,470
I laid out a whole speech just for me to say "I love you" to him.

959
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,310
But it turned out to be quite profound.

960
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,460
I learned another lesson. I hate it.

961

Yes.

It's a bit awkward for me to be in the middle.

It's so classy.

978
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,139
I'll give it points. The air conditioning is really strong. I'll give it points for that.

979

I think the production team is really thoughtful.

Because in the previous episodes,

1041
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,930

1042
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,930

00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,010
Poom, who do you think

1111
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,660
is suited to play which role?

1112
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,630
It's hard to choose.

1113
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:11,800
Because everyone has their own background.

1114
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,670
But I saw someone has experience with misunderstanding a friend.

1115
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,700
That's Chris.

1116
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,650
Yes, because Chris

1117
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,610
confessed to his friend.

1118
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,010
Yes, yes.

1119
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,950
Or Chris might choose "Separation."

1120
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,250
I don't know.

1121
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,810
Chris could play any role.

1122
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:28,890
Now let's see

1123
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,490
who will sleep with whom next.

1124
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:37,050
[The last one, Yi, will announce the boys' sleeping arrangements for tonight]

1125
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,420
Can we open our eyes?

1126
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:39,220
I don't think so.

1127
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,980
Slow down.

1128
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:42,950
No! Hurry!

1129
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,510
So cute.

1130
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,410
[The boys are walking forward with their eyes closed and hands placed on the shoulders of the person in front of them]

1131
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,500
What are they doing?

1132
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:47,890
Okay.

1133
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:51,600
[Struggling to move]

1134
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,850
Are there stairs?

1135
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:50,890
No.

1136
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,670
Is this a trust game?

1137
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:54,960
Wait.

1138
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,710
Okay, stop.

1139
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:57,330
Stop.

1140
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,100
Don't open your eyes.

1141
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,840
Can I put my hands down?

1142
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,480
Can we put our hands down first?

1143
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:09,460
[Yi's departure makes everyone feel flustered]

1144
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,280
Can we put our hands down first?

1145
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,610
No.

1146
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,220
Don't move.

1147
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,300
Don't move.

1148
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,810
Don't move. Okay.

1149
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,340
Okay, we'll listen to you.

1150
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,340
[Separation]

1151
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,800
Let me help you.

1152
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,330
Okay, I'll go downstairs first.

1153
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,480
I trust you.

1154
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,740
-Left.
-Left?

1155
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,120
No.

1156
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:23,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1157
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,350
Yeah?

1158
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1159
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,030
Okay, one more.

1160
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,670
Okay. Sit here?

1161
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,040
Can I open my eyes now?

1162
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,290
I can't?

1163
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,710
Am I going down? Are there stairs?

1164
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,660
He's going to pair them directly.

1165
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,700
He's going to have them sit together directly.

1166
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,120
One more. Down.

1167
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,030
Is that all?

1168
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:49,490
So, is Adson going to pair up with Guei?

1169
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,770
s the scenario we've been hoping for going to happen?

1170
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,040
Really?

1171
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,460
Okay. Sit.

1172
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,610
I'm the last one. How long do I have to stand here?

1173
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,480
You can sit here.

1174
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,010
Yi, are you coming to guide me?

1175
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:06,750
Let me think about it.

1176
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,380
Think about it. You're the last one.

1177
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,250
Robert, come on.

1178
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,610
[Panic]

1179
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:10,360
Where are you?

1180
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,700
Don't move.

1181
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:13,860
Don't move.

1182
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,960
Don't move.

1183
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,490
[Trying to stay calm]

1184
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,950
Why did I step on a pillow?

1185
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:19,830
Okay.

1186
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:22,090
And sit.

1187
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,960
No way!

1188
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,260
Why did it stop here?

1189
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,670
I really want to see who will sleep with whom later.

1190
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,210
Do you have to do this to us?

1191
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,570
Yeah, but I had a glimmer of hope

1192
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,180
when I saw Guei and Adson.

1193
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:44,610
And the last pair was Fumi and Chris.

1194
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,720
They are also quite suitable for each other.

1195
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47,810
But Guei and Adson are what I'm really looking forward to.

1196
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,630
If they can sleep together...

1197
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:52,210
And since Yi was next to Pink earlier.

1198
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:54,850
Right, so Chien Yu will sleep with Robert, I think.

1199
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,190
Seems possible.

1200
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,620
Because Chien Yu and Robert will be...

1201
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:01,980
Yeah, Chien Yu and Robert would be...

1202
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,250
You know, Robert is very manly and straight.

1203
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,430
So, unexpectedly,

1204
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,370
their contrasting personalities

1205
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,970
might balance each other out.

1206
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,200
No, he'll take another identical shirt

1207
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,430
from his suitcase for him.

1208
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:16,430
Both of them will wear sheer outfits.

1209
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,650
Both of them are in good shape.

1210
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,810
Remember to get one for me too.

1211
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,320
Then Guei and Adson...

1212
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,110
I'm really looking forward to them sleeping together.

1213
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,900
Because the key point is that they opened up

1214
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,240
about their vulnerable sides earlier in the afternoon.

1215
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,880
So maybe that night,

1216
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,320
they'll talk even more.

1217
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,560
Yeah, and I'm also looking forward to their video shoot.

1218
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,160
Yes.

1219
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,260
I wonder what it'll be like.

1220
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:40,460
I'm so excited. In the next episode,

1221
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,630
we'll see all the new pairings.
