00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,530
[Final day
Confession]

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:10,750
[Only boys who choose each other
can shoot the final script]

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,980
I want to choose the one that makes me feel the most comfortable.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,540
[Previously]

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,450
And I think the most interesting and funny...

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:22,840
[Adson already has someone in his heart]

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,710
I think we get along very well and we are really a match.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,110
Robert makes me feel that

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,290
I can change my role.

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:37,500
[Chien Yu chose Robert]

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,670
I've always been the one taking care of others,

12
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,110
always the one giving,

13
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,810
which makes me feel like

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,870
I can find some warmth and care from him.

15
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,640
Actually, I'm considering

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,110
between Adson and Pink.

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,990
[Love Casting]

18
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,020
Guei just said

19
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,080
[Auntie Squad: Aben]

20
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,020
he has two choices.

21
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,940
[Auntie Squad: Poom]

22
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,940
[Auntie Squad: Qiao Qiao, Kimi Hsia]

23
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,940
[Auntie Squad: Chu, Ernie Chu]

24
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,190
One is Pink and the other is Adson.

25
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,850
[Auntie Squad: Queen of BL, Niki]

26
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,060
So he officially said goodbye to Chris.

27
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,360
[Auntie Squad's expected couple pairing, Chris & Guei
becomes impossible]

28
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,500
It's over.

29
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,630
Poom. What do you think?

30
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,620
Guei and Pink.

31
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,800
Guei and Pink.

32
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,840
Yes, Guei and Pink.

33
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,870
Yes, yes, yes.

34
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,210
Why?

35
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,440
Because when they performed together,

36
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:23,200
their fingers were tightly intertwined, and they exchanged glances.

37
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:27,240
[Poom supports the hand-holding couple Guei and Pink]

38
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,570
I know. When they were tightly holding hands.

39
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,190
Yes, tightly holding hands.

40
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,490
You need to fully trust each other

41
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,420
to show that kind of feeling.

42
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,990
Okay, deep down, we hope that...

43
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:35,810
Guei and Pink.

44
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,700
Guei chooses Pink.

45
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:40,200
Chien Yu is obvious

46
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,270
because he wants to choose Robert.

47
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,650
And Adson.

48
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,240
Adson will definitely choose Yi.

49
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,670
I'm very happy that

50
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,320
our show, Love Casting,

51
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,710
was meant to see if fake feelings can turn into real ones.

52
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,080
It’s really about whether real feelings develop

53
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,850
during the process.

54
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,550
Actually, at this point,

55
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,090
you can already tell from the night before

56
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,520
they made

57
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,260
their decision and confession

58
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,020
that they have developed a deep bond.

59
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,560
Yes. And I believe this deep bond

60
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,400
will make their acting improve significantly

61
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,500
if it really becomes a series.

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,600
Acting based on true emotions is truly different.

63
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,540
Yes, let's look forward to it together!

64
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,840
The confession of the last episode.

65
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,980
Who will pair up to form the perfect couple?

66
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,070
I'm still thinking about who to choose.

67
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,010
[Chris can't make a decision,
so he chooses to seek help from tarot card reading]

68
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,390
He also went there.

69
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,090
Who? Who? Who?

70
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,530
Overall, this gives me a better feeling.

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,329
Okay, let's see A first.

72
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,960
So for A's situation, here we see a Flirting Star.

73
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,970
It has a lot of tails, very similar to a nine-tailed fox, right?

74
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,440
It is also pink.

75
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,980
This card is like your feelings toward him.

76
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,690
You think he’s charming and attractive,

77
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,680
but you feel like he's not entirely in your control.

78
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,350
Also, as you noticed with the knife,

79
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,420
it's similar to an utility knife.

80
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,980
It won't give you a fatal blow,

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,190
but it can still cause some damage.

82
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:18,200
[Chris's person of interest, A,
often leads to conflicts when they interact]

83
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,620
It might not bring the best outcome

84
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,430
in the dynamic between the two of you.

85
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,200
Let's see B.

86
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,180
The three cards of B are all upright.

87
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,800
This person gives you a sense of reassurance,

88
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,340
warmth, and thoughtfulness.

89
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,040
He's like the moon.

90
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,510
The moon gives us a feeling similar to that of a mother,

91
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,079
who takes care of you and makes you feel at home.

92
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:37,550
He's smiling, which shows that he agrees.

93
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,790
This card, the treasure bowl, has a lot of money.

94
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,390
Yes.

95
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,190
It's not that he'll bring you wealth,

96
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,300
but he will bring you a lot of good relationships.

97
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,160
If you choose him,

98
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,940
you two will get along very well.

99
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:55,400
[Chris's person of interest, B,
provides provides abundant emotional support]

100
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,470
And that sense of mutual support

101
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,600
can actually bring a lot of opportunities to both of you.

102
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,140
Okay, I think

103
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,940
you can draw one from this stack.

104
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,140
I think you can communicate with your soul

105
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,350
and see if it has anything to remind you.

106
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,980
Come on, Chris. Who will your soul choose?

107
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,280
Okay.

108
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,190
It's so accurate.

109
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,290
What did it say?

110
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,850
It says go with the flow.

111
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,110
He might have an answer in his heart already.

112
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,510
[Let's go with the flow]

113
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,560
He's just being indecisive.

114
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,370
I am shocked.

115
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,600
Although we don't spend a lot of time together,

116
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,500
I've observed how he interacts

117
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,900
with everyone from the side.

118
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,570
And...

119
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,900
[Pink has decided to whom he is going to confess]

120
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,670
I think that, in the end,

121
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,300
our personalities might actually be a good match.

122
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,740
When I am with him,

123
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,350
I won't feel uncomfortable or stressed.

124
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,710
I feel very happy.

125
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,520
I think the reason I'm most hesitant is

126
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,590
because I know he won't choose me.

127
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,820
The person I want to choose...

128
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,890
Although I know he won't choose me,

129
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,400
I've decided to

130
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:09,720
[Fumi is ready to face the possibility of failure]

131
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,760
follow my feelings

132
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,930
and be brave for once.

133
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,470
So I am struggling a bit,

134
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,970
wondering whether I should be honest with myself

135
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,900
and bravely face the feeling of

136
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,770
being rejected.

137
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,680
I still don't know who to choose.

138
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,190
Because...

139
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:30,490
I'm thinking about many different reasons,

140
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,159
like who could help me improve further.

141
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,590
[Yi decided to get a fortune reading after struggling to decide]

142
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,710
What do you want to ask today?

143
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,680
I'm not sure who to choose today.

144
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,150
Will he have three choices, or just two?

145
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,190
His tarot cards will be fully laid out on the table.

146
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,020
Fully laid out.

147
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,590
Two.

148
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,090
There are two people in your heart.

149
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:56,780
Yes.

150
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,590
Now please close your eyes.

151
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,050
Just think to yourself

152
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,460
whether it's better to choose A or B.

153
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,730
I want to know who it is.

154
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,440
My gosh, this tarot card reading is really intense.

155
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,240
From a development perspective, it actually looks quite good.

156
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,580
And you can see here that

157
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,210
there is a bathtub with lots of flowers.

158
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,810
Many flowers represent popularity with the audience and people in general,

159
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,950
which is a positive effect.

160
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,090
So, if you choose him,

161
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,620
your interactions with each other

162
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,720
will be very comfortable and happy.

163
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,960
However, with this card, you should also be cautious.

164
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,890
It indicates that you might have a few points

165
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,909
where disagreements could easily happen.

166
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,870
[Yi's choice for Person A
has great appeal to others, but they may occasionally argue]

167
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,010
This is what you should pay attention to.

168
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,620
The three cards for B seem more calm,

169
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,040
because, unlike A, which has a lot of flowers,

170
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,080
B's three cards look yellow and dark.

171
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,210
Overall, it doesn't seem like a very comfortable relationship.

172
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,880
And we have a card in the middle

173
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,710
with a sun in it.

174
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,120
This card is actually a nobleman card,

175
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,940
but it's upside down here.

176
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,590
You two might

177
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,800
have your own ideas and opinions,

178
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,700
so it may not be easy for you to communicate with each other.

179
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,880
And then, you might not be able to help each other.

180
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,800
So the third card doesn’t look good.

181
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:16,610
[Person B in Yi's heart
is hard to communicate with, and they can't help each other]

182
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,370
It's a skull-like situation.

183
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,600
Although it's upside down,

184
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,130
I think if we are talking about long-term interaction,

185
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,070
B's card

186
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,620
doesn't look as comfortable.

187
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,650
Now I think

188
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,780
you can communicate with your soul

189
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,370
and see if it wants to remind you of anything.

190
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:36,960
Okay.

191
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,710
Okay, you want this one.

192
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,150
Okay. What does it say?

193
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,300
Lying on you.

194
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,070
Actually, I think deep down,

195
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,900
you already have

196
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,740
some ideas in mind by now.

197
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,640
Very reassured.

198
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,810
Yes, it's Adson.

199
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,070
It's Adson.

200
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,730
Nice.

201
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,750
Nice. He said nice.

202
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,150
He thinks it's accurate.

203
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,230
[Final script
What decision will the boys make?]

204
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,340
It's coming.

205
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,760
Just like this?

206
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,290
Get us two.

207
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,650
At least two scripts.

208
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,340
I'm going to cry.

209
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,570
[Adson wrote down his choice
without hesitation]

210
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,050
It must be hard to write.

211
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,060
Yes.

212
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,560
[Thinking again and again
Chris wrote down his final decision]

213
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,360
Yi, don't write the wrong name.

214
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,809
Yi, you need to write the name of the person you care about correctly.

215
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,280
Robert!

216
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,570
Robert!

217
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:08,560
[Guei seems to be hesitating between Adson and Pink]

218
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,800
I think Pink will choose Yi.

219
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,260
He has figured out what to write it.

220
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,250
[Pink, without hesitation,
wrote down the final confession choice]

221
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,070
Fumi, I can’t guess who it is.

222
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:26,180
[Fumi gathers the courage
to write down his choice from the heart]

223
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,500
I think Fumi feels more sorrowful.

224
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,950
I already feel like crying.

225
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,960
Is it too early?

226
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,090
I think so too.

227
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,000
You’re on the verge of tears.

228
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,520
No.

229
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,500
I was not about to cry.

230
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,170
But don't you think watching them walk up

231
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,610
and seriously...

232
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,870
I think they are...

233
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,140
They moved you, didn't they?

234
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,940
It moved me.

235
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,180
Also, aren't you feeling more sentimental about Fumi?

236
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,010
A little.

237
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,910
It's obvious that Adson is going to choose Yi.

238
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,440
Personally, I believe in tarot card reading.

239
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,490
In the end, he got the card and said lying on you.

240
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,950
That's Adson.

241
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,420
Because being with him just feels really reassuring and comfortable.

242
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,830
Will you cry if Yi didn't choose Adson in the end?

243
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,630
Then that's his fault. He jinxed it.

244
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,730
[Master of the jinx]

245
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,530
Come on, the master of Yi and our master of the jinx.

246
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,700
Do you think Yi will choose Adson?

247
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,770
After watching the teacher's tarot card reading, I feel...

248
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,520
Yi must choose Adson.

249
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,110
Okay. Poom.

250
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,910
I think Yi will choose Pink.

251
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:52,380
[Poom has a different opinion
he thinks Yi will choose Pink]

252
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,880
Really?

253
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,980
So do you think Person A and B in the tarot reading

254
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,920
are Adson and Pink?

255
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,650
Yes.

256
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,720
He thinks it's Adson and Pink.

257
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,090
It makes sense.

258
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,460
Adson and Pink didn't hesitate at all.

259
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,630
They are very direct.

260
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,630
But Chris did a tarot reading.

261
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,490
He did one as well.

262
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,670
But I really don't know his choices.

263
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,510
The first one is someone who is charming,

264
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,410
but gettin along with him

265
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,440
might come with some barriers and challenges.

266
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,880
I immediately thought of Yi.

267
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,270
Do you remember when Yi hurt him?

268
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,850
When they finally ended up

269
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,740
[The fourth day
Yi replaced Chris, who was going to sleep in the same room, with Adson]

270
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,650
in the same room,

271
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,650
Chris was happy.

272
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,480
But Yi replaced him.

273
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,600
He was very disappointed during the interview.

274
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,860
He said he had no chance to stay in the same room with Yi.

275
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:41,940
[The boy is heading to the final confession spot
Will the one he chose appear?]

276
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,330
There will be a confession spot,

277
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,830
and the other person will go find him.

278
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,550
Pink.

279
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:15,940
[Pink's determined steps
will lead to who?]

280
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,850
Pink will go to Yi.

281
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,270
Who? Who? Who?

282
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,100
Guei.

283
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,940
Impossible.

284
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,950
I still really hope for this pair.

285
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,580
Pink and Guei.

286
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,180
I think Pink is going to Yi.

287
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,470
Look, he really goes to Yi.

288
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,910
Impossible.

289
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,500
He's really determined.

290
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,800
Poom is amazing.

291
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,050
[Spot on]

292
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:02,120
[Guei is still waiting]

293
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,220
Who will he choose?

294
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,860
Pink.

295
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:20,690
Pink.

296
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,190
Yes, Pink.

297
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,090
[Guei didn’t wait for Pink to arrive]

298
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,040
I think maybe the time we spent together was too short.

299
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,500
Well,

300
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,680
we talked for a long time.

301
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,650
I thought we were quite close.

302
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,290
We also had great chemistry

303
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,560
in terms of coordinating with the storyline.

304
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,090
I think Pink's gaze

305
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,560
really helped me immerse myself in the story.

306
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,580
It reminds me of this.

307
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,940
No, this is my favorite scene.

308
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,810
Maybe he has his own favorite person

309
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,380
who he likes and feels comfortable with,

310
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,110
someone he can easily work with.

311
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,120
That's fine. I wish him the best.

312
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,650
They will definitely be able to work better together.

313
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,490
That's it.

314
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,630
He's hurt.

315
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,460
Don't be sad, Guei.

316
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,570
He's acting tough.

317
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,340
Gosh.

318
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,880
[Chien Yu walks bravely
towards Robert?]

319
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,190
Robert.

320
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,680
Okay. Okay.

321
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,470
We meet again.

322
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,070
We meet again.

323
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,360
I think I care about Fumi.

324
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,920
Yeah, who will Fumi choose?

325
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,890
[Fumi's final confession is to...]

326
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,860
It's Yi.

327
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,740
[Everyone in the Auntie Squad is shocked]

328
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,730
We were all wrong.

329
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:54,250
[Adson hasn't made a choice yet]

330
00:15:55,010 --> 00:16:04,520
[Will he choose Chris, whom he dotes on like a younger brother?
Or the childish companion Yi?]

331
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,020
Adson will choose Yi.

332
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,970
Oh no, Yi.

333
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,480
Yi. That's a lot of people.

334
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,370
Why?

335
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,570
[The person Chris chose didn't show up]

336
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,990
So, who did Chris choose?

337
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,530
I'm a little sad.

338
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,520
But...

339
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,850
[Fumi]

340
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,460
Because I feel that my connects with him

341
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,500
is on a spiritual level.

342
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,170
I can respect his choice.

343
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,000
Tarot reading is very accurate.

344
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,970
I feel that with Fumi,

345
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,110
I don't have to do anything special.

346
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,140
We just get along so well,

347
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,730
[Chris chose Fumi
but Fumi chose Yi]

348
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,850
and I feel secure.

349
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,450
Oh, my. Yi really messed things up.

350
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,520
I didn't expect three people to choose him.

351
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,960
Really. I really didn't expect that.

352
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,910
He's really the king of popularity.

353
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,290
But Fumi and Yi...

354
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,829
Yeah.

355
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,690
Why did Fumi choose Yi?

356
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,569
Or maybe he really got into the character?

357
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,040
Because the scene he played with them was,

358
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,000
Chris gave Yi a love letter,

359
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,650
and later Yi gave it to Fumi.

360
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,290
[Sounds reasonable]

361
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:26,980
Didn't they hug each other?

362
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,210
So when Fumi was acting in that scene,

363
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,320
we thought it was an act,

364
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,310
but it actually seemed like he was expressing his true feelings.

365
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,060
It's not me.

366
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,720
I've liked you for a long time.

367
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,990
I think he might have picked up

368
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,430
on the emotions Yi was giving him.

369
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,030
Now that we know his thoughts,

370
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,830
looking back at that expression, we are able to notice something.

371
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,600
There must have been a lot of complicated emotions.

372
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,940
How could we not see that?

373
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,270
We missed it.

374
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,180
Because yesterday at the bonfire party,

375
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,800
[Is there a possibility that Chien Yu and Robert both feel the same way?]

376
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,920
we talk about how I feel that, for me,

377
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,220
being brave is something I hope to learn.

378
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,190
I think during the course of this show,

379
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,230
it feels like I can use this opportunity

380
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,160
to make some changes in myself.

381
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,430
I think you give me a sense of being cared for,

382
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,870
a feeling of dependence,

383
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,290
which makes me feel warm.

384
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,840
I want to tell you this.

385
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,810
I don't think you need to feel pressured.

386
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:33,710
Because I think this has helped me

387
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,290
become a different version of myself.

388
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,930
Whether it's being brave

389
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:44,000
or expressing my true feelings

390
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,230
to a stranger,

391
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,530
I think you, out of these seven people,

392
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,860
have given me the most energy and ability to make changes.

393
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,290
That's all.

394
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,540
Thank you.

395
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,880
You also brought me a lot of good energy.

396
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,300
We can still maintain a friendly relationship in private.

397
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,000
Of course.

398
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,590
Because I really like you.

399
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,490
Okay.

400
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,380
Good luck.

401
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,260
Okay.

402
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,120
Give me a hug.

403
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,060
A hug?

404
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,040
Yes.

405
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,540
You don't have to get up.

406
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,790
Thank you.

407
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,780
Okay.

408
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,010
No.

409
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,910
Can I hug Chien Yu?

410
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,320
I want to know more about Robert.

411
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,590
Because we don't seem familiar with you.

412
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,060
Since you're new, I thought we should "collide" a little...

413
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,060
Maybe have a little misunderstanding.

414
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,130
Yes, a misunderstanding.

415
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,530
You want to sleep on the left or on the right?

416
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,360
I'm fine with anything.

417
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:43,010
[The Auntie Squad is heartbroken]

418
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,910
My baby.

419
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,210
Don't touch him. He's mine.

420
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,700
Go, baby.

421
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,870
Yeah.

422
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,660
So bad.

423
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,660
Oh my god.

424
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,000
Look.

425
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,060
Didn't you say you want to sleep over for another night?

426
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,040
Robert!

427
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,910
Robert!

428
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,910
[Tears pouring out]

429
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,880
What song is this?

430
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,250
What you want is not me?

431
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,980
That's too much.

432
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:51,980
I thought they could at least be together.

433
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,340
My gosh.

434
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:02,220
Give me Chien Yu's number right now.

435
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,220
[Robert refused Chien Yu's confession
They are not able to form a couple]

436
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,220
Let's give him a hug in the air.

437
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,120
Come on, everybody.

438
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,230
Let's give Chien Yu a hug.

439
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,340
[Let's give brave Chien Yu a hug]

440
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,240
Poom, you supported them from start to finish.

441
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,600
Comfort Chien Yu.

442
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,510
Give Chien Yu a hug.

443
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,420
Give him a hug.

444
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,040
I think that Chien Yu's speech

445
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,210
was sincere, thoughtful,

446
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,040
and full of courage.

447
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,150
And you can see that Chien Yu has transformed

448
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,840
into a completely different person from the beginning until now.

449
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,220
You know it takes a lot of courage to confess.

450
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,520
I've done that.

451
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,030
Yes.

452
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,220
You can hear the heartbeat.

453
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,500
You will be scared of any look

454
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,930
or reaction the other person might give you.

455
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,610
Confessing is very difficult.

456
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,870
He was so brave.

457
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,510
But in the end, he has to watch...

458
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,540
But I'm curious now.

459
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,200
Who is Robert going to choose?

460
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,390
Maybe no one.

461
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,140
He has to choose.

462
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,210
He might just put a big 'X' on it.

463
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,450
A big 'X' that he is not choosing anyone.

464
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,820
That's possible.

465
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,460
It really is just that there are no feelings, or...

466
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,480
Don't hit my face.

467
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,960
Hit my face!

468
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,660
Don't hit my face.

469
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,200
Getting slapped in the face directly.

470
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,230
Okay, I feel...

471
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,220
Can we take five days off?

472
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,620
No.

473
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,830
I want to continue watching.

474
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,970
I am watching while bleeding.

475
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,870
This vest was supposed to be white.

476
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,180
It has already turned red.

477
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,540
My heart is bleeding.

478
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,970
The first thing I did when I got on the boat was talk to you.

479
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,300
[Pink was the first to express his feelings]

480
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,310
Hello.

481
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:51,840
Hello.

482
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,320
Hello.

483
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,500
Hello.

484
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,730
What's your name?

485
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,640
I'm Pink.

486
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,490
Pink?

487
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,910
You make me feel warm and comfortable.

488
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,710
Although your Chinese is not so good,

489
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,270
and my English is not so good.

490
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,070
Today is handsome.

491
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,260
You too.

492
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:11,940
You look like Kenny.

493
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,040
This is big.

494
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,310
In the past few days,

495
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,600
although I'm not the one you spend the most time with,

496
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,830
I've been observing you and others.

497
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,830
I feel like

498
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,920
you are the person I think is the most suitable choice.

499
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,410
From the beginning on the boat,

500
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:46,190
it was anime that gave us common topics to talk about.

501
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,070
Then we both did

502
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,040
similar work related to modeling.

503
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,960
Later on, I acted with you.

504
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,810
We chatted a lot when we lived in the same room.

505
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,960
At that time,

506
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,930
I felt like I really wanted to

507
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,260
continue doing things together with you.

508
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,380
Can we be together?

509
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,080
Yi.

510
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:25,830
Just, you know, first day we met, we, like the same room.

511
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,900
And second day we acted drama together.

512
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:33,530
Nice.

513
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,330
Nice?

514
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,490
Nice to hear.

515
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,490
So...we share the same zodiac.

516
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,880
And our sense of humor is pretty much the same too.

517
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,820
Paper, scissors, stone.

518
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,630
What's that?

519
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,610
My face.

520
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:06,640
I feel like we just get along really well, we’re a match.

521
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,560
So I'm very happy that I can

522
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,300
play with you from the first day to the last day.

523
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,240
So, yeah, follow your heart, you know.

524
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,430
No.

525
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,930
What are you doing?

526
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,880
This is the most important part.

527
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,650
Aren't we...

528
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,050
Yeah, aren't we going to watch Yi's choice?

529
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,490
You showed us a bunch and then turned into this...

530
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,860
Auntie is angry.

531
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,390
Yes, I want to see who he will choose.

532
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,390
I just want to know the ending.

533
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,930
When I was watching this group, I realized

534
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,800
we only have one last chance left.

535
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,770
This is the last group.

536
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,970
I want Yi and Adson.

537
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:43,500
At least.

538
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,260
We have to protect our couple.

539
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,440
Okay, that's it. Come on.

540
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:56,710
Thank you for choosing me.

541
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,500
Fumi.

542
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:05,390
When we didn't know each other at first,

543
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,900
I knew you read anime.

544
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:14,550
Then I think we have a lot in common to communicate.

545
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,530
We can talk about anime.

546
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,440
Because I didn't know other people,

547
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,760
but I know a lot about anime.

548
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:28,820
So I'm very happy

549
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,360
to see a otaku here.

550
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,540
So we can

551
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:44,110
watch more anime together in the future.

552
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,110
And Pink,

553
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,380
I know it's hard for us to communicate

554
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,110
because my Chinese is not good,

555
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:04,940
we didn't communicate much on this show.

556
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:12,710
But I'm still very happy to know you.

557
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,860
We both like playing basketball.

558
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,980
Although I can't play it well,

559
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:25,060
you can carry me.

560
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:30,070
You said you want to go to Thailand,

561
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:33,310
so you can send me a message.

562
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,650
You can come and live at my place at any time.

563
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:42,000
We can eat and play basketball together.

564
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,450
And Adson,

565
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,010
we were

566
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,280
not that familiar with each other at first.

567
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:06,110
But you told me a lot when we were on the boat.

568
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,170
You spoke in English and translated for me.

569
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:15,170
The first day we lived together, and there was no door.

570
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,140
It was awkward.

571
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:26,140
So we knew each other very fast.

572
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:31,640
The next day, we filmed that drama.

573
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,250
That was my first time.

574
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:39,340
You're very experienced.

575
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:44,270
I think you've helped me a lot.

576
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:48,870
I also feel the most comfortable when I'm with you.

577
00:29:51,340 --> 00:30:00,230
So I want to say thank you for choosing me.

578
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,560
If I can choose,

579
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,830
I want to choose all of you guys.

580
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:09,910
When his hand was like this,

581
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,440
I thought he was choosing Adson.

582
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,980
Then it got back here.

583
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,110
Yeah, and it came that way.

584
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,650
You know, I just heard a keyword.

585
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,030
He said if I could you all.

586
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,400
Didn't he say that?

587
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:19,930
Yeah.

588
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,820
So he did say "you" for all, right?

589
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,220
Yeah.

590
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,190
Did that mean

591
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:24,410
he is not choosing any of the three?

592
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,270
[Impossible]

593
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,960
No way. No way.

594
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,720
I heard that too.

595
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,510
Maybe it just means,

596
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,060
"if I can choose all of you".

597
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,570
He just doesn't want to offend anyone.

598
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:38,860
Translate it with Yi's level of Chinese.

599
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,720
[Tired]

600
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,440
So he said he is most comfortable with Adson.

601
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,140
Yeah.

602
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,640
The most comfortable and secure.

603
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,910
That actually aligns well with the tarot.

604
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:50,220
Yeah, and with Pink...

605
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,950
Although they didn't communicate very much,

606
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,960
there's a Bangkok Date.

607
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:58,320
For Fumi, they share the same hobbies, so they enjoy their conversations.

608
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,480
They both like anime.

609
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,210
Yeah.

610
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,810
I am thinking if he might end up not choosing any of the three

611
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,560
and go for Guei instead?

612
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,100
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

613
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,730
And Guei thought nobody would choose him at the very beginning.

614
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,150
If he chose Guei, I would really...

615
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,330
run out naked.

616
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,950
Okay, you said it.

617
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,400
You said that, don't...

618
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,610
But that'll be amazing to watch as well.

619
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:16,010
Keep that for now.

620
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,680
I'm literally going crazy.

621
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,360
Poom, Poom, what do you think?

622
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,510
[His expression explains everything]

623
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,220
He's really struggling.

624
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,980
Thank you for choosing me.

625
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,350
If I can choose,

626
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,710
I want to choose all of you guys.

627
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,960
But today,

628
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,660
I need to...

629
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:53,910
I still need to follow my heart.

630
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:57,310
[Yi’s final love confession choice is]

631
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,600
Then I choose...

632
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,380
Adson.

633
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,790
Adson.

634
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,270
Our...

635
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,260
At least we have secured a pair.

636
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,880
Pink.

637
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,380
Actually, the result is...

638
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,650
just as I expected.

639
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:37,050
I'm happy that they can form a CP

640
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:40,090
and continue to develop.

641
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:42,590
At the very least, I think

642
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,160
I gathered my courage

643
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,960
and was able to express my feelings to him.

644
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,890
I think

645
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,730
that's what matters the most.

646
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,340
I think Fumi is really…

647
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,630
Pink.

648
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,940
But I really think Pink

649
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,950
stayed true to himself all the way through, right?

650
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:06,950
It turned out that Pink cared about him from the moment he got on the boat.

651
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,000
Some happy, some sad.

652
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,590
Such a conflicted feeling.

653
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,700
When I look at them, I will feel very happy.

654
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,970
But that two people’s backs looked so disappointed.

655
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,830
All the choices are over.

656
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:37,500
But I really admire Fumi and Pink

657
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,360
because Fumi already knew the answer.

658
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,020
Yeah.

659
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,440
And throughout this process,

660
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,060
he cared more and more about Yi and also his every move.

661
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,540
He even knew what Yi's final choice would be,

662
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,090
But in the end, he still decided

663
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:52,470
to tell him what he wanted to say.

664
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,230
Fumi was just trying to... How to put this...

665
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,400
Pretending to be strong.

666
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,970
Yeah.

667
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,700
You know, because Fumi knows

668
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:06,870
[Fumi is mentally prepared for a failure in the love confession round earlier]

669
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,530
how to protect himself well.

670
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,010
He already told himself

671
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,140
the day before the selection that

672
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,170
Yi definitely wouldn't choose him.

673
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,250
Get mentally prepared.

674
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,719
Yeah, he had already prepared himself mentally.

675
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,090
So he has already sealed himself.

676
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,010
And Pink...

677
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,449
I feel so sorry for Pink.

678
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,090
I think Pink cried so saddly because

679
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:21,659
he was looking forward to it.

680
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,600
When Yi was talking about everyone,

681
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,800
did he already know a bit about it?

682
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,469
Yeah, I feel before he had announced his final choice,

683
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:31,239
he already felt that Yi would choose Adson.

684
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,000
So his tears dropped.

685
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:34,340
And Pink and Adson,

686
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,570
neither of them has ever hesitated at all.

687
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:40,179
So I think with two people who didn't hesitate at all,

688
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,659
one ended up heartbroken,

689
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,239
while the other found happiness.

690
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,420
And I just didn't expect that he had already

691
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,389
made up his mind the first day he got on the boat.

692
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,320
I didn't expect that!

693
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,050
Me neither.

694
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,420
That's right, the moment he stepped on the boat.

695
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,030
So he's the type of person who believes in "love at first sight."

696
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,050
This is really...

697
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,320
We really need to watch it again from season 1.

698
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,150
He actually made up his mind from the moment he got on the boat in the first episode...

699
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:06,850
[First day
first meeting]

700
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,100
What's your name?

701
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,170
I'm Pink.

702
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,070
Pink?

703
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,040
When we first met at the very beginning,

704
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:16,290
[Day 3: Pre-sleep interview
Pink talks about the most memorable thing about Yi]

705
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,370
he gave me the feeling of being really approachable,

706
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:14,340
like he's pretty cute,

707
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,410
and his Chinese is not very good.

708
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,950
We're getting separated soon.

709
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:22,150
[Day 3: Pink and Yi, who were originally supposed to shoot together, are suddenly separated]

710
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,490
I'm really reluctant. We slept so well together last night.

711
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,120
Yeah.

712
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,850
He just gives off this very happy vibe.

713
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:27,360
[Day 5 Pre-sleep interview: Pink already wants to choose Yi as his CP]

714
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,550
No matter what we do,

715
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,450
I just feel like we click,

716
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:30,110
and I also want to try acting with him.

717
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,800
Poom. When you see Pink crying, you feel...

718
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,230
Very sad.

719
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:41,070
I also feel he is very sad when I see him crying.

720
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:45,380
It seems that he knew he wouldn't be chosen,

721
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,580
so he started to cry and feel sad.

722
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,210
So I think this is really very interesting.

723
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,650
I think this is really the most valuable part

724
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,850
of our Love Casting.

725
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,420
When I was watching, I was in a mixed mood.

726
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,020
On one hand, I was expecting,

727
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,360
and on the other, I was very worried about them.

728
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,790
At last, I also felt they're heartbroken.

729
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:04,020
Actually, this is where our fake drama becomes real.

730
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,760
What sounds like a

731
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,570
made-up story is all fiction.

732
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,230
Yeah.

733
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:11,840
And many BL dramas are built on an imagination.

734
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,870
But their emotions are real,

735
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:20,020
[BL world is fictional
the boys' feelings are real]

736
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,340
so Pink can cry like this.

737
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,650
And it can be conveyed to the audience and into the hearts of those who watch.

738
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:23,050
It’s all ups and downs, and you just go along with it.

739
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,050
But at least we formed a CP at last,

740
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,020
and it's a happy CP.

741
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:31,160
Yeah, the strongest CP vibe. They're like a perfect mix of enemies turned lovers  all the time.

742
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,470
[Adson and Yi's love confession is about to unfold]

743
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,460
Yeah, their plots are really fascinating.

744
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,430
Alright, actually, our production team

745
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:38,100
really put a lot of effort into completing this project —

746
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,630
Energy Running Low — let's watch it together!

747
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,460
[Energy Running Low]

748
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,050
Give me.

749
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,550
Give me energy.

750
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,320
Give me energy.

751
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,470
Give me.

00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,480

753
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,740
Sir. Sir.

754
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,520
Hello.

755
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,360
Sir. Sir.

756
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,310
Are you okay?

757
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,700
You're awake.

758
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,470
Sir. Sir.

759
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,780
Are you okay?

760
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,310
Do you need me to take you to the hospital?

761
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,370
I'll make the call.

762
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,430
Sir. Sir.

763
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,360
Stop joking, okay?

764
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,050
Pranks are not funny.

765
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,970
Don't let go.

766
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,790
Just consider it me doing a good deed for the day.

767
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,120
Why do I have this?

768
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,010
You'll be naked if you're not wearing it.

769
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,350
That's too crazy.

770
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,120
So you came on a spaceship?

771
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,850
How did you end up on Earth then?

772
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,170
I don't know.

773
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,520
So holding hands can give you energy?

774
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,270
Yeah.

775
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,930
How long do you need to get fully charged

776
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,990
before you can return to your planet?

777
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,970
Holding hands for about

778
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,100
ten thousand years.

779
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,720
Ten thousand years?

780
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,250
That's too long.

781
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,950
Or you want to hug me, which can be faster.

782
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,490
Hug you?

783
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,270
Okay.

784
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,380
No, not like this. This is useless.

785
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,870
Take off your clothes.

786
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,970
Only skin contact can work.

787
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,150
No.

788
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,630
We can hold hands.

789
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,580
Hold hands?

790
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,380
So what about your friends?

791
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,950
I don't have enough energy,

792
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,620
so I can't reach them.

793
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,020
I'll get you some clothes. Let's go.

794
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,850
You want to stay in my house?

795
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:55,560
Sure.

796
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,410
You want my energy?

797
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,330
Of course.

798
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,830
But from now on,

799
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,420
you will be my slave.

800
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,760
Carry me upstairs.

801
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,720
Did you hurt your foot?

802
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,020
Do you still want energy?

803
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,750
Okay.

804
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:27,630
Okay.

805
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,760
Go!

806
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,170
Here.

807
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,880
Give me a massage.

808
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,110
Is this okay?

809
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:15,980
Harder.

810
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,060
You need to eat, so do I.

811
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,340
Let me help you.

812
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,840
What's that?

813
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:48,770
Are you stealing electricity?

814
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,230
Keep massaging. Hurry up.

815
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,820
I'm not full yet.

816
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:10,930
You're always trying to steal electricity.

817
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,640
How much have I given you already?

818
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,130
You stole my electricity.

819
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:01,770
Go home.

820
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,010
I want to go home.

821
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:36,770
Stand straight.

822
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:40,770
Hands up.

823
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,360
Higher.

824
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,240
What are you doing?

825
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,050
You'll know later.

826
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:44,070
Thank you for the energy you give me.

827
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,380
I'm willing to give you more.

828
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,140
They're so cute.

829
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,950
So cute.

830
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,960
[Great Shock]

831
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:02,580
Gosh.

832
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:04,950
Shocked?

833
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,410
Very shocked.

834
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:08,760
That kiss...

835
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:11,390
For that kiss, you could feel the energy even through the screen!

836
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:13,760
Because it used to be some funny plots,

837
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,040
I thought it would be just like that.

838
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,860
When it came to the end, it turned out to be this.

839
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,630
It gives you something real.

840
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:21,620
Full of energy!

841
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:23,450
That kiss requires a lot of trust in each other,

842
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:25,600
and it’s something that comes from having feelings that have been nurtured,

843
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,900
so they can kiss like that.

844
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:27,840
Really.

845
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,410
That’s something they can't fake. It really can’t be acted out.

846
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:32,110
To be honest,

847
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:36,560
since the first performance, Yi has improved a lot.

848
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:39,380
He has improved a lot. Yeah.

849
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:42,170
He showed his cuteness in front of the camera.

850
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:44,120
And the key point is, don’t you think

851
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,420
they play their roles so perfectly that

852
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,580
no one else could pull it off like they do?

853
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:49,220
Poom.

854
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:51,240
Is that kiss real?

855
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,230
That kiss was clearly very real.

856
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,240
Especially when they kissed, I felt very shy.

857
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:03,640
From the moment they started getting to know each other until now,

858
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,440
watching them perform together,

859
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,680
I feel they’re just so cute.

860
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,180
Really.

861
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,120
That's called being an Auntie, okay?

862
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,980
Yeah, that's an auntie's heart.

863
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,950
Congratulations to Poom on becoming our senior member.

864
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:18,920
A senior member of Auntie Squad.

865
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,990
He's in.

866
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,270
He's in.

867
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:24,360
From the beginning, we gathered these eight boys,

868
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:26,580
these new actors together,

869
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,830
to train them and have them live together.

870
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:31,490
I actually think BL, to me, is kind of like this:

871
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,770
no matter your gender or age,

872
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:35,870
we've all probably imagined

873
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:37,870
having a perfect love story at some point.

874
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:40,350
What's that image? What're those pink bubbles?

875
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:49,510
[BL brings a perfect love story to the audience, regardless of gender]

876
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,380
It doesn't have to be like a fairy tale where

877
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,080
two people are destined to be together.

878
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,520
But it can be very free and natural,

879
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,510
allowing you to feel the bitterness and sweetness of love.

880
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:52,110
I think that's what makes BL so beautiful.

881
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:53,760
It really feels like I've accompanied them

882
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,530
through what feels like a summer.

883
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:57,060
Yeah.

884
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,430
As for my own feelings,

885
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:01,830
because it's actually been a while since I've been in a relationship,

886
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:02,570
I mean it,

887
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:05,260
I'd forget about love and excitement,

888
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:12,730
[The real love stories of the 8 boys strike directly at the hearts of Auntie Squad]

889
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:07,870
or my heart racing because of love.

890
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:09,340
When I saw everyone confessing their love,

891
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,410
it'd remind me of the way I confessed mine before.

892
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:14,440
So I'm very grateful to Love Casting.

893
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,210
Thank you, these eight boys.

894
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:17,420
You remind me of

895
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:19,290

[The fluttering feeling of love and the feeling of youth]

897
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:21,350
and the feeling of youth.

898
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:22,850
Really, thank you.

899
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:24,650
I want to congratulate you.

900
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:28,460
Although some were not chosen,

901
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:32,730
at least you can have a beautiful experience

902
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:35,100
and made some good friends.

903
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,470
Congratulations.

904
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,040
Really.

905
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,840
Before coming to the show, I thought it would be

906
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,540
all about youth,

907
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,840
and just fun and happiness, full of joy,

908
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,310
but I didn't expect that

909
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:51,380
they'd have so many real stories.

910
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,420
Whether it was through the process of filming the acting scenes

911
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,920
or truly having heart-to-heart conversations to understand each other,

912
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,460
I feel like the unexpected surprises actually

913
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,430
came from them.

914
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:05,840
For these eight boys,

915
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:07,630
this is a very precious memory,

916
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:11,440
and it also includes your dream--

917
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,670
to film a very good production.

918
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,640
This is already a very, very good production.

919
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,910
Even though in the end, it’s Adson and Yi who are filming together,

920
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,810
the other boys, you all did a great job.

921
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:25,380
This is the biggest encouragement I want to give you all.

922
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,220
Really, thank you

923
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:29,090
for letting us see such youthful, passionate,

924
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,040
and touching moments. Thank you!

925
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,290
As you said,

926
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:37,330
these eight boys brought us their true emotions.

927
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:38,200
I'm also looking forward to seeing them

928
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,230
in different fields,

929
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,070
and appreciating their different products.

930
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:45,240
Most importantly, that "Energy Running Low", isn't it too short?

931
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,900
Right? I'll be pounding the table for more.

932
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,370
They can show us 12 episodes for that.

933
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:51,370
Yeah, because the characters are well set.

934
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:52,340
Thank you, Love Casting,

935
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,980
for bringing us passion for life.

936
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,950
We'll see you next season.

937
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,850
Bye.
