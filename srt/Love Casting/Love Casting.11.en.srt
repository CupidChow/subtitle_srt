189
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,130
Dried tofu.

190
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,430
Do you want this?

191
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,850
What is this?

192
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,980
It's hot.

193
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,070
I want dried tofu.

194
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,940
[Hot]

195
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,570
It's so hot.

196
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,130
Sorry.

197
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,720
Do you want some?

198
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,740
Robert and Chien Yu don't seem to interact much.

199
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,080
They didn't interact at all.

200
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,050
Yeah.

201
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,930
Why? After they were split into different groups, when they came back, they were just...

202
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,390
How did it end up like this?

203
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,010
I'll get it myself.

204
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,200
Sorry.

205
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,230
Fumi.

206
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,400
Chien Yu, do you want some?

207
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,690
I've already had some.

208
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,070
No.

209
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,620
I'm scared of everything you feed me.

210
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,960
[Adson's image can no longer be changed]

211
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,650
I think this barbecue is really interesting.

212
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,790
And there's really a chance later on.

213
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,580
After everyone finishes eating, they can sit down

214
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,620
and have some honest conversations from the heart.

215
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,220
Yes.

216
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,990
Did you notice some of their

217
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,650
small interactions just now?

218
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,910
Robert and Chien Yu didn't have much interaction.

219
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,690
Yes.

220
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,610
They're shy.

221
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,030
It's okay, he can use his own way of understanding.

222
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,320
Because I see hearts in his eyes.

223
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,640
He's seeing this with love.

224
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,440
So his CP won't be broken up.

225
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,909
Although they're not sitting close,

226
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:50,340
I saw them constantly looking at each other's faces.

227
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,270
[Eye contact]

228
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,880
You can see their eye contact.

229
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,020
He's paying close attention.

230
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,070
He's watching a different show from us.

231
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,010
But...

232
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,870
But actually, I think Chien Yu is being proactive now.

233
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,460
He originally wanted to sit next to Robert.

234
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,330
Yeah.

235
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,450
But Pink took the seat.

236
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,330
But why did Pink sit there?

237
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,040
I don't think it was for Robert.

238
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,970
Then who is it for?

239
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,300
The person on his right?

240
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,390
The person he gave the cookies to.

241
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:27,820
[Pink squeezed Chien Yu out to sit next to Chris]

242
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,110
Chris.

243
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,050
It's Chris sitting next to him, right?

244
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:28,920
When did Pink start wanting to be close to Chris?

245
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,520
[Trying to recall]

246
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,850
He was originally sharing a room with Yi

247
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,920
and wanted to act with him.

248
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,560
Yes, but then they just happened

249
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,460
to be separated.

250
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,620
Unexpectedly, he acted pretty well with Guei.

251
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,420
But when giving out cookies, he gave them to Chris.

252
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,470
So maybe there are some details we didn't notice.

253

[Auntie Squad is predicting CP pairing]

254
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,400
Will he choose Chris?

255
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,570
But that's how the world works.

256
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,570
Some people are meant to be friends,

257
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,890
and some people are meant to be partners.

258
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,140
After getting to know each other,

259
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,470
it's like "Sorry, let's just be friends."

260
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,110
Or maybe,

261
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,590
"We can try to go further."

262
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,710
I think they are good friends.

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,070
[Pink and Guei can only be good friends. They're not suitable as a couple]

Come on.

00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,800
I'm starting to feel a bit...

271
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,260
I was just...

272
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,770
Because the seating choice on the last night is actually quite important.

273
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:20,530
And that is...

274
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,830
Even if they didn't get to sit together

275
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,640
and grill together,

276
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,370
if someone's first instinct was to sit somewhere

00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,110
for some purpose,

278
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,070

00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:36,990

[Poom thinks Pink was looking at Yi]

290

After that night, they seemed to get along quite well.

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,080
Because that night, there was thunder, and the scene was cut off, right?

292

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,990
It seems like there really was this process, right?

301
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,050
And?

302
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,360
At first, when everyone wasn't familiar with each other,

303
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,430
they didn't talk much.

304
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,970
But Pink seemed to be the one who talked the most with Yi.

305
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,710
Then, on the fourth day, when they were split up into different groups, Pink seemed upset.

306

Yes.

307

Yes.

319

There was one more thing that made me sure about it.

320
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:12,260
When he saw Yi opening the car door and got in...

321
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:13,330
[Poom thinks Yi took the same car with Pink because he wanted to spend more time with him]

322
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,350

323
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,280

00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,090
His face.

374
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,380
[Amazing]
[Unbelievable]

375
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,560
Applause.

376
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,620
Really?

377
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,340
Why?

378
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,220
Just do it.

379
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,420
It's real.

380
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,110
Yes.

381
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,470
You saw it?

382
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,580
It's real.

383
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,380
Why don't you draw one, Adson?

384
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,210
Why?

385
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,720
No reason. I have magic hands.

386
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,150
Okay.

387
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,500
I only know this one trick.

388
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,050
Today is the last night. And tomorrow...

389
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,420
There won't be a next night.

390
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:16,140
Tomorrow, there won't be a time without phones.

391
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,600
It seems like it's something worth celebrating.

392
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,790
It's frustrating without a phone.

393
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,810
But later I realized

394
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,280
that only during times like this can we truly spend time together.

395
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,880
Otherwise, like when we're eating,

396
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,970
[We can only focus on communication when we're without phones]

397
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,110
we'd all be on our phones.

398
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:31,240
I'm not really good at group living.

399
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,210
And...

400
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,020
I'm surprised

401
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,320
that I could get along so well with you here.

402
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,690
I don't talk much in private.

403
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,940
[On the last night, the boys open up and express their true feelings]

404
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:43,740
Really.

405
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,760
I can't tell.

406
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,890
I can't tell.

407
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,110
I can understand you.

408
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,360
I'm an INFP.

409
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,760
I'm an INFJ. I get you.

410
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,620
And...

411
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,020
I'm really happy to have met you guys.

412
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,540
Even though we've only spent 7 days together,

413
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,280
I feel like we get along very well.

414
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,760
I'm really happy

415
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,360
that you have added so many colors to my life.

416
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,310
It's like a great stroke.

417
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,490
-Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet...
-And black.

418
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,940
You said it yourself.

419
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,390
Black.

420
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,060
I don't care anymore.

421
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,530
If you exclude me,

422
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,740
there are exactly 7 colors.

423
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
Okay.

424
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,890
Yes.

425
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,870
You're yellow, alright? You're yellow.

426
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,930
Okay.

427
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,680
-Or green would work too.
-Yellow's pretty bright, so that's fine.

428
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,930
Yes, my pants.

429
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,780
[Scared]

430
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,220
There's a bug!

431
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,690
No, no!

432
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,350
[Scared]

433
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,350
You should go save him.

434
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:43,560
[Hero]

435
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,070
I'm afraid of bugs too.

436
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,710
He was like this.

437
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,660
It's on your back.

438
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,150
Really?

439
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,200
Really.

440
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:57,040
[Both Robert and Adson lose all their masculinity]

441
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,570
Throw it in.

442
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,470
Don't kill it.

443
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,300
Don't kill.

444
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,710
Don't kill.

445
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,260
[They did nothing]

446
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,530
You always talk like this.

447
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,680
Sorry, I just went straight to...

448
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,480
It's fine, I'm not afraid of bugs at all. Give it to me.

449
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,450
Just talk about the emotional part.

450
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,510
Because since the past,

451
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,960
I've always been living in group settings.

452
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
But usually—

453
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,280
I talked to Fumi about this before—

454
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,450
I've always stayed within the same circle.

455
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,290
I think

456
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,220
I'm very afraid to make new friends,

457
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,860
or meet people from different fields.

458
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,600
I don't know how to get along with them.

459
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,660
I've always kept my heart closed off,

460
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,490
not knowing how to be happy.

461
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,070
I think I only realized

462
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,910
that I needed companionship

463
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,670
during this program.

464
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,640
I feel like after meeting you guys

465
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:44,610
[After spending time with the other boys, Chien Yu understood that he wasn't alone]

466
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,310
and starting to interact with you,

467
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,620
I've been able to

468
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,620
slowly show my softer side.

469
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,120
I've always been afraid of

470
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,860
not being the person everyone expects.

471
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,090
This is actually like

472
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,630
when I went to the beauty pageants.

473
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,390
Because before, I used to think

474
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,100
I had to win a place

475
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,990
or do certain things in competitions.

476
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,970
Later, I realized that

477
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,840
the results aren't that important.

478
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,670
The experiences with everyone

479
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,760
are now

480
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,400
the most precious treasure for me.

481
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,930
At first, I saw this program

482
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,870
as just work.

483
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,750
I didn't plan to invest

484
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,530
too much emotion into it.

485
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,510
But after filming that short skit with you the next day…

486
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,490
I actually told him that...

487
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,530
I said... I wasn't sure

488
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,860
about his feeling,

489
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,430
but for me… I didn't feel that happy

490
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,670
or comfortable

491
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,500
interacting with him. I said that to him.

492
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
He was so straightforward.

493
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,670
Because he wanted to do it his way,

494
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:39,010
[Guei directly expressed his dissatisfaction with Chris]

495
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,440
and I also wanted to do it my own way.

496
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,100
But aside from our experience,

497
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,370
we didn't really feel each other's emotions.

498
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,810
So I felt like…

499
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,480
there was something missing in our acting.

500
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,910
But I only told him this today.

501
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,570
I'm happy that we've enjoyed our time together.

502
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,480
That's why we don't take this to heart.

503
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,890
Otherwise, I wouldn't have told him,

504
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,350
"I wasn't happy that day."

505
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,210
Because I trust him and like him.

506
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,960
Because people who feel insecure

507
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,790
have found

508
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,710
common ground here.

509
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,460
I'm really glad

510
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,730
that I came here

511
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,770
and made a bunch of great friends.

512
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,170
Whether it's you guys

513
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,840
or the crew and staff.

514
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,170
When I was in elementary school, I was in traditional Chinese music class,

515
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,110
and in middle school, I was in the art class.

516
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,610
Maybe because I've always been in specialized talent classes,

517
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,510
I often found myself in unfamiliar environments alone.

518
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,650
From elementary school to middle school,

519
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,820
to high school, and then to university,

520
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,590
I've always gone to new schools alone,

521
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,590
without anyone I knew around.

522
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,560
Because I had to change districts or schools.

523
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,550
So, I've become used to being alone

524
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,460
and trying to solve problems

525
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,230
by myself.

526
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,510
Being suddenly thrown into group life

527
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,070
for this show

528
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,330
was actually quite an adjustment for me.

529
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,470
Sometimes, I don't know when the right time is

530
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:54,830
[Fumi was used to being independent and had difficulty adapting to group life]

531
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,750
to speak.

532
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,210
I didn't know how to fit in

533
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,910
or get along with everyone.

534
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,820
After coming here,

535
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,350
I realized that I'm someone

536
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,590
who isn't good at many things. I'm clumsy.

537
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,130
Especially because I keep causing trouble.

538
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,690
It makes me feel so frustrated.

539
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,069
I really let this affect me

540
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,060
and I've been worry about causing trouble for everyone,

541
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:16,020
[Fumi cannot accept showing his imperfect side in front of others]

542
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:16,099
making you think I'm lame or something like that.

543
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:19,210
But I'm still learning how to get along

544
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,010
with myself and with others.

545
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,710
I hope these experiences—

546
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,910
maybe it's the same for everyone who participates in this show—

547
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,109
will help me develop the ability

548
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:30,150
to connect with others in the future.

549
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,420
Yeah, like this.

550
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,090
They talked a lot.

551
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,560
I thought they wouldn't come to this part.

552
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,890
Because earlier, they were just playing around.

553
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,760
But as they kept talking,

554
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,630
they eventually got serious

555
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,800
and started sharing their feelings.

556
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,900
They have different personalities.

557
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,390
Yeah.

558
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,350
But unexpectedly, they complement each other.

559
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,200
Yeah.

560
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,210
So you couldn't have imagined...

561
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,040
In the first episode, you could never have imagined

562
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,780
that when Chris was so honest

563
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,030
[Aben made a mistake. It should be Chris, not Chien Yu]

564
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,230
about his vulnerability,

565
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,580
it would be Guei who was the first to say, "I understand you.

566
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,590
I get you."

567
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,360
I think that's the interesting part.

568
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,190
I believe this conversation tonight

569
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:18,100
will greatly influence their final decision.

570
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,030
Because they might have talked separately.

571
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,870
Like how they just mentioned,

572
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,400
"I think I heard you talk about him."

573
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,000
Or "I heard him talk about someone."

574
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,600
But what they didn't know was

575
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,140
that they could sit down together and have a good talk.

576
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,050
They didn't know they could have such an experience.

577
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,550
And I really like something Guei did.

578
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,420
He told Chris on the last day,

579
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,140
"Actually, I was really upset with you that day."

580
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,440
Yes.

581
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,390
I like people like him.

582
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,430
Because I think that's what a true friend does.

583
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,790
A friend should speak out when something bothers them,

584
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,800
because that's the only way your friendship will last.

585
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Exactly.

586
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,390
If you keep it all inside,

587
00:18:51,030 --> 00:19:00,050
[Speaking out what's bothering you is what true friends do]

588
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,470
it means you're not truly a friend to this person.

589
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,500
Yes, he did a good job.

590
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,670
And if he thought

591
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,740
they would never see each other again,

592
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,970
he could have just let it go and not said anything.

593
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,140
But he valued this memory,

594
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,680
so he said it.

595
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,480
He wanted to be friends with him, and that's great.

596
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,210
Poom, after hearing their inner thoughts,

597
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,380
did you feel touched or moved by anything?

598
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,900
They've all been living alone,

599
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,390
and everyone has their own barriers they struggle to overcome

600
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:24,230
and doesn't really want to interact with others.

601
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,600
But their time together helped them

602
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:31,190
overcome their own barriers.

603
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,430
For me, this is really heartwarming.

604
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,820
People who've been living alone finally have friends.

605
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,400
I'm really happy for them.

606
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,580
I also noticed one thing.

607
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,150
On the first day, Poom barely spoke,

608
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,690
but today, he actually said out loud,

609
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,220
"I think you're all wrong."

610
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,650
He has changed too.

611
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,570
Yeah, he's being himself now.

612
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,160
Good.

613
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,960
Thank you.

614
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,180
Okay. Let's see who else will share their inner thoughts.

615
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,910
I was raised under a military-style education.

616
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,700
The reason I used to be afraid of water

617
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,570
was that I had nearly drowned before.

618
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,640
I've shared it with you before.

619
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,370
This is how I was taught when I was a kid learning to swim.

620
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,510
Normally,

621
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:12,110
people learn hand movements, leg movements, and breathing techniques separately.

622
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,330
But when I was learning, they taught me all three at once

623
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:22,040
[Guei was raised under military-style education]

624
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,840
and told me I had to master them all at once.

625
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,850
But if you don't know how to swim and you're afraid of water,

626
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,980
you just can't do it.

627
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,320
That's how I grew up.

628
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,940
So I feel…

629
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,430
I don't know how everyone grew up,

630
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,400
but I'm glad that now,

631
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,230
when people talk about me, they say,

632
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,270
"You're well-behaved and thoughtful."

633
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:39,690
I used to be arrogant, bad-tempered,

634
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,830
and always thought

635
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,940
everything should be done my way.

636
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,010
But after growing up,

637
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,980
I realized that was just because I was young and immature.

638
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,890
At first, since I was a foreigner

639
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,990
and my Chinese wasn't good,

640
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,210
I felt like

641
00:20:54,330 --> 00:21:00,570
I was an alien; like an alien, right?

642
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,660
And we couldn't communicate.

643
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,800
But now, we're very close.

644
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,410
We're like Fast & Furious. Like Vin Diesel. Family.

645
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,530
Family.

646
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,130
Family.

647
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,050
The...

648
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,720
Fast & Furious.

649
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,480
Vin Diesel.

650
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,910
Family?

651
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,230
Vin Diesel.

652
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:20,900
Yes.

653
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:25,360
I also want to say that...

654
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:30,230
[The eight boys are getting along like family]

655
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:34,210
this experience has also given me more cultural understanding.

656
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,020
Because I'm also Asian.

657
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,770
So it's like bringing more culture to me.

658
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:41,900
You know?

659
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:42,670
I know.

660
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,800
You know?

661
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,320
Yeah. We know.

662
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,800
Good.

663
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,560
And I noticed that Pink really

664
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,930
doesn't talk much.

665
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,540
Really?

666
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,540
Yes.

667
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,520
Really?

668
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,480
Yeah. His teeth are really shiny.

669
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,450
Okay, I'll share.

670
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,300
Pink, come on.

671
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,890
Pinky.

672
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,720
At first,

673
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,650
I thought coming on this show

674
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,260
was a huge challenge for me.

675
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,390
I felt like many people here

676
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,330
had similar experiences to mine.

677
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,560
For example, he was in a sports class, and I was too.

678
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,060
I've also been part of a boy band before.

679
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,920
But I felt I...

680
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,200
I didn't do them very well.

681
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,750
It was because

682
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,940
I lacked perseverance and self-confidence.

683
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,680
That day, Guei told me that

684
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,930
if the teacher asks a question

685
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,770
and you have an unsure answer in your mind

686
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,110
but are too afraid to raise your hand

687
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,270
because you're scared it might be wrong,

688
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,350
the opportunity will be taken by someone else.

689
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,210
They might get the answer wrong, but they would get noticed by everyone.

690
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,810
Teacher might think he's trying hard at least.

691
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:41,780
But I'm still at the stage where I dare not raise my hand.

692
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,100
These past few days, hanging out with everyone,

693
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,300
I feel very comfortable.

694
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:51,160
[Pink hopes to face the unknown with more confidence]

695
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,700
I also told many people

696
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,370
that we should hang out again.

697
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,400
After this ends.

698
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,660
I told him I'm going to Bangkok to find him.

699
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,490
Yes.

700
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,580
This isn't just talk.

701
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,860
I think I'll actually do all of this, one by one.

702
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,520
This is my promise to all of you.

703
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,330
Robert!

704
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,480
You came the latest, what are your thoughts?

705
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,540
These past few days

706
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:10,770
have been some of the happiest for me since graduation.

707
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,320
Because when you're still studying,

708
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,800
you're kind of forced to meet different people.

709
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,030
After graduation, all my interactions were work-related.

710
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:25,770
Whether it's personal stuff, showbiz,

711
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,330
or social media,

712
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:33,580
I rarely have the chance to genuinely connect with people.

713
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:37,780
[Robert lets down his guard to make real friends]

714
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,700
Just being friends, with no strings attached.

715
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,750
For me, I felt...

716
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,990
honestly,

717
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:44,820
there's a bit of a gap between us.

718
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,280
I didn't expect

719
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,990
a nearly ten-year age gap.

720
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,630
At this age, coming to a show like this,

721
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:57,200
I was a bit resistant and scared at first.

722
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,400
Being with you all,

723
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,910
I feel very happy that,

724
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,540
even though I'm childish, when talking to everyone,

725
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,340
I can still

726
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,240
connect with each of you.

727
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,910
At my age,

728
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,030
I feel like I've gone back to my early twenties,

729
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,520
like when I was 25,

730
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,520
how passionate I felt about acting and my work,

731
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:21,260
[After this week, Adson rekindled his passion for acting]

732
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,040
and my dreams.

733
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,630
I feel that passion surging through me again.

734
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,030
I feel like I've been reborn with new blood.

735
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,970
My old self is gone,

736
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,440
and being with you guys gave me new life.

737
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,400
You must be truly happy,

738
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,070

They'll get to film.

899

I think we should start with the easier ones.

911
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,550
Start with the easier ones. Who's sure?

912

Yes, but I think...

I think Chien Yu is sincere.

916

He's very sincere.

917

But I think Robert's feelings

919
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,870
might be more complicated.

920
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,380
It's not necessarily to respond to his love.

in order to form a CP in the end.

924
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:51,220
He and Chien Yu also have the best chemistry

925
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,400
since they knew each other the longest,

926
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,490
so he'd choose Chien Yu.

927
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,570
-I think that's the reason.
-Right?

928
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:57,910
I agree.

929
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,380
I think at least,

930
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,180
when they hung out,

931
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,190
they already gave off a strong CP vibe.

932
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:03,880
Yeah.

933
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,170
And the scene they did was pretty good.

934
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,350
Yeah, and they bickered a lot off-screen, it was fun to watch.

935
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:08,990
Yeah.

936
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,370
Okay, so this pairing goes to our

937
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:12,620
most supportive fan, Poom.

938
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,320
Your CP.

939

We're gifting it to you.

941
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,030
Gifting cookies was very important,

942

because he didn't expect that

943
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,010
both Fumi and Pink would chose him.

944
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,010

[Stressed]

946
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,010
But with Pink, things are getting complicated.

947
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,630
This plot could be a full BL drama now.

948
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,350
Pink seems to care a lot about Yi.

949
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,050
But will Yi choose Pink?

950
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,640
But Yi might choose Guei.

951
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,810
So annoying.

952
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,490
Yi might choose Adson.

953
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,230
Yeah.

954
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,580

956
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,700
And I think Adson will choose Yi.

957

[Yi is the biggest wildcard in the final confession]

958
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,630
It's complicated.

959
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,380
It's so annoying that they're not together.

960
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,760
Yi is a sinful man.

961
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:00,540
He's interacted with everyone

962
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,750
and everyone might choose him.

963
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,740
I want to hear Poom's thoughts.

964
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:08,719
I saw that from the beginning,

965
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,350
Yi wanted to break out of his pairing and interact with everyone.

966
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,949
But in the end, he came back to choose Adson.

967
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:19,920
I think with the others,

968
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,830
Yi probably won't choose them.

969
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:22,280
Yeah.

970
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,100
Whether they care about Yi or not,

971
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,230
or how they got along with him,

972
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,489
I don't think Yi will choose these three.

973
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:33,159
But now I think the two of them have a shot.

[Auntie Squad predicts the CP pairings]

975
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:36,770
One of them got spicy cookies from Yi,

976
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,639
and they had some interactions.

977
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,870
The other is Adson.

978
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:44,120
He was his initial scene partner.

979
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:47,630
They have good chemistry and he feels secure.

980
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,460
They've also hung out a lot.

981
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,550
Yeah.

982
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:54,659
But I think Yi is a man of his word.

983
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,530
If he really promised someone,

984
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,900
like with the cookies,

985
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,000
even if he really wanted to give them to Adson,

986
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,300
but because he promised his cookies to Guei,

987
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,700
he decided to still give them to Guei.

988
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,010
Let's not forget fate.

989
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,240
It's fate that allowed them to stay in the same room.

Poom has something to say.

991
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,210
I think it might be hard for Yi,

992
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,350

He thinks it's won't be Guei. It's between Adson and Pink.

995
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,700
Then Adson's got a double bet.

996
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,960
It's Adson then.

997
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,900
There's so many different pairings, I'm confused already.

998

Yi's really everybody's center.

999

Yeah.

So after all the guessing and choosing,

1001
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,240
there's a double, so we're going with Adson.

1009

the situation between you two is that

1082

But it's upside down now. It can't grow.

1101

00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:37,870
if you pick this person, there might not be much room for development.

1104
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:37,910
[Guei's option A seems to lack potential]

1105
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:39,170
Did he mention who he is?

1106
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,100
No, he didn't.

1107
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,240
Pink, he did.

1108
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,740
But we don't know

1109
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,730
-who's A or B.
-Right.

1110
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,060
Okay, let's look at B.

1111
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,680
The three cards of B,

1112
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,380
do you see a general on this card?

1113
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,240
Very beautiful, and a lot of money is flying around.

1114
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:55,750
And there are many gears behind.

1115
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,390
The two of you together

1116
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,350
give off a dazzling impression.

1117
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,800
And it feels very...

1118
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,030
This general is a charming general.

1119
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,090
He's talented and creative.

1120
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:08,050
You two seem quite good together.

1121
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,170
There are many flowers in the third card.

1122
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,340
Actually, flowers are good.

1123
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,660
Flowers mean popularity.

1124
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:16,460
You two would have great emotional chemistry,

1125
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,350
so you may be popular with the audience.

1126
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,660
But because it's upside down,

1127
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,850
so,

1128
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,750
relatively, things might be awkward at first.

1129
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,970
If you want to

1130
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,120
this to go well long-term,

1131
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,350
you have to try your best

1132
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:35,760
to communicate with each other

1133
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:40,050
[Guei's option B requires warmth and open communication]

1134
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,700
and not be so tough and hard,

1135
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,530
but be more gentle.

1136
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,530
Actually, the teacher is affecting the final choice.

1137
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,400
Yes, but she's quite accurate.

1138
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,760
It sounds like Guei's personality.

1139
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,170
I think I know now.

1140
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,750
I have a good idea.

1141
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:50,740
Just let it flow naturally.

1142
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,140
Okay, thank you.

1143
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,840
No problem. Thank you. Good luck.

1144
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,440
Thank you.

1145
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,820
I want to choose someone I feel the most comfortable with

1146
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:11,290
and someone I feel is the most fun and interesting.

1147
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:16,730
Someone I feel like I match with,

1148
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:24,120
[Adson already has someone in mind]

1149
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:19,530
who I feel comfortable with.

1150
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,230
It's very comfortable for me when we interact.

1151
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:23,870
That's very important to me.

1152
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,100
Yi, right?

1153
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,350
Yes, he'll definitely choose Yi.

1154
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,350
It must be Yi.

1155
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,790
He didn't hesitate.

1156
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,080
I think he's choosing Yi.

1157
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:31,850
Yeah, I think so too.

1158
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:32,790
Yi's really...

1159
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,470
Yi is really hard to read.

1160
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,130
Robert really,

1161
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,130
I think he made me feel

1162
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,760
like I could

1163
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,960
be someone different.

1164
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,900
From a character who always takes care of others,

1165
00:42:52,610 --> 00:43:03,490
[Robert is the person Chien Yu wants to form a CP with]

1166
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,730
who's always giving,

1167
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,140
to someone who

1168
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:58,500
can feel the warmth

1169
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,910
of being taken care of.

1170
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:03,680
He's like a bright big brother to me.

1171
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:12,020
I'm still thinking about who to choose.

1172
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,830
[Who will choose each other and become a CP?]
