187
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,000
Left foot. Left foot in first.

188
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,430
Yes.

189
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,170
In and out. Very good.

190
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,180
It's hard.

191
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,880
Okay, your turn. Left foot.

192
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,140
In and out. In and out and in. Right.

193
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,560
Not bad.

194
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,320
Now, switch to the other side.

195
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,550
Okay, let's do the moves with the silken hammock.

[Fumi and Chien Yu are practicing aerial yoga]

197
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,680
Go grab your hammock with both hands.

198
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,659
Cross the silk with your left foot.

199
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:41,800
Lower your bottom.

200
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,120
Then stretch your right foot to the widest.

201
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:45,909
Jump.

202
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,930
Okay, now look at me.

203
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:53,409
[Their moves look weird but we can't tell what's wrong with their movements]

204
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,090
Straighten your arms. Keep your arms straight.

205
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,880
Okay, bend and lift your right knee.

206
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,960
[Wow]

207
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,409
Then cross the silk.

208
00:06:58,409 --> 00:06:59,450
Fumi's legs are funny.

209
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,820
Your hip joint should cover your hip.

210
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,650
I'll help you with that later.

211
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,450
Go up and bend your right knee.

212
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,890
Straighten your right arm.

213
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,650
Let's do this simple move later.

214
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,990
Simple?

215
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:19,200
Okay. Now, put your right foot into this hole.

216
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,000
Try it. Straighten your left leg.

217
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,340
Straighten your left leg.

218
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,410
Okay, let me help you.

219
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,020
Turn, hip, up, pull.

220
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,720
Yes, it's actually a simple move.

221
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,180
Let me try.

222
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,770
You should use your hip. Don't use your thigh to push the silk.

223
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,990
Yes, good.

224
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,310
[Finished successfully]

225
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,940
Handsome man, bend and lift your right knee.

226
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,190
Right foot, right knee.

227
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,260
Right knee. Bend your right knee.

228
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,080
Then your thighs touch your...

229
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,140
Use your sole to touch the front side of your thigh.

230
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,000
Tighten your feet.

231
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,000
Tighten your feet.

232
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,260
Yes, look. It's so beautiful.

233
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,530
I have a good curve now.

234
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,600
Wait.

235
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,840
Say it yourself.

236
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,410
So, do you have anterior pelvic tilt?

237
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,380
People with anterior pelvic tilt should push their bodies forward.

238
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,830
The moves you're doing

239
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,850
[They're doing better and better]

[Robert, Adson, Pink and Yi are making earth ovens for the first time]

243

Okay, then we...

244
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,650
We need to

245
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,410
pile them.

246
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,960
Yes, let's pile it up.

247
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,320
They need to start with making a cover.

248

They are going to make a kiln.

249
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,480
Yes, like a mini-pyramid.

250
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,480
Robert, you did this before, right?

251
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,690
When we were in the car,

252
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,000
you said you had once tried this.

253
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,640
Yes.

254
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,669
You just

255

pile it up.

256

Like piling the toy bricks.

Yes.

260
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,410

[40 minutes later]

263
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,910
they must have used some techniques.

264
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,840
Yes, how did they pile it?

[Boys can't seal the kiln]

266
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,350
Is it because our rocks are not hard enough?

267

I don't think so.

268
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,900

269

277

Let's learn from them.

297
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,250
We can use this one secretly.

[A perfect kiln]

It was piled up with big pieces.

301
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,410
Yes, we need to use big ones.

302
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,610
Then we do this from the top

303
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,150
and immobilize it like this.

304
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,280
Right?

305
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,720
Come on, Adson, you try.

306
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,090
Yes, take two big pieces.

307
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,020
Two big ones each.

308
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,790
Okay.

309
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,430
I want this.

310
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,060
Are you sure?

311
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,790
Yes.

312
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,730
Should we remove these?

313
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,060
No, we'll do it like this.

314
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,560
I think we should leave them here.

315
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,930
It fits right.

316
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,600
Yes, let's get close.

317
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,470
Take two big ones.

318
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,800
Yes.

319
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,770
But it seems too far.

320
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,810
No.

It won't collapse again this time.

328
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,320
But if someone invites me to make an earth oven,

329
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,450
I won't go.

330
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,550
I'll just say no.

331
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,190
It's so tiring.

332
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,420
It's really tiring.

333
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,790
I think doing aerial yoga is really difficult for boys.

334
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,470
Because boys' bodies are stiff.

335
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,960
If a man is very muscular, it's very hard for him to do it.

336
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,660
Because boys' bodies are not as soft as girls'.

337
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,660
It's really hard for them.

338
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,660
But in a BL drama, it may go like this:

339
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,340
after the teacher leaves,

340
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,910
Chien Yu will go teach Fumi,

341
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,010
and they'll have body contact,

342
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,880
and Fumi is still very clumsy

343
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,110
and they'll have more body contact.

344
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,480
Then they'll start to...

345
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,210
[These fantasies will only happen when Aben directs a show]

No, it's not like that.

00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,500
Your show is going somewhere else.

348
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,640
You mean Fumi will get himself tangled, right?

349
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,760
Yes.

350
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,420
Their body contact will turn out to be something else.

351
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,840
But it's the same with the ones who practice karate.

352
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,520
Because Guei is very good at it

353
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,660
while Chris isn't,

354
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,730
Chris will admire Guei.

355
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,430
Yeah, I hope so.

356
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,520
Because both of them are very inner-directed.

357
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,980
After the first episode,

358
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,820
the two of them seemed to dislike each other.

359
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,810
Right. Guei is doing something he's good at,

360
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,180
and Chris is not good at it.

361
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,810
After they are trained by the very strict teacher,

362
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,030
maybe they'll grow on each other.

363
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,750
Let's start learning the basic karate moves.

You there and you here.

369
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,960
Okay, the first move. Clench your fists.

370
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,030

559
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,360
Chien Yu.

560
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,090
Why should he think of it as Chien Yu?

561
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,480
Why?

562
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,220
Nice.

563
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,220
One is enough.

564
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:46,990
[They start making the kiln]

565
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,800
Okay, the fire will reach there later.

566
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,260
Then it can keep burning.

567
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,040
Yes, put it in now. Or it'll go out later.

568
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,460
I'll just cover it and put it in.

569
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:56,030
[Don't think Adson can do it]

570
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,830
I'm afraid he'll get himself burnt.

571
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,030
This shouldn't be done by Adson.

572
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,370
It's horrible. It'll ruin the whole thing.

573
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,550
Really? Okay.

574
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:01,870
I'll put it in.

575
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:02,540
Okay.

576
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,270
Okay.

577
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,860
The owner said the soil should be heated to 400 degrees Celsius.

578
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,190
[They started to fire the kiln successfully]

579
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,010
A little red.

580
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:10,760
A little red.

581
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,570
So much smoke.

582
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,240
What do you think the other two groups are doing?

583
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,100
I think if we are like this,

584
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,150
they should be something easy.

585
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,870
Something elegant.

586
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,410
Because Robert...

587
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,940
Robert just said

588
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,990
you always chose a hard one.

589
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,570
When we're with you, whatever we do is so hard.

590
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,340
When we two are doing things together, we always do the hard things.

591
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,540
But I felt happy a few days ago. We were fishing shrimps.

592
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,380
I know, so we...

593
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,350
So we were pulling the scallions out.

594
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,650
We three were pulling the scallions out.

595
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,590
So the problem is with us three.

596
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,130
Yes.

597
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,790
Really?

598
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,440
We got in the wrong car.

599
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,710
Bow to each other. Bow to the referee.

600
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,780
[Guei and Chris practicing karate]

601
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,070
Bow to each other.

602
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,020
Okay, stand still.

603
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,940
Blue Zone. Step on the outside of the blue and you are out of bounds.

604
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,390
[Battle practice]

605
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,470
Okay.

606
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,020
Come on.

607
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,570
Ready, go.

608
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,250
Do you want to fight back?

609
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,980
Okay.

610
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,670
Stop.

611
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,150
What do you mean?

612
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,520
Pause. Back to your position.

613
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,380
You hit his chin and hit his face.

614
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,990
[Chris made a foul by hitting the face]

615
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,040
Okay, one foul.

616
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,130
Sorry.

617
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,430
Ready, go.

618
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,490
Be serious.

619
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,230
Hitting the face is not allowed.

620
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,260
Don't hit my face after defence.

621
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:38,850
Attack him.

622
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,800
Pause.

623
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,880
Is that a foul? I didn't hit it.

624
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,250
Back to your position first.

625
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,720
In a formal competition,

626
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,570
you can touch the opponent's face slightly.

627
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,790
You can score like this.

628
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,290
One point.

629
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,820
One point.

630
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,660
[Though he doesn't know the scoring rules]

631
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,690
You got a point first.

632
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,930
OK. Ready, go.

633
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,750
How much time do we have?

634
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,030
15 seconds.

635
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,870
[Guei actively attacks to get points]

636
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,030
Last 15 seconds. It's time to get points quickly.

637
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,470
Not touching him.

638
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:10,900
Stop.

639
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,600
At this time,

640
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,970
If you make a foul now, the number of the fouls made by you will be four.

641
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,120
[Guei looks aggressive, but Chris's attacks are precise]

642
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,610
If you make a foul in the last 15 seconds, it'll be counted as four fouls.

643
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,620
If you make another foul, you'll be disqualified.

644
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,360
It's 1 to 0 now. Then you have to take the points aggressively.

645
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,510
Let's start.

646
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,680
There's no much time left. Time is running out.

647
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,120
Stop.

648
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,580
Stop.

649
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,330
You can get a point this way.

650
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,850
The last attack you made can get you a point.

651
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,290
Although he hit you, you hit the right spot.

652
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,580
You still hit the right spot and that got you a point.

653
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,030
So you got one point.

654
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,650
Now 1:1, but he got the first point before you did.

655
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,150
The one who gets a point first will have an advantage.

656
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,190
How many seconds left?

657
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:40,900
Five seconds.

658
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,430
Five seconds.

659
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,310
[Starting suddenly]

660
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,400
Not yet. Don't rush.

661
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,650
Ready, go.

662
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,390
Again.

663
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,900
Stop.

664
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,480
You hit his face.

665
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:52,670
Stop.

666
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,190
Did he hit you?

667
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,450
He missed the last punch.

668
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,230
That's a point.

669
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,340
I got a point? Why?

670
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,000
[Don't know what's going on]

671
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,120
The last punch, that punch...

672
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,450
I don't quite understand.

673
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,860
Yeah, we are very focused.

674
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,360
We don't know how we just got points.

675
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,160
Okay.

676
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,760
So the result is 2:1.

677
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,000
I won.

678
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,400
So I need to bow to you.

679
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,570
Yes, bow to him and bow to the referee.

680
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:16,980
Then you can go down.

681
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,400
Because from the very beginning,

682
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,570
they started to interact with each other in this process.

683
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,050
Like you said,

684
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:27,360
[The battle practice allowed them to have more tacit cooperation]

685
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,470
Whether you're practicing karate or taekwondo,

686
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,960
the interaction is key.

687
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,380
Yes.

688
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,150
When one's hand goes over, the other should step back.

689
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,410
It requires good footwork.

690
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,800
But I think the other group is also cute.

691
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,790
Because practicing the aerial yoga makes them closer.

692
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,850
I think for a real couple,

693
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,990
or two actors who are a couple in a show,

694
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,830
it's important to have good friends.

695
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:49,650
[Auntie Squad thinks Chien Yu and Fumi don't feel like a couple]

696
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,930
Because friends will give you some advice.

697
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,960
Friends talk about what will happen next,

698
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,130
how he feels about you

699
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,290
or...

700
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,100
You mean chatting while practicing yoga?

701
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,340
Yes, because in the process,

702
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,840
the suggestion is very important.

703
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,480
For example, your best friend will tell you

704
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,240
how he feels about you,

705
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,580
or give you some advice.

706
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,120
But some people's advice might not be very good.

707
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,150
What kind of person do you think Fumi is?

708
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,380
Is Fumi very observant?

709
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,540
I always feel that

710
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,440
Fumi a good friend to everyone.

711
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:14,730
He hasn't made me feel that

712
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,180
he likes or wants to get close to someone.

713
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,880
He's like a good friend to everyone.

714
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,670
And they were joking that

715
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,880
whoever is Adson will be unlucky.

716
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,340
He always gets the super difficult task.

717
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,170
He had to pull out the scallions,

718
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,640
or make the earth ovens.

719
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,940
It happened every time.

720
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,050
Adson needed to deal with mud or dirt all the time.

721
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,080
But did you notice

722
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,320
some details about Yi?

723
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,840
Yi, don't follow Adson all the time.

724
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,150
I can see it.

725
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,160
It's the last day.

726
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,990
He's taking the last chance.

727
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,370
Yes, he knows how to take the chances.

728
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,230
[He knows Yi the best]

729
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,380
He wanted to make sure his predictions about the best couples are right.

730
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,690
Well, I think you have so many reasons and theories all the time.

731
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,830
Last time you said

732
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,340
you could think from Yi's perspective

733
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,970
and then you predicted Yi's predictions about the couples.

734
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,430
And then Yi's judgement was completely different from your predictions.

735
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,910
I just want to say

736
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,910
what you said

737
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,480
[Don't be too confident]

738
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,550
may be completely wrong,

739
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,250
and then we can replay the scene again.

740
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,820
In the end, maybe Yi will choose Pink.

741
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,720

00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,680
Chien Yu is a good jumper. He keeps jumping.

1300
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:34,260
[Today's topic is kicked off by Pink. It's so rare]

1301
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,050
He was on a volleyball team, so he jumped so high.

1302
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,860
You know I dare not approach him when he grabs the ball.

1303
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,540
I thought I'd get internal injury.

1304
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,090
When I grabbed the ball, I saw Chien Yu alone in the air.

1305
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:45,560
[The biggest shield, Chien Yu]

1306
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,090
Everyone else was on the floor.

1307
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,320
They were just watching him jump.

1308
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,920
Going up there will get you killed.

1309
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,510
Pink is really good.

1310
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,410
I don't know where he went and then he scored.

1311
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:55,980
[The King of the Euro Step on the court, Pink]

1312
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,420
Adson is old too.

1313
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:58,550
[This is Pink's true nature]

1314
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,930
I haven't finished yet. I'm choking.

1315
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,280
I'm counting on you.

1316
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,620
I saw Pink shinning on the court.

1317
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,810
His eyes are also shining.

1318
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,130
My ball. I want to score like this.

1319
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,620
I want to win.

1320
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,450
Really.

1321
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,300
At first, I thought

1322
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,410
seven days are quite long.

1323
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,000
If I'm with a group of strangers.

1324
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,260
Until now, I actually feel a bit

1325
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,590
reluctant that there are only two days left.

1326
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:28,720
The more we get along, the more we don't want to end.

1327
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,450
It's funny for boys to play basketball.

1328
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,570
They will start to say...

1329
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,480
When Yi is about to throw, they will said there is no need to guard.

1330
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,810
No need to guard because he will miss.

1331
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:38,110
There will be some weird interaction.

1332
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,320
When they see Yi, they will say no.

1333
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,080
Yes.

1334
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,410
But one of them is so handsome.

1335
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,200
Pink is so handsome.

1336
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,550
Pink is really good.

1337
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,880
Why is he so good?

1338
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,160
His whole style of playing, like when he dribbles,

1339
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,550
includes doing a behind-the-back dribble.

1340
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:54,460
Then he takes a step first, quickly stops,

1341
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,730
and then goes straight into a jump shot.

1342
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:56,840
And he also used a fake move earlier.

1343
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,700
Yeah, it's hard for him to shoot like this.

1344
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,340
So he specifically practiced all the skills.

1345
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,100
They're all good.

1346
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,470
It feels like the ball is attached to his hand.

1347
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:05,490
He did it smoothly.

1348
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,660
And there was a pair that was pretty good.

1349
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,360
Yi and Adson.

1350
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,870
The two of them.

1351
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,140
[Aunt's style of praising]

1352
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:12,960
Yi kept passing the ball to Adson.

1353
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,970
At first, Adson thought he might not make it,

1354
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:17,850
but he got a lot of points.

1355
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:18,390
Yeah.

1356
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:21,120
The key point is that all his points were scored from passes made by Yi.

1357
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,880
Yeah, because Yi can't make it.

1358
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:25,510
Niki, you noticed a detail.

1359
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:27,430
In the beginning, Yi

1360
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,200
gets along well with Guei.

1361
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,410
Yes, when they got off the car.

1362
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:34,250
[After Yi got off the car 
he couldn't stop chatting with Guei]

1363
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:32,700
When they gather together,

1364
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,970
they really want to get closer

1365
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:37,140
to those who aren't on the same team.

1366
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,610
Sharing what happened just now.

1367
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:41,210
They also want to know

1368
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:42,140
what happened to others.

1369
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,050
Yes, because he gave cookies

1370
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:45,480
to Guei, right?

1371
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,830
And they'll communicate in English.

1372
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:52,020
It just feels like Guei is willing to cooperate with Yi

1373
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,490
and wants to communicate with him more.

1374
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:56,560
So he talks to him in English.

1375
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,840
[Auntie Squad predicts couple pairing]

1376
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,590
Yes, so I think this little detail at the end,

1377
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:01,200
plus the fact that they spent the whole day together

1378
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,180
playing basketball and doing different activities,

1379
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,270
might lead to some changes in their relationship.

1380
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:06,170
I'm really

1381
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,450
worried, scared but looking forward to it.

1382
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:11,440
Poom, did you notice anything

1383
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,480
interesting when they were playing basketball?

1384
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,440
I think so.

1385
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:18,860
He saw Chris too.

1386
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,850
Chris.

1387
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:20,960
He saw it.

1388
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,470
Yes, I think it's the last day.

1389
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,960
After Chris went to practice karate

1390
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,710
and then came here to play basketball,

1391
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:32,360
his ending just had no romantic vibe at all.

1392
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,980
["His soul is out"]

1393
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,300
A feeling of nihilism.

1394
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,030
Yeah, so I don't know

1395
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,270
what he will choose in the end.

1396
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:38,700
His energy has been drained.

1397
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,370
I think Chris is strange now.

1398
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:42,770
It's because when they were giving the cookies,

1399
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,850
we were also wrong about Chris.

1400
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,940
Two people chose Chris.

1401
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,280
So I think during the final confession,

1402
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,080
there might be a twist

1403
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,550
that we didn't notice.

1404
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,770
Could it be that the more upset he gets,

1405
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:59,360
the more unexpected developments there will be?

1406
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:02,550
[Chris might become the biggest variable in the final confession?]

1407
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:00,690
in episode 11?

1408
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:01,990
There may be someone to comfort him.

1409
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:04,890
Let's look forward to the development in Episode 11.

1410
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:05,950
It's almost come to an end.
