and then later

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,150
we'd split into groups.

before or during the process,

19
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,680
there'll definitely be some shyness or nervousness.

20
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,210
For example, just joking around

I'm a little nervous

79

because of the language barrier

80
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,550
and being unfamiliar with everything,

81
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,320
so it's a little awkward.

Yes, I'll pay attention to many details,

109
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,470
or what he likes to drink,

110

or if he's feeling hot or wearing too much.

(It's difficult to defend myself)
He was already showing it to us.

114

Kimi Hsia, since you've acted in many dramas,

143
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,180
have you ever felt like

144

Is that a thing?

146
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,450
I think there'll be an element of that.

147
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,490
If you're supposed to date someone,

148
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,650
date someone on-screen,

149
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,760
you must have feelings for them.

150
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,430
Otherwise, the audience will find it very fake.

151
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,160
Yeah.

152
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,300
It's hard to control.

(To make a scene believable, real emotions must be involved)

how to put it away.

Yes.

160
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,770
Or don't detach

161
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,140
and actually start dating!

Great. A real-life CP is the best.

After a drama ends,

167
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,909
I start checking their IG to see if they're following each other

168
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:54,820
and if he restricted him, right?

169
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,620
Whether they unfollowed each other...

170
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,150
I want to see

171
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,220
whether they continue to follow each other.

172
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,190
If they reunite again,

173
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,220
I'll be happier.

174
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,390
Chu, when acting,

175
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,860
have you, you know,

176
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,450
developed real feelings?

177
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,980
Let's not talk about the filming process first.

178
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:10,770
In that moment, the emotions are real.

(For that moment, the emotions are true)

181
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,700
Yes.
(For that moment, the emotions are true)

182
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,700
Yes, I understand.
(For that moment, the emotions are true)

183
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,340
Because when you look at each other,
(For that moment, the emotions are true)

184
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,570
you need to cry, laugh,
(For that moment, the emotions are true)

185
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,910
you need to feel shy.
(For that moment, the emotions are true)

186
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,480
That moment is real, right?
(For that moment, the emotions are true)

187
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,980
Yes.

188
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,950
So I think Love Casting

189
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,910
is here to capture that moment.

190
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,150
So beautiful!

191
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:29,670
Where is this?

192
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:29,920
(Yilan, Taiwan)
Where is this?

193
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:29,950
(Yilan, Taiwan)

194
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,390
Yeah, where is this?
(Yilan, Taiwan)

195
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,250
(Yilan, Taiwan)

196
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,130
Very tall.

197
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,400
You can see that he's tall?

198
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,500
He has long legs.

199
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,200
Legs?

200
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,400
Long legs.

201
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,870
He's my type.

202
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:56,409
Anyone there?

203
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,720
Hello, my name is Yi Gao.

204
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,430
I've always wanted to be an actor.

205
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,210
(Yi Gao: 1.80m, 72kg, Aquarius, from Canada, Nurse)
I've always wanted to be an actor.

206
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,450
Then I about heard about this opportunity.

207
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,570
So, I came here excitedly

208
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,590
to join.

209
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,310
I don't think so.

210
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,330
(Would filming a BL drama spark chemistry?)
I don't think so.

211
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:22,820
(Would filming a BL drama spark chemistry?)

212
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:35,909
Hello.

213
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,010
Hello.

214
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:37,520
Hello.

215
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,110
What's your name?

216
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,190
I'm Pink.

217
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,020
Pink?

218
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,170
I'm Pink.

219
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,580
When I'm in a new environment,

220
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,180
(Pink: 1.77m, 58kg, Libra)
When I'm in a new environment,

221
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,330
(Pink: 1.77m, 58kg, Libra)

222
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,230
I tend to be a bit introverted and take time to warm up.
(Pink: 1.77m, 58kg, Libra)

223
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:49,690
I tend to be a bit introverted and take time to warm up.

224
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,780
But actually,

225
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,570
I talk a lot once we become close,

226
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,320
and sometimes I'm quite funny.

227
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:56,220
Being pinned down?

228
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,730
(Possibility of being pinned down by a guy?)
Being pinned down?

229
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,290
No way.

230
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,820
Hello.

231
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,490
What's your name?

232
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,640
I'm Pink.

233
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,300
Pink.

234
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,230
My name is...

235
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,660
Your name is Pink? Really?

236
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,430
English.

237
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,060
Are you serious?

238
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,430
I thought you wanted

239
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,530
to match that.

240
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,310
Hello, I'm Adson.

241
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:22,730
I heard that I might be the oldest one here.

242
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:26,820
(Adson: 1.85m, 80kg, Aquarius, Actor & Model)
I heard that I might be the oldest one here.

243
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,140
I hope that after a few days of

244
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,610
getting to know everyone,

245
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,429
I can

246
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,440
take on the role of an older brother

247
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,440
and take care of everyone.

248
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,100
I haven't thought about

249
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,590
(Possibility of things getting heated with a guy?)
I haven't thought about

250

(Possibility of things getting heated with a guy?)

251
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,539
dating a boy.
(Possibility of things getting heated with a guy?)

252
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,150
Can you speak English?

253
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:43,679
A little.

254
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,790
Enough for basic communication.

255
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,090
Because my Chinese isn't very good,

256
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,340
so

257
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,060
I might need a translator.

258
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,930
Your Chinese is pretty good.

259
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:52,030
(Yi Gao from Canada is worried about communication barriers)
Your Chinese is pretty good.

260
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,290
No, it's not good.
(Yi Gao from Canada is worried about communication barriers)

261
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,100
(Yi Gao from Canada is worried about communication barriers)

262
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,230
No problem.
(Yi Gao from Canada is worried about communication barriers)

263
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,130
It's fine.
(Yi Gao from Canada is worried about communication barriers)

264
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,070
In this kind of situation,

265
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,470
he would probably rely more on someone who speaks good English.

266
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,980
Hello.

267
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,930
What's your name?

268
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,480
My name is Fumi.

F-u-m-i.

270
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,090
Because my personal motto in life is

(Fumi: 1.82m, 58kg, Leo, Graduate Student in Psychological Counseling)

00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,710
to stay flexible.
(Fumi: 1.82m, 58kg, Leo, Graduate Student in Psychological Counseling)

274
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,760
No matter what stage of life I'm in,

275
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,900
if any unexpected

276
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,220
and valuable opportunities arise,

277
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,920
I want to give it a try.

278
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,440
Hello everyone.

279
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,150
I'm Guei from U:NUS.

280
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,060
I tend to be more of an observer.

(Guei: 1.80m, 76kg, Aquarius, U:NUS Leader)

283
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,250
I actually have quite a bit of social anxiety.
(Guei: 1.80m, 76kg, Aquarius, U:NUS Leader)

284
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,170
I actually have quite a bit of social anxiety.

285
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,780
Yeah, I don't dare to interact with others.

286
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,830
If someone doesn't start a conversation with me,

287
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,860
it'll be hard for me to talk to them.

288
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,110
I'm worried about physical contact.

Because
(Are you comfortable living with boys?)

294
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,560
I don't like

295
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,420
people touching me too much.

296
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:58,890
Okay.

297
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,190
Is everyone this awkward?

298
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,160
It's probably like this at first.

299
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,960
Okay.

300
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,570
It'll get better gradually.

301
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,400
So you were all just talking awkwardly like this?

302
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,970
It was even more awkward before.

303
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:08,900
It was even more awkward?

304
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,700
When there are fewer people, it's more awkward.

305
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,840
The more people, the more...

306
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,870
Warmer and livelier.

307
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,210
I love this kind of awkwardness.

308
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,410
Because they're awkward but also a little shy.

309
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,310
The green boy is here.

310
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,980
It seems like everyone wears a different color.

311
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,150
Sit here.

312
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,190
Don't be awkward.

313
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,290
He's Adson.

314
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,890

Chris.

324
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,270
Why are they all so hard to pronounce?

325
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,040
Hi, I'm Chris.

326
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,910
I'll be 22 after my birthday.

327

(Chris: 1.77m, 62kg, Gemini)
I'll be 22 after my birthday.

(Chris: 1.77m, 62kg, Gemini)

329
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,280
And I'm about to graduate from university.
(Chris: 1.77m, 62kg, Gemini)

330
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,070
Because many people say I look like a dog,

331
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,330
like a husky or a Samoyed.

332
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
Yeah, so

333
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,330
that may be my charm.

334
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,160
How many people will be here in total?

335
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,830
-I heard that...
-There should be eight.

336
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,790
In total?

337
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,400
I heard.

338
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,560
But I don't know if it's true.

339
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:13,670
(A moment of silence)

340
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,070
Hi.

You can also call me Chien Yu.

because I like to talk nonsense.

352
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,600
I'm afraid they would think I'm too enthusiastic.

353
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,360
When they took my phone earlier,

354
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,430
I felt like I went back to Chenggong Ridge.

355
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,360
-Back in the military.
-Me too.

356
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,900
Why was my phone taken away again?

357
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,530
And I can only get it back at night.

358
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,500
I just told them

359
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:45,770
I feel even more insecure

360
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:46,570
(Extroverted Chien Yu finally breaks the ice)
I feel even more insecure

361
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,000
than when I was in the military.
(Extroverted Chien Yu finally breaks the ice)

362
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,070
They just took our phones suddenly.
(Extroverted Chien Yu finally breaks the ice)

363
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:51,740
They just took our phones suddenly.

364
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,570
It was really sudden.

365
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,180
Because at least in the military, they tell you what's going to happen.

366
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,810
Yes.

367
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:55,640
But here,

368
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,610
we don't know anything. So you feel really uneasy.

369
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,680
I don't even know where we're going later.

370
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,480
So who is the eighth person?

371
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,380
Guess we'll find out.

372
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,220
We'll get seasick soon.

373
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,390
Right now, just swaying like that

374
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,690
is making me feel quite dizzy.

375
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,050
Me too.

376
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,300
After we got on the boat,

377
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,480
we introduced ourselves one by one.

378
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,880
Gradually, from very awkward,

379
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,330
to even more awkward,

380
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
to super awkward.

381
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,670
I think it's great that

382
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,670
everyone is of a different type.

383
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,970
There're all kinds.

384
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,670
-No one overlaps.
-Right.

385
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,280
Yes, like Chris,

386
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,910
who's the husky, puppy type, very cute.

387
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,110
Then there's Chien Yu, the fitness coach.

388
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,820
He walked in showing his abs.

389
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,980
Yes.

390
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,150
Yes, from a distance,

391
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,150
I was wondering if that was skin.

392
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,220
Yes.

393
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,360
But Chu noticed

394
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,590
some details, right?

395
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,030
Guei has a mysterious aura,

396
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,230
so he might have an advantage.

397
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,530
Because everyone

398
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:52,530
is curious about the unknown.

399
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,070
Peng Peng, do you have any impressions

400
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,200
of any of the guys?

401
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,640
Actually,

402
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,570
I heard that the eight boys

403
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,870
each have their own style.

404
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,040
I think one of them is very interesting.

405
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,710
It's...

406
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,310
Adson. He said he's the big brother.

407
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,750
I think he's handsome.

408
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,650
Also,

409
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:13,090
like you said, there are all kinds.

410
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:13,850
I want to see

411
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,490
how cute they'll be

412
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,560
when they interact.

413
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,730
Because they are all different types.

414
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,430
But there were only seven of them, right?

415
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,230
Yes, there's one more.

416
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,100
I don't know when the eighth one will appear.

417
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,570
And I'm looking forward to it.

418
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,830
Let me tell you, the eighth one

419
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,870
usually appears

420
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,970
after everyone is already getting close,

421
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,940
when things start to get romantic,

422
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,140
the eighth guy suddenly appears and stirs everything up.

423
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,880
Makes a powerful entrance.

424
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,380
Right? That's always how it goes.

425
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,350
From a story perspective, it makes sense.

426
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,660
We've set sail!

427
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,520
They're really sailing through the waves.

428
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,760
It's very anime-like.

429
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,290
It's like an anime opening scene.

430
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,390
Where are they going?

431
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:06,680
(When everyone is having fun taking photos, something unexpected happened?!)

432
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,140
Do you want to sit in the back?

433
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,680
Pink, you'll feel more comfortable here.

434
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,810
I'm very comfortable.

435
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,550
It's windy.

436
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,520
So it's better for you to sit over there.

437
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,650
I feel like it's more comfortable sitting here.

438
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,290
I think it's stuffy there.

439
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
It's windy here.

440
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,600
And it's not as shaky as the front of the boat.

441
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:22,850
Wow, it does feel like the waves are huge.

442
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,570
(As the excitement wears off, the boys start getting seasick)
Wow, it does feel like the waves are huge.

443
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,840
(As the excitement wears off, the boys start getting seasick)

444
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,930
You're all posing.

445
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:28,970
Here, pose.

446
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:29,260
("Turn around and vomit" pose)
Here, pose.

447
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,760
His pose is good.
("Turn around and vomit" pose)

448
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,820
("Turn around and vomit" pose)

449
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,800
He simply turned his back on you.
("Turn around and vomit" pose)

450
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,370
Do you feel better here?

451
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,270
Yes because I can look ahead.

452
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,750
It's like driving.

453
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,570
If you look at the side, you get even dizzier.

454
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,880
Why do I feel like vomiting?

455
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,280
Okay. Take my seat.

456
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,770
I feel sorry for him.

457
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,910
His whole face is like this.

458
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,280
Poor him.

459
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,130
I'm quite comfortable.

460
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,110
For now.

461
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,160
If I don't feel well later,

462
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,280
edit this part out for me.

463
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,550
Edit out the part where I said I'm comfortable.

464
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,370
Talking big.

465
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,380
You even emphasized it.

466
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,200
(Only Adson, Guei and Fumi can talk normally now)
You even emphasized it.

467
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,370
"I'm quite comfortable" and then I start throwing up.
(Only Adson, Guei and Fumi can talk normally now)

468
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,330
(Only Adson, Guei and Fumi can talk normally now)

469
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,810
This is turning into

470
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,380
some kind of elimination game.

471
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,310
Being eliminated one by one.

472
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,350
I really didn't expect

473
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,930
to take an hour to reach Guishan Island.

474
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,010
One by one,

475
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,360
we started losing people.

476
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,050
One, two, three.

477
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,590
I found they were really uncomfortable.

478
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,960
I threw up so much.

479
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,400
So I think this is actually...

480
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,160
I was surprised and it was unforgettable.

481
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,410
I'm surprised because I've never been there.

482
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,450
I've always wanted to go there.

483
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,530
And

484
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,750
I didn't expect to get seasick.

485
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,510
Super seasick.

486
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,750
Oh my god.

487
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,780
How did this happen?

488
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,910
It's so awkward.

489
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,450
This was supposed to be romantic.

490
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,080
Yeah.

491
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,790
But their first day started with them throwing up.

492
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,450
But could it be that because of this,

493
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,660
you'll also realize who really takes care of you?

494
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,890
You'll also have a different feeling, right?

495
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,710
(Water sports bring the boys back to life)

496
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,610
-He's strong.
-This is Yi Gao, right?
(Water sports bring the boys back to life)

497
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,680
He has a great body.

498
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,730
(Only Guei stands alone at the edge of the boat)

499
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,390
(Adson steps forward to check on Guei)

500
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,560
He really doesn't dare to jump.
(Adson steps forward to check on Guei)

501
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,530
Yes, he's afraid of water.
(Adson steps forward to check on Guei)

502
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,330
He was the coolest one in the introduction segment.
(Adson steps forward to check on Guei)

503
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,330
He was the coolest one in the introduction segment.

504
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,500
Now he doesn't dare to jump.

505
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,100
(Turns out, Guei is afraid to jump into the water)

506
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,900
Don't.
(Turns out, Guei is afraid to jump into the water)

507
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,890
(Turns out, Guei is afraid to jump into the water)

508
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,840
Just like, three, two, one, jump.

509
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:54,910
(Everyone cheers for Guei)

510
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,310
Three, two, one, jump.
(Everyone cheers for Guei)

511
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,880
(Everyone cheers for Guei)

512
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,180
Just jump once first.
(Everyone cheers for Guei)

513
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,150
Just jump once first.

514
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,860
Although I look fearless,

515
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,640
I just happen to be afraid of heights and water.

516
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,150
And today, I encountered both.

517
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,670
(Adson demonstrates the jumping technique for Guei)

518
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,369
(I still dare not) (Scared)

519
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,770
Close your eyes.

520
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,410
I thought,

521
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,950
is it too late for me to quit now?

522
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,630
I was so scared.

523
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,680
Three.

524
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,810
You have to grab that,

525
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,550
or you'll drift away.

526
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,680
So scary.

527
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:38,790
Okay.

528
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,690
Three.

529
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,660
Two.

530
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,320
Three, two.

531
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,860
Okay.

532
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,010
One.

533
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:45,570
(Backs out at the last moment)
One.

534
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,020
(Backs out at the last moment)

535
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,920
(Poom is worried too!)

536
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,400
Will looking down make it less scary

537
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,670
or should I not look?

538
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,940
Look.

539
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,700
Looking makes it scarier?

540
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,400
Looking makes it less scary.

541
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,710
Okay, I'll look down.

542
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,280
Ready?

543
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,690
Three, two.

544
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:02,910
(Chien Yu jumps with Guei again)
Three, two.

545
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,680
You haven't jumped yet?
(Chien Yu jumps with Guei again)

546
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,240
One.
(Chien Yu jumps with Guei again)

547
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,640
(Chien Yu jumps with Guei again)

548
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,170
The impression I had of him,

549
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,420
whether on stage or in private,

550
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,410
was cool and fierce.

551
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,890
I didn't expect that our first game

552
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,320
he was the most afraid.

553
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:17,980
It's quite different.

554
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,460
But he overcome it and jumped down.

555
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,740
Everyone was there to support him.

556
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,180
Everyone has such great bodies.

557
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,930
That's Adson.

558
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,100
They're really having so much fun.

559
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,760
Fumi.

560
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,540
(Water activities bring the boys closer together)

561
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,830
So cute!

562
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,400
-This is so fun.
-It’s like a wave dance.

563
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,210
So youthful! Oh my god.

564
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,540
It's so beautiful.

565
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,610
Yeah. And I think these activities are great.

566
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,280
It feels like they instantly became super close.

567
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,300
Yeah, and speaking of earlier,

568
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,050
do you think

569
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,950
anyone had the biggest image contrast, Niki?

570
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,280
Definitely Guei.

571
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,520
At first, he said

572
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,790
he was fearless,

573
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,820
and then he was afraid of heights and water.

574
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,790
Clearly, he’s afraid of a lot of things.

575
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,260
He’s afraid of a lot of things.

576
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,630
And normally, Guei,

577
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,960
U:NUS from ATOM BOYZ,

578
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,660
he’s always the super cool

579
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,260
dance guy on stage.

580
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,160
But just now,

581
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,100
we saw his adorable side for the first time.

582
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,730
The contrast is cute.

583
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,830
We got to discover his different sides.

584
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,770
But the contrast is cute.

585
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,770
And did you notice that

586
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,240
both Adson and Chien Yu helped him?

587
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:12,940
Yeah.

588
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,280
No, I think Adson wants to look cool.

589
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,940
He's the type who wants to take care of people.

590
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,450
But he landed on his face while diving.

591
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,250
It was a full-on splat.

592
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,280
I thought it must have hurt.

593
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,090
Super painful. Really super painful.

594
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,020
But I think

595
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,890
both of their contrasts were really cute.

596
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,860
Quite attractive.

597
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,830
Because when Adson appeared,

598
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,230
you know, wearing a gentleman hat,

599
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,900
he seemed older and cool.

600
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,130
But when he was teaching him,

601
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,070
he had this slightly clumsy vibe. Very attractive.

602
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,870
Yes.

603
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,870
Yes. How about Chu?

604
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,270
Did you find anyone memorable?

605
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,500
I think...

606
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,770
Because the first scene was Yi Gao,

607
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,110
because Yi Gao...

608
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,210
He has a great figure!

609
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,080
Yes, because he looked skinny,

610
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,010
but then the camera cut to him jumping in the water

611
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,710
and he's actually really built.

612
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,380
Peng Peng, did you notice anyone?

613
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,720
Well...

614
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,460
Guei looked really cool.

615
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,420
I didn’t expect him to have a fear of heights. So cute.

616
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,360
There's a contrast.

617
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,470
He was about to jump

618
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,200
but then still couldn’t do it.

619
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,070
I think it's cute.

620
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:13,830
(Traditional Yilan cuisine—feast time)

621
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,470
Of course, we have to toast,
(Traditional Yilan cuisine—feast time)

622
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,300
everyone.

623
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,810
-Let's do it.
-Cheers!

624
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,310
Nice to meet you all.

625
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,910
This place is famous.

626
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,250
I've tried this restaurant before.

627
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,180
Shared dishes.

628
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,680
It looks delicious.

629
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,090
It has that nostalgic Taiwanese flavor.

630
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,220
You guys don't mind if

631
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,190
I just use my chopsticks, right?

632
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:37,430
Sure.

633
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,290
(Polite)
Sure.

634
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,260
Go ahead.
(Polite)

635
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,070
Are you still feeling unwell?

636
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,710
No.

637
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,210
It's gone after eating.

638
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,680
I thought it's still swaying.

639
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,980
So was this your goal?

640
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,180
Was the goal to eat this meal?

641
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,480
Of course.

642
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,820
I still feel like we're swaying, too.

643
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,890
A little.

644
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,390
Luckily, I was fine just now.

645
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:10,760
The horizon still feels off.

646
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,930
You mean you're okay now?

647
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,160
Your vision is steady again?

648
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,290
I've been...

649
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,400
Crispy coating.

650
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,630
Made from salted egg.

651
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,490
Yes.

652
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,630
I don't know.

653
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,500
You can't tell?

654
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,400
Yeah.

655
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,570
I thought it was bitter gourd.

656
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,940
I don't like bitter gourd.

657
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,170
It looks like tofu.

658
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:25,970
Look.

659
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,710
Yi Gao must not be used to a lot of these foods.

660
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,860

(A mysterious dish sparks a discussion among the boys)

664
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,280
Yes.

665
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,650
Egg, right?

666
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,150
It's egg.

667
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,600
(Actually, it’s a Yilan specialty—rice cake scraps)

668
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,280
There were so many things I’ve never eaten before.

669
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,950
Just like...

670
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,520
That...

671
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,130
I still don't know

672
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,490
whether it's egg or tofu.

673
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:54,830
So, well...

674
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,060
But it's delicious.

675
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,080
So we're supposed to stick them up there?

676
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,060
There are character boards.

677
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,120
There are eight of them.

678
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,600
So there's a storyline.

679
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,330
(There are 8 roles on the 4 clapperboards, the boys can pick whichever role fits them best)
(The one they're paired with will be their partner in tomorrow's show. First come, first served!)

680
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,030
(The one they're paired with will be their partner in tomorrow's show. First come, first served!)
So there's a storyline.

681
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:18,600
(The one they're paired with will be their partner in tomorrow's show. First come, first served!)

682
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,560
I don't get it.

683
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,130
Does that mean we're missing one person?

684
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,540
"Ice-Cold, Sunny, Domineering CEO..."

685
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,240
What does it even mean, Shota?

686
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,440
"Shota" means...

687
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,370
It's like the one on the left,

688
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:33,760
"Shota" means the cute type.

689
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,040
(Yi Gao can't understand the meaning of each role)
"Shota" means the cute type.

690
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,640
And then, the other one is its contrast.
(Yi Gao can't understand the meaning of each role)

691
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,050
The "Domineering CEO" type is more bossy,
(Yi Gao can't understand the meaning of each role)

692
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,680
like a big man, manly.

693
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:44,470
(The boys are considering each character)

694
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,190
I'll pick this side then.

(Loyal Puppy VS Tsundere)

696
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,360
Loyal Puppy? Isn't that Chris?
(Loyal Puppy VS Tsundere)

697
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:48,780
Then I'll stick mine here.

698

(Loyal Puppy VS Tsundere)
Then I'll stick mine here.

699

How can you pick that?

700
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,360
How can you pick that?

701
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,960
Nice Guy was my first choice.

702
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,560
I hope...

703
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,100
I can be a nice guy in this life.

704
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,850
But I know it's hard.

705
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:02,790
But...

706
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,900
it's good to be a Nice Guy as a role.

707
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,490
What does that mean?

00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,810
It's someone who pretends to be nice to you,

It's someone who pretends to be nice to you,

(Domineering CEO VS Shota)
It's someone who pretends to be nice to you,

714
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,480
but is actually plotting against you.
(Domineering CEO VS Shota)

715
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,350
Two-faced.
(Domineering CEO VS Shota)

716
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,530
Two-faced.

717
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,950
That's not me.

718
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,720
That's not me.

719
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,890
Shota, right?

720
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,260
Shota means the cute type.

721
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,030
Young boy or cute boy.

722
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,530
Yes, he looks like a Shota.

723
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,320
I'm smiling.

724
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:31,930
(Shota)
I'm smiling.

725
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:32,560
(Shota)

726
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,370
Maybe the domineering CEO label suits my personality.

(The reason why Adson chose Domineering CEO)

730

(The reason why Adson chose Domineering CEO)

731
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,080
relatively straightforward when it comes to relationships.
(The reason why Adson chose Domineering CEO)

732
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:44,890
(Your pick will be your roommate tonight)

733
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,140
I feel guilty.

734
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,740
Because I was debating between Tsundere and Ice-Cold.

735
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,760
I didn't expect Chien Yu picked

736
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,590
the contrast of Tsundere, Loyal Puppy.

737
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,660
And I was like, I don't want to be like him,

738
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,380
so I just went with something else on the spot.

739
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,230
So I'll sleep alone?

740
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,680
When I was choosing my roommate,

741
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:19,140
I didn't expect the process to be like this.

742
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:24,070
I couldn't read those Chinese characters at all.

743
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,750
Fumi doesn't like Chien Yu, does he?

744
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,920
He doesn't want to share a room with him.

745
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,020
He doesn't want to be paired with him.

746
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,760
He doesn't want to be paired with him.

747
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,860
Really? Is that what this means?

748
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,560
If I'm the shy type,

749
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,560
and I put my photo up there,
but no one chooses to be next to me,

750
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,960
I'll feel kind of hurt.

751
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,870
That's right.

752
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,700
Right? You'd take it personal.

753
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,270
But did you guys notice a detail?

754
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:43,930
What is it?

755
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,030
I mean, the ones who pick first and the ones who pick after.

756
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,170
It means that those who pick afterward

757
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:48,830
are actually choosing to match with someone.

758
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,110
(The ones who pick afterward are the ones who are really making the choice)
are actually choosing to match with someone.

759
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,130
(The ones who pick afterward are the ones who are really making the choice)

760
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,370
Yeah.
(The ones who pick afterward are the ones who are really making the choice)

761
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:51,580
(The ones who pick afterward are the ones who are really making the choice)

762
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,780
Maybe they feel safe
(The ones who pick afterward are the ones who are really making the choice)

763
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,780
with that person,
(The ones who pick afterward are the ones who are really making the choice)

764
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,180
or they're interested in him or want to know more about him.
(The ones who pick afterward are the ones who are really making the choice)

765
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,620
So Yi Gao may be quite

766
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,590
interested inAdson?

767
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,120
Adson can take care of him.

768
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,720
I think because Yi Gao

769
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,780
is not fluent in Chinese right now,

770
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,260
and his appearance might not fit exactly...

771
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,660
But he's a sturdy Shota.

772
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,730
Yeah.

773
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,970
I think his inner world is similar to that of a Shota.

774
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,200
Yeah, that makes sense.

775
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,470
Because he needs someone to help him.

776
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,370
He's new to Taiwan, unfamiliar with everything,

777
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,710
and needs explanations and protection.

778
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,870
And he's matched with Adson,
the Domineering CEO type.

779
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,010
Adson is perfect for that role.

780
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,480
I think they're so alike.

781
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,550
I mean, their image...

782
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,910
and their looks are quite a match.

783
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,150
So Adson is the domineering CEO,

784
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,990
with Yi Gao, the Shota.

785
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,180
And we've got Pink and Fumi.

786
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,350
Guei picked Chris.

787
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,260
Yes, Guei and Chris.

788
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:35,820
Now that you mention it,

789
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,990
because you have a point,

790
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:37,620
and it's starting

791
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,430
to make sense.

792
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,930
At first, it wasn't clear if the pairings worked.

793
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,060
But once someone actively

794
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,530
picks another person,

795
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,270
there will be some stories.

796
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:45,900
Exactly!

797
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,500
I think our rooms are only on the second floor?

798
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,140
Okay.

799
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,170
So we need to knock first.

800
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,180
-How does this work?
-Pull it.

801
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,410
That was fast?

802
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,310
So we have electronic locks.

803
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,950
Excuse me.

804
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,020
A double bed?

805
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,390
Well, that's expected.

806
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,360
There's a bathtub!

807
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,510
We have to check the rooms out first.

808
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:16,830
How did you get the password in?

809
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,830
I'll show you.

810
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,930
Okay.

811
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,720
Thank you.

812
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,270
This is the password, right?

813
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,610
No, this is good.

814
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,110
Take this.

815
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,580
Sorry.

816
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,610
Take a look around.

817
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,510
One bed.

818
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,490
Which side do you usually sleep on?

819
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:34,850
(Yep, two people are going to share one bed)
Which side do you usually sleep on?

820
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:36,010
This side is for the winner.
(Yep, two people are going to share one bed)

821
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:36,690
This side is for the winner.

822
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,280
Okay.

823
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,720
The winner sleeps here,

824
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,250
and the loser sleeps there, okay?

825
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,090
Okay. Come on.

826
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,820
Paper, scissors, stone.

827
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,890
I win.

828
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:47,990
The winner sleeps here.

829
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,830
Okay, I'll sleep here.

830
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,170
That's so awkward.

831
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,040
They've only known each other for five hours.

832
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,140
Yeah, and now they have to shower and sleep together.

833
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,170
Besides...

834
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,480
the bed is so small.

835
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,580
Yeah, that's so awkward.

836
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,190
Oh, you guys are here.

837
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:06,480
(Chris's walking around, helping others unlock their rooms)
Oh, you guys are here.

838
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,250
Our room is here.
(Chris's walking around, helping others unlock their rooms)

839
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,120
It's like this.
(Chris's walking around, helping others unlock their rooms)

(Chris's walking around, helping others unlock their rooms)

841
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,200
The view is great.

842
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,100
Yeah.

843
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,700
It feels like a honeymoon suite,

844
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,240
-or something like that.
-Yeah.

845
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,770
(You already thought of getting married?)
-or something like that.
-Yeah.

846
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,340
If my room looked like this,
(You already thought of getting married?)

847
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,440
I'd never leave.
(You already thought of getting married?)

848
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:30,900
I'd never leave.

849
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,940
Which side do you prefer?

850
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,610
Or you don't really mind it?

851
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,280
What about you?

852
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,010
Well, I don't mind. I just happened to stand here.

853
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:39,950
I'll take this side then.

854
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,210
This side? Okay, I'll take that side.

855
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,180
Okay. Thanks.

856
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,140
I'm checking out the rooms.

857
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,980
(Chien Yu sleeps alone upstairs)
I'm checking out the rooms.

858
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,290
So, it turns out my room is upstairs.
(Chien Yu sleeps alone upstairs)

859
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,590
Really?
(Chien Yu sleeps alone upstairs)

860
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,990
Is it the best one?

861
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,390
Yeah, it's very fancy, so big.

862
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,390
Really? I'm going to have a look.

863
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,230
Wait, check out our room first.

864
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,160
I want to see your bathroom.

865
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,530
We have a bathtub.

866
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,760
Loyal Puppy's private room.

867
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,900
Hey, it's huge.

868
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,870
Wow, lucky you! You have two beds.

869
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,140
Why?

870
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,640
No one's staying with him.

871
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,970
Chien Yu has two beds to himself.

872
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,440
Hey, you gotta check out our room later!

873
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,540
You need to check ours later.

874
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,950
It's...

875
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,180
so different.

876
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,950
I already tried the bed and it felt so good.

877

881
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,220
I haven't seen your room yet.

882
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,760
Their room...

883
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,060
Loyal Puppy...

884
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:24,560
Thank you.

885
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,460
Loyal Puppy gets a room with two beds.

886

Yi Gao, let's show them our room.

887
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,520
It's a pity that

888
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,270
I haven't met my Tsundere friend.

889
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,590
But it's fun

890
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,270
to sleep alone.

891
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,880
I need to lie down for a sec.

892
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:51,390
Guys, take a look at Yi Gao's and my room.

893
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,020
Are you ready?

894
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,920
No door.

895
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:58,730
That can spice things up.

896
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,960
Oh my gosh.

897
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,540
That can spice things up.

898
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,470
Why is it suddenly so quiet?

899
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,200
Can't find the right words to describe it?

900
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,670
No, it's just that both of them...

901
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,740
are huge.

902
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,540
And he'll kick people.

903
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,710
I might get kicked off the bed.

904
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,780
Our bathroom doesn't have a door.

905
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,310
Do you want to use the bathroom?

906
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,950
Okay, everyone can see it.

907
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,520
Do you want me to close the door for you?

908
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,450
Okay.

909
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,450
I'll just hold it shut for you.

910
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,060
Tell me when you're done.

911
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,930
Then I'll...

912
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,760
open it when you're done.

913
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,730
Everyone can see it from outside.

914
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:35,930
It's horrifying!

915
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,830
How do you feel right now?

916
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,460
Yeah, why did you pick "Loyal Puppy"?

917
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,400
(The reason Chien Yu chose Loyal Puppy)

918
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,670
Actually...
(The reason Chien Yu chose Loyal Puppy)

919
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,970
I just feel like I fit that type.
(The reason Chien Yu chose Loyal Puppy)

920
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,940
Maybe my appearance,
(The reason Chien Yu chose Loyal Puppy)

921
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,110
well, because of my look.
(The reason Chien Yu chose Loyal Puppy)

922
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,950
And I like

923
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,580
listening to people's stories.

924
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,880
So, I think I'm like a puppy.

925
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,720
That's why I picked it.

926
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,590
But I didn't expect my other half was not here.

927
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,090
I think it indeed quite suits you.

928
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,920
Among the eight types,

929
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,060
you fit the "loyal" type.

930
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,060
So I rushed to pick as the first one,

931
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,950
and ended up being alone.

932
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,260
(Alone)
and ended up being alone.

933
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:10,700
(Alone)

934
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:10,870
He actually cares about it.
(Alone)

935
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,170
He actually cares about it.

936
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,100
Yeah, he does.

937
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:14,900
You picked it yourself.

938
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,470
Yeah, we all kind of fit what we picked.

939
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,800
But Pink is also very Sunny.

940
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,410
I think myself as the Loyal Puppy,

941
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,380
Sunny and Nice Guy.

942
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,620
So I picked whichever feels closest to myself.

943
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,450
(Pink was deciding among "Loyal Puppy", "Sunny" and "Nice Guy")
So I picked whichever feels closest to myself.

944
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:24,480
(Pink was deciding among "Loyal Puppy", "Sunny" and "Nice Guy")

945
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,980
But two categories got picked,
(Pink was deciding among "Loyal Puppy", "Sunny" and "Nice Guy")

946
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,180
so I thought, maybe "Sunny" quite fits me.
(Pink was deciding among "Loyal Puppy", "Sunny" and "Nice Guy")

947
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,570
I mean, at the time I thought Chien Yu would go for "Sunny".
(Pink was deciding among "Loyal Puppy", "Sunny" and "Nice Guy")

948
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,320
I mean, at the time I thought Chien Yu would go for "Sunny".

949
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:30,920
Yes, I thought so too.

950
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,320
I thought he suits "Sunny" better.

951
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,450
So I was like,

952
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,650
I'll let him pick first.

953
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,760
I'm going to put my photo up again.

954
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,530
Well,

955
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,190
but I think "Sunny" also suits you quite well.

956
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,530
Look, today you crossed over to the fourth board.

957
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,530
(Pink placed 1st in the physical challenge)

958
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,230
Fourth.
(Pink placed 1st in the physical challenge)

959
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,700
That's our record.
(Pink placed 1st in the physical challenge)

960
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,000
Have you ever thought...

961
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,310
that maybe they'd divide us into pairs of two?

962
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:55,540
Yeah, there were some guesses.

963
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,480
But I thought maybe

964
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,440
there would be like

965
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,280
4 to 4,

966
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,150
or 4, 2 and 2.

967
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,750
I even imagined that on the first day,

968
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,550
everyone would share one big dorm

969
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,340
so we could bond, and later

970
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,220
(Sharing half the bed, so relationship won't break)
so we could bond, and later

971
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,550
we'd split into groups.
(Sharing half the bed, so relationship won't break)

972
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,960
I didn't expect being paired off on day one.
(Sharing half the bed, so relationship won't break)

973
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,220
-Straight up.
-Yeah.
(Sharing half the bed, so relationship won't break)

974
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,960
I always assumed it'd be two people sharing one room.

975
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,630
Really?

976
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,800
Have you thought that I'd be on my own?

977
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,300
No one would assume that.

978
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,800
Chien Yu takes it personally.

979
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,000
He cares about it a lot.

980
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,400
But you're not a snorer, right?

981
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,840
I don't snore,

982
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,570
I don't talk in sleep,

983
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,010
and I hardly kick around.

984
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,480
I'll do it all.

985
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,330
I would probably snatch the cover.

986
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,140
And I have some serious morning grouchiness.

987
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,050
Oh, then can I wake you up?

988
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,620
My morning grouchiness is more like...

989
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,280
Do you smack the alarm clock?

990
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,990
(Guei's revealing he has morning grouchiness)
Do you smack the alarm clock?

991
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,050
No, I mean,
(Guei's revealing he has morning grouchiness)

992
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,020
you can call me,
(Guei's revealing he has morning grouchiness)

993
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,920
but please don't bit me.
(Guei's revealing he has morning grouchiness)

994
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,540
(Guei's revealing he has morning grouchiness)

995
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,620
Bit you?

996
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,220
Bit you or bite you?

997
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,290
It's like shaking.

998
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,360
Don't shake me.

999
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,430
You can do this,

1000
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,370
but not like this.

1001
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,830
-Oh, we can't shake you.
-That's tricky.

1002
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,920
Okay, I see.

1003
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:56,700
I do tend to talk in my sleep,

1004
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:57,800
(Yi Gao will talk in sleep and kick around)

1005
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
and sometimes I will kick...
(Yi Gao will talk in sleep and kick around)

1006
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,170
(Yi Gao will talk in sleep and kick around)

1007
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,310
Kick?
(Yi Gao will talk in sleep and kick around)

1008
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,200
What? Kick?
(Yi Gao will talk in sleep and kick around)

1009
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,510
What? Kick?

1010
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,910
Okay, so, should you...

1011
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,550
kick the other way next time?

1012
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:11,650
I'm afraid I'll sleep under the bed tomorrow.

1013
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,320
By tomorrow morning,

1014
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,420
will you both end up

1015
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,020
wrestling under the bed?

1016
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:20,030
(Playing games to get to know each other better)

1017
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:30,500
Why does he look so relaxed?

1018
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,510
Godzilla?

1019
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,680
It looks ike he's pretty confident.

1020
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,850
The stairs.

1021
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:40,780
Escalator.

1022
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,980
-Okay.
-I got you.

1023
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,160
Oh no.

1024
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,060
The moment he hears a circle, and that's it.

1025
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:53,860
(Feeling guilty)

1026
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,870
He felt guilty.
(Feeling guilty)

1027
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:55,900
(Feeling guilty)

1028
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,700
It turns out to be the moon.
(Feeling guilty)

1029
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,040
I can't even guess it myself.

1030
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,470
It's something you can throw and it comes back.

1031
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,570
Right?

1032
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,940
Frisbee?

1033
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,179
-Earth's surface?
-Gravity?

1034
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:12,110
Banana shaped.

1035
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,110
Boomerang?

1036
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:14,850
No.

1037
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,480
It's not an idiom.

1038
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,650
Pasta?

1039
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:21,290
How did you get it?

1040
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,190
Really?

1041
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,920
(Proud)

1042
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,389
How did you know it was pasta?

1043
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,300
I was going to say...

1044
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,330
this is a shrimp, right?

1045
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:33,560
(Shrimp)
this is a shrimp, right?

1046
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:33,650
(Shrimp)

1047
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,400
Yeah, and I...
(Shrimp)

1048
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,000
Yeah.
(Shrimp)

1049
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,440
(Shrimp)

1050
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,739
Do you know what I was guessing?
(Shrimp)

1051
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:38,810
What?

1052
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,469
Worm in the eye.

1053
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:41,770
That really looks like an eye.

1054
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,110
Because I wanted to draw a plate,

1055
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:45,510
but then realized I couldn't draw one.

1056
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,510
Just draw a fork instead.

1057
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,280
Guei is totally the king of contrast.

1058
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,780
You're smart.

1059
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:55,469
Acting cool and biting the pen cap.

1060
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,080
I think playing game

1061
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,680
is the most fun part.

1062
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,560
Don't laugh.

1063
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,430
Are you that uncertain?

1064
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,300
It's simple. I think you can figure it out instantly.

1065
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,010
Okay.

1066
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,920
What's the answer?

1067
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,490
Convenience store.

1068
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,150
You're confident.

1069
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,620
No hesitation.

1070
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,050
Neat and clean.

1071
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,620
I even highlight it.

1072
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,650
And highlight.

1073
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,620
Come on.

1074
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:33,690
Tomato.

1075
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,800
The point is here.

1076
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,260
This glow...

1077
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,400
But you drew that stem wrong.

1078
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,240
As long as you guessed it, that's cool.

1079
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,670
You are so strict.

1080
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,320
Strict Master is here.

1081
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,010
There's no way they'd give me

1082
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,050
a riddle about finding something.

1083
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,050
(Chien Yu is rummaging around in his room alone)

1084
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:56,930
Maybe...
(Chien Yu is rummaging around in his room alone)

1085
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:57,250
(Chien Yu is rummaging around in his room alone)

1086
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,250
He's looking for a mission
(Chien Yu is rummaging around in his room alone)

1087
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,100
to unlock his number eight.
(Chien Yu is rummaging around in his room alone)

1088
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,890
to unlock his number eight.

1089
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:02,820
His roommate.

1090
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,760
Escape room.

1091
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,790
Is the production team really that scheming?

1092
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,610
I searched all the rooms.

1093
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,460
I pulled up the chair and cushion

1094
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,480
to see if there's any task card there.

1095
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,250
And I pulled the mattress away.

1096
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,380
Then,

1097
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,200
the staff told me,

1098
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,400
"Chien Yu, you can go downstairs now."

1099
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,450
And I was so confused and asked,

1100
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,190
"Is there any hidden mission?"

1101
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:21,750
He said,

1102
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,130
"Nope, you can come down now."

1103
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,150
Today, it seems we don't have much energy for bonding.

1104
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,440
Not today.

1105
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,820
I think just sleeping together is fine.

1106
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,410
I think bonding with Mr. Sandman will be nice.

1107
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,880
I almost fell sleep.

1108
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,830
Hold the door for me, I need to use the toilet.

1109
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,500
This bed is quite small.

1110
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,010
Two boys.

1111
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,380
Yeah, it's small.

1112
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,860
Each of them is about 180 cm tall.

1113
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:58,620
Yeah.

1114
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,880
What do we do?

1115
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,090
We don't have a door.

1116
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:02,940
(No door is a big problem)
We don't have a door.

1117
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,380
(No door is a big problem)

1118
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,720
I think it's not a problem.
(No door is a big problem)

1119
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,850
I think taking shower's alright.

1120
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,280
Anyway...

1121
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,710
It's okay. Anyway, I won't...

1122
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,850
There's a pillow between them.

1123
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,980
A subtle distance.

1124
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,820
Our room is the smallest.

1125
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:26,700
And there's no door in the toilet.

1126
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,250
So...

1127
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,720
I don't know what to do

1128
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,500
if I want to get changed.

1129
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,790
Perhaps I need to get changed in the shower.

1130
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:48,960
To be honest,

1131
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,510
I'm really not good at

1132
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,870
talking nonstop, trying to keep the conversation going.

1133
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,400
I mean, it's like when there's nothing left to say,

1134
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,970
yet somehow, I have to keep the conversation,

1135
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,440
and I jump in randomly.

1136
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,310
Yeah, me neither.

1137
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,370
But they keep telling me to talk.

1138
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,410
And I feel like...

1139
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,280
Are they back in the room to complain?

1140
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,480
"I don't want to keep talking."

1141
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,050
They do have a bestie vibe, though.

1142
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:08,680
Yeah.

1143
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:09,850
It's like we were talking over each other,

1144
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,050
stepping on each other's lines.

1145
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:11,750
They haven't finished yet,

1146
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,220
and if I wanted to say something...

1147
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,420
But if I didn't say anything, they'd keep talking.

1148
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,220
Talking over each other.

1149
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:15,960
Yes, that's true.

1150
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,460
So they have to find a way to keep talking.

1151
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,860
It's so hard.

1152
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,770
And I'm really not used to

1153
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:24,260
stay moving on camera.

1154
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,030
Because before,

1155
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,670
I just did still shoots.

1156
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,220
Just grab the frozen moment.

1157
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:28,870
Pink is...

1158
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:29,280
(Fumi's MBTI is I, and Pink's is E. They end up sharing a room)
Pink is...

1159
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:29,300
(Fumi's MBTI is I, and Pink's is E. They end up sharing a room)

1160
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,180
We have similar traits.
(Fumi's MBTI is I, and Pink's is E. They end up sharing a room)

1161
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:31,200
(Fumi's MBTI is I, and Pink's is E. They end up sharing a room)

1162
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,380
Both of us are
(Fumi's MBTI is I, and Pink's is E. They end up sharing a room)

1163
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:32,400
(Fumi's MBTI is I, and Pink's is E. They end up sharing a room)

1164
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,380
the quiet ones at first.
(Fumi's MBTI is I, and Pink's is E. They end up sharing a room)

1165
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:33,880
the quiet ones at first.

1166
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,420
But...

1167
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,900
that's what MBTI says.

1168
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,260
Sometimes, it's useful to refer to it.

1169
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:38,720
(What does Fumi do that would make you unable to sleep together?)

1170
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,070
If he goes to bed
(What does Fumi do that would make you unable to sleep together?)

1171
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,470
(What does Fumi do that would make you unable to sleep together?)

1172
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,750
without taking a shower today.
(What does Fumi do that would make you unable to sleep together?)

1173
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:43,740
Keep hygiene.

1174
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,340
And change your clothes.

1175
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,170
(So that's why you brought so much luggage?)

1176
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,080
Well, because I'm someone...
(So that's why you brought so much luggage?)

1177
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,960
Well, because I'm someone...

1178
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,990
who tends to overthink and be a bit more careful.

1179
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,710
I like to be prepared for any situation.

1180
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,010
For example, with underwear,

1181
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,460
instead of packing exactly seven pairs for seven days,

1182
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,670
I'll take ten.

1183
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:00,630
Yeah.

1184
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,680
This way,

1185
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,850
if any get wet,

1186
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,390
I'll have extra pairs available.

1187
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,260
(After getting along with each other for a day,
who impressed you the most?)

1188
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,720
Actually,

1189
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,930
Yi Gao and I interact a lot.

1190
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:13,770
In terms of communication,

1191
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,950
he has this

1192
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,890
natural quirky vibe,

1193
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,200
and I think

1194
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,570
that's really cute.

1195
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,450
Actually, the person that impressed me the most was...

1196
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,700
Guei.

1197
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,880
It's because of that boat thing.

1198
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,490
When I first saw it

1199
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,850
I thought,

1200
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,700
"It's so far, how am I going to get on?"

1201
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,740
Then he came over and helped me up.

1202
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,490
Adson.

1203
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,640
He's nice, because he always helps

1204
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,600
translate Chinese for me.

1205
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,320
I also think Chris is cute.

1206
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:45,240
He said he would cook for us.

1207
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,600
So I'm looking forward to it.

1208
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,490
Because I want to eat.

1209
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:55,590
Both Adson and Fumi are mature.

1210
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,550
Other people make me feel that they are younger.

1211
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,940
There's a pillow in the middle.

1212
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,980
They also have a pillow there.

1213
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,160
They are Guei and Chris, right?

1214
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,560
They really did put a pillow in between them.

1215
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,180
Yi Gao's sleeping pose is quite manly.

1216
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,800
Poor guy!

1217
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,610
He's all by himself.

1218
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:53,930
I feel bad for him.

1219
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,800
Geez, he's got enough space to sleep sideways.

1220
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,180
His room is so huge.

1221
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,820
So huge, so empty.

1222
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,160
They slept together on the first day.

1223
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:17,790
Yes.

1224
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,780
So he ended up by himself...

1225
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,310
in such a big room.

1226
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,480
That's how Chien Yu is.

1227
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,440
For him, episode 1 ended on a really sad frame.

1228
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,080
Indeed.

1229
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,210
You guys are mean, laughing at him like that.

1230
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:28,880
Didn't you notice

1231
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,650
there's already a bit of a "couple vibe" going on?

1232
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,350
Really?

1233
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,650
Let's look at it pair by pair.

1234
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,520
Adson is paired with Yi Gao, right?

1235
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,590
And Adson is kind of like he was

1236
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,960
when he jumped into the water.

1237
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,560
He's cool and protective,

1238
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,560
like he'll take care of you and protect you.

1239
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,260
And Yi Gao is like a innocent Shota,

1240
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,190
content with being looked after.

1241
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:44,360
Then we've got Fumi and Pink.

1242
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,700
I think they are

1243
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,470
getting along with each other.

1244
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,770
Really chill and harmonious.

1245
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,340
Yes, they are very harmonious.

1246
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,770
And they feel safe to be together.

1247
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,610
Usually, that kind of pair wouldn't realize it at first,

1248
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,940
thinking they're just friends,

1249
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,180
but then one day, sparks fly.

1250
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,340
Because they've been so natural with each other.

1251
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:01,630
They feel comfortable with each other.

1252
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,080
The point is, when they sleep

1253
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,120
so comfortably in the same room,

1254
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,360
they'll start relying on each other more and more.

1255
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,960
Another pair is Chris and Guei.

1256
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,960
I think they're a good match too.

1257
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,340
They're like the handsome "Husband" type,

1258
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,290
and Chris is like

1259
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:17,260
the super-capable "Wife" type.

1260
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,100
Because he's been running around helping everyone.

1261
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,130
Yeah.

1262
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:21,560
I think there's a lot to watch.

1263
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:24,270
I think Guei and Chris are quite special.

1264
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,040
Because Guei kept talking

1265
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,710
about his own bottom line,

1266
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,210
or his own quirks.

1267
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,950
He's like, "I have morning grouchiness,
please don't shake me when I'm sleeping."

1268
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,650
As if the other person has to wake him.

1269
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,760
I was like, "Does he even plan to wake you up?"

1270
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,050
But now I'm excited to see

1271
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,720
how every time he says stuff like that,

1272
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,190
it might totally get overturned later.

1273
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,290
Yeah, yeah!

1274
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,420
Yeah, he says he doesn't snore

1275
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,490
or talk in his sleep.

1276
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,890
So let's see if it's true.

1277
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:47,630
Yeah!

1278
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,490
Maybe.

1279
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:49,400
Right?

1280
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,160
(Day 2)

1281
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,630
I'm dressed a bit like him.

1282
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,370
Yes, the same color.

1283
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,910
I look more green.

1284
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:00,810
What is this?

1285
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,740
Our script, I guess.

1286
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,620
Script?

1287
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:03,930
(What kind of surprise will the script bring for them?)
Script?

1288
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:04,160
(What kind of surprise will the script bring for them?)

1289
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,190
Wait, so Chien Yu doesn't have to act now?
(What kind of surprise will the script bring for them?)

1290
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:06,310
(What kind of surprise will the script bring for them?)

1291
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:06,750
There are two copies.
(What kind of surprise will the script bring for them?)

1292
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,050
There are two copies.

1293
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:07,450
(There are only three sets of scripts on the table)
There are two copies.

1294
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:08,610
(There are only three sets of scripts on the table)

1295
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:09,850
No, one for each.
(There are only three sets of scripts on the table)

1296
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:12,020
(There are only three sets of scripts on the table)

1297
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,750
What is your practice?

1298
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,000
We're going to practice kissing.

1299
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:20,610
(The boys are paired up in twos, seriously discussing the script)

1300
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:22,930
I think it's funny.

1301
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:24,860
He tilts his chin

1302
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,310
and says,

1303
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,280
"You don't know what you're going to be missing."

1304
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,100
It makes people wonder.

1305
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,330
Chien Yu.

1306
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,030
What's up?

1307
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,720
Chien Yu, who are you going to act with?

1308
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,630
I'm the director today.

1309
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:40,750
I'll lend you mine.

1310
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:41,940
I'm the director today.

1311
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,220
Kiss scene?

1312
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:47,010
(Happy)

1313
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:48,420
Hold on, is that my number eight?
(Happy)

1314
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,040
That's possible.
