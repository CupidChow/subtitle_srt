when Wayne took the photo for you

42

00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,409
our faces were really this close.

191
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,360
My nose almost touched his.

192
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,460
Yeah, really.

193
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,170
But in the video, it didn't look that close.

194
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,300
So in front of the camera,

195
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,800
we should do everything in a more dramatic way.

196
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,370
The angle should be bigger.

197
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,010
[The first audition taught the boys more about how to perform in front of the camera]

198
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,040
Only in this way can it look better and clearer in the video.

199
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,870
So I think we're now back to what

200
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,210
Wayne talked about when he first came.

201
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,240
He told us

202
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,740
we should know more how to work with the camera.

203
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,490
If we can know better about it,

204
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,750
we'll look better in front of the camera.

205
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,420
Before Guei raised his chin,

206
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,010
I thought he was a debt collector.

207
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,870
He was like

208
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,040
he wanted to beat someone up.

209
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,390
Being a bit like a villain.

210
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,430
Then he suddenly raised his chin.

211
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,040
I think the contrast was quite interesting.

212
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,440
Because at first, he seemed like a very, very bad boy,

213
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,800
but when he raised his chin,

214
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,840
he was being sweet and that formed a contrast.

215
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,850
That smile is very important.

216
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,800
Actually, I think that moment is very good.

217
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,360
Yes.

218
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,510
Guei and Chris both realized

219
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,610
the tricky thing about the camera.

220
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,820
But in fact,

221
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,980
I don't think it's as bad as they imagined.

222
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:38,740
Right.

223
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,500
If you ignore everything else and just focus on their legs,

224
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,970
their performances are okay.

225
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,590
Yeah.

226
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,330
Yes, as long as you step on the right spot,

227
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,240
the video can be edited.

228
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,710
The scene of their first meeting...

229
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,730
I think they must have discussed how they should react for a long time.

230
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,430
So it was awkward.

231
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,640
Yes. And the result is that Chris was a bit shy.

232
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:03,360
[Too much rehearsal made Guei and Chris lose the chemistry of their first meeting]

233
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,420
So it felt it was designed to be like that.

234
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,030
And Guei's being like an alpha male

235
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,580
was prearranged.

236
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,360
It didn't felt real enough.

237
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,110
But their opinions are so different...

238
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,310
For example, when they were watching

239
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,050
the last pair's performance,

240
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,250
they had totally different ideas.

241
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,890
Yes, I noticed that.

242
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,110
They are like

243
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,810
"well, you can stop being a couple."

244
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,820
Right.

245
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,160
Are they not suitable for each other?

246
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,870
You supported them.

247
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,830
Yes, you shipped them.

248
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,480
I'm sorry. I'll go home first.

249
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,100
It's okay. It's because they don't know each other well.

250
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,270
Yes, they don't know each other well.

251
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,470
Looks like

252
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,040
it's time to watch the last pair's performance.

253
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,600
Let's see how long

254
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,660
it would take Pink to catch a frisbee.

255
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,860
Let's see how many times he needed to try.

256
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,170
I'll kneel down first.

257
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,200
[Feeling guilty]

258
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,750
No need.

259
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,480
Regret or something.

260
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,220
The Practicing Balance this time really got me very nervous.

261
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,510
And I didn't know what to do.

262
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,500
So you must watch it.

263
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,190
A tragic romance in the rain and the Practicing Balance.

264
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,460
Loyal Puppy and his master.

265
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,190
[Don't know what he's talking about]

266
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,890
What is it?

267
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,360
So many elements in his introduction.

268
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,190
One more time.

269
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,130
Three.

270
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,000
Two.

271
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,480
One.

272
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,670
Sorry.

273
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:09,880
It's okay.

274
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:12,840
Okay.

275
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,740
Keep it flat.

276
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,810
Sorry.

277
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:20,980
Okay, it's going to be far.

278
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,580
Okay.

279
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,680
Get ready.

280
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,520
Almost.

281
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,050
Yes.

282
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,070
Great!

283
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,180
Coming.

284
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,920
This time, catch this disc (sounds like "Come and kiss me").

285
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,650
Like this?

286
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,760
[Practicing Balance]

287
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,710
Pink's shy smile

288
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,210
made me feel that

289
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,910
they were a real couple

290
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,850
having fun together.

291
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,440
In the clip,

292
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,910
were you already a couple?

293
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,780
No.

294
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,890
My setting is

295
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,330
that I've got feelings for him.

296
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,170
So I'm not sure

297
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,330
what he meant by that.

298
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,320
So when he really did that,

299
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,810
I was shocked.

300
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,960
But I think this gesture is good.

301
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:39,840
It feels like

302
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,620
you didn't know how to express it

303
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,330
and you didn't know whether he really meant it.

304
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:43,870
But

305
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,540
you couldn't just go and kiss him.

306
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,040
So you used that gesture

307
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,070
and then you two were both awkward.

308
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,910
It seemed you two both

309
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,580
were hiding your feelings

310
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,710
for each other.

311
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,330
It's love.

312
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,460
Kind of love.

313
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,880
I like them all.

314
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,150
But my favorite

315
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,710
is Fumi and Pink.

316
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,130
Because their clip

317
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,130
is like a Japanese drama.

318
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,840
And

319
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,000
when you did this,

320
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,110
there was no sound.

321
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,310
And...

322
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,280
I felt it, you know?

323
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,450
It was romantic and beautiful.

324
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,280
That scene was romantic and beautiful.

325
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,720
And it was raining, right?

326
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,850
Yes.

327
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,280
I said our story was a tragic romance in the rain.

328
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,530
Really?

329
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,770
You made this title yourself.

330
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,130
You said it was because

331
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,620
Pink was very tired from catching the frisbees.

332
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:37,070
[Felt exhausted]

333
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,010
That was really tiring.

334
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,130
I saw that

335
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,460
the third time you threw the frisbee,

336
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,880
he really went quite far.

337
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,230
That frisbee went crooked.

338
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,780
It formed a right angle.

339
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,280
But I think that part...

340
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,380
Yes, I like it best.

341
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,380
It's very natural.

342
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,940
That's why he told him to get ready to catch it.

343
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,760
Every one of us

344
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,780
has seen the part each of us took.

345
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,060
Do you want to have any particular part

346
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,320
you would like to try?

347
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,110
I have one.

348
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,380
[The parts the boys want to try]

349
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,180
I want to try

350
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,070
Wayne's part.

351
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,230
Because I think it's super weird.

352
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,550
I thought you were going to tell me

353
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,580
it's because Chien Yu was lonely sleeping alone.

354
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,610
No, it's because...

355
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,020
Don't you think

356
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,040
a passerby...

357
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,180
And over there.

358
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,730
He knew what you were doing.

359
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
So he did the same movement as yours on purpose

360
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,290
and deliberately created a chance to meet you.

361
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,730
He created

362
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
that chance for himself

363
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,800
to meet you.

364
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,310
-A love encounter.
-Yes.

365
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,540
A prearranged love encounter.

366
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,890
I think the role he played is kind of a schemer.

367
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,930
Yes, kind of.

368
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,050
So I want to

369
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,220
try it.

370
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,770
I actually want to try Adson's part.

371
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,230
I have very few experiences

372
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,530
[Shy boy]

373
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,620
of playing that kind of roles.

374
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,860
I'm often assigned

375
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,560
to a role as a shy boy.

376
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,210
-You also want to play an aggressive character.
-Yes.

377
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,060
-I want to try it. 
-To make a breakthrough.

378
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,420
I want to have a breakthrough by playing an aggressive character.

379
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,560
I thought you caught too many frisbees and wanted to take a shower.

380
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,590
If I get a part like that,

381
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,200
I'll take a shower.

382
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,230
I want to switch with Adson

383
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,340
because I want to see him grovelling on the ground.

384
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,500
He didn't want to get a new partner

385
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,080
but he wanted to switch roles.

386
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,290
This feels like he's trying to take revenge.

387
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,450
Everyone is so cute.

388
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,290
So the last pair

389
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,720
is also very cute, I think.

390
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,460
The kiss?

391
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,550
That's a lot of feelings.

392
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,150
The most impressive thing is that he used his hand...

393
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,990
Fumi did this

394
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,120
and asked him if he asked for a kiss like this.

395
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:33,030
But during this process,

396
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,630
his eyes were fixed on Pink.

397
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,580
I think it was great.

398
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,980
I think the reason why

399
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,040
they had such chemistry

400
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,790
may be that they are roommates.

401
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,650
And they really often

402
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,120
chat in their room.

403
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:55,560
Sleeping in the same room helps the boys cultivate good chemistry]

404
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,780
And they're like friends.

405
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,890
So if my friend

406
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,650
suddenly does that to me,

407
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,990
just like what they did in the video,

408
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,820
I'll really want to know what will happen next.

409
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,090
-Right.
-Because it's a beginning of a love story.

410
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,410
This is the beginning of a romance,

411
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,170
but there might be

412
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,400
some difficulties or something.

413
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,560
There's a lot of room for imagination.

414
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:04,990
Yes.

415
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,370
After watching all those videos,

416
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,530
which one do you think is the most impressive?

417
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,730
I still think Adson and his partner

418
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,730
are really good.

419
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,550
They have good teamwork.

420
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,780
Yes, their clip was relaxing and cute.

421
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,560
And they were relaxed.

422
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:17,990
Yeah, it felt natural.

423
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,210
And I think the video of Adson and his partner

424
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,040
was totally different from my expectation.

425
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,320
I didn't expect Yi to be so cute.

426
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,850
Yeah.

427
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,650
I didn't expect Adson to be so funny.

428
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:27,820
Yeah.

429
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,790
I'm surprised that he could be that funny.

430
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,890
He's like silly male lead

431
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,230
in the old comic books

432
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,260
who thinks he himself is very handsome.

433
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,700
They looked great together.

434
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,300
Yeah.

435
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,180
Yeah, their interaction and chemistry are good.

436
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,570
Yeah, now we're going to match them.

437
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,900
One for each.

438
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,430
Of course, there are only seven boys now.

439
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:47,180
[Auntie Squad's ideal CPs after watching their first performances]

440
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:45,970
Poom, do you have

441
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,410
your favorite pair?

442
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,330
The one I just saw

443
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,200
is the one I like at first.

444
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,510
Adson and Yi are good.

445
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,420
Adson and Yi.

446
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,100
But there's another person I think is very interesting.

447
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,220
Pink.

448
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,590
Because his gaze

449
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,150
and his reaction at that time

450
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,810
really showed he had fallen in love.

451
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,150
So I like Pink.

452
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,970
Okay, so Poom

453
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,260
picked Pink and Fumi's pair, right?

454
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,600
But do you think

455
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,520
they should split up

456
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,520
or still be a couple?

457
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,250
I actually want Pink to get a new partner.

458
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,350
He wants Pink to get a new partner.

459
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,220
I want to see what will happen if he's with another boy.

460
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,060
He agrees.

461
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,530
Okay, a Pink's photo on your side.

462
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,800
Who and who do you think should be matched together?

463
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,820
I think

464
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,850
Guei and Chris must be separated.

465
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,390
They must be separated.

466
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,110
They must be separated. There's no doubt.

467
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,240
Right.

468
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,470
Give Guei's photo to me first.

469
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,630
Let me think who he should be matched with later.

470
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,730
Yeah, let’s see who he should be matched with.

471
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,460
-Definitely can't be Chris.
-I'll give you Chris's photo.

472
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,870
I think Pink can be matched with Chris.

473
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,610
-Okay, let them have a try.
-I think it'll work.

474
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,420
Right? Because there's a height difference between them.

475
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,200
I'll put him on the right.

476
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,250
Why? Is there a difference?

477
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,000
Yes, the left and the right are different.

478
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,170
Really?

479
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,880
What do you mean?

480
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,329
Usually, we want the left one to be the top.

481
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,800
And the right one to be the bottom.

482
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:12,960
Really?

483
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,089
Yes, but this is just the position I want, either way is fine.

484
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:15,839
I see.

485
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,030
Yes.

486
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,880
Okay, who should Guei be matched with?

487
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,950
How about Long?

488
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,280
Will that be weird?

489
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:23,540
No.

490
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,829
Because he has a mind of his own.

491
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,130
While Adson is quite experienced

492
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,450
and older.

493
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,430
Will he be more likely to listen to Long more?

494
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,160
I think so.

495
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,660
I just feel that if they're a couple,

496
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,130
they may not quarrel much.

497
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,980
Yeah.

498
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,680
Our main goal is to get a couple not to quarrel much.

499
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,770
Adson is his senior,

500
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,960
so maybe they'll get along well.

501
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,780
Yeah, he can give him some advice on acting.

502
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,420
Okay. Yi is very lively.

503
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,600
Don't let Chien Yu be alone.

504
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,210
I see.

505
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,020
Okay, how about Chien Yu?

506
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,670
Who should he be matched with?

507
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,920
If we don't want Chien Yu to be alone, we can find him

508
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,560
a boy who is gentle

509
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,290
and who can take the initiative and let him know his feelings.

510
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,610
Judging from their figures, Yi is more suitable.

511
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,110
Considering the figures...

512
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,230
And Yi is a bit like a boss.

513
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,030
Okay, let him be matched with Yi.

514
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,320
He can have a partner who is very different from his last one.

515
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,550
Maybe in the next episode,

516
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,840
the couples will be like these.

517
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,360
Maybe we'll be perfectly right.

518
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:25,080
[Couples predicted by Auntie Squad. Fumi will be alone]

519
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,150
Because I think

520
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,780
we now know them better and better.

521
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,060
So I think Adson and Guei

522
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,830
have a great chance.

523
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,530
I think it's possible.

524
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,570
And I really want to see them working together.

525
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,470
[Who are you sleeping with tonight?]

526
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,970
Okay.

527
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,940
Here comes the most exciting part again.

[Boys can choose their partners to sleep with tonight.]

They're all blank this time.

530
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,890
You're right.

531
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,480
I have a suggestion.

532
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,850
What do you think?

533
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,930
I think...

534
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:40,990
Let the older ones choose first?

535
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,450
On the contrary,

536
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,460
I think we should let the youngest one choose first.

538
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,390
Let the youngest one choose first.

You can't choose anyone right now.

540
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,030
Right. Can I choose the room first?

541
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,350
Can I?

542
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,100
I don't think you can.

543
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,320
Okay.

544
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,100
But he's the first one but he only gets to put up his photo first,

545
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,460
-he can't choose anyone.
-Right.

546
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,050
The second one is...

547
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,680
Should I go second?

548
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,300
Then I'll just do it randomly.

549
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,150
Shouldn't you think about whether you'll...

550
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,580
[Chien Yu spent last night alone but still chose to wait to be chosen.]

551
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,910
Don't you think about whether you'll be chosen?

552
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:12,970
It's okay.

553
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,890
-You look unhappy.
-It's okay.

554
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,980
I think it's my turn now.

555
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,310
Yes, your turn.

556
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,270
Choose Chris.

00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,530
Wait.

560
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,300
It's a pity we made a mistake.

561
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,810
[Just matched]

562
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,410
[Happy]

563
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,060
I'll go down first.

564
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,360
I told Pink that

565
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,530
I was really touched

566
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,430
that he picked me.

567
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,260
My heart felt warm.

568
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,690
Because from the first day to now,

569
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,600
Pink was surprisingly like a boss.

570
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,280
Be careful.

571
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,630
I think you won't get a room today.

572
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,440
I'll sleep here tonight.

573
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,330
No, at least you got it.

574
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,790
It won't like that you missed all the frisbees.

575
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,250
I'll put it here.

576
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,090
Okay.

577
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,080
The one who's not chosen will be alone.

578
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,860
Just like me yesterday.

579
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,790
[Guei and Adson haven't made a choice yet.]

580
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,480
Go.

581
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,470
You know, I thought

582
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,460
you would wipe that one and then put it on another place.

583
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,640
That would be very funny.

584
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,340
He has many...

585
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,140
Because we're the last ones, he and I had many to choose from.

586
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,640
And in the end,

587
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,790
he stuck his next to mine,

588
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,920
I was a little surprised.

589
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,590
I thought...

590
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,820
I didn't expect him to choose to be with me.

591
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,760
Maybe tomorrow...

592
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,320
We don't know what we'll act tomorrow

593
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,120
but we'll sleep in the same room.

594
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,330
Okay, the last one, Adson.

595
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,490
The one who chooses last seems to have the hardest choice to make.

596
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:04,940
[The last one, Adson, who will he choose?]

597
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,890
I gave myself a hard choice to make.

598
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,180
It's okay

599
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:08,040
if you let me sleep alone.

600
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,850
-Are you sure? 
-This is also a sort of emotional blackmail.

601
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,580
It's okay. I can sleep alone. Really.

602
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,270
No pressure.

603
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,720
I can sleep alone.

604
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,690
Will he sleep with Yi again?

605
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,570
Or should I...

606
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,620
What?

607
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,190
-That's the show.
-Come on.

608
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,420
How could you do this to us?

609
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,080
Yes.

610
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,270
Who did Adson choose?

611
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,450
And our predictions are wrong.

612
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,040
I thought we would be right.

613
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,010
All our predictions are wrong.

614
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,920
After Pink picked first,

615
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,410
[Auntie Squad's match predictions are all wrong]

616
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,330
these two predictions...

617
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,760
But you're right about one thing.

618
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,910
Pink can also be like a boss.

619
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,040
He was so manly just now.

620
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,670
Because he knew Chien Yu had spent one night alone...

621
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:48,720
It's a huge bonus.

622
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,850
So manly.

623
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,210
That really earned him bonus points.

624
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,780
We matched them like this

625
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,340
based on our thoughts

626
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,420
about whose image is suitable for whom.

627
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,190
Yeah.

628
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:00,380
Yeah, we weren't thinking who really wanted to sleep with whom.

629
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,690
-Right.
-Indeed.

630
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,550
We were thinking about their cooperation.

631
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,120
Yes.

632
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,750
We were thinking how the two of them

633
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,250
could form a contrast in the acting.

634
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,620
But who will Adson choose in the end?

635
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,260
Yi and Chris are the only ones left. Right?

636
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,200
Yi and Chris.

637
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,150
Who will he let spend the night alone? That's what we should think about.

638
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,060
It's cruel, isn't it?

639
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,530
How about we vote?

640
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,310
Okay.

641
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,620
Let's vote.

642
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,480
Will he choose the one he's already spent the night with

643
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,600
or the one he's never slept with?

644
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,630
Why does it sound so strange?

645
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,110
If Yi gets to be alone at last, he will think

646
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,450
whether it's because he...

647
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,430
They acted together and they spent the night together,

648
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,220
but he now leaves...

649
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,230
Let's vote.

650
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:46,280
[1 vote]

651
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,180
Chris.

652
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,490
You think it's Chris.

653
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,250
Adson and Chris.

654
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,640
I think it'll be Chris too.

655
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,950
[2 votes]

656
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,840
[3 votes]

657
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,030
I think it's Chris too.

658
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,900
But I also like Adson and Yi.

659
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:56,060
[3 votes 2 votes]

660
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,600
I choose Yi.

661
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,070
Three votes, and two votes.

662
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,800
Now some of us stand with Yi, and the others with Chris.

663
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,590
So you want him to pick his previous partner.

664
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,420
Yes, the previous one.

665
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,470
So we three want him to get a new partner.

666
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,880
The new partner.

667
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,400
Yes, we want to see a new pair.

668
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,240
I knew it.

669
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,360
I'll give you freedom.

670
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,270
Okay.

671
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,940
Are you not satisfied with his acting today

672
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,310
so you let him sleep alone?

673
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,380
I think

674
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,320
I want to try something new.

675
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,880
New partner and new experience.

676
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,640
[Brand new pairs now. What activities will the boys have tomorrow?]

677
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,760
So Yi will sleep alone tonight.

678
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,940
No one will hear what I'll say when I'm in a dream.

679
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,940
I'm so touched that you chose me.

680
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:35,870
Really?

681
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,100
You're the first one.

682
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,760
I think we're the first new pair.

683
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,550
Yeah.

684
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,680
I'm really touched.

685
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,850
Isn't this handshake too formal?

686
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,150
He was alone yesterday.

687
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,340
And since the first day,

688
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,220
I've had good impressions of him.

689
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,280
He's strong.

690
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,970
But he's gentle.

691
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,480
He's very attentive.

692
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,000
I think he is so different.

693
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,100
He's my...

694
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,170
If I can

695
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,210
choose by myself,

696
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,880
he's one

697
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,790
of the boys I want to choose most.

698
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,730
Did you say you wanted to switch rooms?

699
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,250
-No.
-No?

700
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,950
I always said I wanted this room.

701
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,120
You just said this room.

702
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,950
But you said you wanted to be alone.

703
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,650
This is like a quarrel between a couple.

704
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,750
I feel like I'm the third one

705
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,590
who gets involved in their relationship.

706
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,290
No...

707
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,520
They're still fighting

708
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,750
They're really...

709
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,380
Okay, let's be serious.

710
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,110
Pack your stuff and you...

711
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,360
[A quarrel between the two. So it's because someone wants to switch rooms.]

712
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,100
Why do I feel like I'm a homeless man?

713
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,930
I feel I'm being kicked out.

714
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,270
It's like I couldn't pay the rent after the lease expired.

715
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,060
I'm really happy.

716
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,380
You mean staying away from me?

717
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,940
No. I don't need to switch rooms.

718
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,510
Don’t make it sound like I’m such a person.

719
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,380
When I was with Fumi today, I felt

720
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:48,460
[Why did you choose to sleep with Fumi?]

721
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:45,980
it was great.

722
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,980
Because on the first day,

723
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,020
I could feel that he was very attentive.

724
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,120
I think...

725
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,860
maybe during the rehearsal,

726
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,760
I can know more about that...

727
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,580
if he put his attentiveness into this script,

728
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,630
it might

729
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,500
bring more to it.

730
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,310
Actually, I have a good impression of Adson.

731
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,950
Because he...

732
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,510
It's not because he likes to have fun with me.

733
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,340
It's because he'll use his experience

734
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,150
to tell us and teach us something.

735
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,460
And he also makes us laugh at some parts.

736
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,020
I think he's quite humorous.

737
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,930
Why did I zoom myself?

738
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,390
This group is cute.

739
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,010
They're actually cute.

740
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,460
Okay, that's it.

741
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,660
In fact, if you think about them,

742
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,290
they really match each other.

743
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,140
Yeah.

744
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,730
I'd want to watch this BL drama.

745
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,290
No one knows what they're doing.

746
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,160
I want to delete it.

747
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,400
Chris is a nice guy.

748
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:41,000
I think I'd like to know more about him.

749
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:41,920
[At the last moment, he chose to sleep with Chris. ]

750
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,050
Otherwise, I'll keep joking with him.

751
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,750
Joking aside,

752
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,890
but actually...

753
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,500
I still want to know more about him.

754
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,940
Being alone.

755
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,980
It feels free to be oneself right now.

756
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,380
I think sleeping alone

757
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,750
is good.

758
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,540
And...

759
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,730
Today...

760
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,600
Today, the one who slept alone

761
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,220
has got a coach or teacher

762
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,300
[Yi looks forward to performing with professional actors together.]

763
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,840
who could film with him, right?

764
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,660
So I think

765
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,590
if I have the same opportunity tomorrow,

766
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,570
I can learn a lot.

767
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:38,590
[A room with no door in the bathroom belongs to Chris and Adson tonight.]

768
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,970
It belongs to Chris and Adson tonight.

769
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,950
They didn't put the pillow.

770
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,230
[Pink and Chien Yu's room]

771
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,820
It seems that nobody puts the pillow now.

772
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:50,920
[Fumi and Guei's room]

773
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,150
Yes, there is.

774
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,400
But it's flat.

775
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,040
[Even with the lights off, each room is buzzing with conversation.]

776
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,110
Since people vomited on the first today,

777
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,520
they also chose once they came.

778
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,590
It was awkward to enter the room on the first day.

779
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,620
Now embarrassment is completely gone.

780
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,390
People are very familiar with each other.

781
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,330
Yeah, and the atmosphere is good.

782
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,940
[The next day, boys sleep together. The sense of distance from the first day disappeared.]

783
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,220
But I think

784
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,160
you just mentioned a key point that

785
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,060
Adson and Chris are a good couple partner.

786
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,430
Exactly, I didn't think about it just now.

787
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,760
But when you put them together,

788
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,670
I suddenly feel this looks great.

789
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,600
Because they are

790
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,560
[The boss and his young secretary]

791
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,000
the youngest and the oldest among them. Ten years' difference.

792
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,020
And...

793
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,640
And Chris is that kind...

794
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,940
You'll feel though he is young,

795
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,970
he is not very obedient.

796
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:32,120
I think his character can be a little willful

797
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,770
-and rebellious. -Yeah.

798
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,120
So if it's based on the plot development now,

799
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,540
there is some subtlety between him and Guei.

800
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,320
Yes, even when he was moving out,

801
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,890
[Happy Enemy]

802
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,520
they were still arguing.

803
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,880
Because Fumi is with that one.

804
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,530
Fumi shares a room with Guei.

805
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,200
And Chris is stuck in the middle.

806
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,950
He's been stuck between Fumi and him the whole time.

807
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,250
The subtlety!

808
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,060
So cute.

809
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,810
I think maybe Chien Yu and Pink.

810
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,580
They get along well.

811
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,570
They were chatting lively with each other when the lights were off.

812
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,850
Of course they get along well.

813
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:05,470
[My muscular boy]

814
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,880
Because the moment Pink chose him,

815
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,610
the feelings had already started to heat up.

816
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,010
Yes, the feeling has become more intense.

817
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,210
So they'll definitely do well.

818
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,750
I think Pink's image has completely reversed from

819
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,820
what he originally looked like in my opinion.

820
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,290
Yes.

821
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,730
I kind of fell in love with him.

822
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,780
So manly.

823
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,430
He's really macho and aggressive.

824
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,930
And he's nice and considerate.

825
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,600
Yeah.

826
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,590
He can think of a lot of details.

827
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,760
I think Chien Yu is a talkative person.

828
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,870
And

829
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:29,090
when Pink and Fumi were taking a rest together,

830
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,760
it seems that they didn't talk that much.

831
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,420
But when I saw him with Chien Yu,

832
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,330
I think they got along well.

833
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,120
That's right. I think an important point is that,

834
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,940
besides being warm as we just found

835
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,010
Pink was behind the scenes,

836
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,300
it's also important to be an actor.

837
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,240
Because he can

838
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,100
display his shyness at the very beginning,

839
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,800
but at some moment, he can become very manly.

840
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,350
It just feels like he's got a lot of potential for flexibility.

841
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,640
Yes, he's got high flexibility.

842
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,960
Yeah, so he can master a lot.

843
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,250
I'm looking forward to his future development in different directions.

844
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,140
Really.

845
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:06,520
[Day 3: A Great Day for Motorcycle Trip.]

846
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,230
It looks like we're riding a motorcycle.

847
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,240
Are we going by ourselves?

848
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
Can I take a car?

849
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:21,240
Besides, there are only three motorcycle.

850
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,670
Who wants to walk?

851
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:25,270
[There are only three motorbikes.]

852
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,920
No. The one who lives alone.

853
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,590
You'll need to walk.

854
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,460
You'll need to walk.

855
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:26,990
Me?

856
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,320
You'll need more exercise.

857
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,210
Okay.

858
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,760
A fierce battle!

859
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,490
[They found something.]

860
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,880
Is someone coming?

861
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,110
Is this our friend?

862
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,620
Yes, the eighth member.

863
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:39,830
The eighth one?

864
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:40,560
Really?

865
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,620
Really? The fourth motorbike.

866
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,160
Hello.

867
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,810
I'm the eighth member.

868
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,850
The eighth member?

869
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:51,990
Yes, I'm Robert.

870
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,660
He's very famous,

871
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,290
because he has taken some really good photoshoots.

872
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,420
I watched them all.

873
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,590
[Robert: 1.75 meters, 75 kilograms, Aries,  Fitness KOL]

Hello, I’m Robert Hung.

875
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,100
Everyone calls me Robert.

876
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,810
I enjoy spending time in nature.

877
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,780
Going to the beach, and climbing a mountain.

878
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,040
I think at first, I'd try to

879
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,440
blend in with everyone.

880
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,480
And then I'll see what's the personality of everyone.

881
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,260
I hope I can be the actor who can become whatever he plays.

882
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:16,080
I won't reject any roles.

883
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,270
Because every character is a soul.

884
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:21,240
What I can't accept includes: snoring.

885
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,890
[What're the things you can't tolerate when dealing with boys?]

886
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,030
No odor under armpits.

887
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,920
Because I have a sense of cleanliness personally.

888
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,170
One more important thing is that

889
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,430
nasal hair needs to be trimmed.

890
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,320
Because many boys don't trim their nasal hair.

891
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,630
I want to know more about Robert

892
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,860
because we don't seem familiar with you.

893
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,840
How do you know he's older?

00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,370
I'm only 23.

895
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,700
Maybe he's 20.

896
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,030
Okay, he looks quite younger.

897
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,890
I think we should introduce ourselves first.

898
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,450
Because he doesn't know us at all.

899
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,310
OK, I’m 23.

900
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,430

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,020
No, you're 40.

927
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,610
Your turn.

928
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,680
My name is Yi, 25.

929
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,900
Yi, 25.

930
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,190
So it's you who are taking us to

931
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,240
have an adventure in Yi Lan today?

932
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,960
Follow the navigation. I don't where to go either.

933
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,930
But we don't have navigation.

934
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,280
I know I'll give him a ride.

935
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,830
But you have navigation, right?

936
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:46,820
We'll go with you.

937
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,050
So you have...

938
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:52,050
Wait. The point is who'll ride the motorbike.

939
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:53,570
[What unexpected pairings will occur if the boys decide to ride with each other themselves?]

940
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,080
Or I ride?

941
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,240
You'll ride.

942
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,830
Let's go.

943
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:55,550
Come on.

944
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,590
Ready.

945
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,480
Okay!

946
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,090
So passionate.

947
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,960
This is how you go to Yi Lan.

948
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,180
You need to play like this.

949
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,870
Why is someone alone?

950
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,260
Their navigations are different.

951
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:33,430
[Boys split into two groups. The journey to Yi Lan for exploration.]

952
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:46,280
[Robert, Yi]

953
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,330
Actually, I don't really remember their names.

954
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,450
I only heard them once.

955
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,100
OK.

956
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,250
I know you are Yi.

957
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,540
Yes.

958
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,960
I know them.

959
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:54,240
It's really hard because it's all Chinese.

960
00:32:53,650 --> 00:33:02,920
[Yi introduces every boy to Robert with enthusiasm.]

961
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,510
I think they seem to be a good match.

962
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,200
He is Adson.

963
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,010
Adson.

964
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,420
The one in front is Chris.

965
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,110
Chris.

966
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:09,490
[Chris, Adson]

967
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:03,680
Yes.

968
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,470
Chris.

969
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,240
Did you see where we are going?

970
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,110
Yes.

971
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,980
Adson is at the back seat.

972
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,180
Yes, how could this happen?

973
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,960
How could it be?

974
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,830
They are such a contrast.

975
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,980
What's this called? A younger aggressor?

976
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,940
Because the noise is very loud.

977
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,160
Did you check the location just now? The destination?

978
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,390
Where is the destination?

979
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,220
It seems to be a farm.

980
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,110
A farm?

981
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:35,100
We're dressed as if we're going to a club for dance today.

982
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,560
[Farm]

[High-end Shirt]

985
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,340
We're going to dance with animals.

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,740
[Guei X Fumi]

987
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,960
Do you come to Yi Lan for fun very often?

988
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:44,440
No, only two or three times.

989
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:55,920
[Fumi takes the initiative and starts to talk to Guei.]

990
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,330
I often visited there with my university classmate.

991
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:52,010
It's close to come here from the Shuang Bei.

992
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,730
So we often made plans,

993
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,820
directly decided to visit Yi Lan for holidays,

994
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,430
and we'd play for two days and one night, like this.

995
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,500
It's really comfortable to relax here.

996
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,020
Yeah. And there are really so many people on weekends.

997
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,220
Every time, as long as it was

998
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,800
Sunday night, and it was time to travel back,

999
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,659
once we got to the highway, there'd be a huge traffic jam.

1000
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,949
The traffic could be so bad that we could only get home when it was very late.

1001
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:17,699
Pink X Chien Yu.

1002
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,830
I saw the keyword, "Shrimp's Town".

1003
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,340
So it's about shrimps?

1004
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,530
Really? I love shrimps so much.

1005
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,139
When I was a small boy, I used to

1006
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:21,440
fish shrimps with my dad at the shrimp ponds.

1007
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,270
Really?

1008
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,440
Yes, but I grew up and became busy, so not so often anymore.

1009
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:32,860
[Pink becomes talkative unexpectedly because of the topic of fishing shrimps.]

1010
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:25,739
But I still go with my friends sometimes.

1011
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,010
I love Thai shrimps a lot.

1012
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,310
I've never fished shrimps before.

1013
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,010
Really?

1014
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:29,710
Really.

1015
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,830
I think fishing shrimps is fun.

1016
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,020
I'll need to ask you how to fish them later.

1017
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:35,210
But I haven't been fishing them for a long time, so I wonder if...

1018
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,190
It's okay. We'll see later

1019
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,550
if your skills have declined.

1020
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,190
OK.

1021
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:40,570
There are truly unexpected top and bottom pairings.

1022
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,100
Because Pink rides a motorcycle,

1023
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,179
and Chris also rides a motorcycle,

1024
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,699
these are all beyond our expectations.

1025
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,389
We've been riding for so long, but there's still half an hour to go.

1026
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,960
There's a car behind us.

1027
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:54,949
There's a car behind us.

1028
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,929
Why such a long time!

1029
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,780
So cute.

1030
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,750
So funny.

1031
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,960
I don't what they're already doing right now,

1032
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,420
but we're still riding.

1033
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,820
Darn it.

1034
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,800
Let's go.

1035
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,580
[The shrimp fishing team got the rods and is ready to start fishing for shrimp!]

1036
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,120
Go! Go! Go!

1037
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,650
I didn't expect the rod to be so light.

1038
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,060
Sure, it's not heavy.

1039
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,730
It's quite light.

1040
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,440
I tried my uncle's fishing rod for fish once. It's heavy.

1041
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,750
Fishing rod for fish can be heavy.

1042
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,970
The shrimp rod is light while fish is heavy.

1043
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:22,670
The weight is different.

1044
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,200
Yes.

1045
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,140
Would you like to teach me?

1046
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,640
Because I don't know how to fish shrimps at all.

1047
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,710
And I've never fished shrimps.

1048
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,240
You need to be careful with

1049
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,190
the hook, bending it up.

1050
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,480
Check how warm Pink is.

1051
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,380
OK. Any hook can be okay?

1052
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,980
No. You have to pick both up.

1053
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,580
Okay.

1054
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,250
Yes, be careful.

1055
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,050
Take it off and then?

1056
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,760
Then you need to pinch it.

1057
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,590
Pinch the other side and pinch the two hooks.

1058
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,090
Hold it. Hold it.

1059
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,660
Don't get yourself caught. Grab the front.

1060
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,250
Okay.

1061
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,120
Then turn.

1062
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,360
[Pink teaches Chien Yu carefully.]

1063
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,990
You are rotating the line, not the rod.

1064
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,850
Should I remove both hooks or remove one?

1065
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,960
Yes, both of them should be removed.

1066
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,780
[Look at the gesture. A veteran.]

1067
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,300
Just remove it.

1068
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,470
Because it seems to be a double hook.

1069
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,680
You'll need to smooth out the line later.

1070
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,080
Because the shrimp is not big,

1071
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:15,220
[Pink: Guei is teaching shrimp fishing.]

1072
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,780
you won't have to cut it too big.

1073
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,380
If you do so, they'll later eat for a very long time.

1074
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,150
Shrimps don't have big mouths,

1075
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,750
so we don't need to use such big baits.

1076
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,420
They can't bite them firmly if it's big.

1077
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,950
Because we just need them to bite the bait for food

1078
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,590
and get hooked.

1079
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,630
Yes.

1080
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,240
So we can use any bait?

1081
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,570
Actually, we normally use...

1082
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,150
You can use your skin too.

1083
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,420
Yes, it's just the taste that matters.

1084
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,580
[Do shrimps eat human?]

1085
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:24,950
Then you hook it.

1086
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,040
Some fishy smell, that'll be right then.

1087
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,890
Yes, hook first.

1088
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,850
Take a small piece.

1089
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,870
Chien Yu, did you say that you want a competition?

1090
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,360
Yes, because I want to say that

1091
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,020
teaching comes first

1092
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,400
because Fumi and I have never fished shrimps.

1093
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,890
Let’s start with a teaching session in two groups first.

1094
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,010
[Fumi is still fighting with the fish line.]

1095
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,830
Because I dislike fishing very much.

1096
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:45,180
I'd think I'm so impatient.

1097
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,470
Then you take this with one hand, and this with the other.

1098
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,600
Then just throw it out?

1099
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,760
Do I need to stand up?

1100
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,080
What does this physical contact mean?

1101
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,310
[At a loss]

He wants to demonstrate.

1103
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,490
Like this?

1104
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,680
Okay, that's it.

1105
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,640
Is it moving?

If it's like this, I will slightly...

1107

1108
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,200
Just lure it a bit.

1109
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,340
Ok, so do I need to lure it a bit?

1110
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,270
A little.

1111
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:07,870
OK.

1112
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,040
It will run if you shake it too much.

1113
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:11,930
I'm cross-eyed after staring.

1114
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,120
Is this normal?

[Pink is immersed in fishing. He can't hear a sound from the outside world.]

and my parents,

we'd often go fishing shrimps at the shrimp farm.

1119
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,830
I haven't been fishing for a long time.

1120
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,500
Then I came back to the shrimp farm today.

1121
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:31,350
I was very happy during that period of time.

1122

Yes, almost.

Okay. If you think it's time, then stand up and pull it.

I thought we are fishing together.

1130
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,580
Shouldn't we start together since it's a competition?

1131
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,650
Aren't we just teaching first?

1132
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,010
Not yet. Teaching time first.

1133

This one doesn't count.

Yeah, but we...

We look like a joke here.

1154

No, I feel like we're the boss here.

1155
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:06,400
I think I'm here to entertain the crops.

1156
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,740
Sanxing scallions are also called "four-season scallion,"

1157
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,800
so that means we can harvest them all year round.

1158
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,170
I see. I understand what you mean.

Don't be afraid of getting your hands dirty.

1162

When you pull it out, there's soil on it.

1163
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:24,210
You can slightly knock it on the straw

1164
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,260
and knock off the soil.

1165
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,930
Will we have gloves?

1166
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:29,940
No.

Not necessary, I feel it's easy.

or just go straight to a team competition?

I knew they would compete.

If you need any help...

1286
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,480
No problem.

1287
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,690
Come on up!

1288
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,650
Yes!

1289
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,080
Why does it fly so far every time?

1290
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,160
I feel sorry for all his shrimps.

1291
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:01,790
I'm sorry.

1292
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,670
Shrimp, I'm sorry.

1293
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:05,910
No, I can't lose.

1294
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,020
[Calm and steady, just to catch shrimps]

1295
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,630
Come on.

1296
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:10,380
I'll compete with the genius fisher.

1297
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,080
The two of us rookies will see who catches one first.

1298
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,160
Showdown.

1299
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:16,320
Come on.

1300
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,420
[Fujian Team] [Guei-Pink Team]

1301
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,670
How many do you have now?

1302
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,410
Four.

1303
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,590
I have three now.

1304
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,990
[Another round of showdown
with a change of position]

1305
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,380
The third one. Silently.

1306
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,520
Yes, catching up slowly.

1307
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,750
Yeah.

1308
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,650
Because that's the shrimp cave.

1309
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:30,550
Shrimp Cave?

1310
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,260
Yes, there seems to be a lot over there.

1311
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:33,990
Yeah.

1312
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,430
Go.

1313
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,550
[Pink and Guei are sitting closer and closer]

1314
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,930
It's okay. We're all beginners.

1315
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,270
Yi.

1316
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,560
Roger and Chris,

1317
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,920
[The new partner's name is Robert]

1318
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,120
we'll need to fill this cart with the scallions we pull.

1319
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,690
I think we'll need to pull all of them out.

1320
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,810
At least we'll need to get all of them on this side, I feel.

1321
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:53,580
Should I put it in first?

1322
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:55,460
No way, are you sure we follow this way?

1323
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,410
I think you're going this way.

1324
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,910
I think you...

1325
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,610
I think you should go...

1326
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:05,220
[When Adson are Chris are struggling with moving the scallions, Robert had already completed the task.]

1327
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,790
No, I think you can go this way,

1328
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,660
and we'll pass it.

1329
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,120
Because I am afraid you'll...

1330
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,530
Then it'll be full soon.

1331
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,300
Yes.

1332
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:14,120
Okay. Come on. Gently put them down.

1333
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:16,530
Yi, be careful. Your feet are already stuck.

1334
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,030
Put it down well.

1335
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,140
Come on.

1336
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,090
Adson cares about Yi very much.

1337
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,990
In fact, this is...

1338
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:27,470
Will we get paid like this?

1339
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,130
Where is the boss?

1340
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,200
I'm the boss.

1341
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,380
You need to finish all this row, and then this side's too.

1342
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,260
[Mr. Adson is online.]

1343
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,720
What about the salary per hour?

1344
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,820
Hourly pay will depend on your performance.

1345
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,310
We're great.

1346
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:39,790
It'll will be great.

1347
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,710
Being a boss myself.

1348
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:44,860
It needs to be pushed back.

1349
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,130
Back the car.

1350
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:48,500
Yes.

1351
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,550
We're really not suitable for this place.

1352
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,710
[Two impractical people.]

1353
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:56,970
Our outfits are not suitable.

1354
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,930
Be careful, okay?

1355
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,420
You can pull it.

1356
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:01,550
Okay, I'll do this.

1357
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,200
I'll push it forward like this.

1358
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,030
Why is Adson pushing?

1359
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,020
Adson really takes good care of everyone.

1360
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:14,720
Yeah.

1361
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,910
It's really hard.

1362
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:19,130
Okay, Roger.

1363
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:20,600
So, my turn?

1364
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:21,530
I think...

1365
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:23,620
Because it's your first day,

1366
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:26,040
I think you can show yourself off.

1367
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,040
Really?

1368
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:29,140
It's not that heavy.

1369
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:30,570
No, I did it on purpose just now.

1370
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:31,810
He just dissed you directly.

1371
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:32,780
Yes.

1372
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,310
I did this on purpose for program effect.

1373
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,310
So good.

1374
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:38,560
Poom, this is our Yi Lan's famous local speciality.

1375
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:41,950
Yes, we have very enjoyable shrimping fishing and scallion harvesting.

1376
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:44,620
There are also shrimps fishing in Thailand.

1377
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:46,630
[Through the boys' experience, let's introduce everyone the beauty of Yi Lan.]

1378
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:47,100
I want to know what's special about the scallion.

1379
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:49,870
It's mainly because of Yi Lan's climate.

1380
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:52,550
Its soil and its development.

1381
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:53,340
It is very delicious.

1382
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,400
Yes, so the scallions we harvest

1383
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,730
are very fragrant and sweet.

1384
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,100
If you add them into different dishes, wow.

1385
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:01,370
Wait, can I go to Yi Lan right now?

1386
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:02,690
As I'm talking, I feel I want to eat it so much.

1387
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:04,470
Let's just drive to Yi Lan directly.

1388
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,380
But do think the activities of shrimp fishing and scallion collecting

1389
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,640
have triggered some changes

1390
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,180
to their combinations?

1391
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,330
I think the shrimps's side is quite obvious,

1392
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,620
because they happened to match with one who are good at fishing it,

1393
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,820
while the other one can't do it.

1394
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,590
So they can teach each other.

1395
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,820
I can feel Pink is really

1396
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,930
very considerate and manly.

1397
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,610
[The shrimp fishing trip shows Pink’s considerate and attentive side.]

1398
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:23,530
Yeah, really.

1399
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,530
He is really a surprise.

1400
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:27,260
I think what's interesting is

1401
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,530
Chris and Adson.

1402
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:33,080
Because I feel Chris specifically displays

1403
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:34,940
his quite childish side

1404
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:36,170
in front of Long.

1405
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,890
[In front of Adson, Chris can show his capricious side.]

1406
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,340
His childish face, right?

1407
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:38,410
I think if they don't know each other well,

1408
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:40,010
he can't show that side of his personality.

1409
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:41,080
It's quite natural.

1410
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,110
But our eighth member showed up.

1411
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:44,170
Robert!

1412
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:45,660
He's finally out.

1413
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,180
I think he's quite generous.

1414
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:50,020
He fits in perfectly without any sense of discord.

1415
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,920
He quickly blended in with everyone.

1416
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,960
Yeah, but Robert came in,

1417
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,390
he is the dominant one.

1418
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:57,750
So this just balances everything out.

1419
00:46:56,110 --> 00:47:01,120
[The relationship between boys changes.]

1420
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,160
So I’m curious

1421
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:00,830
what their pairings will look like in the future.

1422
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:02,470
And you may have noticed one point just now.

1423
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:05,830
Yi and Adson have separated already,

1424
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,650
but when he put scallion,

1425
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,350
Adson'd still take care of him somehow, right?

1426
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:12,890
And when Robert came in,

1427
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:18,450
[Adson and Yi's interaction has caught Auntie Squad's attention.]

1428
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:15,300
when he introduced himself to everyone,

1429
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,950
Adson was still

1430
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,910
giving some hints to Yi.

1431
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,050
Yes, I noticed that.

1432
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,090
They naturally had some physical contact. Yes.

1433
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,390
Now he and Yi and Chris,

1434
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:27,560
I feel they all have chemistry with each other.

1435
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,800
They're all cute.

1436
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:30,850
But I'm looking forward to enjoying what kind of chemistry

1437
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,710
Robert and Yi can create together.

1438
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,470
I'm looking forward to it as well.

1439
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,360
The next episode will definitely be more exciting!
