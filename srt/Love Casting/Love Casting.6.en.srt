00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,550
How could you squeeze?

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,960
My butt hurts.

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,260
I've been kneeling so long

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,830
that I can't feel my knees.

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,010
I'll give you a very good gift tonight.

9
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,570
I've found two massagists.

00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,280
[Love Casting]

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,250
I still can't forget

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,110
the scene of them being massaged.

[Auntie Squad: Aben]

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,580
That's right. They know what we want to watch.

[Auntie Squad: Niki, Queen of BL]

16
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,560

[Auntie Squad: Qiao Qiao, Kimi Hsia]

00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,490
[Auntie Squad: Chu, Ernie Chu]

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,300
They saw each other half-naked.

21
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,880
They also slept together,

22
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,340
and they massaged each other.

23
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,890
They also told each other their feelings for each other.

24
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,570
What will happen next?

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,940
If the two actors have gotten along like this,

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,200
it means, normally, they've been filming together for three months.

27
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,680
Chu, have you ever had this kind of experiences?

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,200
You'll get closer and closer to each other, right?

29
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,420
Yes.

30
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,180
As time goes by, we'll get closer.

31
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,250
And then you'll start dating?

32
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,420
Will you gradually become a couple in real life?

33
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,150
I think people will fantasize that

34
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,270
the gay couple or straight couple in a drama

35
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,840
may become a couple in real life.

36
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,970
A real couple.

37
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,150
I guess they may be together. Will they fall in love with each other?

38
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,310
If they're in the characters, they will.

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,990
[Actors need to have true feelings when acting.]

40
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,330
If they're in the characters, they will?

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:31,890
Yes.

42
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,380
Because if you spend days together,

43
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,039
you'll start to kind of take care of him in real life.

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,580
Maybe you'll have more body contact.

45
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:46,000
[When actors stay together for a long time, they'll be closer and they'll fool around together.]

46
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,910
Because when they become really close,

47
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,320
they'll fool around and hug,

48
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,990
or do something else. It's normal.

49
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,220
So, Poom.

50
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,610
Have you ever had the experience

51
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,090
that you and another actor had been working together for a long time,

52
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,910
and you started to care more about each other,

53
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,720
and then you frequently checked his IG,

54
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,220
making sure, for example, if he had eaten or not?

55
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,470
I would ask him some questions.

56
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,660
If we are filming together, I would ask.

57
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,190
I asked almost everyone of the cast and crew

58
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,660
questions like "Have you eaten?"

59
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,220
"How was yesterday?''

60
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,740
We will pay much attention to

61
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,430
whether the actors have any contact after their show is completed.

62
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,550
The Thai actors

63
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,410
are actually very close to each other.

64
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:27,650
[Fans pay attention to the contact in real life between actors who are a couple in a show.]

65
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,230
So Thai BL actors are known for their off-screen contact.

66
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,730
Yes, because people will notice and discuss

67
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,750
whether they are wearing the same rings.

68
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,950
They may also discuss

69
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,400
whether they wore the same hat

70
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,829
or the same T-shirt.

71
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,370
If they are seen at the same place in a similar time,

72
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,390
they will wonder

73
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,730
if they're having a secret date.

74
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,690
Yes.

75
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,430
So in this episode,

76
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,360
Auntie Squad

77
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,930
will see which couple become closer after they massaged each other.

78
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,500
But I think the producers will split the couples.

79
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,140
It's time to do that now.

80
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,890
[The interactions between boys are spontaneous, not prearranged.]

81
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,340
No.

82
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,570
Right.

83
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,280
When we start to really love them, they're going to split them.

84
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,380
Let's watch.

85
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,980
Time to eat.

86
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,480
Smells good.

87
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,220
I want to have tomato sauce.

88
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,350
Me too.

89
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,190
I want this.

90
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,990
I want to have tomato sauce.

91
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,320
No, it's his.

92
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,460
Can we decide by rock, paper, scissors?

93
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,490
It's so nice to eat after a massage.

94
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,330
Rock, paper, scissors.

95
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,060
You two lost.

96

Let's go.

97
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,170
Let's have pesto sauce.

98
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,810
If I have that, I'll...

99
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,710
Actually, I'll feel nauseous if I have cream sauce.

100
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,980
Let's eat with etiquette.

101
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,010
Etiquette.

102
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,780
Only you have that.

103
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:32,510
[Bath towel]

104
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,810
We should eat with etiquette.

105
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,950
Is that a bath towel?

106
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,020
Bath towel.

107
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,079
What does he mean by that?

108
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,920
Adson.

109
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,420
He doesn't want his white suit to be stained.

110
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,760
Then don't wear anything white.

111
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,190
What's that?

112
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,350
How was the massage?

113
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,860
You share with us first.

114
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,160
We want to know your feeling because you didn't make any sound.

115
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,100
[It matches him so well.]

116
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,570
Because Chien Yu is like a rock.

117
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,970
Well, he was doing the massage casually.

118
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,170
How did he do the massage?

119
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,900
And he used that...

120
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,640
Come on. Let's have a quarrel. A long-distance one.

121
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,810
You go first.

122
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,230
[Robert and Chien Yu are quarreling again.]

123
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,910
He gave me a very comfortable massage.

124
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,240
I also gave him a nice one.

125
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,160
The person who got the massage didn't say it was comfortable.

126
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,700
Well, he rubbed me with his nails.

127
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,350
Well, that was an accident.

128
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,680
And he used very little oil.

129
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,140
My arm hair was shaved off.

130
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,779
You know, my arms were burnt. It hurt so much.

131
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,740
I didn't dare to talk.

132
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,340
Yours is not sunburn. Mine is sunburn.

133
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,630
Look, I have some too.

134
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,660
[Embarrassed]

135
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,850
I really have some.

136
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,610
Actually, he wasn't doing massage. He was removing hair.

137
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,910
Yes.

138
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,970
Removing hair? Then I should have charged more for that.

139
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,780
[The Little World of the Two]

140
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,580
We're talking here.

141
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,650
We're not talking. We're just eating.

142
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,620
Fumi has been in his own little world for four days.

143
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,360
You're right. You're always in your own world.

144
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,890
Fumi and Yi's small world.

145
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,790
Everyone felt comfortable.

146
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,710
Very comfortable.

147
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:50,860
After eating,

148
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,390
I think I'll fall asleep when doing the next activity.

149
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,900
Almost done.

150
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,590
After the massage, our muscles are relaxed. I feel full after eating.

151
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,659
And then I'll feel sleepy.

152
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,120
Let me see if I can come up with a joke to tell.

153
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,590
Okay.

154
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,510
Time for jokes. One for each.

155
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,540
[Adson's bath towel is in Yi's hand.]

156
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,460
We will just laugh.

157
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,600
It's okay. It doesn't matter if the joke is not funny.

158
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,700
We'll grade each joke.

159
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,250
I'll go first.

160
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,140
Because my joke hardly makes people laugh. Let me go first.

161
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,450
Okay.

162
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,820
If it's not funny, have some soup.

163
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,000
Okay.

164
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,640
Is having soup a punishment?

165
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,620
The corn soup?

166
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,660
No, I just don't want to waste food.

167
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,550
[If the joke is not funny, the one who told it will have a bowl of corn soup as a punishment.]

168
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,390
Okay.

169
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,830
I love this joke very much.

170
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,760
But I've told it many times,

171
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,040
[Eating is the most important.]

172
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,410
but people's reactions to it are very different.

173
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,400
One day in the deep sea,

174
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,130
a fish met a big fish.

175
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,909
The small fish said to the big fish,

176
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,000
"What kind of fish do you like to eat?"

177
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,220
Then the big fish said,

178
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,670
"I like eating fish that speak slowly and quietly."

179
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,650
Then the small fish said, "Oh, yeah."

180
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,930
Why did you spoil my joke?

181
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:52,340
You have the soup first.

182
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,610
You have the soup first.

183
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,460
Let me tell one joke, but it's a bit...

184
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,030
You have the soup first.

185
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,130
You can't. You need to have two.

186
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,630
I just had the soup.

187
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,330
You are so bad.

188
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,230
I really hate people who spoil jokes.

189
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,700
Yes, I really hate people who spoil jokes too.

190
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,300
I heard that. It's a very old joke.

191
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,470
No, I didn't even see everyone's reaction to it.

192
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,040
You're going to pretend you haven't heard it.

193
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,270
Yes.

194
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,440
-What? 
-Yes.

195
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,170
I'm sorry.

196
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,730
[The one who spoils the joke must be punished.]

197
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,480
Be respectful.

198
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,580
I'm sorry.

199
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,210
It was an accident.

200
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,250
He's serving you.

201
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,370
Well, isn't he going to tell a joke next?

202
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,970
You tell the joke. Tell it while having the soup.

203
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,140
Finish the soup first.

204
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,950
Okay, and then tell the joke.

205
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,670
But my joke is a little dirty.

206
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,350
It doesn't matter.

207
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,940
It it's too dirty, it will be edited out.

208
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,820
Okay.

209
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,580
Okay, everyone is waiting for you.

210
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,330
Okay.

211
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,970
One day,

212
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,850
Ming was playing on a swing.

213
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,070
Then Mei suddenly walked over.

214
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,970
She said, "Ming, you know what?

215
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,940
The teacher said if boys often wank,

216
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,570
their hands will turn dark easily.

217
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,110
Let me check your hand."

218
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,430
[Chien Yu, Chien Yu]

219
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,750
Why are they suddenly calling Chien Yu?

220
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,140
Robert likes to tease Chien Yu.

221
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,659
[Trying to clarify]

222
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,390
I really didn't expect

223
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,990
it was white here.

224
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,980
I laughed because of Pink's laughter.

225
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,260
He's always like that.

226
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,630
He didn't even finish.

227
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,820
But he won.

228
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,460
Does he need to have the soup, Chien Yu?

229
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,050
He should be punished. That is bullying.

230
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,460
I should have the soup now?

231
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,400
Yes, what you did is bullying.

232
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,350
I think Robert should tell a joke next.

233
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,210
I haven't come up with one.

234
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,530
You brought it up.

235
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,450
Two of us have told jokes. How come you still haven't got one?

236
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,420
I have one, but it's not a joke.

237
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,660
It's a real story, not altered at all.

238
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:29,950
It's funny, isn't it?

239
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,170
It's quite funny.

240
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,580
If we don't laugh, you'll still need to have the soup.

241
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,890
Okay, well...

242
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,070
Shall I continue with this bowl?

243
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,630
No, you haven't finished it.

244
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,470
Finish this bowl?

245
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:37,960
Yes.

246
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,650
Shouldn't we fill it up every time and take turns to have it.

247
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,650
We all have it from the same cup?

248
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,370
Yes.

249
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,000
Drink it yourself. The same cup.

250
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,170
[A big pot of corn soup. Not everyone can get to tell a joke.]

251
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,070
A serving bowl.

252
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,620
You want to knock on the cup?

253
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,850
You finished it?

254
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,409
[Thinking for a long time]

255
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,840
Are you ready?

256
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,050
He just took a glance.

257
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,840
You know in Hsinchu... I'm from Hsinchu.

258
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,030
There are many snack shops on the street.

259
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,840
Meat ball soup is sold in the snack shop.

260
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,510
But the story is about the fish balls.

261
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,290
One day, we went to eat in the shop

262
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,300
and there was a girl who was sitting in front of us,

263
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,790
eating alone there.

264
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,260
She had ordered a bowl of fish ball soup.

265
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,410
In her fish ball soup,

266
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,750
[Not getting to the point yet?]

267
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,100
there were three fish balls.

268
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,660
When she was about to eat the first one,

269
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,840
it accidentally fell onto the table.

270
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,790
Then, when she was to eat the second one,

271
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,210
it fell again.

272
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,409
Then she only had one fish ball left.

273
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,669
I could see that she was being very careful,

274
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,080
picking up the fish ball with her chopsticks.

275
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,960
She was clamping the fish ball very carefully.

276
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,100
Then it fell when the fish ball was going to be put into her mouth.

277
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,310
The funny part is that the shop owner saw it

278
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,610
so she took another several fish balls

279
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,750
to the girl.

280
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,510
Then the shop owner...

281
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,790
What happened?

282
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,150
I don't know. He just laughed.

283
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,670
[Pink has got Robert the corn soup.]

284
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,690
He's already preparing the soup for him.

285
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,640
The shop owner was serving that...

286
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,270
Finish the story first.

287
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,190
She needed to use the big spoon to get the girl

288
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,240
the fish balls.

289
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,410
Then...

290
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,660
Okay, stop laughing. Finish the story first.

291
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,970
And the fish balls fell again.

292
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,970
[End of the story]

293
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,570
The story is like what happened to me yesterday. I even cried for it.

294
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,470
What?

295
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,880
So the girl didn't get to eat fish balls in the end.

296
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,590
So the shop owner also dropped the fish balls.

297
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,450
Okay, that's all.

298
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,080
I think the funny part of his story is

299
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,370
that no one understood what he said.

300
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,070
You can think what it was like in your head.

301
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,160
It's so hard. I don't understand.

302
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,450
Is this hot and sour soup?

303
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,700
How about I tell you another joke?

304
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,200
One more.

305
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,960
This is the funniest.

306
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,990
Have the soup.

307
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,420
What?

308
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,800
Well, let me tell you.

80 percent of boys' parties

are like this.

312
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,880
The conversations are not meaningful at all.

319
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,580
one boy asked another,

320

"How are you? Have you had enough?"

321
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,580
The boy would say, "No, I'm not full yet. Who's full now?

322
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,930
Let's have more.

when you're having a party with your male friends?

333
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,080
Like you said, we'll just be chatting,

334

talking about something meaningless.

We say whatever we want to.

But the point here is,

342
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,400
they can have fun like this.

343
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,070

367
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,820
Let's watch the videos

368
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,440
we filmed this morning.

369
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,340
There's a misunderstanding,

370
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,060
heart-breaking moments, and an affair in them.

371
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,180
Three elements.

372
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,880
I want to see the heart-broken moments.

373
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,380
Because it feels like a very sad story.

374
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,820
It's okay. We don't need to...

375
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,350
It's okay. Let it be the first.

376
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,190
Okay.

377
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,050
Let's see the heart-broken story first.

378
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:57,650
I agree.

379
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:06,060
[Previously]

380
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,940
I'm like a heart-broken puppy.

381
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,430
You can see what it was like for me to be a heart-broken puppy.

382
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,360
[Heart-broken]

383
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,070
What are you doing?

384
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,960
What are you doing?

385
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,380
What are you doing?

386
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,050
Can you do me a favor?

387
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,690
Sure.

388
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,310
Give this to Fumi for me.

389
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,390
If I were you,

390
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,090
I would definitely go.

391
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:57,950
Please.

392
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,450
Okay.

393
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,680
What's wrong?

394
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,630
What are you doing?

395
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,620
I'm wondering when we can

396
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,190
hang out together again.

397
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,030
I have something for you.

398
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,450
What?

399
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:54,620
This.

400
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,210
Great.

401
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,460
I always hoped we could take a step further.

402
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,520
No.

403
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,460
It's not me.

404
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,500
I've liked you for a long time.

405
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,680
Can we be together?

406
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,160
(I'm sorry...)

407
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,190
[Silence]

408
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,210
So terrible.

409
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,890
No, it's great.

410
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,520
Not bad.

411
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,680
You all did a great job.

412
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,480
I think you had very complicated feelings.

413
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,280
You did well when you opened the door.

414
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,750
I can see that

415
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,520
you were facing a dilemma.

416
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,050
Not bad.

417
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,790
Not bad.

418
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,600
Thank you for saying this. Thank you.

419
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,700
Thank you.

420
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,730
I think that Fumi's acting gave me a feeling

421
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,320
that you really had an experience like that before.

422
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,100
Because you showed your shock at first,

423
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,160
and in the end you got what you wanted.

424
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,290
I just think, oh, it's amazing.

425
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,880
Your crying scene was really…

426
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,750
I was too tired from crying yesterday. So I'm not able to cry today.

427
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,090
Otherwise, I would have been crying.

428
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,890
No need.

429
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,110
Great. I think it is wonderful.

430
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,440
But compared to our performances from

431
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,880
the first day or the second day here,

432
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,720
the second day, yes.

433
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,860
Compared to our performances from that time,

434
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,310
I think everyone has improved a lot.

435
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,010
Yes.

436
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:07,650
[The boys are getting used to showing their emotions in front of the camera]

437
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,450
I think we are more proficient in working

438
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,700
with the camera,

439
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,580
and we can control our emotions better now.

440
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,060
And I think we have more tacit cooperation now.

441
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,500
Yes, because today's dramas

442
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,790
are more difficult

443
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,810
than the ones from last time.

444
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:20,020
I think because we had classes yesterday,

445
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,120
we were mentally...

446
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,050
We had expectations.

447
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,990
Everyone showed their own things.

448
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,220
Yeah.

449
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,720
Because yesterday's acting classes

450
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,630
were really inspiring.

451
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,930
They went deep into my heart.

452
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,850
Especially

453
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,020
your roles were characters who were a little sad.

454
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,740
So you used what you learned yesterday

455
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,740
into your acting today.

456
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,930
But I heard that you didn't have to cry.

457
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,050
But you cried.

458
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:51,810
I don't know.

459
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,320
Maybe the feelings just came and I cried.

460
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,630
He really cried because he looked at me like this.

461
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,450
[Yi and Adson are having a private conversation again]

462
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,520
Did you cry a lot?

463
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,790
Or just once?

464
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,359
I cried twice.

465
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:11,329
[Chris's crying scene]

466
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,170
Have you done that before?

467
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,609
No, it's my first time acting in a crying scene.

468
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,490
I haven't done the crying scene either.

469
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,920
Well, I have.

470
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,420
But it was a rather big challenge this time.

471
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:19,490
There was a shift.

472
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,839
I was nervous.

473
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:23,690
And I had complicated feelings.

474
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:29,320
I had expectations, disappointment, and then I let it go.

475
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,630
I think there were too many emotions in it.

476
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,640
It's like seeing my child grow up.

477
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,930
It's only been three days.

478
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,520
Yes, only three days.

479
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,760
Their states are very different.

480
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,880
Although that was short,

481
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,270
I felt touched

482
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,750
by their emotions.

483
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,670
Qiao Qiao, whose acting do you like, among them three's?

484
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,780
I think Chris's

485
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,250
is not as bad as he thought.

486
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,950
He said it was terrible after watching it himself.

487
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,950
No.

488
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,920
Don't be too harsh on yourself.

489
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,480
Because there'll be edits.

490
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,160
Actually,

491
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,670
I like his gaze when...

492
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,660
I think it was when Yi turned around and said sorry to him,

493
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,160
and he had that gaze.

494
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,270
He didn't shed tears. But the tears were in his eyes.

495
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,000
Actually, I think that gaze is the best.

496
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,300
Sometimes, you don't have to shed tears.

497
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,270
When the tears were in his eyes and not shed,

498
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,600
his gaze was even sadder.

499
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,800
That was great.

500
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,780
After watching a sad scene,

501
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,310
we'll see a misunderstanding.

502
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,880
Is it a sad misunderstanding?

503
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,450
Is the next one about a misunderstanding?

504
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,950
It can be a misunderstanding.

505
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,700
Sure.

506
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,750
It's about a misunderstanding.

507
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,620
It's just a misunderstanding.

508
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,860
Just a misunderstanding, okay?

509
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,320
I dare not watch.

510
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,230

played by Chien Yu and me.

519
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,570
I was beaten badly in the drama.

558

it's gone.

559

I think it's gone.

560

You're welcome.

You should apply some medicine later.

565
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,260
Okay.

566
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,240
Good. That's good.

567

Bravo!

568

It's a story of a hero saving a beauty. Great.

569
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,900
Was I the beauty?

570
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,750
Is there still a caterpillar on you?

571
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,580
I was the beauty.

572
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,220
Kevin removed it.

573
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,020
A caterpillar.

574
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,450
What is the babe?

575
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,650
It's a misunderstanding.

576
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,790
I found that he is the best person who can make you be like this.

577
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,390
Yeah, his acting can touch you.

578
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,130
Why is it a baby?

579
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,730
Baby, I want to treat him as my little baby.

580
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,500
And I have to say

581
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,970
his anger had a big influence on me.

582
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,020
[Robert's little baby]

583
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,970
I don't know. Maybe it's because it was too hot.

584
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:06,940
Too hot?

585
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,500
He was really angry.

586
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,810
So when he rushed over,

587
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,640
he pulled me here,

588
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,610
and let me stand behind him,

589
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,850
at that moment,

590
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,200
I really felt flustered when you ran towards me.

591
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,570
He said it directly in front of everyone.

592
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,590
He's a very honest person. He's an extrovert.

593
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,630
He's so cute.

594
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,360
Keep looking.

595
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,190
Okay.

596
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,190
The story is a funny one.

597
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,760
And I think it is funny because Kevin...

598
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,180
I told him,

599
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,850
"Kevin, it’s okay if you hit me hard."

600
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,740
Otherwise, I don’t think I can do that.

601
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,940
So he really hit me hard.

602
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,420
Looks like he did it really hard.

603
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,180
Yes, because he was afraid he would get me injured,

604
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,380
he hit me gently at first.

605
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,910
Then I said to him, "it's okay. You can just hit me really hard."

606
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,510
Otherwise, I think my reaction would be fake.

607
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,380
Because I can’t do that.

608
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,990
And I said, "Kevin, don’t worry."

609
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:58,060
[To make it look real, Kevin's every hit is really hard.]

610
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,950
He really did it like this.

611
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,800
Then my body turned red.

612
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,050
So it wasn't sunburn. It was bruise.

613
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,370
He hit me really hard. Really really hard.

614
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,030
Is there anything you want to share, Yi?

615
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,930
Well, I said he ran fast.

616
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,490
[New view]

617
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,230
I think the scene of hitting him is really difficult.

618
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,700
The angle was adjusted many times.

619
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,200
I did it at least 30 times.

620
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,700
So the last time you were the most angry.

621
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,280
I was quite angry except for the first two times.

622
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,540
But I ran to him many times and I felt hot.

623
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,510
The weather helped me

624
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,260
A blue vein showed here.

625
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,880
You looked very angry.

626
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,750
You looked cool when you did it.

627
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,050
You had a very angry look on your face.

628
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,130
I saw him punching him and then standing there.

629
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,120
And it ended there.

630
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,250
Yes, that's it.

631
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,480
That's it.

632
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,710
I really like this one.

633
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,860
It's funny.

634
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,360
It’s surprisingly interesting.

635
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,100
Thank you, Kevin.

636
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,900
Thank him for playing that part.

637
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,340
And he tumbled 20 or 30 times.

638
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,380
But

639
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,230
every time he was on the camera, he was so cool.

640
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,620
But I think...

641
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,130
When he was about to be hit...

642
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,330
When he was about to get hit and turn back, he was like...

643
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,140
He was so cool.

644
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,380
He came from Hong Kong for this. It's worth it.

645
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,800
He looked super cool.

646
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,630
The story was ridiculous when I saw it at first.

647
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,890
Yeah.

648
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,560
And people would think

649
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,100
it's a romantic comedy

650
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,530
and then watch it.

651
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,730
And in the end, you saw

652
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,290
[It's All the Caterpillar's Fault attracted Queen of BL with its twist.]

653
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,230
Kevin's smile.

654
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,200
Yes.

655
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,470
It felt like he knew his job was over and he was about to fly away.

656
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,470
The other two...

657
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,410
I think after they caught the caterpillar,

658
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,440
they way they looked at each other made me feel there was chemistry between them.

659
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,250
Yes, I remember Robert's line.

660
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,520
He said, "You'd better put on your clothes first."

661
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,150
That was a very good job he did.

662
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,420
He was really awkward and too shy to look at him.

663
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,890
So he asked him to put on his clothes.

664
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,260
Chien Yu was really shy.

665
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,290
He was so shy that

666
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:44,160
he didn't even realize the shooting was over

667
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,800
His arm and foot went in line.

668
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,330
But I think he did one thing very well.

669
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,270
That is, he's frank to everyone.

670
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,170
He said openly that he was a little flustered.

671
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:55,910
Yeah.

672

Poom, when you were filming,

673
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,080
did you ever had a moment of being very flustered and kind of falling in love?

674
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,020
Yes.

675
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,280
When I was filming, I thought I was the character.

676
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,610
I looked at my partner and I would think he's cute.

677
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,090
But I really like that scene.

678
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,010
I didn't expect it to be like this.

679
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,640
They make me feel shy.

Especially when he took off his clothes and found it was a misunderstanding.

681

He looked at him like this.

682
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,470

00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,860
Yeah.

738
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,030
And I think Pink...

739
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,300
We could already feel the connection in his eyes

740
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,710
during the acting process.

741
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:27,130
But the one who surprised me the most is Guei.

742
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,430
I've never seen Guei

743
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,760
have such a gentle expression

744
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,140
from the first episode until now.

745
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,200
As far as the storyline goes,

746
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,110
his earlier behavior was kind of annoying,

747
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,140
yet also seemed like he was pretending to be the big brother.

748
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,290
But here,

749
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,460
surprisingly,

750
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,640
he showed a protective look in his eyes.

751
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,970
It really hits differently.

752
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,400
It’s interesting. Even though there is a third person

753
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,900
causing a misunderstanding,

754
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,900
Kevin still ends up with a smile in the end.

755
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,370
You can feel that

756
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,640
his smile is a blessing for two of them.

757
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,310
But why did Adson give a smile that

758
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:01,010
seemed to carry some kind of hidden intent?

759
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,210
What do you mean?

760
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,310
We really found Adson's way of acting.

761
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,820
They are good because

762
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,670
they hardly have lines.

After saying a few words to Adson,

766
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,860
they never spoke again.

767
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,320
Yeah.

768
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,560
But at that time,

769
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,890
Guei found Pink was unhappy.

770
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,130
He thought about it.

771
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,020
Then he reached out his hand.

772
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,360
It seemed hesitant, yet also a bit probing.

773
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,710
Is he really going to hold his hand?

774
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,410
It makes people feel nervous.

775
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,380
Like that...

776
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,480
Right. When they held hands,

777
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,010
I turned around,

778
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,610
and the four of us were like this.

779
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,150
It was just holding hands,

780
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,610
but they were like this.

781
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,030
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

782
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,490
He went through stages.

783
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,560
First, he was probing, then really holding hands.

784
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,090
Finally, they held hands with their fingers interlocked.

785
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,370
I like it.

786
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,600
It's quite cute.

787
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,430
I didn't expect them to be so adorable.

788
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,240
Pink's eyes are like this.

789
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:06,240
I didn't expect Guei and Pink to get along so well.

790
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,860
Especially when their fingers interlocked.

791

So cute.

792
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:14,580
I also noticed that Adson's reaction was like this.

793
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,890
It gives off a sneaky vibe.

their feelings will definitely change in some way.

00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,199
I thought you guys have held hands.

925
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,170
He didn't hold my hand.

926
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,340
Do you know what happened to Robert?

927
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,409
He's always like this.

928
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,040
He's still preparing.

929
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,250
How long has he been beaten?

930
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,580
He keeps getting beaten.

931
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,610
If I were Fumi, I've left long ago.

932
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,989
Fumi was squeezing over there.

933
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,889
You’re so strong, yet you keep squeezing me.

934
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:47,320
No, he is the one who should hold my hand, right?

935
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,620
You two are so strong and you put him in the middle.

936
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,420
He should hold my hand, shouldn't he?

937
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,360
I've already thought about what comes next. 
If you don't hold my hand, how can I say it?

938
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,360
Okay, let's hold hands.

939
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,270
[Slow]

940
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,060
Who picks up the act from here?

941
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:59,100
Let's officially apologize to the audience.

942
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,640
I didn't feel anything after Guei and Adson kissed.

943
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,040
And it seems that Guei can't

944
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,610
play the role Pink played.

945
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:06,370
Yes.

946
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,340
Really.

947
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,720
So casting is really important.

948
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,610
He and Adson...

949
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,380
No.

950
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,180
Adson is so funny. I can't stand it.

951
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,320
There is no chemistry between them.

952
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,580
Yeah, the last pair.

953
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,990
I feel like they already have a certain chemistry

954
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,790
and pattern in their interactions,

955
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,270
but when they act, it seems like there's no real connection.

956
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:25,860
Yeah.

957
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,060
The scene was taken away by Fumi.

958
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,860
I think Chien Yu is still a bit in the situation.

959
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,260
I think Robert is really...

960
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,500
He thinks it's fun.

961
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,980
He hasn't...

962
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,600
He hasn't feel that kind of emotional connection yet.

963
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,740
About the two of them...

964
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:38,470
I think what's interesting is that

965
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,540
through this short play, we can see

966
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,980
their current state of the relationship.

967
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,640
I think so.

968
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,280
Right?

969
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:46,420
[Who are you sleeping with tonight?]

970
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,650
When suddenly given freedom,

971
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,420
I don't know what to do.

972
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,320
Can we move now?

973
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,480
Okay, I'll move first.

974
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,600
[Robert decides the first move]

975
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,250
Go, baby.

976
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,530
What the hell?

977
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,110
I think...

978
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,720
Go, baby.

979
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,590
Me?

980
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:08,870
Didn't you say you want to sleep over for another night?

981
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,220
What do you mean?

982
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,240
He wants to sleep for one more night.

983
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,610
Don't talk nonsense in the show.

984
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:17,910
It sounds like something happened to me.

985
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,780
Okay, prove your innocence.

986
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,320
No, I remember when we were outside today,

987
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,920
you promised that you would pick me.

988
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,290
Yes, how could this happen?

989
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,330
Okay, go ahead.

990
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,720
Think about it.

991
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,570
So stressful.

992
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,290
I was acting with him this morning.

993
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:36,500
The day before yesterday, he said,

994
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,020
let's do it again tomorrow.

995
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,630
Because we didn't talk much yesterday.

996
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,040
Okay, I'll go.

997
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,010
Okay, Guei, go.

998
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:46,470
It's nothing.

999
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,780
Just choose randomly.

1000
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,540
If you want to go, just do it.

1001
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,870
That's the quickest way.

1002
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,510
Baby.

1003
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,240
It's so hard.

1004
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,330
He's your baby.

1005
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,320
No, he doesn't know who he is.

1006
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,790
I have someone I want to choose.

1007
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,260
I may want to choose

1008
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,260
Chris or Yi.

1009
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,460
I think I made this decision because

1010
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:19,500
[Fumi wants to pick Chris or Yi]

1011
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,600
Chris and Yi

1012
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,600
haven't chosen yet.

1013
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,530
Let them decide.

1014
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,810
If you want to know who the baby is, go ahead.

1015
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:25,990
[Robert, Guei, Adson, and Fumi all leave the decision to others]

1016
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,870
The other four go...

1017
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,930
I don't want to move.

1018
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:26,830
No one wants it.

1019
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,630
Okay, let's...

1020
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,720
Then Pink, you go.

1021
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:31,990
Me?

1022
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,720
Because no one wants to go.

1023
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,540
Then him.

1024
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:36,390
Guei, please.

1025
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,770
Pink, make your choice carefully.

1026
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,440
Coming.

1027
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,230
I was acting with Guei today.

1028
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,860
And I think we are quite suited to act together.

1029
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,100
Also, I haven't shared

1030
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,700
a room with him yet.

1031
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:56,270
I want to take the opportunity tonight

1032
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,810
to talk with him and get to know him more.

1033
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,640
Gosh.

1034
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,860
Don't put pressure on me.

1035
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,150
[Hesitating]

1036
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,900
Okay.

1037
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,190
Come on, babies.

1038
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,400
Okay.

1039
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,750
Be brave.

1040
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,650
Chien Yu.

1041
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,250
Break the boundaries bravely.

1042
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,000
I don't think he'll choose Robert.

1043
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,360
Break the boundaries.

1044
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,240
Okay, let's sleep one more night.

1045
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,500
Poom's ship.

1046
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,010
It's a combination that Poom wants.

1047
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,270
I chose Robert.

1048
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,540
I always thought

1049
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,800
he was a quiet person.

1050
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,080
But when we had dinner today,

1051
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,780
he kept talking about himself.

1052
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:43,380
Because I didn't know he would have this side.

1053
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,650
He just kept talking.

1054
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,150
We didn't even know what he was laughing about.

1055
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,850
He suddenly laughed,

1056
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,060
and we didn't know why.

1057
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,360
But when we see him laugh, we just want to laugh too.

1058
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,260
So I thought

1059
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,860
I can

1060
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,200
have a deeper conversation with him

1061
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,930
to know more about

1062
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,400
his stupid side.

1063
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,420
You two.

1064
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,680
Okay, I'll do it.

1065
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,800
I'll choose another one.

1066
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:09,260
I want to sleep with different people every day.

1067
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,990
Go back to Adson.

1068
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,420
Why is it Fumi?

1069
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,860
Why?

1070
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,830
Like a playboy, you know?

1071
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:22,000
Playboy.

1072
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,430
[Is this how you use the word?]

1073
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,260
I want to change one every day

1074
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:32,570
to get closer to everyone.

1075
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,820
Okay, babies, have you decided?

1076
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,640
At that moment,

1077
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:46,310
I wanted to have a chance to talk with different people.

1078
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,210
A chance to sleep together.

1079
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,350
But when I realized,

1080
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,590
I was the last one.

1081
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,590
I've been hesitating for too long.

1082
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:59,830
I was thinking about Yi or Chien Yu.

1083
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,450
I think Adson's time has come.

1084
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,720
What?

1085
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,910
I think so too.

1086
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,810
Right? You know.

1087
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,170
Tell me. Let's see if we're the same.

1088
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:11,110
I think Adson is finally going to show them

1089
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,080
his comedian side.

1090
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,610
Yeah.

1091
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,820
The actor's...

1092
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,620
You mean he can act seriously with Chris.

1093
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:24,530
[Auntie Squad is looking forward to Adson's charisma side]

1094
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,050
Yes. Because Chris has watery eyes,

1095
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,720
Chris will be

1096
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,120
assigned to something that's like

1097
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,230
Yeah.

1098
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,490
a more serious storyline.

1099
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,310
Yeah. And then Adson has to...

1100
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,060
And their pair

1101
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,750
is an authentic Japanese BL...

1102
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:36,370
You know, a complete dominant and submissive combination.

1103
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:38,010
A pair that needs someone to take care of them.

1104
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,460
There are many possibilities.

1105
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,640
Qiao Qiao, do you think any of the pair

1106
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,680
has some chemistry?

Yes.

I really like Robert and Chien Yu.

1137
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,200
Later I think when Chien Yu went back and picked him,

1138
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,730
he was a bit shy.

1139

I thought

he wouldn't choose Robert.

1143
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,040
Yeah.

1144
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,370
But I didn't expect him to choose him again.

1145
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,570
But when he chose again,

1146
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,640
his expression showed everything.

1147
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,180
He was just putting on his own little show.

1148
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,280
He wanted to choose Robert.

1149
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,950
It shows that he also likes to be teased by him.

1150
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:54,920
I think so.

1151
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,480
Actually, he enjoys it.

1152
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,690
I think Chien Yu will choose Robert again

00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,970
Actually, I am not...

1289
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,900
I don't like it that much.

1290
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,420
I prefer being sexy

1291
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:18,550
and cool.

1292
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:19,480
Because of your personality.

1293
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,110
Yes, that's my personality.

1294
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:22,850
Because I'm different from you.

1295
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:25,390
My personality is basically the same as my appearance.

1296
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,270
Yes.

1297
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,730
So I have no such problem.

1298
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:28,890
I have a problem like this.

1299
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,250
There is another problem.

1300
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:31,510
I like to make people laugh.

1301
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:33,610
Maybe others don't think it's funny,

1302
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,980
and think that I'm stupid.

1303
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:38,310
Some people are like Robert that

1304
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:41,120
his words are awful and not funny.

1305
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:45,920
[Guei accidentally said his true feelings about Robert]

1306
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,170
But his behavior

1307
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,840
makes people laugh.

1308
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:45,920
Something like this.

1309
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:48,140
You do that so people like you.

1310
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,480
Yes, so I think

1311
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,780
why not embrace your true self?

1312
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,310
If you do, you'll have the chance

1313
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:57,510
to do things you really want to do.

1314
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,870
This episode is amazing.

1315
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:02,260
Because we've collected

1316
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:03,330
a great couple.

1317
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:04,290
Yeah.

1318
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,290
It should be two couples.

1319
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:06,150
Two couples.

1320
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,050
Yeah, I think it's developing well.

1321
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:09,970
And he just said

1322
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,470
he really felt something

1323
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:13,530
in Pink's eyes.

1324
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:16,480
Yes, it's very important when acting.

1325
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,340
Very important.

1326
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:18,200
The point is...

1327
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,190
Don't you know what that is, Guei?

1328
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,180
That's love.

1329
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,440
Making your own conclusion.

1330
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:25,740
Love. Love. It's love.

1331
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,860
That's what we want to see.

1332
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:28,630
Love. Love.

1333
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,190
The point is that now,

1334
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,590
there's no pillow in the middle.

1335
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:36,900
[Boys are comfortable on the same bed]
