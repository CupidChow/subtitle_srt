1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I won't say that I'm going to be a burden

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I can't help but look at you

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm a little worried about you

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm a little worried about you

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm a little worried about you

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm a little worried about you

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm a little worried about you

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm a little worried about you

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm a little worried about you

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm a little worried about you

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm a little worried about you

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm a little worried about you

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm a little worried about you

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 1

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Come, sit down

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Sit down, let's play together

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Miss Jiang is here

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Miss Jiang is here

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Look, what good things I brought you

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Here, Miss Jiang bought them all

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Miss Jiang is lucky

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The children are sending you here every day

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I've been too busy recently

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I should have come earlier

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Come, let's go over there

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Who are you?

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're wearing a military uniform, right?

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So warm

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Is this really a gun?

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What are you doing?

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The children are warm on you

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm afraid they'll shoot

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Don't move the soldiers' guns

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll be like uncle to you

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
when I grow up

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll wear a military uniform and shoot

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'll shoot out all the pirates

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll make them dare not bully us

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm sorry

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But if you don't want to be bullied by the pirates

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's just wearing a military uniform

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's not enough to take a gun

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What else should I do?

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You have to study hard

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Live well

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Only when you live will you have hope

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You have to sacrifice everything

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We'll be giving up a lot of things

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We must give up a lot of things

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Xiao Hai

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Xiao Hai

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Xiao Hai

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Xiao Hai

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Come here

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Don't bother them

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let's go

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Let's go back to the room

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why bring me here?

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I want you to see the poor children

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Their families

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
are almost dead

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
They are now

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
still have a handful of bullets

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
They must be attacked

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But if they really wait for the pirates to come in

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't say it's them

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Even if we can't fight them

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
This is the answer I want to give you

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Whether it's for those children

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
or for everyone like me

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The answer I can give

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
is only one

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
There is no choice

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You will be like your father

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You will be a betrayer

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and a person who will be with the pirates

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and the pirates

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What is this?

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
My answer

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The doctor of the mountain scene

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
entered the city

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I want to work with the mountain scene

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
in the heart of Dujian Mountain

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But this time

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
the mountain scene entered the city

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I am worried about you

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
If you have it

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
you can make it in advance

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If you want to stop the cooperation

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
it's much easier

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Are you satisfied with my answer?

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It hurts

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It hurts a little

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
How is it, Lu Yi?

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Is she okay?

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You know it hurts

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Why don't you take good care of her?

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
How bad is the injury

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
of this girl's family?

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Okay

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay, turn around

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Lu Yi, don't scold her

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This matter has nothing to do with her

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I am not careful

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I will take some medicine

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and go back to take some medicine

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's not a big deal

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You go with me to get the medicine

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You little girl

113
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You look weak

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You are very busy

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Don't be like this

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Do you think I am very stupid?

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I want to save you

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
but

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
No

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I think you are cute

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's really dangerous

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I can't do it again

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You go to Ye Wei Young today

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Ye Wei Young

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Is it because of me?

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's not all because of you

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
After all

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The people who were designed yesterday

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
are not only you, right?

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Sorry, I made you suffer

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You are here again

133
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We have talked about this

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You can't mention it again

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Miss, I got the medicine

137
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Otherwise, it's too late

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You got the medicine?

139
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay, I won't bother you

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I will treat you to a meal

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't get me wrong

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I just want to express my gratitude

143
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Master Du

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Our lady is...

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Master Du, when do you want to meet?

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Miss, you are not here

147
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What do you think?

148
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I will meet you at the restaurant

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I will see you

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Miss, you are not leaving?

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Although the mountain is close to the city

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Although the route is very secretive

153
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I can't guarantee that

154
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
you will not be lost

155
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
by the wind

156
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
How about this?

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
From the train station

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
to the landing point

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
you must guard your hands

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and don't make a single mistake

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Don't worry, I will arrange for it

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This time

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
it's my last chance

164
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
to give it to you

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's also my last chance

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
to give it to you

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
If there is another accident

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Officer Zhang

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I will come to see you

170
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes

171
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Get out

172
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Tonight

173
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
be alert

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Don't make any trouble

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yes

176
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Are you sure that the news of this trip is true?

177
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I believe in him

178
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I hope he won't let you down

179
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
because of his trust

180
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Don't worry

181
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
As long as the news is reliable

182
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
the organization will take back

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
his assassination

184
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The car is here

185
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Mr. Shan Jiu

186
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Welcome

187
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Please come here

188
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Mr. Shan Jiu

189
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
please be careful

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Here is absolutely safe

191
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
This way

192
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Mr. Shan Jiu

193
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Get out

194
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Don't worry

195
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I will take care of this

196
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Please

197
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This way

198
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Get out

199
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Mr. Shan Jiu

200
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Mr. Shan Jiu, get in

201
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Chi Yan Zhong

202
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Jiao Yao

203
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I knew that Chi Yan Zhong is not that simple

204
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We were all fooled

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Impossible

206
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
He must have some reason to be so careless

207
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's time for this

208
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You still believe him?

209
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
He always gives us the news of Dr. Shan Jiu

210
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
He always saves the good man

211
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
He is so heartless

212
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm afraid

213
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
he is just a coward

214
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He is the one who takes the position of Du Jian Shan

215
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and takes the position of Du Jian Shan

216
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Jiang Yao

217
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
We are just a pawn

218
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Please ask

219
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Chi Yan Zhong

220
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Jiang Yao

221
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You know

222
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
he is very important

223
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
He can go to the wine shop in Qing Yun Road

224
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
called Jiu Jing

225
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Japanese restaurant

226
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I thought

227
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
the Ouyang City under the Du Army

228
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
was the safest

229
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I didn't expect this

230
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
to happen

231
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It seems that

232
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
the strength of the Du Army

233
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
is very strong

234
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I think

235
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
it's very important

236
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
to be able to

237
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
be able to

238
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
be able to

239
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
be able to

240
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,800
be able to

241
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,000
be able to reach一定要

242
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,680
I also didn't expect

243
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
the strength of the Du Army

244
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
was very strong

245
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,640
Mr. class

246
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,000
did not mention the bad

247
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,800
thanks to Chinese

248
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,840
まで

249
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,200
You won too.

250
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,140
Nothing.

251
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,280
Let me ask these two questionnaires.

252
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,740
Why do they find this out here,

253
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,540
than the person himself and هuomba's daughter?

254
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:41,660
They find out to be people like that tomorrow.

255
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,940
That elder brother,

256
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,840
you should warmly wait here

257
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,560
until he is in his dream.

258
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,640
Listen, darling.

259
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,560
Love is in the world, it's not wandering

260
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,560
Love is in the world, it's not wandering

261
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,560
The past is past, the past is past

262
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,560
The place is familiar, you are the one

263
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,560
Love is in the world, it's completely possible to go with you

264
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,560
I can't read your story

265
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,560
I've seen your eyes, it's a lie

266
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,560
But I don't want to forget
