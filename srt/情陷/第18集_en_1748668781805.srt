1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I won't let you down

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I won't let you down

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let you down

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I won't let you down

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I won't let you down

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I won't let you down

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I won't let you down

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I won't let you down

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I won't let you down

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I won't let you down

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't let you down

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I won't let you down

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I won't let you down

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 19

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Commander, we've checked it.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Today, our ambush is indeed Du Janshan's men.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It seems that he's already reacted.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You did all the back moves.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What should we do now?

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We're about to sign an agreement with the Mountain Police.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
He can't make it to the sky.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I heard that Du Junjun has been in a tight spot recently.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He's been fighting with his heart.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Zheng Yao is making a scene.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Tell the bank of the Oguo that they know what to do.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This is you.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I don't want it now.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'll return it to you.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's okay.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I never thought Qi Mist Trans beispiel was capable to escape this situation.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,520
I suddenly remembered one thing.

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,720
What is it?

34
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,520
Last time, Mr. Shanjing came to the factory

35
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,000
to meet the man who was in the Imperial Bird Society.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,520
One of them is like a masked man.

37
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,840
He is very similar to Jiao Yao.

38
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,120
You mean...

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,240
Jiang Yao is the one who was in the Imperial Bird Society?

40
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,520
I'm just guessing.

41
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,480
This is the Du Palace Hall.

42
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:38,480
Senior

43
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,000
Being a businessman

44
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,480
doesn't do you harm any children.

45
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,480
You're a shameless man.

46
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,360
Since you don't want me to be a doctor,

47
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,160
don't you want to be a 15-year-old?

48
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,160
Here's the report. Here's the report.

49
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,400
Let me have a look.

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,400
Thank you, boss. Thank you, boss.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,080
Here's the report. Take a look.

52
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
Here's the newspaper.

53
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,560
Here it is.

54
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,440
The one who went to Mount Jiu is a traitor.

55
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Are you okay?

56
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
I'm fine.

57
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,600
They went to Chiyan City.

58
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,400
If there's a doctor in Mount Jiu,

59
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,480
we must stop them.

60
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,720
They'll cooperate with Chiyan City.

61
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
I know.

62
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,800
It's not that easy to kill Chiyan City.

63
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,960
We'll meet outside anytime.

64
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,360
I...

65
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
have another plan.

66
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,440
I'll go to the police station.

67
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,640
I'll go to the police station.

68
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,840
I'll go to the police station.

69
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,040
I'll go to the police station.

70
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,320
I'll go to the police station.

71
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,680
I'll go to the police station.

72
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,880
I'll go to the police station.

73
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,280
I'll go to the police station.

74
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,680
I'll go to the police station.

75
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,080
I'll go to the police station.

76
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,480
I'll go to the police station.

77
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,840
I'll go to the police station.

78
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,320
I'll go to the police station.

79
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,720
I'll go to the police station.

80
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,320
I'll go to the police station.

81
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,720
I'll go to the police station.

82
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,280
I'll go to the police station.

83
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,480
I'll go to the police station.

84
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,080
I'll go to the police station.

85
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,480
I'll go to the police station.

86
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,080
I'll go to the police station.

87
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,240
I'm a man.

88
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,640
I'm just a man.

89
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,840
I'm just a man.

90
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,640
Hello, big brother.

91
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,680
You've done a lot of work, right?

92
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,280
You're afraid of the ghost knocking at night, right?

93
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,880
Miss Jiang,

94
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,680
please open your bag.

95
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,480
Please.

96
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,680
If Uncle Jiang didn't let me come to accompany you,

97
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,080
I wouldn't have come here

98
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,480
if I had killed you.

99
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
I've told you.

100
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,680
It's boring to have such a late night meeting.

101
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,080
You can find a chance later.

102
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,080
Let's go.

103
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,680
Okay.

104
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
What's wrong?

106
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
Nothing.

107
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,080
I'm just feeling unwell.

108
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,480
Okay, let's go.

110
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,880
Today, there is an invitation

111
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,480
to bible your cooperation

112
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,880
with Jiang Bei.

113
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,880
Miss Jiang, you're really shiny.

114
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,440
I was in the room that I recognized

115
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,280
I can't see through your eyes

116
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,680
So you hide and remember

117
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,080
You don't change your mind

118
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,480
If you let me kill you

119
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,280
Will you change your mind?

120
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,680
If you feel your head is in the corner

121
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,480
And the gun is sad

122
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,280
I can't think of changing my mind

123
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,880
Marshal Chen is going to be worried

124
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,480
My gun is not bad

125
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,480
Miss Jiang is this capable?

126
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,880
I have a few days to recover

127
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,280
Marshal Chen, don't you know?

128
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,280
Are you going to shoot me?

129
00:08:38,880 --> 00:09:08,680
Marshal Chen

130
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
I'll kill you when you come to kill me.

131
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
Young Master,

132
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,880
is there anything wrong?

133
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,880
Keep an eye on Xiang Yao.

134
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Yes.

135
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Sorry.

136
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
Miss Zhou,

137
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,880
didn't you say that your wound is healed?

138
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
I don't know if Miss Zhou

139
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,880
likes to talk nonsense.

140
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
Yes.

141
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,880
My wound hasn't healed yet.

142
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,880
But I don't need to be a fan of the truth.

143
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,880
Besides,

144
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Young Master Du isn't my person.

145
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
That's right.

146
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
That's right.

147
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,880
You're my little aunt.

148
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,880
I don't think it's appropriate for me to see your wound.

149
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Have you taken the medicine?

150
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
I'll go get my uncle to get you the medicine.

151
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
Don't go.

152
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,880
I'm not like what you think of Yan Zhou.

153
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
So don't bother him.

154
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,880
What did you say?

155
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
Wait a minute.

156
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,880
I haven't told you clearly.

157
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,880
You haven't told me clearly.

158
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,880
So,

159
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,880
you're not my little aunt, right?

160
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Yes.

161
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
I'm not your little aunt.

162
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,880
I'm not the person that Yan Zhou likes.

163
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
I can't marry him.

164
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,880
So I can leave now.

165
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
Then you...

166
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Do you like him?

167
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
Yes.

168
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
Then you don't like him, either.

169
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
Am I right?

170
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,880
I hope you don't.

171
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,880
Because

172
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
I'm not happy.

173
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,880
I'm jealous.

174
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,880
I'm not happy.

175
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,880
Is it because of the sky?

176
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,880
I can't be with you.

177
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,880
I owe you too much.

178
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,880
I'm so upset.

179
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,880
I don't want to be with you.

180
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,880
I don't want to be with you.

181
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,880
I don't want to be with you.

182
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
Love is in the past.

183
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,880
It's not easy to get rid of it.

184
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,880
The love is in the past.

185
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,880
The past is in the past.

186
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,880
The past is in the past.

187
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,880
It's in the past.

188
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,880
The shot is still the same.

189
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,880
The shooting star is still...

190
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,880
the scene of the gun魚.

191
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
Of the title?

192
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,580
The first time he has seen ainin's picture

193
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,880
then, you have no idea that

194
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,880
the love in past is no match for you.

195
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,880
Other through this,

196
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,880
you don't even understand the tumor.

197
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,880
How do you know?

198
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,880
How about your skin?

199
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
Since you don't even know

200
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,880
if it's the back of your head.
