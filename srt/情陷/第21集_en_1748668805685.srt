00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I won't let you down

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I won't let you down

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let you down

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I won't let you down

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I won't let you down

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I won't let you down

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I won't let you down

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I won't let you down

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I won't let you down

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I won't let you down

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't let you down

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I won't let you down

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I won't let you down

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 1

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
When will it be?

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I can't lose those things

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Teacher Jiang is so quiet

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Teacher Jiang, don't read books

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let's go to ride a horse

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's go

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Beifall

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
requiem

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Teacher Jiang

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
laughter

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,800
Really a failure

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What are you doing?

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,600
You'll be gaining weight

28
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,480
Thank you

29
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,360
so many of you

30
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,480
have lived happily ever after

31
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:35,920
Class eye

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,080
I'm got new movies

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,560
Currently

34
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,400
The taste of Yan あり春

35
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,080
Wei Wei

36
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,560
Aww

37
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,480
have a taste of affection

38
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,640
It's delicious

39
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,320
•

40
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,880
It's delicious

41
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,080
When did we meet?

42
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
You are in danger.

43
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,240
Okay.

44
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,240
Actually, there's a saying.

45
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,720
I've been in my heart for a long time.

46
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,520
But I don't know how to tell you.

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,960
What?

48
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,800
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,120
Really.

50
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,120
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
I know

52
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,120
that even if I'm in danger,

53
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,560
this is not for you.

54
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,440
For you, the Chi family is like a red light.

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,720
But I think

56
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,320
it's better than not to say it.

57
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,880
I've been wanting to ask you this.

58
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,080
You've been living well for five years.

59
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,880
But I can't ask you.

60
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,280
I don't dare to ask you.

61
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,120
Because I know

62
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,320
you must be in a bad mood.

63
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,040
I knew that

64
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,520
I was a fool.

65
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,720
Your father's murderer is Du Qian Shan.

66
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,120
I'm really a fool.

67
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,520
Is this a reason?

68
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,680
The hatred between us

69
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,480
can be reduced a little bit.

70
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,880
I've been wanting to ask you this.

71
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,480
Five years ago,

72
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,480
except for your identity,

73
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,880
my blood is mine.

74
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,480
Is there anything else real?

75
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,280
Why are you holding your hand?

76
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,880
Close your eyes.

77
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,080
I'll wipe it off for you.

78
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,080
I'll wipe it off for you.

79
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,680
As if!

80
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,720
omsomallow.

81
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
cumulative selfification

82
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,880
come out.

83
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,040
Jiang Yao.

84
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,800
Jiang Yao.

85
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,480
My daughter.

86
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,000
Dad.

87
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,840
Are you even trying to give my mother up once more?

88
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,560
Your Majesty,

89
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,640
Potato�

90
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,920
It's my own son.

91
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,040
My poor son!

92
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,040
Yes, Please leave.

93
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,160
Please need a second thought.

94
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,820
Go

95
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

96
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,320
Jiang.

97
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,080
Go home.

98
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,720
Uncle.

99
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,400
Jiang.

100
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,760
How is Jiang?

101
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,040
He's fine.

102
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,760
Chen Yanzhou,

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,200
I won't let you leave Nanpo Mountain alive.

104
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,760
Don't shoot, uncle.

105
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,840
Uncle.

106
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,280
Don't shoot, uncle.

107
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,840
ippi, pi Las拉拉

108
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,360
Empty.

109
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,960
According to the document,

110
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,480
the culprit left this room

111
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,160
Sorry.

112
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:50,920
Wake up.

113
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Therefore you can also forcefully come here to visit Madam.

114
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,460
Sister,

115
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,760
she is most appreciate.

116
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,920
You should care anything.

117
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,240
Let her be happy.

118
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,520
Enough.

119
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,320
There is nothing serious about her.

120
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,560
She is still entirely Statue.

121
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
She worried.

122
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,800
I am anxious.

123
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,720
I'm not.

124
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,840
How did I come back?

125
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,480
Your friend sent you back.

126
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,760
How is Chianzhou?

127
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,200
Yao Yao,

128
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,760
you care about others.

129
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,600
What are you doing?

130
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,560
How did you make yourself look like that?

131
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,120
I feel bad.

132
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,320
I'm fine.

133
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,040
Dad, mom.

134
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,200
I have something urgent.

135
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,400
I have to go out right now.

136
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,640
You just woke up.

137
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Why are you going out again?

138
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,720
Are you stupid?

139
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,400
No.

140
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,520
How are you going to rest for two days?

141
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,240
Are you going to see Wen Lan?

142
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,480
I don't know what's going on.

143
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Du Du Jun died suddenly yesterday.

144
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,800
It's good for you to go see him.

145
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,040
You...

146
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,080
Why don't you feel bad for your daughter?

147
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,800
You just woke up.

148
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,720
The child needs to change.

149
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,920
Let's go out first.

150
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,320
It's true.

151
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,520
Just hang up on the child.

152
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:08,920
Let's go.

153
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,080
Just hang up.

154
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,280
Don't use the umbrella again.

155
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,800
Du Jun really died.

156
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,600
No.

157
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,200
I have to go see Wen Lan.

158
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,760
Yao Yao.

159
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,160
Dad, what's wrong?

160
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,240
Dad doesn't know what you're doing.

161
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,000
But it's safe to go out.

162
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,400
Everything is safe.

163
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,120
Your mom is timid.

164
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,440
She's not scared.

165
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,280
I don't want to lose you either.

166
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,640
I see.

167
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,880
Thank you, dad.

168
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,360
My car.

169
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,920
Are you okay?

170
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,840
I'm fine.

171
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,080
Did you get hurt last night?

172
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,720
Don't worry. I'm fine.

173
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,320
That's good.

174
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,280
By the way,

175
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,880
stop talking about the plan in the mountains.

176
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,400
Don't deal with Chi Yan Zhou anymore.

177
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,160
It's too late to wait.

178
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,680
Chi Yan Zhou is willing to save you this time.

179
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,880
He's in love with you.

180
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,800
But he can't give up on what he really should do.

181
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,600
I'm sorry.

182
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,560
I'm sorry.

183
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,560
I'm sorry.

184
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,560
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
I'm sorry.

186
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,440
I suspect that

187
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,160
the cooperation between Chi Yan Zhou and the mountains

188
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,000
doesn't seem so simple.

189
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
Anyway, before I find out,

190
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,320
don't act rashly.

191
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,080
Are you all dead or not?

192
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,160
Get out of here!

193
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,960
Get out of here!

194
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,720
Hurry up!

195
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
Get out!

196
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
How's your health?

197
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Don't worry.

198
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
I'm not in a big problem.

199
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
I didn't ask you.

200
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,160
You're a little bit sour.

201
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,160
I didn't even remember to tell you.

202
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
How's your health?

203
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm fine.

204
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm fine.

205
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm fine.

206
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm fine.

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm fine.

208
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,960
Now that you see me standing here,

209
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,960
you know that I'm fine.

210
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
But you,

211
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,960
I was so confused yesterday.

212
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
I think I saw Du Jian Shan opening the wall for you.

213
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,600
Did you get hurt again?

214
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
A little bit.

215
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
I don't know.

216
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
But Wen Lan,

217
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,720
maybe he's a little bit big.

218
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,920
Although Du Jian Shan's death is a human's heart,

219
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,760
Wen Lan is innocent after all.

220
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,280
I told you to get out of here!

221
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,160
If you don't get out,

222
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,480
we'll go out!

223
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,160
Let him out!

224
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,720
Yes!

225
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,200
Get out!

226
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Get out!
