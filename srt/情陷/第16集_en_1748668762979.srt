1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I won't let you down

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I won't let you down

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let you down

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I won't let you down

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I won't let you down

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I won't let you down

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I won't let you down

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I won't let you down

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I won't let you down

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I won't let you down

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't let you down

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I won't let you down

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I won't let you down

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 1

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Marshal is meeting an important guest

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He's entrusting the order

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No one can disturb him

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But you look so happy

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm not the one who's in love with you

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's okay

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I have time and experience

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Mr. Shan Xing, let's go in

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Mr. Shan Xing, let's go

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's the hardest time for a woman

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
to be on her own

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Sorry, please excuse me

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No need

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I will wait

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,480
I don't like him.

30
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,080
Will you hide in this palace?

31
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,020
You want to die?

32
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
So I might as well

33
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:18,980
have you

34
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,200
be the greedy girl

35
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,080
and got the swan tail.

36
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,520
Are you threatening me?

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,600
Then you can try it.

39
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,800
See if the mountain scenery is the same as the one in the Fei Niao Hui.

40
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,400
Or do you believe I'm Jiang Bei?

41
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,800
You can also bet.

42
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,600
In the end, I'm the one who lost the weight.

43
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,800
Or are you Fei Niao Hui's losses worse?

44
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,600
You've come to see me so urgently.

45
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,400
It shouldn't be just to threaten me, right?

46
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,400
I remember.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,800
You came to ask for punishment.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,400
I'm not afraid of you.

49
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,600
Okay.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll give you five minutes.

51
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,200
Let's start.

52
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,400
Your purpose

53
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,400
is to work with the pirates?

54
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,400
The answer is to meet.

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,200
So from the moment you took the medicine,

56
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,800
until you broke my engagement with Wen Lan,

57
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,400
you've been trying to get this thing out of hand.

58
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,400
Or else,

59
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,000
don't you think

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,400
I'm trying to get you out of trouble?

61
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,400
Are you disappointed?

62
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,600
You're disappointed now.

63
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
You're really ridiculous.

64
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,600
You should be more confident than anyone else.

65
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,000
I know that since five years ago,

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,800
we've been destined to be the same kind of people.

67
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,000
No matter what the world is like,

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
the land and the sea are as dry as the river.

69
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,400
I've always wanted money.

70
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,000
All of it.

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,600
Money is really important.

72
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Can you buy the Zun Yan Sect and become the dog of the pirates?

73
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,600
Didn't you say that in the Fulian Sect?

74
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
If I didn't say it, would you believe me?

75
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,200
How could the Fulian Sect help me?

76
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,000
Jiang Yao, you're right.

77
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,800
I'm just using it.

78
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,200
That's sad.

79
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,800
Speaking of which, I still learned this from you.

80
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,800
It's not easy to be deceived by others.

81
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,600
I just want you to be the one who once made me understand.

82
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,200
And you should also understand the past.

83
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,200
Chi Yan Zhong,

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
you can lie to me or leave me.

85
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,600
But you shouldn't work with the pirates and be a traitor.

86
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:51,760
What she means to you, will be a luxury of your

87
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,860
I'll tell the old man.

88
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,560
I'll listen to you.

89
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,060
l will eat the four methods.

90
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
Mr. Shan Jin.

91
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,520
We hope we'll succeed in working together.

92
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,360
I will hold a banquet at He Ping Hotel.

93
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,520
Please don't miss it.

94
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,520
Oh, right.

95
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,320
I will prepare the contract.

96
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,120
Okay.

97
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,920
I will be there.

98
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,600
Handsome, are you okay?

99
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,320
Che���gem

100
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,660
Ding Jia.

101
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,900
Er?

102
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,240
Qun.

103
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,320
Ha-Qing!

104
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,580
I'm here to say thanks,

105
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,120
I'm Mr. Xia.

106
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,320
She asked to come, married and fought back Her Scale.

107
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,960
You keep exaggerating.

108
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,640
Let me show you.

109
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,640
You seem familiar to me.

110
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,440
My name is Zhen Pelletia.

111
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,360
Yes, that is true.

112
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,320
I have been doing everything in business

113
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,960
since big time ago.

114
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,960
Even if I thought of looking after Oppa

115
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,480
I never had such relief.

116
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,280
I'm really worried about him.

117
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,440
Du Jun,

118
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,600
the military is in a bad mood now.

119
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,240
The cooperation with the Wolf King is interrupted.

120
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,000
The military has been out of control.

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,600
I'm afraid the military is unstable.

122
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,680
I'll call the Shen Jing.

123
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,960
I'll call him.

124
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,720
Du Jun.

125
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,000
Du Jun.

126
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,720
Dad.

127
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,040
Dad.

128
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,800
Dad.

129
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,680
Have a good rest.

130
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,120
I'll go find a doctor for you.

131
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,720
So,

132
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
don't be so anxious every day.

133
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,360
In the future,

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,360
you'll be the one to take care of the family.

135
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,000
Dad, I won't take care of the family.

136
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,960
If you think that no one will take care of the family,

137
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,000
let him take care of it.

138
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,920
What nonsense are you talking about?

139
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,800
Yes, Young Master.

140
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,920
We can't talk nonsense.

141
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,400
I usually talk nonsense.

142
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,440
But I don't have any self-control now.

143
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,920
I won't be like you.

144
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,440
I won't be a coward

145
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,920
and I won't be willing to be a coward.

146
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,600
You bastard.

147
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,880
You think I'm useless and useless in the city?

148
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,240
I'm useless.

149
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,720
I can't change the bad things.

150
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,600
But I won't be changed by the bad things.

151
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,720
You...

152
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,960
You're making me angry.

153
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,760
Changfeng,

154
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,600
I'll solve the problem in the mountains.

155
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,320
You can arrange it.

156
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,080
This time,

157
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,080
you can't let go of the test.

158
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:27,880
Yes.

159
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,160
Young Master.

160
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,120
Be careful.

161
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,040
Mr. Qi.

162
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,320
Mr. Qi.

163
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,600
Mr. Qi.

164
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,480
What's going on?

165
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:35,880
Be careful.

166
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,560
Young Master.

167
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,560
Why are you drinking like this?

168
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,440
I'm not.

169
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,480
I'm not.

170
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,120
I'm not.

171
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,160
I'm not.

172
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,760
Jiang Yao, right?

173
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,600
Mr. Qi.

174
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,280
I saw you drink like this last time.

175
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,320
It's been five years.

176
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,880
Mr. Qi.

177
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,720
It's not the time to talk about this.

178
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,320
Young Master, are you all right?

179
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,840
You're right.

180
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,040
I need to get him back.

181
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,160
Mr. Qi.

182
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,440
Do you need my help?

183
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,400
I'll get the medicine or water.

184
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,120
I'll do it.

185
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,600
Look.

186
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,760
Can you put his foot

187
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,280
behind the head?

188
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,400
Forget it.

189
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,000
