1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I won't let you down

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I won't let you down

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let you down

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I won't let you down

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I won't let you down

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I won't let you down

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I won't let you down

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I won't let you down

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I won't let you down

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I won't let you down

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't let you down

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I won't let you down

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I won't let you down

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 19

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Sir, what do you mean?

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Since you're not his partner,

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
since you're not his partner,

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
then shoot.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Kill him and show us

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
your actual actions.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What?

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You don't want to do it?

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Am I not as good as Du Jian Shan said?

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He's not just your partner,

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
he's also your lover.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So you can't do it?

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Sir, you misunderstood.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I just don't want to use your gun.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Jiang Yao.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Are you afraid of death?

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Chi Yan Zhong,

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
you're a traitor.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You're a dog of my country.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
How could you not have a good life?

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Fine.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll kill you.

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll kill you.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll kill you.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll kill you.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll kill you.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll kill you.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll kill you.

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'll kill you.

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I won't let you down.

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll kill you.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll kill you.

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll kill you.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Have a good cooperation.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Have a good cooperation.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
By then...

51
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
By then, you can stay with me.

52
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Old Chi.

53
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,400
I know you just killed your beloved woman.

54
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,800
How can I persuade you now?

55
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,200
You may feel very uncomfortable.

56
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,400
But time will pass.

57
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Excuse me.

58
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,200
Can I sit here?

59
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,000
No.

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,200
There are so many places to sit.

61
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,200
Okay.

62
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Yao.

63
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Move aside.

64
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,000
Move aside.

65
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,200
No.

66
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
What's going on?

67
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,800
Didn't you get killed by the teacher and fell into the cliff?

68
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
And the old man in the mountain

69
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
went to check your body.

70
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,000
Is there any miracle in medicine now?

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,800
Can a man get back to life?

72
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,800
Actually, we got a bag of blood in advance.

73
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,200
We changed the gun for the treasure.

74
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,400
Our people have been doing good things in the cliff.

75
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,200
I only got hurt by the light.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So the body under the cliff is not you, right?

77
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,000
Good for you two.

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,800
You two even cheated me.

79
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,600
If you can't even cheat,

80
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,200
how can you cheat the mountain police?

81
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,000
But, what do you know about the action of the mountain police?

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,200
When Jiang Yao's body was exposed in front of the people in the mountain,

83
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
we found out that there will be a day like this.

84
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,200
So we prepared in advance.

85
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,000
You two are really old-fashioned and born to be the same.

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,200
Thank you for your compliment.

87
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
You're welcome.

88
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,400
Why are you still here?

89
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,000
You want to go back to Jiangbei?

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,200
Of course, I want to go back with you.

91
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,600
You clearly know that Jiangbei is very dangerous.

92
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,400
Once you are found, you may have a chance to go back.

93
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,400
If it's not dangerous, I might not go.

94
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,600
Because I said that

95
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,600
I will be with you no matter what happens in the future.

96
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,400
And,

97
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,000
I lost my ring.

98
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,200
Okay.

99
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,000
I know it clearly.

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,600
Just here, here, and we are the best.

101
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,200
Is that what you mean?

102
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
That's good.

103
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,600
You two are really...

104
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,800
I'm going to Jiangbei to find Uncle Zhou to propose to you.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The person I'm wearing

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,800
is a woman who loves you.

107
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
If you want to go to the imperial palace,

108
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,600
he will have to suffer a little.

109
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,800
It's okay.

110
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,600
No matter what the difficulties are, I'm willing to do it.

111
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,200
Episode 19

112
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,400
The problem with the construction of the city is that

113
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,800
the railway that I'm trying to build

114
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,000
has failed to be built for the time being.

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,200
The loss of the mine is nearly 16 billion.

116
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,000
The loss is very serious.

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,800
Jiangbei and I understand that

118
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Chiyan City is a building in the middle.

119
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Both parties are together to surround Chiyan City.

120
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,200
But the change of Chiyan City is not easy.

121
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,200
Xiu Huo, hurry and call your teacher Chi to eat at home.

122
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay, mom.

123
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,000
What's wrong with you today? Did you run out to pick up dad?

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Dad, I think you really need to persuade my mom.

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,200
What's wrong?

126
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Did she harm the kitchen again today?

127
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,000
Or did she harm your taste?

128
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,600
Before I came out of the house,

129
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,000
I opened the table and it was very quiet.

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,200
It's really the same as yesterday, the day before yesterday.

131
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,800
Eat hot pot.

132
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,600
That pot is very dirty. It's just a mud in the ground.

133
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Dad, if you don't stop mom from coming out, I'll change my name.

134
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,400
Change your name?

135
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,200
What's your name?

136
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,400
I don't need to call you Chi.

137
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,200
I should call you Chi.

138
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Chi Huo Guo?

139
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,600
What a cool name.

140
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,200
Okay, later dad will definitely teach you to be a good mom.

141
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
Let's go home.

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,800
Let's go.

143
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,600
What soup did you eat today? Why is it so fragrant?

144
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,000
I haven't come in yet and I can smell the fragrance.

145
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Take it.

146
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,800
We are still cooking hot pot.

147
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,400
We are really cooking the fire and the fire.

148
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,200
How can we not get tired of eating?

149
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,800
Then you eat more later.

150
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Okay.

151
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,200
Let's go.

152
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,600
How could I only hope that my dad would stand by me?

153
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,200
Xin Huo.

154
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,000
Sister Yimian and Brother Wanlai,

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm so great that I don't need to eat hot pot anymore.

156
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,200
Xin Huo, come and hug me.

157
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,800
I spent three years in the experiment.

158
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,000
I finally got to talk to Jiang Meihe.

159
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,200
We are also called the teachers.

160
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
We are called the teachers.

161
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,400
And Wenlan is also a doctor.

162
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,000
We all use our own ways.

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,600
To protect our persistence.

164
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,400
I'm so tired.

165
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
I'm so tired.

166
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
I'm so tired.

167
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,400
I'm so tired.

168
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,400
I'm so tired.

169
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,400
I'm so tired.

170
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,400
I'm so tired.

171
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,400
I'm so tired.

172
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,400
I'm so tired.

173
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,400
I'm so tired.

174
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,400
I'm so tired.

175
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,400
I've been through the pain of love and hate.

176
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,400
I don't know who's more sad.

177
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Is it the sky that can be seen?

178
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,400
I've been through the pain of love and hate.

179
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Maybe I'm not good enough.

180
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
I'd rather be chosen first.

181
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,400
I'll never be free.

182
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Love is floating in the world.

183
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,400
The blue and white clouds have passed.

184
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,400
The yellow and white lakes used to be familiar.

185
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,400
They are like you.

186
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Love is in the world.

187
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
I can walk with you.

188
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,400
I can't read your song.

189
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,400
I've been through the pain of love and hate.

190
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,400
Maybe I'm not good enough.
