1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I won't say that I'm going to fall for you

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
because I have too many memories

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't say that I'm going to fall for you

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
because I have too many memories

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I won't say that I'm going to fall for you

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
because I have too many memories

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I won't say that I'm going to fall for you

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
because I have too many memories

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I won't say that I'm going to fall for you

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
because I have too many memories

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I won't say that I'm going to fall for you

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
because I have too many memories

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I won't say that I'm going to fall for you

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
because I have too many memories

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 19

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Stop being so noisy.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Take a rest.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He's...

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Okay.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Be careful.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If you need anything, just contact me.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's all.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Chen, that...

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yumen is going back to Jiangbei in a few days.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I heard that.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Are you really not going to stay?

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It will be over a year later.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's good that he's going back soon.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's right.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's not interesting to stay here.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll send him back then.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Oh, right.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Although Miss Jiang has left,

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
why is her favorite book still here?

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If you're free,

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
give it back to her in a few days.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Miss Jiang, please be quiet.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yumen, come and study with me.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You're Yao Yao's student, right?

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yes.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Please let Miss Jiang remember.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
She's not at home today.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
She's dating a boyfriend.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
A boyfriend?

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
She said that she's opened a Western restaurant in the north.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
These young people are just in love with fashion.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Oh, right.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Which student are you, Yao Yao?

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Miss Jiang, I'll let her call you when she comes back.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Thank you, auntie.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No need.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Where have you been lately?

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
My father didn't bother you, did he?

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
If he really does,

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I can be quiet.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Miss Jiang, you're so young.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm not young.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm just a young man.

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm not a young girl.

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm just an old girl.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm just a young man.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm just a young man.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Miss Jiang,

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I want to ask you something.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Do you think I'm a young man?

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes, you're a young man.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Do you think I'm a young man?

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm just a young man.

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Jiu, are you going to fight with us?

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Is there a problem?

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm not going to tell you if there's a problem.

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
If I remember correctly, the person who took the initiative to get married last time was Miss Jiang.

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What? Are you regretting now?

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I can't say that I regret it.

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But I'm really thinking about it recently.

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Will I make the decision to be wrong?

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And this?

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You don't know how to go back to your head.

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Why do you think that I can still see you now?

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
In my opinion, people are still better looking forward.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No.

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
If Ya Ya is regretting, I'm willing to marry her.

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Can you be a little bit more?

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Jiu, you're really weird today.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't you usually like to be high-ranking?

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You're fighting with us now.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And you care so much about my relationship life.

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I understand.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You're jealous of me.

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What am I jealous of?

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Of course, you're the only one in my family.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're jealous of me and Ya Ya. You're always right.

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Dun Lan, do you know that your dad is coming out for a date today?

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm coming out for a date. Why do you want that stinky old man to know?

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Then he doesn't know.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay, I'll call him now.

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Wurong!

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Jiu, you're a kid. Why are you still calling me?

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So you're leaving or not leaving?

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I...

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I...

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I just remembered that I have something else to do.

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Ya Ya, let's meet again next time.

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I really have something else to do!

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I really have something to do!

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Put it here.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Please enjoy.

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Give me a kiss.

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You didn't raise your hand?

113
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I have a promise.

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Give me a kiss.

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Give me a kiss.

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay.

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Your quality is good.

118
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is it just to feed you steak?

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm so idle.

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Did someone forget that we're in Dujian Mountain?

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Is that related to us?

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What? Miss Jiang wants to have two boats now?

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm not that stupid.

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And I'm friends with Wen Lan.

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We got engaged before.

126
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's also a promise between friends.

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't love her. She doesn't love me either.

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What?

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Last time in Dujian Mountain, you acted so seriously.

130
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It seems like you're good at acting.

131
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Uncle, buy some flowers for your girlfriend.

132
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm not a girlfriend.

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes.

134
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
How can a lover like her find a boyfriend?

135
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
She's not your girlfriend. Why would she feed you steak?

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Gentlemen, let's go.

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Don't tell me we haven't seen each other before.

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The custom of being your partner agree to a month's salary.

139
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
When I ordered this when we were competing with each other.

140
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I realized what kind of joke it was.

141
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Bro, it's okay.

142
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Congratulations.

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Are you here yet?

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Tada.

145
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay.

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay.

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,640
We've opened the ì§‘.

148
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,120
Now that you're here,

149
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,920
we need to get back to Police Department,

150
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,520
so we could get back to the check point.

151
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,440
I think...

152
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,640
I heard there's also something does appear

153
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,680
in the room.

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm not angry.

155
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,600
If I go back now

156
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,200
and settle the engagement with Yanzhou,

157
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,600
he will be very angry.

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,800
Miss, what did you say just now?

159
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Nothing.

160
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,600
Xiu, what do you think of my dress?

161
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,800
Is it strange?

162
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,600
No.

163
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,200
It's like the stars in the flower newspaper.

164
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
It looks good.

165
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,400
Miss,

166
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
why are you dressed up at this time?

167
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,800
I'm going out later.

168
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,600
Don't follow me.

169
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,600
Now you're going out?

170
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,200
It's dark.

171
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm going out in the dark.

172
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,000
I heard that

173
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,200
the city is different from Jiangbei.

174
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,000
There are many nightlife here.

175
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,400
They can drink and dance.

176
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,200
So I have to experience it well.

177
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,800
I'll try my best.

178
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,200
You want to drink?

179
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,000
You want to dance?

180
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,000
No. Absolutely not.

181
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,000
Miss,

182
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
if you let the army know about this,

183
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,400
I'll be dead.

184
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Yes.

185
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
So don't let the army know.

186
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,000
You.

187
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,600
Come here.

188
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,800
The girl came in alone?

189
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
Yes.

190
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,800
It seems like she didn't see anything.

191
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,000
What's the order?

192
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,200
Such a low-end girl.

193
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
If she can serve me,

194
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,400
she can sell a good family.

195
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
You, bring her here.

196
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,400
Yes.

197
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,600
Hello, miss.

198
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,200
We invite you over.

199
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,800
Please.

200
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,400
I'm going to the city.

201
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,800
I'm going to the city.

202
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,200
I'm going to the city.

203
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,800
I'm going to the city.

204
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,400
I'm going to the city.

205
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm going to the city.

206
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,400
I'm going to the city.

207
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,800
I'm going to the city.

208
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,200
I'm going to the city.

209
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,400
I'm going to the city.

210
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,800
I'm going to the city.

211
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,200
I'm going to the city.

212
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,800
I'm going to the city.

213
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,200
I'm going to the city.

214
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,800
I'm going to the city.

215
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,400
I'm going to the city.

216
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm going to the city.

217
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,800
I'm going to the city.

218
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,400
I'm going to the city.

219
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,600
I don't know who is more sad.

220
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,400
Is it the sky in October?

221
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,400
So I can have a rest.

222
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
There are too many losses.

223
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,200
It's like a car.

224
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,000
Maybe I'm not willing to.

225
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'd rather be the first to be chosen.

226
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I don't want to be the first to be free.

227
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,200
Love is in the blue.

228
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,800
The world is floating.

229
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,800
The blue sky and the rain are passing by.

230
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,000
The lake and the sword are in the same place.

231
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,800
There is a similar face.

232
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,200
Love is in the late October.

233
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,800
You can go with me.

234
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,600
I can't read your story.

235
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
I've seen your eyes.

236
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,800
It's also a lie.

237
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,800
It's my fault.

238
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
I'm sorry.

239
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
I'm sorry.

240
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
I'm sorry.
