1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I won't let you down

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I won't let you down

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let you down

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I won't let you down

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I won't let you down

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I won't let you down

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I won't let you down

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I won't let you down

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I won't let you down

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I won't let you down

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't let you down

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I won't let you down

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I won't let you down

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 1

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 1

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There's still this ring.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Why is it here?

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
From the beginning,

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
you were looking for it in the snow.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Is it just to make a wedding?

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Jiang Yao,

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
you're trying to get over it.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Do you still have the chance to save her?

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What am I saying now?

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You won't believe me anymore.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I want to believe you too.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But tell me,

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
what do I believe in?

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
A cheater!

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I know how I can't explain it.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But this time,

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I really didn't want to hurt you.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let me ask you,

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
if you find out today,

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
that I'm really colluding with the Mo Guiren,

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
will you let me go?

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Go away.

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Well,

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll find Du Jian Shan and take him to the palace.

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Shi Yanzhu,

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
come and pick me up.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Take her away.

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What about you?

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
None of your business.

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I know you're all Jiang Jiang in Jiangbei,

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
but you've been in the army.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This is Du Jian Shan's territory.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Isn't it a mess?

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
There's another way.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Let's go.

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Mr. Qi, I want you to help me.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What?

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Are you sure you want to do this?

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll get going.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What do you want?

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Why is he still not here?

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Du Jun, I've been there.

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm busy now.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's not convenient for me to see you.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Busy?

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I just want to see how he's so busy.

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's a long story.

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's a long story.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Please, Young Marshal.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Why?

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Jiang Yao,

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
you really have a big goal.

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You can take any limit.

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
If that's the case,

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I must cooperate with you.

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Du Jun,

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
why is your future daughter-in-law

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
here?

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It must be a bad opportunity.

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Get lost.

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Since you're so busy,

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll see what's going on.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Du Jun.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll do it.

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Du Jun.

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Brother-in-law, why are you here?

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Du Bo Feng.

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You're wearing clothes.

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Get out of here.

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You're so good-looking.

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm not good-looking.

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm not good-looking.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm not good-looking.

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm not good-looking.

92
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm not good-looking.

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I forgot to tell you.

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We have a secret passage.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
We can let you out.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Du Janshan is enough.

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's what I meant.

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Why didn't you say it earlier?

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Jiang Yao,

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
you said that you're going to get married

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
because you love Wen Lan.

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You're married to Wen Lan's uncle.

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You really don't know

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
what I'm thinking.

105
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Brother-in-law,

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I forced you

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
to get married.

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It has nothing to do with him.

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It has nothing to do with him.

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Wen Lan is good-looking.

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You're good-looking too.

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Good.

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Brother-in-law, what does this mean?

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You're a soldier.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The most important thing in the army

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
is love and rules.

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You broke the rules because of love.

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
In my army,

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
you're a criminal.

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But I'll punish you today.

121
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But you have to

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
punish him

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
or him

124
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
or you.

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Otherwise,

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'll kill you.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Xiao Jiu.

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You have a good taste.

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You're not so good-looking.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You're good-looking.

131
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He just wants your life.

132
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Are you sure he really loves you?

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm not sure.

134
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm just a little bit worried.

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm not sure.

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm just a little bit worried.

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm just a little bit worried.

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
He really loves you.

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Brother-in-law.

140
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Brother-in-law!

141
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,000
Brother-in-law!

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,400
Brother-in-law!

143
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,400
Brother-in-law!

144
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,300
Brother-in-law!

145
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,200
Brother-in-law!

146
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,760
I'll go get the medicine.

147
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,360
Stop.

148
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,400
I don't want to see you

149
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,120
in your sister's face.

150
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,840
Remember,

151
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,520
don't call me brother-in-law anymore.

152
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,720
Wen Lan

153
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,440
doesn't have a brother-in-law like you.

154
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,840
Go.

155
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,320
Are you Ling Zhen?

156
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,440
I'm la thinly thin.

157
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,400
I can't sit still.

158
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,800
You have to lie down.

159
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,880
Stop.

160
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,240
Tell me.

161
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,640
Luo tunnels beat your feet.

162
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,140
No.

163
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,200
Guards.

164
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,640
Keep away.

165
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,880
I am one of the most powerful and top-ranked figures of Songωςdu Aqui.

166
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,560
Anyone who sees and sees someone

167
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,680
But he doesn't look like a bed.

168
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,000
So you were just testing him.

169
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,200
Right.

170
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,680
Do you want to hide this from Young Master?

171
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,560
He's been looking for a way out lately.

172
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,920
Don't tell that silly guy.

173
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Don't be sad.

174
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,200
Yes.

175
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,840
Don't worry, Master.

176
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,600
We can get it done.

177
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,120
But it is kind of risky.

178
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,720
If we take a look before it'd snap,

179
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,640
the Fairy will be doomed.

180
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,320
Go out.

181
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,800
올라.

182
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,360
Go out.

183
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,520
At present...

184
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,080
Strange.

185
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,960
Is there a видеоistic thing?

186
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,980
No.

187
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,060
They just don't know it.

188
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,440
Your due date now means

189
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,100
that tu inexpensive

190
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,280
is going to disappear as soon as it is available.

191
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,900
Then why do they buy the moment

192
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,760
when a con師 came?

193
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,900
You just came and started to recall all these.

194
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,360
Jeez,

195
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,060
our relationship starts now.

196
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,220
I'm dead.

197
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,220
Then you'd better die.

198
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,580
Are you afraid of me?

199
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,340
Of course.

200
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,100
Is this the dream I owe you?

201
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,660
So you're making me confused?

202
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,980
What about the ring?

203
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,540
Is it real?

204
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,380
Or have you

205
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,300
always kept it by your side?

206
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,940
After you've thought it over,

207
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,180
I'll listen to the truth.

208
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,940
I've never taken it.

209
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,060
I've always

210
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,820
kept it by my side.

211
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,660
I've never taken it.

212
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,900
I want to find it.

213
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,900
I really want to find it.

214
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,860
It's something I can't find

215
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,060
and I want to find it again.

216
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,060
I'll come back.

217
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,900
I don't care if you're playing the game

218
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,500
or your painting.

219
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,420
How many needles

220
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,580
and how many guns

221
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,900
are there in the game.

222
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,220
You must always keep it

223
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,260
and never stop.

224
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,380
Let's never never��

225
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,580
the time or the subscription.

226
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,500
I don't want to talk with you like this.

227
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,460
You have to find it and never mind.

228
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,140
I want to find it and never mind.

229
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,740
I want to find it.

230
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:53,940
Just one more time.

231
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,060
This way
