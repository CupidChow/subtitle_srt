1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
I can't let myself go

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,600
Episode 1

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,520
Yue Fu and Yue Mu are over there.

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,680
You want to find a good person like Wen Lan?

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,200
Ya Ya, let's go over there.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,600
Okay.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,760
Mr. Peng.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,520
Long time no see.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,640
Ya Ya, wait for me.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,160
This is...

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,040
I knew that Chiyuan City wasn't that cool.

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,440
That boat had a bomb.

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,200
We were all stuck in the boat and couldn't get off.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,120
What?

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,680
You didn't follow our agreement.

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,880
You're the one who's responsible for the consequences.

17
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:44,800
Ya Ya.

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,240
Wen Lan.

19
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,880
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,080
Let's cancel our engagement.

21
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,760
Thank you.

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,760
Thank you.

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,520
What's going on?

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,160
What's going on?

25
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,720
What's wrong?

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,120
You're afraid Jiang Yao won't come?

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,920
She won't.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,280
At least she's your wife.

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,680
You treat her like this.

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,000
Isn't that good?

31
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,880
What's wrong?

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,000
You're in pain.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,840
No.

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,800
I'm worried about Wen Lan.

35
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,880
After all, Mo Ming Qi is going to be snatched by her uncle.

36
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,520
No, no, no.

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,000
I mean,

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,160
the city gate is on fire.

39
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,880
It's so cruel.

40
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,120
It's so cruel.

41
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,480
I'm helping her.

42
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,800
She's young.

43
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,040
She's not easy to deal with.

44
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,600
She's a bad person.

45
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,920
I should help her

46
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,200
with her uncle's

47
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,160
decision.

48
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,160
I'm so touched.

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,520
But let's talk about it.

50
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,400
The Du family failed to get the marriage proposal.

51
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,600
The Du family has a little grudge

52
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,440
with the pirates.

53
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,920
The Du family is so angry.

54
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,320
I'm afraid Jiang Yao will be in trouble.

55
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,320
Really?

56
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,760
She's just in time.

57
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,120
Commander, Miss Jiang is here.

58
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,840
Let her wait outside.

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,160
Zhang Ma,

60
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,480
let go of the water.

61
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,720
I want to bath.

62
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,520
The way you Vote

63
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,360
is really like,

64
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,440
really the way they sleep.

65
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,120
Look how certidunous

66
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,320
I am, young master.

67
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,160
Young master, it's not you.

68
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,480
I am not dumb at all.

69
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,560
I want to take a shower, too.

70
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,120
No, I can't.

71
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,880
I'll let her go.

72
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,680
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,060
You don't know how to please others.

74
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,760
You.

75
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,080
What do you know about me?

76
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,100
I get morning bath

77
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,080
I'm already retired.

78
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,200
So?

79
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,200
Does it have anything to do with me?

80
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,680
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
This is indeed my fault.

82
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,200
I shouldn't have not followed the agreement between us.

83
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,840
I sincerely apologize to you.

84
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,840
Please forgive me,

85
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,440
but I won't let you down.

86
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,440
Please tell the crown prince to let them go.

87
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
It's too late.

88
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,240
I gave you a chance.

89
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,440
Wurong,

90
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,440
tell the crown prince...

91
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,240
How can I do it?

92
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,240
You can't be angry.

93
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,120
You should consider it.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,720
I'm listening.

95
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,520
Is the aanatak not Indian?

96
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,520
I'll say the same.

97
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,240
It's all right.

98
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,840
Jiang Yao is gone and you are head up like a superior in the Ocean.

99
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,040
Why didn't you force them to go?

100
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,320
Hurry, close the window.

101
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,400
It's still warm in the daytime.

102
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,280
It's going to snow tonight.

103
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,280
How come the weather in Zhao City

104
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,760
is so new to the girl?

105
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,760
It's so hard to imagine.

106
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,440
Teacher, it's snowing outside.

107
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,480
Jiang Yao?

108
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,880
Teacher.

109
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,680
It looks cold.

110
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,240
But what is she doing?

111
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,600
Is she trying to use the way of the bitter meat to devour your sympathy?

112
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,480
Or is she saying that she knows that you don't want her to live a better life

113
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,480
and that she wants to eliminate you from this way of self-reflection?

114
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,720
You refuse me.

115
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,740
oidTSs

116
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,520
So we've reached the end.

117
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,640
The desperate past isAD중에

118
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,080
with your voice,

119
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,480
now I have doubts.

120
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,280
So I can't ignore you.

121
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,440
I firmly establish a retainer.

122
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes, I die.

123
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,240
I keep disappears,

124
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,440
then gone already…

125
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,920
I continue to insist

126
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,200
to keep you EPIPHEAL.

127
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,440
Your last lady is coming.

128
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,400
After it's all gone,

129
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,080
she will never leave.

130
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,400
With such gusto,

131
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,200
you'd better not咬 my body again.

132
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,880
Kay.

133
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,400
Then I can drive you out.

134
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,160
I'll go take a bath.

135
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,040
Yes.

136
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,520
My lady.

137
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,520
You must not take my decision.

138
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,720
If you want to hit the flower with me,

139
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,880
this is to protect my secret.

140
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,120
I want to beat you.

141
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,120
Then you can do your work first. I won't disturb you.

142
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,320
The snow is beautiful tonight. Did you see it?

143
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,920
You came here just to experience the different things in Ou City.

144
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,920
The snow is beautiful.

145
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,920
It's different from Jiangbei.

146
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,880
Wu Qi, enemies of the invisible lush mountains have gone unhappy.

147
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,720
I would forgive later if I understand.

148
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,720
The new world is מדraaking each version of this true version.

149
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,720
Look, we don't want what the Emperor told us to do.

150
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,720
What do you mean the characteristic of the Emperor?

151
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,920
What position do you require me to serve?

152
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,920
what happened between you and Yan Zhou.

153
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,280
But I guess

154
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,920
if you leave the house,

155
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,920
you won't agree.

156
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,720
You wear so little,

157
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,760
it will hurt.

158
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,280
Xie Xia.

159
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,280
I'm the one who's kind to her.

160
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,240
It's just a touch.

161
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,040
I can't take it.

162
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,640
Miss, look at her.

163
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,240
She's not a good girl.

164
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,400
I told you,

165
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,600
you shouldn't care about her.

166
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,840
Let her move out.

167
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,840
Xiu, don't say that.

168
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,120
I don't hate you.

169
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,800
If I take this touch,

170
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,480
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble tonight.

171
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,800
But you wear...

172
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,760
I don't know what you call me.

173
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,080
My name is Zhou Yumin.

174
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,480
You can call me Yumin like Yan Zhou.

175
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,040
Miss Zhou, I'm Jiang Yao.

176
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,680
Miss Jiang, I'm glad to meet you.

177
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,520
Hurry and pull your Miss in.

178
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,920
It's so cold outside.

179
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,320
I'm about to fall.

180
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,800
Miss, let's go back.

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,200
I'm cold.

182
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,560
Miss Jiang.

183
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,480
It's okay.

184
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,640
You and Yan Zhou are one after another.

185
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,880
Miss Zhou.

186
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,040
Miss Jiang.

187
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,000
Have you changed your mind?

188
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,560
You're so kind.

189
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,600
I'm sure Yan Zhou will be happy

190
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,440
to be with you.

191
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,920
I wish you two

192
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,040
a long and beautiful life.

193
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,760
My silly daughter.

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,920
I can't stay without you.

195
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,760
What's wrong with me?

196
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,200
Sister.

197
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,880
Firefly

198
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,880
Ancestor.

199
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,480
Ancestor.

200
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,040
Give each of you a call.

201
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,920
I'm sorry.

202
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,120
It's too late to run away.

203
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,880
Don't make yourself in trouble.

204
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,280
Go back.

205
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,560
But Miss Jiang...

206
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,400
Let her stand.

207
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,080
Thank you for your blessing, Miss Jiang.

208
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,280
We'll live a long and beautiful life together.

209

00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,320
Our Gu Ye

212
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,040
is very nice to Miss Jiang.

213
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,960
I advise you

214
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,960
to keep your bad habits.

215
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,560
Otherwise,

216
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,160
you'll die here tonight.

217
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,800
Our Gu Ye

218
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,040
won't look at you.

219
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,880
You don't care about him?

220
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,960
I should die.

221
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,160
If you really want him to die,

222
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,480
why don't you come out?

223
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,360
What's wrong with you?

224
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,200
