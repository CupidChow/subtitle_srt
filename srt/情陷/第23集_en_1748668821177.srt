1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I won't let you down

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I won't let you down

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let you down

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I won't let you down

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I won't let you down

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I won't let you down

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I won't let you down

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I won't let you down

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I won't let you down

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I won't let you down

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't let you down

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I won't let you down

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I won't let you down

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 1

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I haven't held such a marriage for years.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm really touched when you're back.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm in a good mood.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I missed it this time.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't know how many years I'll have to wait.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If I say it again,

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't know how many times I'll see such a marriage.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm afraid.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You're too painful.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The stars are falling.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The sky is bright.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
As long as the light is not extinguished,

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
then the sky will be bright.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Even if the light is extinguished,

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and there's a blood-sucking atmosphere,

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
many people are willing to die.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In exchange, this big and beautiful sky.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Are you one of those people?

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You must be.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Why are you so sure?

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's all thanks to you that you locked me up in the car.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I found a physical road design on the car.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's a bit strange.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
How strange?

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's a...

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
a straight-line road design.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What's wrong with a straight-line road design?

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
There are such designs on roads, on the road, and on the road.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
There are some.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But generally speaking,

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
a straight-line road design

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
is a way to avoid the danger.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's not necessary.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Before I came here,

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I looked at our map.

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Your map is not completely avoided.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That is to say,

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
you designed it on purpose.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
For the sake of

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
slow down the process of progress,

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
even the whole process of breaking through,

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and wasting the wealth of the evil party.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
In addition,

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I can't think of other reasons.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If as you say,

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't want this railway to be built,

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
then why should I cooperate with the mountain police?

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You can do that.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But if we do that,

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
we will cooperate with the Dujian Mountain.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Even if we kill the Dujian Mountain,

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
there will still be tens of thousands of Dujian Mountains.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Can we kill them?

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Teacher Jiang,

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
you are very smart.

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Do you know

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
your plans for Jiangbei?

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If Jiangbei finds out in the future,

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
will you be angry?

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If we really get to that day,

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
there will be a war.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
We can't avoid it.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You can't fight Jiangbei.

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If everyone is afraid of death,

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
they won't be able to see the sky.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
They won't be able to see the life.

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So you are hiding it from me?

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Because you have already prepared for the death?

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Welcome here.

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Then let's just go.

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Sister Yao Yao!

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Sister Yao Yao!

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Sister Yao Yao!

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Sister Yao Yao, come and play with us!

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Let's go down first.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Xiao Hai is still waiting.

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let's take her to the fair.

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Sister Yao Yao!

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Thank you for sending me home late.

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Have a good rest.

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Recently, Wen Lan is in a bad mood.

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We need to take more time to prepare for the wedding.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm not sure if I can get married soon.

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm not sure.

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm not sure.

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm not sure.

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm not sure.

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We need to visit her more.

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Teacher Jiang is looking after you.

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We're going to sign the contract with the police tomorrow.

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I hope everything will be fine.

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
If there's anything we need to help,

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
we will definitely help you.

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm going in.

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Sign the contract tomorrow.

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll come to you.

113
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll go in first.

114
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yao Yao!

115
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Uncle Qing Jia?

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What are you two doing?

117
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Mom.

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Mom.

119
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I can explain to you.

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What do you mean?

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Hurry up and leave.

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm warning you.

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Don't try to hit my daughter.

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I know that your military skills are worse than that of a murderer.

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Our Yao Yao is still young.

126
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
She's a good girl.

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But we're not family.

128
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
We're not afraid of you.

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Mom, it's not what you think.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Don't talk.

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You and Wen Lan got married.

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I saw Wen Lan's kind heart.

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I agreed to it.

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But it doesn't mean I can allow you and Han Jian...

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Prince Jia.

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Hurry up and leave.

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Did you hear that?

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm not afraid of you.

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm afraid of you.

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll visit my aunt next time.

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We don't need to.

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Don't be so rude.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What are you looking at?

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Let's go.

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm telling you.

146
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Whether you're willing or not,

147
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I won't allow you to be friends with her.

148
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Did you hear that?

149
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Mom, she's actually quite nice.

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Think about it carefully.

151
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Think it over, okay?

152
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What's wrong with you?

153
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I didn't look at her.

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I looked at her uncle.

155
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What are you looking at?

156
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You're so good at it.

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I forgot something.

158
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What?

159
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You're not going to say goodbye?

160
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
That's so unkind.

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You don't have to say goodbye.

169
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'll go talk to her.

170
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Okay.

171
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You're not going to say goodbye?

172
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll leave you alone.

173
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'll go back to my room.

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'll go back to my room.

175
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'll go back to my room.

176
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Just go back.

177
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll go back.

178
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You're not going to say goodbye?

179
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I don't want to be in your life.

180
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't want to be in your life.

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The flower has fallen into the river

182
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Is it a放手 or a smile?

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The answer is in your eyes

184
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I have never been alone

185
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's your light walk

186
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
How old are you?

187
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The pain of the flower has fallen

188
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It has fallen

189
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Mr.Yamai, I'm a teacher

190
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Who?

191
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm a student of Duu

192
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Duu?

193
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The one Duu Jianshan sent to you

194
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'll go now

195
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Xu Yanzhou, Jiang You?

196
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You're so good

197
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The flowers are here

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Have a look

199
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Miss, here are the flowers

200
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
How's the time?

201
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Don't worry, everything is fine

202
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
We're going to work with the Oirat

203
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I hope we can get along

204
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Miss Jiang, Mr.Shanjing is here

205
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Mr. Chi, you're very accurate

206
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Please have a look

207
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Sir, can we start the contract?

208
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
We must sign the contract

209
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Before signing the contract

210
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We need to confirm something with the young commander

211
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Please tell me

212
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I received a letter

213
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It says that Miss Jiang who came to my room a few days ago

214
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Is a member of the Flying Bird Society

215
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And you are their partner

216
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes

217
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
If I'm right

218
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
This letter is for Mr. Du Du

219
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You know

220
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He hates to see me working with you

221
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
He sent someone to assassinate me a few days ago

222
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,200
He just wanted to die and took me as a spy

223
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,600
to destroy our cooperation plan.

224
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,600
I also talked to Du Jianshan.

225
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,600
I know his true colors and intentions.

226
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,600
But I know more about the young master's true colors.

227
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,800
So I can't believe him.

228
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
Please investigate.

229
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,200
But I trust the young master.

230
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,600
I have to give an explanation to this matter.

231
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,400
So, please prove that

232
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:29,000
you are not a coward.

233
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,400
How to prove it?

234
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Please come with me.

235
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,800
Understood.
