1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We are all destined to be together

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
From the start of our life, we have decided to separate

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We are the traces of love

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I am like you, how can I leave you here?

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I listen to the sound of a falling tree, I miss you so much

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I miss you so much, I miss your voice

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't want to be separated from you, I don't want to be separated from you

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I listen to the sound of a falling tree, I miss you so much

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am like you, how can I leave you here?

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I listen to the sound of a falling tree, I miss you so much

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I am like you, how can I leave you here?

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Is there any anger in your hands?

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't have any power

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Thank you for your kindness, I have to go

15
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I don't have any power

16
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Flowers, flowers, look at the flowers

17
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Look at the flowers

18
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Flowers

19
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
How to sell them?

20
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
How to choose?

21
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Miss, buy a flower

22
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Help me pick a tree

23
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Ok

24
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Everything goes well

25
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The medicine has been released from the boat, Chen Yanzhou didn't get it

26
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Du Jianshan wants to take my father's wound to work with me

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This medicine is a waste, it's not a pity

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This means, if Chen Yanzhou suddenly comes to the city

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and takes away the medicine

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Now you give the medicine to us

31
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Is it really just to kill you?

32
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm afraid it's not easy

33
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I will keep their image

34
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Jiang Yao, there is one more thing, don't blame me for being drunk

35
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You and Chen Yanzhou have blood and blood

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No matter what, don't put yourself in

37
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I dare not

38
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Flowers, flowers, come and see

39
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Miss Jiang

40
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Please, Your Excellency

41
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Young Marshal, Miss Jiang is taken away

42
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You said you would get married if you were to say it

43
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You really don't give me the face of Du Jianshan

44
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This matter should be asked well

45
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But they are still young and don't know anything

46
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Don't make yourself angry

47
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes

48
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's time to say it

49
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Uncle Du

50
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't call me uncle, I can't afford it

51
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I won't bother you today

52
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Give me a reason to get married

53
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
If it's reasonable, you can leave

54
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Otherwise

55
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Don't blame me

56
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I will give your father a face

57
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This marriage is indeed my fault

58
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
If I say reason

59
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
No

60
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
No

61
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Miss Jiang, you are right

62
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This marriage is so simple

63
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Just say it

64
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Is Miss Jiang not in the heart of Wenlan

65
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You think too much, Young Marshal

66
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I think you are not a good girl

67
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm tired

68
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Dad

69
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Dad, don't bother Yao Yao

70
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It has nothing to do with Yao Yao

71
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Get back without your business

72
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yao Yao is in trouble

73
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
There is no reason to ruin her

74
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Brother-in-law, why don't you listen to me

75
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What do you want to say

76
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
If you really wronged Miss Jiang

77
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's not good to tell the president

78
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You are the whole Ou City

79
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
If you really want to take her away

80
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You can't run away

81
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yes, uncle said it was right

82
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Ok, I'll listen to you

83
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Tell me a reason

84
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Dad, it's to blame

85
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You can only blame your son

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Can't blame Yao Yao

87
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's my fault

88
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I hurt Yao Yao first

89
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Dad, sit down

90
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Dad, you know

91
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Your son is always

92
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Windy and beautiful

93
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yao Yao loves me

94
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Love her is to die

95
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
All day long, I can't do it

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The result

97
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Dinghun was found that

98
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't love her at all

99
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
She can't stand this wrong

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So she got married at that time

101
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yes, I admit

102
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yao Yao is a big heart

103
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But it's because she loves me too much

104
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So you say

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Can this be blamed

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Blame it on the medicine

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Your son is too arrogant

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Miss Jiang, is what she said true

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Dad, I swear

110
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I said it without a lie

111
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yao Yao, tell my dad and uncle

112
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Are you still loving me?

113
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes

114
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I am very loving

115
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So I can't tolerate her not loving me

116
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I was the one who got married

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
To make the result

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Miss Jiang is so affectionate

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So affectionate

120
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Dad, look

121
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I didn't say anything

122
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You are so shameless

123
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I won't kill you

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Come back

125
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yao Yao

126
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You still protect her

127
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Look at me and I won't kill you

128
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Brother-in-law, this whip is also a lesson

129
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
If Wen Lan is hurt

130
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I still love you

131
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yao Yao, are you stupid?

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I think I am a big heart

133
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But I can kill a cow

134
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Then I can't watch you get hurt

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Then I don't care

136
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't want to eat the whip

137
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Go and apologize to your dad

138
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Dad, don't be angry

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yao Yao knows it wrong this time

140
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Chief officer

141
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Close the door immediately

142
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yes, without my order

143
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
No one is allowed to go

144
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Miss Jiang

145
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Not sent

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Thank you uncle

147
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Young master, please

148
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What do you want? I still have to send Yao Yao to the hospital

149
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Your dad is still angry

150
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
No matter how hard you try, you can't change anything

151
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You don't have to care about me

152
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Sorry, I have to contact you

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Don't talk about these

154
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Take care of your wound first

155
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Qiao Qiao

156
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Help me send Yao Yao to the hospital

157
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Take care of her

158
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
No need

159
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I can go by myself

160
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
How can that be

161
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You are injured because of me

162
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I...

163
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:36,060
Chief officer, take the

164
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,060
Young master, goodbye

165
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,060
Chief officer, Miss Jiang has left

166
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,060
What should we do now?

167
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,060
Send someone to watch her

168
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,060
She thought she could hide the reason for the small gap

169
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,060
What suspicious situation?

170
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,060
Send me back immediately

171
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,060
Yes, go

172
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,060
Go

173
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,060
Looks like Du Jian Shan is already suspecting this

174
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,060
Let's go

175
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,060
Selling the newspaper

176
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,060
Let me have a look

177
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,060
Selling the newspaper

178
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,060
Look

179
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,060
Selling the newspaper

180
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,060
I'm not afraid of the future.

181
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,060
I'm not afraid of the future.

182
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,060
I'm not afraid of the future.

183
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,060
I'm not afraid of the future.

184
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,060
I'm not afraid of the future.

185
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,060
I'm not afraid of the future.

186
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,060
I'm not afraid of the future.

187
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,060
I'm not afraid of the future.

188
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,060
I'm not afraid of the future.

189
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,060
I'm not afraid of the future.

190
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,060
