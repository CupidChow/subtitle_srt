1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I won't let you down

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I won't let you down

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let you down

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I won't let you down

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I won't let you down

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I won't let you down

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I won't let you down

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I won't let you down

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I won't let you down

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I won't let you down

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't let you down

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I won't let you down

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I won't let you down

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 1

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 1

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Miss Zhou

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I thought you wouldn't come

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Sorry

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
My dad fell ill yesterday

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How's your wound?

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Is it better?

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The medicine for the flu is very strong

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It won't hurt the next day

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's good

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This restaurant looks like a shopping mall

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
In fact, in addition to this door

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Everyone is a person who can't even eat a bite of rice

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There are two worlds here

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's almost pink

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Nothing

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I just have some surprises

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Like you, the great master of Jing Yi Yuxi

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I should rarely be able to observe

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
the pitiful people in the restaurant

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yes

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Like me, the great master of Jing Yi Yuxi

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
who is respected and respected

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
should be in this world of dancing

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Like me, the great master of Jing Yi Yuxi

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
should be in this world of dancing

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Like these people

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I can take a photo and laugh

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
if I act well

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If I act badly, I'll be in trouble

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Simple

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Just keep going

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's good

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Why do you think of those things

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
that are not relevant to yourself

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're so annoying

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Do you remember what you said to me

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
when you first met me?

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What?

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You said you should be like a new person

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's good that he keeps going

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's good that he keeps going

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's good that he keeps going

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's all the other people's idea

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If you have a good heart

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
you should stick to yourself

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Even if this hope is very weak

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But because of the weak

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
he has become very expensive

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Am I right?

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You're right

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Just because he wants to be weak

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's why he's so expensive

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
There is one more thing

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I will return to Jiangbei

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
In a few days

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So soon

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You will leave tomorrow

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's okay

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I will leave in two days

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
when I get to Jiangbei

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I can visit you

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Ok

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Although Jiangbei is not more than

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
a繁華

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
it must be better

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It must be more delicious.

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Then I'll go try it.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll go out for a while.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Wait for me.

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm selling flowers.

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Which one do you want?

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I want this one.

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
One piece.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Brother Jinan.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Wenlan?

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What a coincidence.

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You're here too?

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Come here for dinner.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You have a date with your family?

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm coming.

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But I don't have the time to do that.

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm here to see your aunt.

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
My aunt?

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The lady in Jiangbei.

103
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'll leave you alone.

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We'll talk later.

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm here to see your aunt.

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm here to see your aunt.

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm here to see your aunt.

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We'll talk later.

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Brother Jinan.

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I finally found you.

111
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The old man said

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Jiangbei and the army are not well these days.

113
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He's afraid you'll be in danger.

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
How about

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I come back to you?

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Brother Jinan.

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I know you're worried about me.

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But I'm safe now.

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yumin.

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What kind of friend are you?

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You have to go today.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I think

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
you should pretend to be a big man.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You're the one who doesn't let people worry, right?

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So you're my aunt.

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I know, Brother Jinan.

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I should have known her.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I have a friend who wants to talk to me.

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll be out soon.

130
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay.

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Then hurry up.

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Why is he still not back?

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He said he didn't come back.

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Where did he go?

135
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I think you didn't come back.

136
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So I wanted to come out to see you.

137
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I just

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
saw a friend.

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
He came to pick me up.

140
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So soon,

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll go to see him.

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So soon?

143
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Is there anything?

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
My family has something to do.

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I might have to go back first.

146
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay.

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh, right.

148
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You went out to buy flowers just now.

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Where are the flowers?

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Mr. Du.

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Thank you for the flowers you gave me.

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Do you want to have dinner with me?

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Okay.

154
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I beg you.

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He...

156
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Friend.

157
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't you have something urgent?

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Then I won't keep you.

159
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I don't need to give you.

160
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
No need.

161
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Goodbye.

162
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Mr. Du,

163
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
which table shall we sit?

164
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You can eat by yourself.

165
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Didn't we say we should eat well?

166
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Why didn't you say anything?

167
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I can't eat.

168
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I can't eat.

169
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I can't eat.

170
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Come on, sister.

171
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Come on, sister.

172
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Come on, sister.

173
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Why is it so hot today?

174
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
A friend gave me a lot of supplies.

175
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The kids are getting married.

176
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
My friend?

177
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That one.

178
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Mr. Chi.

179
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Mr. Chi, you've done a lot of bad things.

180
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You're afraid of being beaten by ghosts at night.

181
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Hurry up and do some good things to make up for it.

182
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Come on.

183
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Take it.

184
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Thank you.

185
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Go ahead.

186
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Chen Anzhong, have you ever thought about it?

187
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Because you're willing to work with the pirates.

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If they want to eat this again,

189
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
they'll only be able to eat it.

190
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Miss Jiang is really a good teacher.

191
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
She never lets go of the chance to teach.

192
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We don't eat what the pirates give us.

193
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Give it back to him.

194
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Are you really a traitor?

195
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You liar.

196
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You said you were a man.

197
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You should have kicked the enemy out.

198
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You liar.

199
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What are you doing?

200
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Who said you were a traitor?

201
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm a traitor.

202
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Of course you can't understand.

203
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You still don't understand.

204
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay.

205
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Stop talking.

206
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Xiao Hai.

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's not easy to eat something when you're in a mess.

208
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Even if it's from a bad person,

209
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
you have to force yourself to eat it.

210
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's a good thing to have a good wife.

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But you can't be a good wife.

212
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
If we have the strength,

213
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
we can drive the bad out.

214
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Teacher.

215
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Why didn't you tell Jiang Yao?

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
We've agreed to work with the pirates.

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
She promised to kill me.

218
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
She's already betrayed me.

219
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
She's speechless.

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
She's speechless.

221
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Chen Yanzhong.

222
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Miss Jiang, what else do you want?

223
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I forgot.

224
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I have something to give you.

225
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll give it to you when you're done.

226
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
This is you he originally was.

227
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Now I don't want it.

228
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Give it back to you.

229
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,200
Move, Move

230
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,600
Blast aside

231
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,360
They ran off again

232
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,940
What?!

233
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,400
They couldn't get up.

234
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,160
Go in right now you're leaving

235
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,700
Bye

236
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,400
After that, we have been together for a long time

237
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,400
From the time we were together, we have decided to let you go

238
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,400
It's a love trap

239
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,400
I'm repeating myself, how do I get rid of you?

240
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,400
I hear the sound of rain falling, I think of you again and again

241
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,400
I miss you so much, I miss your voice

242
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:36,400
I don't want to be separated from you, I don't want to be separated from you

243
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,400
I hear the sound of rain falling, I think of you again and again

244
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,400
I'm still brave, I still don't want to give up

245
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:53,400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

246
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

247
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Love is too much, I want to be with you

248
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,400
I don't know who is more sad

249
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:43,400
Is it the color of the moon that can be seen?

250
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,400
Is it because I'm too much, I'm getting tired of it

251
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,400
Or am I not willing to let go of you?

252
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,400
I'm more willing to let go, I'll never let go

253
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Love is too much, I want to be with you

254
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,400
I'm still brave, I still don't want to give up

255
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

256
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:15,400
Love is too much, I want to be with you

257
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:20,400
I've seen the light, but I'm still confused

258
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,400
I don't want to be separated from you
