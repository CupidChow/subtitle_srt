The End

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Episode 19

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
Goodbye.

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,800
Did I ask you to leave?

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,600
What else do you want?

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
Come here.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,200
Didn't I say that I would be with you till the end?

27
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,400
You are the one who will be with you till the end.

28
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,400
If I don't like it,

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,000
you can have a bite to take.

30
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll do it.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Teacher, that gun...

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,600
Chen Anzhu, you're crazy. You're shooting at me.

34
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,000
Get out!

35
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,200
Young Marshal, can I leave now?

36
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,200
Jiang Yao, you are really a true warrior.

37
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,200
Get out.

38
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,000
That's weird. Why is there another woman in the Young Marshal's Manor?

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,400
Young Marshal is also a true warrior. He is going to marry Xiao Jianlin soon.

40
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,400
He even asked for another woman to come in.

41
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,600
Could it be him?

42
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Jiang Yao, did he still threaten you?

43
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
That's weird.

44
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,600
Since that day,

45
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Chen Anzhu, you've been acting like a woman.

46
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,400
Chen Anzhu, you think I'm the one who has the green skin on me?

47
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,600
And this little dress is pretty.

48
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,200
Chen Anzhu.

49
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,200
Chen Anzhu.

50
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Chen Anzhu.

51
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,000
What's Miss Jiang doing lately?

52
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,200
No need to check. She's holding a game.

53
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,400
You can do anything!

54
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,200
Yes.

55
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,200
Why didn't you think so before?

56
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,600
Now I realize that we two are quite match.

57
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,400
Being able to match Young Marshal Du is my honor.

58
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,400
That's right.

59
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,600
I think we should stop acting in front of the elders.

60
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,400
Let's just pretend to be true.

61
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,000
To make you happy,

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,800
I can give up my one-sided love.

63
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,000
Thank you.

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,600
You should enjoy your one-sided love.

65
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,400
Look at Wen Lan and Yao Yao. They are so match.

66
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,800
Yao Yao, you refused me.

67
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
I feel so sorry.

68
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,200
If you have any feelings, just say it.

69
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,800
These clothes are so deep.

70
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Everyone,

71
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,400
come and join my son's engagement.

72
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Please take care of this little couple in the future.

73
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,200
Come, drink.

74
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,600
Okay.

75
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
My daughter, I'll leave it to you.

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,200
Okay, Chief Jiang. Don't worry.

77
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,400
I won't be able to treat her.

78
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,360
Mom!
