1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I won't say that I'm going to be a burden

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I won't say that I'm going to be a burden

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't say that I'm going to be a burden

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I won't say that I'm going to be a burden

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I won't say that I'm going to be a burden

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I won't say that I'm going to be a burden

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I won't say that I'm going to be a burden

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I won't say that I'm going to be a burden

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I won't say that I'm going to be a burden

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I won't say that I'm going to be a burden

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I won't say that I'm going to be a burden

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't say that I'm going to be a burden

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I won't say that I'm going to be a burden

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I won't say that I'm going to be a burden

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 1

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Do you like him?

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Do you like him?

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Then you don't like him either, either, do you?

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I hope you won't say that.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Because I'm not happy.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm jealous.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Master Du said all those things to many girls.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He doesn't trust the emperor, he's the first one.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What about the girls that would attacked Master Du?

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,840
Or he said...

26
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,000
Master Du is a girl who can ì£¼ove everyone around him.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I really thought he would lend a helping hand.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,240
Then don't you trust him either?

29
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,400
The girls that killed Master Du don't trust us?

30
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
I was waiting for you.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,600
But then I saw Ji Nangge at the door.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,800
I knew

33
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,200
you were the lady who stayed in Jiangbei.

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
I know you and I have an engagement.

35
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,200
But I don't know

36
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,400
you have explained it clearly.

37
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Anyway,

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,800
it's all my fault.

39
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,200
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,800
So,

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Miss Zhou,

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,400
should be jealous?

43
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm not jealous.

44
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
I'm jealous.

45
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
I'm not telling you.

46
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
I'm not telling you.

47
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,000
Thank you.

48
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Ladies and gentlemen.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,200
Thank you for

50
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,600
coming to my birthday party.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,800
Please take care of your health.

52
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,400
I hope you can be safe tonight.

53
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
Thank you.

54
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
Mr. Shan Jing.

55
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,200
You are...

56
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
My name is Jiang Yang.

57
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,800
My father is Jiang Yeming.

58
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
I've been feeling sick recently.

59
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,400
I didn't come to your birthday party.

60
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
So you're the future president of Jiang.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,600
You're so polite.

63
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll have more chances in the future.

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,800
But

65
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,800
I'm lucky to have you today.

66
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
You're so pretty.

67
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
It's an unexpected surprise.

68
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,000
This is

69
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,000
a gift I brought you.

70
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
What is it?

71
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,800
A gift.

72
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,600
I hope you'll like it.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,800
Like it?

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,600
I like it very much.

75
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,200
Miss Jiang.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,600
If you can bring it to my room

77
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,200
and bring it to me personally,

78
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,400
I'll like it even more.

79
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,000
This is my honor.

80
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,400
What's wrong?

81
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,600
Jiang Yang went to the room of Dr. Shan Jing.

82
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,000
He didn't want to kill you.

83
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,800
But Dr. Shan Jing.

84
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
But there's no reason.

85
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,600
He dares to deal with Dr. Shan Jing.

86
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,600
He can't leave this meeting room alive.

87
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,200
I'm afraid he didn't want to leave this meeting room alive.

88
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
He wants to go to the same place with Dr. Shan Jing.

89
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,000
Young Master.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,200
Jiang Yang is going to kill you.

91
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,000
Why do you have to save him?

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,600
Get out of the way.

93
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Miss Jiang.

94
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,800
Don't be unhappy.

95
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,600
I searched the door.

96
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,200
Why do you still search here?

97
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,800
You're all ugly men.

98
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,800
No one can enter my door.

99
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,400
Besides, Miss Jiang.

100
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,600
You came in, right?

101
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,400
You're really...

102
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Mr. Shan Jing.

103
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
This is the gift I gave you personally.

104
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,400
If you don't wear it,

105
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,600
the Zhen family will be sad.

106
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,600
Okay.

107
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
It's beautiful.

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,600
Yes.

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,600
Thank you.

110
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,200
Thank you.

111
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,400
Mr. Chi.

112
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,800
What brings you here?

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,400
Sorry.

114
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't know.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,400
There's a guest in Mr. Shan Jing's room.

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,200
I just want to discuss the details of the cooperation with Mr. Shan Jing.

117
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Please forgive me.

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,400
Okay.

119
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll be there right away.

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,200
Mr. Shan Jing.

121
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,600
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,200
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,400
What's wrong?

124
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,200
Why?

125
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,360
Mr. Shan Jing,

126
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,920
after you lose your lead,

127
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,640
you don't need much time.

128
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,320
Miss Jiang,

129
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,680
your fiancee is waiting for you downstairs.

130
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,760
If you don't go down,

131
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,600
she will come to you.

132
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,160
I have something to do.

133
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,720
When I finish it,

134
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
I'll go to you.

135
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,240
Mr. Shan Jing,

136
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,520
see you later.

137
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,920
Yes.

138
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,680
If you didn't do me a favor just now,

139
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,920
she has already killed my mom.

140
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
I would have killed her.

141
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,000
So you have been killed by her.

142
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,320
It's better for me to watch you

143
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,120
work together.

144
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,680
Since you don't want to work with her,

145
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,480
why didn't you kill me

146
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,680
but kill Shan Jing instead?

147
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,080
You said you didn't know

148
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,680
how to play with her and kill her.

149
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,800
If you kill her,

150
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,480
you can stop this cooperation.

151
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,280
Jiang Yao,

152
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,600
have you thought it through?

153
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,600
If you want to kill Shan Jing,

154
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,160
this is a dead end.

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,680
That's a good thing

156
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,680
that I was able to repeat

157
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,720
the five years ago.

158
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,600
I've already apologized to Yan Zhou once.

159
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,000
I can't do it again.

160
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,240
You can't kill me.

161
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,040
I just think that if I kill you,

162
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,600
Shan Jing will work with others.

163
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,360
I'd rather kill

164
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
the imperial doctor

165
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,080
and have a good life.

166
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,640
This is a good reason.

167
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,200
What are you doing?

168
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,400
I'm giving you a chance.

169
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,840
Kill me.

170
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,520
At least, you can guarantee

171
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,640
that I can't sign

172
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,840
the contract with her.

173
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,480
Do it.

174
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,120
What's the point of hesitating?

175
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,840
Didn't you already

176
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,920
get ready to die?

177
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,040
What are you afraid of?

178
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,680
Zhiyuan,

179
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,960
don't compare me.

180
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,040
Zhiyuan curls her face.

181
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Zhiyuan is oching.

182
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,080
You're unwilling to kill me,

183
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
so you can no longer

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,640
pay respects to Shan Jing.

185
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:43,920
I'm not.

186
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,360
Come.

187
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480
What's going on between these two?

188
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,840
Let's go over there.

189
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,000
Don't disturb them.

190
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,400
Let's go.

191
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,400
We can't pass here.

192
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,040
No.

193
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,600
I'm just a railway worker.

194
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,800
I have to ask her.

195
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,920
Since you don't want to kill me,

196
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,360
don't blame me.

197
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,560
Achen does BellePuy

198
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,360
I'll kill her.

199
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,400
Let me kill her then.

200
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,640
A ××  crowd said

201
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,260
you won't be forced to go to the left of theOOOOO

202
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,320
from brightly lit carriages.

203
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,200
You don't believe me.

204
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,280
Don't you care the whole family?

205
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,560
There's no need for you to get killed.

206
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,620
We certainly do,

207
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Stay here.

208
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,520
If you regret it, kill me again.

209
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,480
When I come back,

210
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,680
you'll be in pain.

211
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,120
Let me out now!

212
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,640
Qianzhou!

213
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,800
Strange.

214
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,200
Where is she?

215
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,480
She just came out.

216
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
We must find them and ask them clearly.

217
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,080
How many things are they hiding from me?

218
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,320
Bastard.

219
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
What is this?

220
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,920
This is the map of the railway

221
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,920
that Chi Yanzhou designed for the bedroom.

222
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,920
Why does it look so strange?

223
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
So this is Chi Yanzhou's plan.

224
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,920
Miss Jiang,

225
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,320
please come in.

226
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,480
This was the main entrance for you.

227
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,400
Just follow me.

228
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,960
Oh, right.

229
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,760
That skirt,

230
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,880
with the pillow and stricts.

231
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,360
Please hurry over.

232
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,520
Young Master.

233
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,760
Why do you draw this up to look like this?

234
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:40,920
I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not afraid of the wind and snow, I'm not
