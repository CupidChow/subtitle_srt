1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I won't let you down

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I won't let you down

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let you down

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I won't let you down

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I won't let you down

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I won't let you down

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I won't let you down

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I won't let you down

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I won't let you down

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I won't let you down

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't let you down

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I won't let you down

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I won't let you down

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I won't let you down

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I won't let you down

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Boss, come on

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Everyone, wait for us

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The auction is starting

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Good, good, good

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll pay 500

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'll pay 650

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll pay 850

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
850

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
1250

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Deal

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
850

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll pay 850

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
880

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
910

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
1350

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Deal

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'll pay 500

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Sister Man, your products

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Just sell them

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Those who have never seen the market

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Before drinking this wine

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
If you are not satisfied with me

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Then the auction will be good

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I guess you should change

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yan Canma, look at you

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Isn't it coming?

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This is the treasure of today

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Everyone, don't miss it

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yan Canma, are you satisfied with this one?

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yes, I'll pay 2000

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yan Canma, you pay 2000

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yan Canma, you are so generous

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Then Miss Zhen'er will return to you tonight

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'll go to the exhibition

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Be careful

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We have a lot of business to do

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We have a lot of business to do

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We have a lot of business to do

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Miss Zhen'er, we have checked

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yan Xuan is lively and colorful

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He is so wild

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He will enter our circle

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll follow this room

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Then I'll do it quietly

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The organization will send people to meet you outside

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You can only do this task to you

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Be careful

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Remember, the goal is to get the medicine in his hand

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The soldiers in the front line

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Are waiting for this to be saved

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So Jiang Yao

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This time we only need to succeed

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We can't fail

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We can't let our comrades

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Succeed in vain

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
20,000

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Hey, Cheng Xin can't live with me, right?

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I want to see who is pretending to be a ghost there

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What's wrong with Ming Zong?

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He only has the second chance

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm going to follow Yan Xuan

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
How dare you to rob a woman with me?

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I even have a party with him

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Who is this?

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What's the name of this? Hurry up

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Chi Yan Chong

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Father

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Father

84
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Father

85
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What are you doing?

86
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Miss Chen Er seems to be very nervous

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Zhen Er

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He didn't get out of the house

89
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,520
You take out the Kanchai

90
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,000
And serve the young master well

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Don't let the young master down

92
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Then you have to lead him well tonight

93
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Miss Chen Er

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Where should we start?

95
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I heard that you girls like this

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
All need to let the guests have a look first

97
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
How about we have a look?

98
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Wait

99
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
This is the first time

100
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm a little nervous

101
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Besides

102
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
There are so many people there

103
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Young master, don't be so happy

104
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes, you continue

105
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If I don't mind being promoted

106
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What are you doing?

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Of course, I will be promoted to the young master

108
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But the young master

109
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Spend a lot of money to send Zhen Er

110
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I just want to wait until the night

111
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Only the two of us

112
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Feel better

113
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I really don't have a good temper

114
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'll let you go this time

115
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I didn't expect that Yan Zhou

116
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Now that he has become the young master of Jiangbei

117
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I heard that the Zhou army will give you a lot of money

118
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
In the next few years

119
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
By the way

120
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It is said that the young master who cheated the young master

121
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The woman who killed the army

122
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Has not found it until now

123
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
She made the Chi family so miserable

124
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Let the capital army die

125
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let the Chi army be divided into five

126
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Don't say that she is blood and blood

127
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Even if she doesn't have a horse, she won't hate it

128
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Correct

129
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Zhen Er, your hands are so bright

130
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What are you afraid of?

131
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I

132
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I just haven't seen anything

133
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I heard you say these things

134
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm afraid

135
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No need

136
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I can't talk about these

137
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yan Zhou is full of money tonight

138
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You should enjoy it

139
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Come, drink

140
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Come, come, come

141
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Come

142
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm

143
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Taking off my clothes

144
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm

145
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Taking off my clothes

146
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm

147
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Taking off my clothes

148
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm

149
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Taking off my clothes

150
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm

151
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I want to take off my clothes

152
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I want to see what kind of sky you have

153
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I dare not listen to the young master

154
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Shen Chong

155
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I can't take it

156
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm too nervous

157
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So nervous

158
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Understand

159
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Take it off

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Continue

161
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Enough

162
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Enough

163
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'll go out first

164
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I can't catch my breath

165
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Wait

166
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
This is Zhen Er

167
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Why is it here?

168
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
If you don't accompany young master

169
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Then accompany me

170
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Sorry, young master

171
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,960
This is Young Marshal.

172
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,440
Get out.

173
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,680
How did Young Marshal come out?

174
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,120
Where are you going?

175
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Zhen'er just wanted to go to the washroom.

176
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,520
Why did Young Marshal come out?

177
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,800
Because it's hard to get you out.

178
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,920
Don't look at me closely.

179
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,640
What if you run away again?

180
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,480
Young Marshal is really alone now.

181
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,600
He can't get away from Zhen'er.

182
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,480
Yes.

183
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,280
I'm confused by you.

184
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,920
It's not a one or two time.

185
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,600
So you've recognized me.

186
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,120
You're not pretending?

187
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,600
Five years ago, you tried to get close to me.

188
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,720
You gave me such a big share.

189
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,720
How can I forget?

190
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,960
Jiang Yao어야aghetti, Long time no see.

191
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,760
Our game will come to an end soon.

192
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,880
