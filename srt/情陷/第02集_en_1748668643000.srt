1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We are all destined to be together

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
From the start of our life, we have decided to part

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's a trace of love

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm like you, how can I get rid of you?

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I hear a sound of a log, I miss you so much

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I miss you so much, I miss your voice

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I don't want to be separated from you

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I don't want to be separated from you

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I hear a sound of a log, I miss you so much

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm like you, how can I get rid of you?

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I hear a sound of a log, I miss you so much

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Episode 1

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Jiang Yao, you go first, you are our teacher, they won't make you feel bad

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's go together

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Jiang Yao, the mission is done, leave the rest to us

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You go first

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Mission, sorry

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Jiang Yao, get up, the breakfast is ready

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I know

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Mom

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I bought it for you

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What's wrong with your mouth?

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm on fire

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Then let the kitchen cook some tender soup, eat slowly

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
President Jiang, why don't you eat?

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The newspaper said that a big person came to the city recently

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The young general of Jiangbei

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's said that Jiangbei will be called to his hands

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Jiangbei Young Marshal Chi Yanzhou

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Isn't he the son of Chi Dujun?

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I heard that he was defeated by a girl

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He lost his important secret in the army

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
He even made the army so fierce

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Isn't it?

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He was taken as a son by the leader of the army

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But recently there is a military law

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This is good for the people

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But this morning it's not about the military

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yao Yao, every few days you and Wenlan's engagement

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That Mr. Fang is always in the city

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I think you have to go out of the city these days

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Ok

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Eat while it's hot, quickly, I'll make you a hot soup

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Du Jun, the medicine was stolen

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What did you say? The medicine was stolen?

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I told you such a big thing

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I told you earlier, isn't it you?

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No, no, no

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You bastard, you can't even hold a bottle of medicine

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'll bite you, bite you, bite you

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Help, help, help, help, I'll go, I'll go

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're wasting my theme

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Sell flowers, sell flowers

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Come and take a look, sell flowers

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Give me some flowers

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Are you ok last night?

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Did Chen Yanzhou trouble you?

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He must be looking for a revenge for that time

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What do you want?

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He's going to be taken away

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The brothers of the group are killed by Chen Yanzhou

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Who took him away?

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Chen Yanzhou

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'll go find him

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No, he came here because of you

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
If you go again, he'll be bitten by the tiger

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Do we have any other way?

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Miao Zhao

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Miao Zhao

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Miao Zhao

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Not only did he take revenge on your old lover

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
but also took away Du Jinshan's medicine

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,200
and made him a suspect between the two

74
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,000
Now he's just waiting to be taken away by the fish king

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Miao Zhao, he's really a master

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This medicine is not just for me

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Your father was also very angry with Du Jinshan

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But who would have thought that even a dog could find the tiger teeth

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He was also the biggest man in the world

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But in the end, Jiang Yao is still the best

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yesterday you took her back

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I thought you could kill her

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
How could you be so tender?

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't underestimate beauty Yun

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Although she looks tender and kind

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
she's very gentle

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
She's free and kind

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
She's even more beautiful

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You know her so well

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You seem to really like her

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Don't touch her

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You're still raising this flower

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Why not?

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
She's just reminding me

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Some things are beautiful

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
but they're poisonous

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Flowers are

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and people are

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Well

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I didn't get the chance to feel it yesterday

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I personally sent it to you today

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's not impossible

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
My life is yours

104
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So you want to die

105
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'll help you

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Jiang Yao

108
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You're just a cheap person

109
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Your life is as simple as a dead horse

110
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
If I kill you like this

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'll be too cheap to be yours

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What do you want to do?

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Of course I want to play with you

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I don't want to eat anything else

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I want to eat

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I told you to go east

117
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You can't go west

118
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I told you to kneel

119
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You can't stand up for me

120
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
How's it, Miss Jiang?

121
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Cheap?

122
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Why? Are you afraid I'll fall asleep?

123
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Maybe one day I'll be in this situation

124
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So if you think it's hard

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
you can't kiss me

126
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Although I like to force people to kiss me

127
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll kiss you

128
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Commerce

129
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yummy

130
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
This is a heh

131
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Throw out the wine

132
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,000
Pose

133
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Clean it up

134
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,320
If you insist,

135
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,680
I won't mind sharing the truth with you.

136
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,840
Goodbye.

137
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,760
Did I ask you to leave?

138
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,280
What else do you want?

139
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,920
Come here.

140
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Love is a dream

141
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Love is a dream

142
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Love is a dream

143
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Love is a dream

144
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Love is a dream

145
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Love is a dream

146
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Love is a dream

147
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Love is a dream

148
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Love is a dream

149
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Love is a dream

150
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Love is a dream

151
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Love is a dream

152
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Love is a dream

153
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Love is a dream

154
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Love is a dream

155
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Love is a dream

156
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Love is a dream

157
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Love is a dream

158
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Love is a dream

159
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Love is a dream

160
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Love is a dream

161
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Love is a dream

162
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Love is a dream

163
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Love is a dream

164
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Love is a dream

165
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Love is a dream

166
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Love is a dream

167
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,200
I'm so sorry. I'm so late.

168
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,000
Maybe I'm not worth it.

169
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'd rather be the one to blame.

170
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll never be free.

171
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,200
Love is in the cold.

172
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,000
The world is full of waves.

173
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,600
The love is in the rain.

174
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,800
The past is in the past.

175
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,000
The past is in the past.

176
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,800
The most familiar place is you.

177
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,000
Love is in the heart.

178
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,200
The past is in the heart.

179
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,800
I can walk with you.

180
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,600
I can't read your story.

181
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
I've seen your dream.

182
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,800
But it's also a lie.

183
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,800
I never forget.
