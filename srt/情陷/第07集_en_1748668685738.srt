1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I won't let you down

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I won't let you down

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let you down

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I won't let you down

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I won't let you down

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I won't let you down

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I won't let you down

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I won't let you down

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I won't let you down

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I won't let you down

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't let you down

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I won't let you down

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I won't let you down

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 1

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
His back has a fever and a high fever.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But we don't have anti-inflammatory.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
If the pirates didn't take the medicine,

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
you'd better watch over him.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Excuse me, where's the house?

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Over there.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Over there? Thank you.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Where is he?

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Miss Jiang, we're here.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Who are you?

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Why did you bring me here?

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Get off.

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Why did you bring me here?

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Du Jian Shan is watching me.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He must know that I'm going to get married.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're so bold.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You'll only get hurt.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I didn't know that you were worried about my safety.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You're thinking too much.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If Du Jian Shan finds out about you,

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
we'll be in trouble for him.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's good.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll take you back to prevent you from getting involved.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You betrayed me in front of Du Jian Shan.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're not the first one to do this.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Get off.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What's wrong?

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Jiang Yao.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Ji Tan.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're so stupid.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You're so stupid.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You can't stand it.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You can't stand it.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's useless.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's useless.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's useless.

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Du Jun, why do you always hit me?

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Don't you sleep?

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Search for me.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Jiang Jia, Xue Tang.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
As long as he's somewhere,

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
don't let him go.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Get out.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Get out.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If I find out that someone is doing something bad,

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'll kill him.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Kill him.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Come on.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Give me a new piece of iron.

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm hungry.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Do I need to go back to the top or top of the city?

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You think that I'm a lowly servant?

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
None of your business.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's not true.

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Let meientes with you for now.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,400
It's badly injured.

72
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,480
It's very sensitive.

73
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,920
It was affected by a cold that day.

74
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,200
So it's not good for the fever.

75
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,680
I just used the medicine for him.

76
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,080
He'll be better tomorrow.

77
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,520
It's fine if he's not dead.

78
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,080
This...

79
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,920
This is it?

80
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,000
It's nothing.

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,280
Don't disturb me.

82
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Yi Chuan

83
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,840
Yi Chuan

84
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,360
You'reChan

85
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,280
Come in.

86
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,520
He's a culprit.

87
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,800
Who asked you to bring her the whip?

88
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,000
준,

89
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,400
We are the soccer team.

90
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,400
There is no first runner in our jungle.

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,080
We have our weakness.

92
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,240
Don't be展minded.

93
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,360
He wants us to go after him for free.

94
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,760
Don't talk like a informer.

95
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,800
He deserves to have a little bit with his genre.

96
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,520
What is this?

97
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,240
Don't touch him.

98
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
Wen Lan gave you this.

99
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
You're so precious.

100
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,360
You don't even want me to see you.

101
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,360
You're so mad

102
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
that I gave you this.

103
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Jing Yao.

104
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,360
Five years ago,

105
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,360
did you have any of those

106
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,360
you truly loved me?

107
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,360
Even for a moment.

108
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,360
Xiao Hua.

109
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
Qian Zhou, what are you doing?

110
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,360
Let go of Qian Zhou.

111
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Qian Zhou, you're wrong.

112
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
Isn't it a treasured grudge?

113
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
It's so important.

114
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,360
Then go find it.

115
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,360
You look so ugly today.

116
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
Who's going to hit you?

117
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
Something's up.

118
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
I'll send a doctor to the mountains

119
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,360
to see if we need to do anything

120
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,360
after we've been here.

121
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,360
I'll have you finish with the medicine.

122
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,360
Where is there even a scent?

123
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,320
You can ask theamı

124
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,760
I couldn't deal with Dujian Mountain several times

125
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,600
Recently lost my contact with Jiang's family

126
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,360
You have made DE Corn chun's doubts about his ability

127
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,380
We just need to focus onntry

128
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,880
DE Corn will surely give up

129
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,220
Then what do you want to do?

130
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
I need to observe Wenjing's Imperial Physician

131
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,200
When will I rush to Aocheng

132
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Jiang Yao?

133
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
What is she doing?

134
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
She said she was looking for something.

135
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
She's looking for something with such a big blood?

136
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
How long has she been looking for it?

137
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
It's been a while.

138
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I've told her.

139
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
But she insisted on looking for it.

140
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
She didn't let me stay with Xiu'er.

141
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
I think

142
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
it must be something very important to her.

143
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
She's been hurt so badly

144
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
and she's still alive.

145
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
She's really crazy.

146
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
I've only found this one.

147
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
I won't look for it.

148
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
It seems that you're just like

149
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Wen Lan'ai.

150
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,200
She and I have already agreed.

151
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
It's impossible for us to ever be together.

152
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Since we've been lost,

153
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
we should stop.

154
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
I feel very sorry for you.

155
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Look what you got.

156
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Look at you.

157
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
You alright alone?

158
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Look at you.

159
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Don't you know about me?

160
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
You know.

161
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Just because of you,

162
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,400
Xiao Yao, we've already ended.

163
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
We've already ended.

164
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,000
If you hate me, you can kill me.

165
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,400
But don't torture me like this.

166
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,800
Li Chang will make me think...

167
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,400
Think what?

168
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,600
You think you still love me?

169
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:27,000
The distance between us is like a rain of tears.

170
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,000
Xiao Yao,

171
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
you're so stubborn.

172
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,400
Chen Yanchou,

173
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,400
Chen Yan will make you feel better.

174
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Yes.

175
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,200
So no matter how much you feel,

176
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,400
how much you hate me, you must give me a deep thought.

177
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,000
Because this is what you deserve.

178
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,800
Li Li, you're like a thunder.

179
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,200
Let the courage be the one who doesn't want to give up.

180
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,200
You hate me, you're so stubborn.

181
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Don't torture me.

182
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,800
I want to give up, I want to give up.

183
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
I'll hold on to the foundation.

184
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,200
But love is a regret.

185
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
I'm like you.

186
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,800
How do I get out of this place?

187
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Xiao Yao,

188
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
you're so stubborn.

189
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
Wait for me here.

190
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,800
This is where we first met.

191
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Close your eyes.

192
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,600
