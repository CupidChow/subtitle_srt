1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I won't let you down

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I won't let you down

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let you down

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I won't let you down

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I won't let you down

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I won't let you down

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I won't let you down

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I won't let you down

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I won't let you down

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I won't let you down

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't let you down

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I won't let you down

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I won't let you down

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 1

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What's wrong?

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why are you sitting here?

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Did you sit here for a whole night?

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You didn't change your clothes?

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Mom, I'm fine.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You can go out first.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Mom, what's wrong?

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Tell me.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You can go out first.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Then wait for me to come down and eat.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Episode 1

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's already night.

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Miss hasn't come back yet.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What's wrong?

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Miss, you're finally back.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Come. Thank you, Miss.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Where have you been?

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Why haven't you come back at night?

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You're making me angry.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm fine.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I just met a friend.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So I've been chatting for a while.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What friend?

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You've been chatting for a whole night?

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You don't know that.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I didn't sleep last night.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I've been waiting for you.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Is this the Chi Palace?

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yes.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
There's a letter from Miss Jiang.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Please pass it to Mr. Chi Yan Zhou.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It must be the love letter he wrote to Young Marshal.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That woman left

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and didn't let Young Marshal take her.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're talking nonsense.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What?

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What did he say?

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He asked me out.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He's here?

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I can't wait.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Tell me.

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If he's really so cruel,

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
we can only do it according to the plan.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If he's really so cruel,

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
we can only do it according to the plan.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's right.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I know.

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're right.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Tell me.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Ma'am.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Young Marshal.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Young Marshal.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Young Marshal.

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Miss.

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Sir, how much is this?

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,900
I'll go instead.

74
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,080
As always.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,680
tablespoons.

76
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,920
Your son.

77
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,480
Xin Weiyin is good with Mekong.

78
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,020
He is beautiful.

79
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,440
But it's not me.

80
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,020
Only my son.

81
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,000
Thank you.

82
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,400
No problem.

83
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,480
He and my father are playing japan.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,840
Thanks.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,740
Don't mention it.

86
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,840
It's okay.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Miss Jiang, you know this place very well.

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yes.

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I often come here.

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This is for you.

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Tong Xinjie used to pray for peace.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I hope you can also be safe.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's so expensive.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I didn't come here last time.

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Is it okay for you to take it?

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why are you so expensive?

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Since you've been here,

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you should know

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
that Tong Xinjie

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
is going to tie the vegetables

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
on the tree.

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's so poor to have

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
a lover on the tree.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Xin Yue is a homeless man.

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I bought it.

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Thank you.

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You're here.

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Why did you buy it?

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Boss, it's too hot.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I came here

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
because it's too hot.

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
There are few people here.

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But it's not hot.

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's go ahead.

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Where?

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Where?

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Although it's too hot,

118
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
the money is still a waste.

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I can't waste it.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I still have to hang it

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
on the tree.

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You're willing

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
to let Tong Xinjie

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
marry me

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and marry me?

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Look, look.

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Tong Xinjie is here.

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Why are you still in there?

129
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Wait for me.

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
No matter what,

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I will always be here.

132
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The future is still far away.

133
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'd rather be in the dark.

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm coming.

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
There are many lovers here.

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But they may not

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
be able to be together in the end.

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The new world is a thousand times.

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
No one can find it.

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's why

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
someone will be disappointed

142
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
with these desires.

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I didn't expect

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
to be like this.

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I know that

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
people's hearts are a thousand times.

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But I didn't expect

148
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
that someone's heart

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
would be fake from the beginning.

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Xiaoyao,

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
five years ago,

152
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
you were in the fire for the mission.

153
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Did you have

154
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
a moment

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
because I wanted to leave?

156
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Even a moment,

157
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
if I give you another chance,

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
you will still think so?

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'll take you somewhere.

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I didn't expect that

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
you would leave

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
before you came.

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes, I did.

164
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I was a little reluctant

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
to leave.

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Miss,

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
you are

168
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
a person who is reluctant.

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm not.

170
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What's going on?

171
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What happened?

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Miss,

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
wait a minute.

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'll go down and ask.

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Brother,

176
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
what's going on?

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Mr. Du is here.

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What's going on?

179
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's so good.

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Thank you.

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Miss,

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Mr. Du

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
is the one

184
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
who is in the bomb

185
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
outside our company.

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's said that

187
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
the old lady in the night

188
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
is in a mess.

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
No one cares.

190
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
She often hurt

191
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
those innocent girls and children.

192
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It seems that

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Mr. Du's friend

194
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
is also guilty.

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
He is in there

196
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and is being justice for the people.

197
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I've heard that

198
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
you are

199
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
tricking people here.

200
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
If you let me see you again,

201
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'll go.

202
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Take her away.

203
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes.

204
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Leave it to the police.

205
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It seems that

206
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
we have a close relationship

207
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
with Mr. Du.

208
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Mr. Du.

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Miss Zhou,

210
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
what a coincidence.

211
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes.

212
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What?

213
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Miss Zhou

214
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
also likes to watch TV?

215
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I've been there.

216
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Miss Zhou, you're hurt.

217
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
When I was

218
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
tricking people,

219
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I was careful.

220
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's not serious.

221
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What about you?

222
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Where are you going?

223
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm leaving.

224
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Get lost!

225
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What are you doing?

226
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Miss Zhou, be careful.

227
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Miss Zhou, be careful.

228
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's so embarrassing.

229
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's so embarrassing.

230
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Miss Zhou.

231
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Miss Zhou.

232
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Miss Zhou.

233
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Are you okay?

234
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Miss Zhou.

235
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Miss Zhou.

236
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Mr. Du.
