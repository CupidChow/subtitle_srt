1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I won't let you down

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I won't let you down

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let you down

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I won't let you down

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I won't let you down

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I won't let you down

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I won't let you down

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I won't let you down

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I won't let you down

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I won't let you down

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't let you down

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I won't let you down

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I won't let you down

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 19

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Young Marshal, Jing Yao escaped.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Qing Nan, break the mountain.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Du Jian Shan, I suggest you release me.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I heard that you have been caught and imprisoned.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You have been looking for my father several times.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I want him to help you fill in the military expenses.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You are now tied to his daughter.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If he knows about this,

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm afraid that this won't be easy.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Don't worry.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Uncle won't make things difficult for you.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
As long as Chiyan Zhou comes,

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
he will let you go.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If you want to use me to bring Chiyan Zhou here,

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
then you are probably wrong.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Do you know why Chiyan Zhou

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
asked me to marry Du Jia?

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Tell me.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Because he hates me.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He can't see me well.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Five years ago,

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
they were forced to marry a woman from the Flying Bird Society.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
His father died because of this.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You should know this.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You mean

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
you are the woman from the Flying Bird Society?

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Exactly.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Why did he put the money in the Jiangbei State?

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He wants to investigate with me?

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Is he going to save me

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
if we two have such a deep grudge?

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
He wants me to die in your hands.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He's here.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Chiyan Zhou,

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
you really didn't disappoint my brother-in-law.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Stop.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Don't act rashly.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Or else, I will report the bomb.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You shouldn't have come.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We are willing to leave him alone.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let him go.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
As long as you cooperate,

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
my brother-in-law won't be in danger.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What do you want?

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Go.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Chiyan Zhou!

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Chiyan Zhou!

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Stop!

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What are you doing?

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We are willing to leave him alone.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Chiyan Zhou!

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Chiyan Zhou, please spare me!

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Chiyan Zhou!

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Chiyan Zhou, please spare me!

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Chiyan Zhou!

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Spare me!

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Chiyan Zhou!

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Chiyan Zhou!

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Chiyan Zhou!

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We are not a criminal if we keep waiting.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No matter what, we have to go up and see.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
As the young master said, no one can go up without his order.

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But we can't just watch him die.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I believe in you.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And he doesn't want us to sacrifice anyone here.

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You are here to save Chiyan Zhou.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We are here to save Jiang Yao.

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
We are here to stop the war.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The mountain is full of explosives.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
If we leave here, you might not see Jiang Yao.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
She will blow up the bones.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What should we do?

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I have a way.

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I used to come here when I was a kid.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I know there is a way.

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But it's not easy to leave.

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Put the gun down.

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Du Jianshan is your father.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You really have the guts to take us up.

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
One of them is my uncle.

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
One of them is my best friend.

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You can't go there.

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Follow me.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Follow me first.

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Jiang Yao.

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You knew Du Jianshan was looking for you.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You still want to come here?

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You are so romantic.

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You are so kind.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
How can you let her go?

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You are so affectionate to her.

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
She used to be so kind to you.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But she still cares about her father's death.

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
When I kill you,

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I will let her go.

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
If you kill her,

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Jiang Bei and Wang Guiren won't let you go.

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't think about the future.

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Do you think I will be better now?

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's all because of this bastard.

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He made me fall into this.

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I really regret it.

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
When I kill her father,

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I will be a total traitor.

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What did you say?

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What did you say?

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Look at this.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's a big deal.

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's not good to remember it.

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I forgot to tell you two.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Your father in Chiyan City

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
was not killed by the birds.

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I killed him in the wild.

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But he didn't die.

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Before he died,

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
your father told me to run away.

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
He told me to take good care of you.

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I really can't hear it.

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I just want to kill one of them.

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He is so pregnant.

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He won't let you go.

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But he stopped me from taking good care of me.

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He told me to take good care of you.

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay.

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I will let you and his daughter-in-law

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
be together in the Yin Sword.

142
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Go.

143
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Xiao Yao.

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yan Zhou, are you okay?

145
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm fine.

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yan Zhou.

147
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yan Zhou.

148
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I've prepared something good here.

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You can have a talk

150
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
while you're here.

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay.

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Don't get in the door.

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You can have a look.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Be quick.

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Be calm.

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's cold.

157
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's cold.

158
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
He wanted me to die here.

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We're almost there.

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's right ahead.

161
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You said you can't push the door.

162
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You can't push the boat.

163
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
We won't die here, right?

164
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't say that, Xiao He.

165
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I can't let you go.

166
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I can't let you go.

167
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I can't let you go.

168
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I can't let you go.

169
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I can't let you go.

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I can't let you go.

171
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I can't let you go.

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I can't let you go.

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Right.

174
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We'll definitely come back to save you.

175
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I can't die here.

176
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Or else, it'll be a big loss.

177
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's the armor.

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Hurry up.

179
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Hold me.

180
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Let my dad go.

181
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Hurry up.

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Dad, don't shoot.

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Your son is in their hands.

184
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Dong Jun, it's Young Master.

185
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Let Wen Lan go.

186
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Let him go first.

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Tell me.

188
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Or we'll kill him.

189
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Hurry up.

190
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Dad, save me.

191
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I don't want to die.

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Do you think you didn't get killed?

193
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Or do you think you didn't stop me from working with my family?

194
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Daoyong.

195
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
When will it be?

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I can't lose you.

197
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm so surprised.

198
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm so surprised.

199
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm so surprised.

200
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm so surprised.
