1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I won't say that I'm going to be a burden

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I can't help but look at you

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm a little worried about you

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm a little worried about you

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm a little worried about you

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm a little worried about you

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm a little worried about you

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm a little worried about you

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm a little worried about you

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm a little worried about you

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm a little worried about you

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm a little worried about you

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm a little worried about you

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm a little worried about you

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm a little worried about you

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm a little worried about you

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm a little worried about you

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm a little worried about you

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm a little worried about you

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm a little worried about you

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm a little worried about you

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm a little worried about you

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm a little worried about you

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm a little worried about you

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Aunt

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,200
What's the matter? Tell me.

27
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,000
Who are you?

28
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,200
You little girl.

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,000
What are you doing here?

31
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,200
I'm here to talk to you.

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,200
You're a senior.

33
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,600
What do you want to talk about?

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,600
Xiu'er, go and move a chair inside.

35
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,600
Move a table.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,600
Guanyin, prepare a paper pen for me.

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,200
Yes.

38
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,000
Yu Mian is...

39
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Go help her.

40
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,400
Me?

41
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,000
Okay, go help her.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,600
You all know clearly

43
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,400
which bank you are.

44
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
When you owe money,

45
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,600
how much you owe,

46
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,600
how much you pay,

47
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,600
how much you pay,

48
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,600
I'll write it down and pay it back.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,600
You're a little girl.

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,600
You're reliable.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Then, this gentleman,

52
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,400
please say it first.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,600
Okay.

54
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,600
I represent the capital bank.

55
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
I've been in charge of the capital bank for three years.

56
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
It's really a good thing.

57
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,000
It's mine.

58
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,200
Mine.

59
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,600
Mine.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,600
Mine.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,600
Mine.

62
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,600
What are you thinking about?

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Is this the Zhou Yu Mian I know?

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,800
This little girl is really good at business.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,800
Yes.

66
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,200
Are you sure you know

67
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,400
the real Miss Zhou Jia?

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,800
It seems I missed a lot of things.

69
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Okay, I've written it down.

70
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,400
Xiu, take this list

71
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,000
and take them to the bank to get the money.

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,800
Wait a minute.

73
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,600
These debts today

74
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,200
are from my account.

75
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,200
Yan Zhou.

76
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,600
You're a girl.

77
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
You haven't been through the door yet.

78
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,800
If your father knows

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,600
I'm a brother's embroiderer,

80
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,200
he'll break my leg.

81
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,400
Let's go.

82
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,200
Let's go.

83
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,400
Wen Lan,

84
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,600
write a note later.

85
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,200
Give me Yu Mian.

86
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,200
Thank you for what happened just now.

87
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,000
No need.

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,000
What are your plans in the future?

89
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,800
My father passed away.

90
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,800
This family is gone.

91
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
I want to take my father's body away

92
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,800
and then pay the bank's debt.

93
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,400
What about you?

94
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,600
I'm going to study medicine.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,800
You said

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,400
although hope is weak,

97
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,000
it's not expensive.

98
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,200
I want to be a fan of hope.

99
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,800
Okay.

100
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,600
No matter what you do,

101
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll support you

102
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,600
and always be by your side.

103
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,400
Thank you.

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,600
Bao Qiao,

105
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,000
we didn't disturb you, right?

106
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:45,800
Wen Lan,

107
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,800
what happened between your father and me

108
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,200
is none of your business.

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,600
If you...

110
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,400
Zhao, I...

111
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,000
I understand.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I won't blame you.

113
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,600
And Yao Yao, you're all victims.

114
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,400
Thank you.

115
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,000
If you need any help,

116
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,400
just tell me.

117
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,400
Okay.

118
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,400
Wen Lan,

119
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,600
you're the one who loves me.

120
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,800
Fortunately, Miss Zhou is with her.

121
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,400
We can rest assured.

122
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,000
By the way,

123
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
is Young Marshal free tonight?

124
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,600
You want to ask me out?

125
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,400
There's a temple meeting tonight.

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,600
I don't know

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,400
if Young Marshal can be a face.

128
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,800
Do you remember the last time we attended the temple meeting?

129
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,000
Or five years ago?

130
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,800
I don't like to be in a hot spot.

131
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,000
But if my family is in a meeting,

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,200
I can't help but think about it.

133
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,200
Young Marshal,

134
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,000
you have to think about it.

135
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,600
I'll go to the welfare hospital.

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I promised Xiao Hai

137
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,600
to take them to the temple meeting.

138
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,200
If you think it through,

139
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
just wait for me in the old place.

140
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,200
Your rabbit is here.

141
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,200
A rabbit.

142
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,200
I'll take it.

143
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,200
Here, take it.

144
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,000
Have a taste.

145
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,000
Have a taste.

146
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,800
Is it sweet?

147
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,600
It's sweet.

148
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
It's sweet.

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's sweet.

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's sweet.

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You're here.

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You've been waiting for a long time, right?

153
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I almost thought

154
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
you wanted to light me up here.

155
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,200
Sister Jiang Yao,

156
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,000
isn't she a traitor?

157
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,000
Why should we

158
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
go to the temple meeting with her?

159
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't want to play with her.

160
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,400
As long as Sister Jiang Yao...

161
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,000
Xiao Hai,

162
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,400
it's my fault.

163
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,000
She's never a traitor.

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
She's a good person.

165
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,200
Are you sure

166
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
you can drive the bad out of her?

167
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,200
No.

168
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Can't you drive the bad out of her?

169
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,800
Yes.

170
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,400
That's good.

171
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,400
Then I'll be willing to

172
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,600
play with her.

173
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,400
Let's go there and have a look.

174
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,000
Let's go.

175
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,200
Jingzhu, come here.

176
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,400
Sister Jiang Yao,

177
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,000
is she your boyfriend?

178
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,200
She's not my boyfriend.

179
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Because she said

180
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,800
that people like me

181
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,400
don't deserve to have a boyfriend.

182
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,200
So, you're so jealous of her.

183
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,600
Then I'll take back that sentence.

184
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,200
Sister Jiang Yao,

185
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,600
let's go there and have a look.

186
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
This is yours.

187
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
Take it for you.

188
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,800
Thank you.

189
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,600
This is yours.

190
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,400
I'm a little bit...

191
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,200
Take it.

192
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
It's for everyone to have fun.

193
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,600
Sister Jiang Yao,

194
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
you're so pretty.

195
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,200
Let's go.

196
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,680
Everyone,

197
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,400
one minute.

198
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,400
Never mind.

199
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Hit it.

200
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Anyone?

201
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,200
It's a wedding ritual.

202
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,580
Good job.

203
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:55,980
Boss,

204
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,500
can you draw this?

205
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,120
Handsome boy.

206
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,400
Draw someone.

207
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,500
Wait a second.

208
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,600
I'm so happy to have you by my side.

209
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,400
Even if I'm in this world...

210
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,600
Here, I'll give you a toast. I wish you a long, long life.

211
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,200
I'll always be your shadow.

212
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
The memories of those days.

213
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,000
Thank you.

214
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The scene I forget is the most beautiful of my life.

215
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,200
The last time I saw a teacher like him,

216
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
he was still five years ago.

217
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Actually, these five years,

218
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,200
I've never dared to come to a place like this.

219
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,200
Because I'm afraid of the situation and the situation.

220
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,200
I'm afraid of thinking about the things between us.

221
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Teacher Jiang, are you telling me this?

222
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,200
You should take it as...

223
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,200
I'm afraid that I'll be far away from you.

224
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
You...

225
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,200
You've been like this for five years.

226
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,200
I heard that you've always been born to be like this.

227
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
You're a traitor.

228
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,200
There are many times that I almost died at the battlefield.

229
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
But I thought I couldn't die.

230
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,200
I had to live to get back to Yao City.

231
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,200
I had to find Du Jian Shan to avenge my father.

232
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,200
And I had to find a liar to make a statement.

233
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,200
These words are the only words in my heart.

234
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,200
I could live on when it was the hardest time.

235
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Did you make the statement you wanted to make?

236
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
It's worse than I thought.

237
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
I'm sorry.

238
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
I've accepted your apology.

239
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,200
Forget about this.

240
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
I'll take you to a good place.

241
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
I'm sorry.

242
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
I'm sorry.
