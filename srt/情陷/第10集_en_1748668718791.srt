1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I won't let you down

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I won't let you down

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let you down

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I won't let you down

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I won't let you down

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I won't let you down

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I won't let you down

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I won't let you down

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I won't let you down

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I won't let you down

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't let you down

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I won't let you down

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I won't let you down

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 19

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You've been away for so long, yet you still haven't asked me?

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Guess you can get lost here.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You're not from Oocheng, right?

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We've never been out of the faraway gate.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We just came to Oocheng for a long time.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We wanted to go around, but we didn't know where we'd be.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Now that the world is in chaos,

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
you have a place to live.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Come out next time.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Find more people to accompany you.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Exactly.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I said we should find someone to accompany us.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We should also be the ones to be alone.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But you're not willing to.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You're so kind.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I... I don't know if I should count it or not.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Come on, let's hear it.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Maybe I can help you solve the problem.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
My father thought of a fiancee for me.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But actually, he's already familiar with it.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I don't know if I should listen to my father

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and stay with him.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Or if I'm the fiancee of my father,

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I should marry that girl.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Mr. Du, if it's you, what would you do?

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's all?

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm familiar with the South.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
A while ago,

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
that old man of mine

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
chose a girl for me.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Then?

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Then he chose a girl for the soul.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We came to a fake engagement.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Marriage is so important.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
How can you do it?

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Who told them to care about my preferences?

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Marriage is a big deal.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
How can you do it to them?

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Mr. Du's behavior and ideas

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
are really bold and thoughtful.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So, I mean...

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
First, you have to be sure.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Do you like that man?

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If you like him,

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
you can fight with him.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If you don't like him,

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
you can let him go.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What's important is

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
whether I like him or not.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Do I want to marry him?

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Of course you want to marry him.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He's so excellent.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why wouldn't you like him?

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's true.

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Which girl doesn't like him so much?

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's not certain.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If love

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
is a good thing,

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't even have the chance to go out.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Why?

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You'll be chased by girls until you run away.

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Mr. Du is so humorous.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You're obviously self-love.

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Miss,

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
we'll be there soon.

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You live here?

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yes.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What a coincidence.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
My uncle lives here too.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Since you're here,

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
do you want to go to your uncle's house to say hello?

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
No, no, no.

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If I knew that

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
my two kids were out there,

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I wouldn't let my dad take me back.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay, I'll see you off.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Thank you for your guidance.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Thank you for taking us back.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Bye-bye.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'll get going.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Bye-bye.

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The key to a feudalism is not important.

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The key is your heart.

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Miss, when is it?

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why are you still thinking about Mr. Du's nonsense?

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't think about it.

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Let's take a shower and go to bed.

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay?

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Xiu, where are we going tomorrow?

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We'll go out tomorrow.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We almost have an accident today.

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What's this?

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The drug?

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What does the mixy thing have to do with me?

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Could this be Miss Chu?

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What's the tiny thing Miss Zhou has to do?

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
There must be a following mystery.

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If you're with Her,

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Miss Zhou and Yao Yao are together.

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,400
Yao Yao and who are together?

115
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,560
Yao Yao and...

116
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
Father!

117
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,000
You just said that Yao Yao and her are together.

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Who?

119
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
What Yao Yao?

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,600
Father, you're getting older.

121
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,000
Stop following me.

122
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,680
Officer Zhang,

123
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,600
keep the track of this clue.

124
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Yes.

125
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Father, you even followed me.

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You're so eager to find Yao Yao.

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What are you going to do?

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
She ruined your son's marriage.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You should be so careful.

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
If you continue like this, I'll be angry.

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You're not angry anymore.

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Son, but this time you did well.

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Father, I'll cancel your ban.

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll cancel your ban.

135
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Father!

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Old man!

137
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That girl is in the office?

138
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yes.

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't think I know them.

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Officer,

141
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
is this the person behind the scenes?

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Could it be your uncle?

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm worried that he already knows

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
that the truth of the death of Chiling Feng

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
was revealed five years ago.

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So he deliberately made a team with you.

147
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
No way.

148
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Everyone knows that Chiling Feng died

149
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
in the hands of the Flying Bird Society and the pirates.

150
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No matter how smart he is,

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
he won't be able to find out who I am.

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Could it be...

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Could it be Jiang Bei?

154
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He's also willing to cooperate with the pirates.

155
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
After all, he's just a piece of trash.

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If this matter really has something to do with my uncle,

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll kill him right away.

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Kill him?

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll kill him.

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let's go.

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Where will Chi Yan Zhou hide his letter?

162
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Could it be with the body?

163
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The situation right now

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
is too difficult for him to get in.

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Jiang Yao.

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Why are you standing there?

167
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Come in.

168
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
By the way,

169
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm not in a hurry to say thank you.

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What is it?

171
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Su Ji's sugar

172
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
has always been hard to buy.

173
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That day, I accidentally passed by.

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No one was in line.

175
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I just slept.

176
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Don't buy it anymore.

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Miss Zhou will be unhappy.

178
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
She won't.

179
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Isn't she your fiancée?

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
We never got engaged.

181
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
My father and I,

182
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
his father,

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
always wanted to make up for our marriage.

184
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But I never agreed.

185
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That's enough.

186
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's better not to add too much water

187
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
in winter.

188
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You're quite persistent.

189
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You've liked this word before.

190
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But now,

191
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
the likes haven't changed.

192
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If you like something,

193
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
it's a clear mind.

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You can't be sure

195
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
that it's a clear mind.

196
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
How can it change easily?

197
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Then what do you think of that...

198
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That love letter,

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
why are you so persistent?

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Is it because

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
you're clear-minded

202
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
about the relationship

203
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
with him?

204
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's all over.

205
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's meaningless to say it now.

206
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
No.

207
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Just kidding.

208
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Is it a放手?

209
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Is it a swim or a smile?

210
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The answer is in your eyes.

211
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I've never been alone.

212
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Qian Cheng.

213
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What's wrong with you?

214
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I forgot about the snow.

215
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I can't see the chance.

216
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's your tears.

217
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
No wonder my obsession

218
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
is not a step back.

219
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm like your emotions are flying.

220
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
If you follow me all day,

221
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
when will you let me go?

222
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm afraid that I'll be ruined.

223
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's all over.

224
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Will he hide his heart in the clothes?

225
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It turns out that it's Du Jianshan.

226
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's not him.

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I found that

228
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm not the one

229
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
who colluded with the pirates.

230
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Do you feel disappointed?

231
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What?

232
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You want to tell me?

233
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm not the one.

234
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm not the one.

235
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm just trying to

236
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
see the letter.

237
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm afraid that

238
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
the soup that's been removed

239
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
will be worried about my health.

240
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
There's still this ring.

241
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Why is it here?

242
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
From the beginning,

243
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I was looking for it all my life.

244
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Is it just a piece of cake?

245
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm afraid that

246
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'll be ruined.

247
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm afraid that

248
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'll be ruined.

249
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm afraid that

250
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'll be ruined.

251
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm afraid that

252
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'll be ruined.

253
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm afraid that

254
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'll be ruined.

255
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm afraid that

256
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'll be ruined.

257
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm afraid that

258
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'll be ruined.

259
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm afraid that

260
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'll be ruined.

261
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm afraid that

262
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'll be ruined.

263
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm afraid that

264
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'll be ruined.

265
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
No wonder I'm not the one.
