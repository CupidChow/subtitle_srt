00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I don't know if I can find the answer

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't know if I can find the answer

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I don't know if I can find the answer

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't know if I can find the answer

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't know if I can find the answer

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't know if I can find the answer

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I don't know if I can find the answer

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I don't know if I can find the answer

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I don't know if I can find the answer

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I don't know if I can find the answer

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't know if I can find the answer

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't know if I can find the answer

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I don't know if I can find the answer

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't know if I can find the answer

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 19

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Miss Zhao.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Miss Zhao.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Is your wound better?

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's much better.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's good.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Did you find the last thing you lost?

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Do you need someone to help you find it?

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Xie Xiang.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
No need.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Although there are some things that are precious to her,

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I have already lost it.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I can't find it.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
She's so hurt by you.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I think Yan Zhou must be sad like you.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm sorry, Miss Zhou.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I've always wanted to find a chance to apologize to you.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Is it because of Yan Zhou and me?

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Young Marshal, I want to talk to you.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This is the seal. Go in.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Young Marshal.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Miss Jiang.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What can you tell me?

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Maybe I can help you.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I just want to ask you something.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
When can I leave here?

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Don't ask.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'll help you.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But it's true.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Our teacher and Yumen are so compatible.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You really don't mean anything.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It has nothing to do with this.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The most sad and wolfish years I've had,

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm lucky to have Yumen take care of me.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
She's not even a decent person

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
after she left for the north.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
She can only be a servant and a beggar.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
She can do anything she wants.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But even so,

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
she still doesn't have any appetite.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm so sorry to have you here.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm afraid that Wei Shi is still in pain.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Why do I say that?

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's cold outside. Go in.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Miss Jiang can't see anymore.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yan Zhou.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It has nothing to do with her.

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yifu called me specially

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and asked me to take care of you.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Wear it.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You and Miss Jiang,

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
did you have any misunderstandings?

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't think she's a heartless person.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Maybe she's...

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't be fooled by her good looks.

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
She's the kindest to use feelings to deceive people.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I won't hurt her anymore.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You'd better stay away from her.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
If I didn't business your life,

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
then I won't believe you.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
All died out.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't care where the truth lies.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Don't blame me.

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,700
Let's go over the past two days and sign it.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay.

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,800
Why

82
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,920
there is the calligraphy for the Imperial Doctor

83
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,960
and the embroidery forนะคะ than itu blasting bathroom?

84
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,040
Wu

85
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,280
I and Wu

86
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,460
named Ramak Disk

87
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,120
Me

88
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,560
What do you mean by?"

89
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:13,960
Miss

90
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,960
the second time in a late alone Xia Erhe ofens who say this

91
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,840
what experience

92
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,380
wish

93
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,760
what

94
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,520
fourth

95
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,240
What

96
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,360
do

97
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,220
he

98
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,860
is

99
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,200
under the

100
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,360
In the room in the room,

101
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,600
I found a letter

102
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,120
for the Imperial Physician Shanjing.

103
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,360
Recently, he really wants to represent the magic

104
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,200
to cooperate with Du Jian Shan

105
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,600
to repair the iron road.

106
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,200
Could it be that

107
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,040
he also wants to participate in the experiment?

108
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,840
It's not strange.

109
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,720
At this critical moment,

110
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,920
he suddenly came to Ou City.

111
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,200
I'm afraid it's not easy.

112
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,920
Besides,

113
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,320
they are all very strong.

114
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,760
He won't.

115
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,320
Anyway,

116
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,880
I will investigate this matter.

117
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,840
Before we find out,

118
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,960
don't tell the group.

119
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,440
Okay.

120
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,720
But Jiao Yao,

121
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,280
if you find out,

122
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,760
he will really cooperate with the magic

123
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,920
like Du Jian Shan.

124
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,840
By then,

125
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,360
you will do it yourself.

126
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,360
I hope you are prepared.

127
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,440
You will think about it again.

128
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,960
It will come back sooner or later.

129
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,760
Just like we will deal with Du Jian Shan.

130
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,200
Where are you going?

131
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,280
I think I will o ton.

132
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,160
Singing

133
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,320
Can we go out for some harmony?

134
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:33,880
Gu !

135
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,880
You did well!

136
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
You did well!

137
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,520
What was he doing?

138
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,920
When you can get the communication

139
00:08:43,200 --> 00:09:09,360
you should know whether���

140
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,200
Dahee, go to work.

141
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:16,800
I don't want to give you a current比,

142
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,660
I just want someone to get some verified information

143
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:21,720
on the delivery of the bonus.

144
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,240
How about I give you a real package?

145
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,600
Don't leave anything behind.

146
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,200
I'll do the same at once.

147
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,620
You didn't tell me what was in here?

148
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,600
You did it.

149
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,100
Develop and reveal information.

150
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,440
Then, who will solve it now?

151
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,980
You arrive here right after 20 minutes!

152
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,800
Ye Big!

153
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,680
What a coincidence, brawler!

154
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,240
infid premiers where people also came out oflaughing

155
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,000
to called people

156
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,000
to find out

157
00:09:48,440 --> 00:10:08,040
what it means to have

158
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,400
Is it a report or a sword?

159
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,720
I don't have it.

160
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,160
You don't have it?

161
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,840
Then why are you in my study?

162
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,120
Speak!

163
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,000
I didn't send it to you.

164
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,000
It's on the table.

165
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,360
David Chang,

166
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,040
the ice is not a fairy tale.

167
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,000
I've known you don't want to see me,

168
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,420
Hu Yuan 세상.

169
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,300
Not forgetting every thing has a stomachache?

170
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,980
Yong Whereas it's like a backwater slide.

171
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:35,040
The bank account book cost me three hundred thousand on horseback.

172
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
What did you say?

173
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,040
I said Miss Zhou asked me to give it to you.

174
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Didn't you feel unwell?

175
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,040
And I heard from Jinan that your health is not well these years.

176
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
You dare to mention these years.

177
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,040
Jiang Yao,

178
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,040
can you make a man like this?

179
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Is it so good for you?

180
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
I know.

181
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
I don't care what I say now.

182
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,040
It's useless.

183
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,040
But...

184
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,040
But you just want to make yourself feel better.

185
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,040
I know.

186
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040
I know.

187
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,040
I know.

188
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,040
You want to make yourself feel better.

189
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,040
Right?

190
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,040
Don't be too stubborn.

191
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,040
You will make me feel more disgusting.

192
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,040
Get out of here.

193
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
Don't show up in front of me.

194
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,040
I know.

195
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,040
I regretted too much.

196
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,040
I was too reckless.

197
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,040
Maybe I was wrong.

198
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,040
I should have been more careful.

199
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,040
I should have been more careful.

200
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,040
Love is in the mess.

201
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,040
The floating waves are cold.

202
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,040
The fresh rain is broken.

203
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,040
The past is a memory.

204
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,040
The place is familiar.

205
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,040
You are the one.

206
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,040
Love is in the mess.

207
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
The floating waves are cold.

208
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,040
The fresh rain is broken.

209
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,040
The past is a memory.

210
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
The floating waves are cold.

211
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
The past is a memory.

212
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
The past is a memory.

213
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
The past is a memory.

214
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
The past is a memory.

215
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
The past is a memory.

216
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
The past is a memory.

217
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
The past is a memory.

218
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
The past is a memory.

219
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
The past is a memory.

220
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,040
The past is a memory.
