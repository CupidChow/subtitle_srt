1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,400
I don't want to be separated from you

2
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,640
I can't stand the sadness

3
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,200
I can't stand the sadness

4
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,400
I can't stand the sadness

5
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,000
I can't stand the sadness

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I can't stand the sadness

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I can't stand the sadness

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,600
Miss Jiang cares about her fiancÃ©e

9
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,000
Mr. Du

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Come and talk

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Talk

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Chen Yanzhou

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What do you want to do?

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What do you think I should do?

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You'd better not come here

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This is the Du family's factory

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Jiang

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What?

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Wenlan

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Uncle

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You're so serious

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I thought you were here to get married

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Don't scare our Yang Yang

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What's wrong?

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Get married

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm not a woman here

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What marriage do I get?

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You're kidding

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You've been here for years

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You're still so boring

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yang Yang, don't be afraid

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This is the one I always mention to you

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Handsome, rich, wise and wise

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's him

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Uncle

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Don't look at him like that

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He's so small

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You're scaring him

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I just think Miss Jiang's pure wounds

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
are very different

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let him laugh

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is the dog that was bitten by our family

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
a while ago

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I've also raised a wild cat a few years ago

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's so popular to bite people

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But these things are like this

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No matter how good he is

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
he can't take care of himself

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Right?

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Miss Jiang

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why are you talking about it?

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You've become a cat and a dog

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Uncle, I have something to ask you

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I heard you're a good-for-nothing in Ye Wei Yang

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You're just a fan of the role of Hong Yan

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Now everyone in the world knows

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I really brought him here

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Where is he? Where is he?

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Where is he?

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Where is he?

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Why don't I see him better than my family?

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm just kidding

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
When did you learn such a boring joke?

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yan Zhou

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Brother-in-law

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Long time no see

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You've said it

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yan Zhou

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm ashamed of your dad

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I didn't help him

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You won't blame me, right?

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If you want to blame me, you should blame that bird

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Today is a good day

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's not cold

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Right

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Come on, Yan Zhou

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Little Jiao Zi

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Little Jiao Zi

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Look at these two kids

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm just looking forward to Wen Lan

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
When the factory is done

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll be proud of you

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What's wrong?

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You look so tired

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Did I really get scared by that real man?

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm telling you

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He's the real man

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But he's actually

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He's not usually like that

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm not that timid

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm just tired

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's almost evening

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll change my clothes

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Are you looking for me?

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Is Marshal Chi going somewhere wrong?

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This is a change

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I think

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You're more suitable for Zhen'er

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What do you think?

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What do you think?

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
If it weren't for Marshal Chi's reminder

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I would have forgotten

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I shouldn't call you Marshal now

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I should call you

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Uncle

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You should call me Uncle

108
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You should call me Uncle

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Uncle

110
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
With Uncle's wounds

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And marriage with strangers

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It feels very different

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
If Wen Lan finds out

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't know if he'll like it

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Or not

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I've already decided

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Wen Lan and I are married

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It won't change you

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So confident

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I really want to try

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Tell him everything

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Chi Yan Zhong

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You came here today

124
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Is it because you want to say this?

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Xu Xiaohui is now

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
No way

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
If I marry Xiaohui now

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Wen Lan will be the only one

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Who can make the whole family

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I know I've made a mistake

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But can we

132
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Stop holding him in?

133
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Wen Lan is innocent

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Being Wen Lan

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Being Wen Lan

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You really mean a lot to me

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But I'm not good enough

138
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I just can't see you

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'll say it again

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Marry Xiaohui

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Wen Lan

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The marriage ceremony will start soon

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
My dad is on the way

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I should go

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You didn't follow our agreement

146
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The consequence is self-reliance

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Why are you here?

148
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm going to go

149
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm going to go

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm going to go
