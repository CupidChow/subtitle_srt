1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I won't say that I'm falling for you

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
because I have too many memories

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't say that I'm falling for you

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
because I have too many memories

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I won't say that I'm falling for you

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
because I have too many memories

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I won't say that I'm falling for you

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
because I have too many memories

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I won't say that I'm falling for you

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
because I have too many memories

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I won't say that I'm falling for you

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
because I have too many memories

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I won't say that I'm falling for you

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
because I have too many memories

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 19

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Jiang Meng!

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Miss

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I love to be ordinary

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not good at acting

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
but I'm not bad at...

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sorry

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How come it's you?

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Master Du

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Are you okay?

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Jiang Meng

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I love you

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I love you

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Where are the people?

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Master Du

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Thank you for saving me once again

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
They...

32
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,600
stole something from me.

33
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,480
I'm not that type of girl.

34
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,840
You're a bastard.

35
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,560
What?

36
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
Nothing.

37
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,080
It's not a good thing.

38
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,520
Don't you know that?

39
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,320
I'll take you home.

40
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,040
Be safe.

41
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,440
What is that Mrs. Qian doing?

42
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,840
I was thinking about it.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The fire is getting bigger.

44
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,760
You know that.

45
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,120
I can't leave

46
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,640
without you.

47
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,840
Mom, I'm going out.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,280
It's time. Where are you going?

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Nene.

50
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,600
Mrs. Wang.

51
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,280
Wait for me.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,320
It's going to be over soon.

53
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,520
Nene, go out.

54
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
Why are you here?

55
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,640
I hope you can kill Chi Yanzhou.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,140
Look.

57
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,840
Chi Yanli made these for me.

58
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,720
Let me hate you, partner.

59
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,000
Zhang Man.

60
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,360
auerge.

61
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,040
Jiang Yao is not here yet.

62
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,840
Bye.

63
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,120
I didn't see Miss Jiang.

64
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
popularity.

65
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,840
He hardly can see her.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm afraid of you.

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm afraid of you.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm afraid of you.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm afraid of you.

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm afraid of you.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm afraid of you.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm afraid of you.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm afraid of you.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm afraid of you.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm afraid of you.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm afraid of you.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm afraid of you.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm afraid of you.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm afraid of you.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm afraid of you.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm afraid of you.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Hello.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Help me find Jiang Xiao Ni.

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm Jiang Xiao Ni.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I've an emergency.

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What should I do?

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What are you doing?

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm busy.

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Thank you.

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's too late.

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Don't tell me there's something wrong.

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,360
I'd rather be alone in the dark.

94
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,120
You're awake.

95
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,600
Have you been here last night?

96
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,160
No.

97
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,120
There are only a few days left.

98
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,000
Are you waiting for her here for a night?

99
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,200
Commander.

100
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,920
What's the matter?

101
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,920
The people of the Flying Bird Club are preparing to assassinate Commander.

102
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,600
And this is Miss Jiang's secret mission.

103
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,560
She took this mission?

104
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,720
That's what the news is.

105
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,200
I'm not sure.

106
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,520
Youyou.

107
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,400
It's time to go for breakfast.

108
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,120
The organization is going to kill Chi Yanzhong.

109
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,120
Why?

110
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,000
There's no reason to do that.

111
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,240
You know we have to stop

112
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,280
Du Jinshan and Dr. Shanjing's cooperation.

113
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,880
Since we have to stop this,

114
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,280
we can't stop Dr. Shanjing

115
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,640
from doing it.

116
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,720
Dr. Shanjing is a secret.

117
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,600
We can't catch him.

118
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,280
As for Du Jinshan,

119
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,880
you know

120
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,880
he's the one who's the best.

121
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,680
It's impossible to kill him.

122
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,200
But we can't kill him.

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,960
Someone can.

124
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,840
You have to kill Chi Yanzhong

125
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,040
and get Du Jinshan.

126
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,560
Make a conflict between Jiangbei and Du Jinshan.

127
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,680
Then let Jiangbei deal with Du Jinshan.

128
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
It's not you.

129
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,240
It's us.

130
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,320
But Chi Yanzhong can't do it.

131
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,800
For so many years,

132
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
Jiangbei has been cooperating with the pirates.

133
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,680
It's a long time ago.

134
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
He's Chi Yanzhong's subordinate.

135
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,760
The pirates?

136
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,240
Really?

137
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,120
I'm afraid not only the pirates,

138
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,000
but also many other partners

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,480
are all his enemies.

140
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,800
Kill him.

141
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,760
Let them attack the pirates.

142
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
They won't let you.

143
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,040
These are just guesses.

144
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,240
No evidence.

145
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
I knew

146
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
you would be in trouble one day.

147
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,840
If you think it's difficult,

148
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
you can give this task to others.

149
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,280
But Jiang Yao

150
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,560
won't change

151
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,400
the plan to kill Chi Yanzhong.

152
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,640
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

153
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,280
See you tomorrow.

154
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,360
Wait!

155
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,440
I'll go.

156
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,600
Ok.

157
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,520
Where is this?

158
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,200
Why am I in the mortal world?

159
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,600
You haven't told me

160
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,760
where your house is.

161
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,920
How can I send you back?

162
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,960
Be careful.

163
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,440
You can't see who I am.

164
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,720
I'm not your lover.

165
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay.

166
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,560
You're forcing me.

167
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,760
Oh gosh.

168
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,160
Having breakfast?

169
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,080
Ми

170
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,520
I'm scared.

171
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,500
事情

172
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,240
Into my heart

173
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:50,900
cut amazing

174
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,760
Is it all right?

175
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,560
You're leaving now?

176
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
That's all?

177
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,320
I'll pay for the dirty clothes.

178
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,520
The money in the restaurant and the room.

179
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,520
I'll pay...

180
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,680
If this doesn't work,

181
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,800
what happened last night...

182
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,040
I can pay for it, too.

183
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,720
If you think this is appropriate...

184
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,800
The rich lady in the room is different.

185
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,840
No.

186
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,640
I know you're not short of money.

187
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
But I...

188
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,320
Fine. I'm kidding.

189
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,440
Nothing happened last night.

190
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,280
As for the rest...

191
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,880
It's all the tricks.

192
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,480
