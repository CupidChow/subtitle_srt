1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,640
5 million baht in exchange
for destroying him.

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,720
What do you want?

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,040
Break up with Mahasamut.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,920
I'm begging you, don't hurt Mahasamut.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,160
Don't do anything to them.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,640
If you can't decide,
how about I choose for you?

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,080
Just like what happened
with your Uncle Doctor.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:27,920
Mahasamut!

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,080
Ai Rak, calm down.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,800
Ai Vie, I met Dad.
He’s gonna kill Mahasamut!

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,520
You hear me, Dad’s gonna kill him!

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,080
Just like he killed Uncle Doctor!

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,520
Chapter 9: The Chosen Path

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,520
Wanna grab a bite?

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,440
Not hungry.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,960
Then, wanna stop by
somewhere before going home?

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,400
No.

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,280
You’re all mopey, little rascal.

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,280
If it’s bugging you, why don’t we
tell your mom and Khun Tongrak?

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,200
You told them?!

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,000
Not yet, I'm sticking to my promise.

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,960
But I’ve never lied to Mommy before.

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,520
I just didn’t say the whole thing.

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,039
Yesterday, she asked me what was
wrong, and I told her I had a headache.

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,520
Did I do the right thing, Uncle Mut?

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,960
So… why are you reluctant to tell
Khun Kwan or Khun Tongrak?

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,760
When I told them…

28
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,120
I thought it’d help Uncle
Rak be more on guard.

29
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,240
It never crossed my mind that
it was Grandpa’s plan to use me.

30
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,960
So, I feel that we shouldn’t
tell them this time.

31
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,880
I’m doing the right thing, right?

32
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,080
I’m so confused.

33
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,000
What do you think
will make you feel better?

34
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,400
Well...

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,440
Telling Uncle Rak.

36
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,520
Then tell him.

37
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,480
But…

38
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,039
Do you think Uncle Rak would
want to see you stressed out?

39
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,800
No.

40
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,160
Mm, he wants you to be happy.

41
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,720
He wants you to have fun like other kids.

42
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,880
If he finds out he’s
the cause of your stress

43
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,840
do you think he’ll blame himself?

44
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,560
Totally.

45
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,600
Mm, so…

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,600
We’ll just comfort
Uncle Rak if he feels sad.

47
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,640
With you by his side, he’ll coddle
you so much he’ll forget the stress.

48
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,320
But if you can’t do it,
I’ll tell him for you.

49
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,520
You’re gonna use this
to your advantage, right?

50
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,400
It’s called using your role
to its full potential.

51
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,120
So, what’s your call?

52
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,200
Have you made up your mind?

53
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,920
I’m going to tell Uncle Rak and Mommy.

54
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,880
I don’t care what Grandpa thinks.

55
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,720
With so many of us, we don’t
need to worry about losing.

56
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,120
Right, Uncle Mut?

57
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,480
Right.

58
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,400
Then let’s go to Uncle Rak’s house.

59
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,040
Where did you park the car?

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,960
Sorry, I came by taxi today.

61
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,320
- What?
- Khun Tongrak took the car.

62
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,200
So, we have to go to
the main road to catch a cab?

63
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,440
That’s right. Who said it was a good idea
to put a posh private school way out here?

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,360
Then… let’s go!

65
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,480
- I want to fess up already.
- Let’s go.

66
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,040
Stop running, you’re gonna trip.

67
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,880
Meena.

68
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,440
Love Sea the Series

69
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,920
Oh Uncle Mut, it’s Auntie Vie.
I’d better call her back.

70
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:22,920
Mm.

71
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,880
Meena.

72
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,680
What is it?

73
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,600
Stay behind my back.

74
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:46,840
Uncle Mut.

75
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,280
Who are these people?

76
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,760
If I say run, you run.

77
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,520
Wait, what’s going on?

78
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,280
I don’t think we’ve had any beef before.

79
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,560
We didn’t, but I want one.

80
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,480
Meena.

81
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,520
Run!

82
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,520
- Yes?
- Go!

83
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,200
Go get the girl!

84
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,160
You want a piece of me?

85
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,640
Bring it on.

86
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,880
Go tell your boss if he wants me dead,
he’d better kill me himself.

87
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,680
My car’s up ahead.
Thank you for walking me here.

88
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,720
I’m the one who owes you thanks.

89
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
You should join us for
the next episode as well.

90
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,880
Hmm, will you buy me lunch?

91
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,640
Sure thing, it won’t
make a dent in my wallet.

92
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,760
By the way, you’re meeting up with Meena?

93
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,840
Yeah, since I’m in the area,
I might as well hang out with her.

94
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,440
But she’s not picking up the phone.

95
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,800
Help!

96
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,520
Help!

97
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,159
Help!

98
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,440
Please help my uncle!

99
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,920
Mister, please help my uncle!

100
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,760
Meena.

101
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,840
Auntie Vie!

102
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,920
Auntie Vie, help.

103
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,560
- Uncle Mut’s getting beat up!
- What?

104
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,200
- Where?
- This way!

105
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,600
Auntie Vie, this way! He’s right here!

106
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,360
What happened?

107
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,640
I got jumped, P’ Vie. Can’t you tell?

108
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,120
Now's not the time for a joke.

109
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,120
I could take care of myself.

110
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
I can see that.

111
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,760
Uncle Mut...

112
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,600
You’ve got blood all over.

113
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,400
Uncle Mut, please don’t die.

114
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,840
They’re just small wounds. I’ll be fine.

115
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,200
Hey, get on!

116
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,920
How are you gonna tell Ai Rak?

117
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,320
Given how I look…

118
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,640
guess I’ll have to tell the truth.

119
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,560
He’ll find out even if I lie.

120
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,840
That's good, but…

121
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,520
Ai Rak’s gonna freak out.

122
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,480
Mahasamut!

123
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,560
Ai Rak, Calm down.

124
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,360
Ai Vie, I met Dad.
He’s gonna kill Mahasamut!

125
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,520
Wait, calm down and listen to me.

126
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,080
Dad’s gonna kill him just
like he killed Uncle Doctor!

127
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,400
What am I gonna do if
something happens to Mahasamut?

128
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,280
Hey, hold on!

129
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,880
Just tell me where he is!

130
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,280
I’m here.

131
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,960
That’s what I was trying to tell you.

132
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,120
I’m okay.

133
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,160
How’s Ai Rak?

134
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,800
He’s finally settled.

135
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,440
That’s a relief.

136
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,320
Does he get like this often?

137
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,120
No.

138
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,160
It’s the first time
I’ve seen him like this.

139
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,040
He told me it’s happened to him before.

140
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,680
This is probably his second time.

141
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,200
Does it have to do with
the guy you mentioned?

142
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,280
Uncle Doctor.

143
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,080
Well…

144
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,960
Has Ai Rak brought him up?

145
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,160
No, that was the first time.

146
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,440
You see…

147
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,880
Uncle Doctor…

148
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,000
Mook.

149
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,160
Hey, what happened to you?

150
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,560
Don't worry, I’ll live.

151
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,360
Then… what about P’ Rak?
Is he injured too?

152
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,040
He called me, but I didn’t pick up.

153
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,800
When I called back, the line was busy.

154
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,560
Where is he?

155
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,080
Sleeping upstairs.

156
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,160
Khun Tongrak is safe and sound.

157
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,560
Khun Tongrak.

158
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,120
Had a nightmare?

159
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,840
I… I…

160
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,720
I don’t know. I just…

161
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,920
I’m going to sleep with Khun Tongrak.
Could you lock the door?

162
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,440
Okay.

163
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,760
Let’s go.

164
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,600
Aren’t you going to ask me what happened?

165
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,520
Are you still angry with me?

166
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,120
No, I won’t ask.

167
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,360
I’ll hear about it from Mahasamut tomorrow.

168
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,320
But you need to go home.

169
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,040
You have an early shoot tomorrow.

170
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,560
It’s late.

171
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,280
- You should leave--
- Wait, what about you?

172
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,760
I’m staying the night here
in case P’ Rak needs something.

173
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,120
But you should go home now.

174
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,320
I'll handle the rest from here.

175
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,160
Please leave.

176
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,240
Have a safe trip home.

177
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,560
Does it hurt bad?

178
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,040
Not at all.

179
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,400
Really?

180
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,720
Why would I lie to you? It doesn’t hurt.

181
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,800
But Vie said you got slashed with a knife.

182
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,360
And I’m telling you that it doesn’t hurt.

183
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,560
Just a tiny scratch. Getting cut
by a fishing net hurts a lot worse.

184
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
It’s all my fault.

185
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,920
Dad hurt you because of me.

186
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,240
No, it’s not your fault.

187
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,800
It’s his.

188
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,400
That bastard’s out of his mind.

189
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,120
Sorry…

190
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,040
I’m really sorry.

191
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,240
I’m going to find out
who made you this way.

192
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,320
Meena.

193
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,080
Khun Kwan.

194
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,040
Can we have a talk?

195
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,160
It’s about Rak.

196
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,280
Sure.

197
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,400
P’ Rak, how are you feeling?

198
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,680
Mook, where’s Mahasamut?

199
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,440
Downstairs.

200
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,920
Oh! P' Rak, take it easy.
You might get dizzy.

201
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,640
Do you need something?
I can go get him for you.

202
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,440
- I’ll go get him now!
- Oh!

203
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,640
Don’t.

204
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,200
I’m okay.

205
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,000
Sorry for making you worried.

206
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,960
It’s okay. I’m just glad you’re alright.

207
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,480
Help me with something.

208
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,080
Sure thing! Just tell me what
you need, and I'll take care of it.

209
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,640
I’m hungry.

210
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,400
Got it, I’ll head downstairs
and whip something up.

211
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,680
Wait. Take your time.

212
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,800
I want a big meal.

213
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,400
Sorry?

214
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,600
I’m starving.

215
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,280
Okay.

216
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,120
Hang tight.

217
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,680
Come meet me, son.

218
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:11,040
I want to know how he
ended up staying with you.

219
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:24,720
Send my regards to the guy at
your place. Hope he’s doing fine.

220
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,440
Thank you for sharing with me.

221
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,320
I’m the one who should thank you.

222
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,480
I was never able to help Rak

223
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,840
but I’ve been hoping that
one day someone would.

224
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,320
Sawasdee ka, P’ Kwan.

225
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,040
Sawasdee ja.

226
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,840
Umm… is something the matter?

227
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,400
Well…

228
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,640
Where’s Khun Tongrak?

229
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,880
Oh, P’ Rak’s up.

230
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,480
He’s hungry, so I’m going to
whip something up for him.

231
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,760
I’ll do it.

232
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,560
I’ll help you, Uncle Mut.

233
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,360
Come on.

234
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,920
Let’s go.

235
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,320
What can you cook?

236
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,640
- Omelet
- Omelet?

237
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,520
Good job.

238
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,040
Okay, last one.

239
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,080
Khun Tongrak, food’s ready.

240
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,560
Khun Tongrak.

241
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,160
Where is he?

242
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,880
Khun Tongrak.

243
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,480
Khun Tongrak.

244
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,120
Khun Tongrak.

245
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,160
Khun Tongrak.

246
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,440
Khun Tongrak isn’t upstairs.

247
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,520
What?!

248
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,280
Huh?

249
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,560
P’ Rak’s gone.
I have no idea where he went.

250
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,280
Lend me your phone.

251
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,960
Pick up.

252
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,640
Dammit!

253
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,960
Dad...

254
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,160
Dad’s definitely behind this.

255
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,480
Do you know where he is?

256
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,160
No.

257
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,240
I don’t want to know what he
does, where he is, or who’s he with.

258
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,480
Not at all!

259
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,320
There’s got to be someone
who knows. Anyone.

260
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,080
No.

261
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,280
I don’t know.

262
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,880
Khun Kwan, get a grip.

263
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,040
There’s got to be someone
who can reach your dad.

264
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,240
Rack your brain.

265
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,400
Mom.

266
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,000
Contact her now!

267
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,960
Was it hard to find my place?

268
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:23,040
Actually, I didn't expect you
to decide and come so soon.

269
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,360
What do you want, Dad?

270
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,840
Seems like that's your
usual way to greet me now.

271
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,640
Have a seat.

272
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,440
- I don’t--
- Sit down!

273
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,320
Yes.

274
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,160
I like it when you’re obedient.

275
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,920
Alright, let’s get to the point.

276
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,840
What kind of deal did you
make with Mahasamut?

277
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,120
Please leave him alone.

278
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,480
I’m asking, what kind of deal did you make?

279
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,480
What’s this?

280
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,640
You even made a written agreement?

281
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,880
I’ve told you everything.

282
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,000
Could you leave him alone now?

283
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,520
What makes you think I’d do that?

284
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,120
I’m willing to do everything...

285
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,800
as long as you leave Mahasamut alone.

286
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,880
I’m begging you.

287
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,000
Everything?

288
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,600
I’ll do whatever it takes.

289
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,320
Even if… you have to
kick him out of your house?

290
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,240
You won’t act like a stubborn
kid with me again, will you?

291
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,280
What did I tell you?

292
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,840
You only have to do as I say

293
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,520
and everything will be fine.

294
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:21,840
Hm?

295
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,400
You only have to do as I say,
and everything will be fine.

296
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,240
After Mom kicked Dad out

297
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,560
Rak had to go see a child psychiatrist.

298
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,120
Uncle Doctor was the one
who took care of him.

299
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,600
He was everything to Rak, but…

300
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,440
When Uncle Doctor got into an accident

301
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,320
Dad claimed he was
the one who killed him

302
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:08,520
making Rak believe that
Dad will get rid of whoever he loves.

303
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,600
Dad plays mind games with us.

304
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,720
And this time, he’s making
Rak think he’s targeting you.

305
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,440
You made it.

306
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,840
Where’s Khun Tongrak?

307
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,920
Where my son is has nothing to do with you.

308
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,280
Hey.

309
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,600
I could call the cops
on you for trespassing.

310
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,400
Khun Tongrak.

311
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,440
Khun Tongrak.

312
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,400
Khun Tongrak.

313
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,000
Khun Tongrak.

314
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,920
Khun Tongrak.

315
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,080
Are you okay?
Did you get hurt anywhere?

316
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,560
Sounds like you think I’d abuse my own son.

317
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,120
Shut the hell up!

318
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,480
Look at me. Are you alright?

319
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,400
Talk to me, Khun Tongrak.

320
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,360
Are you alright?

321
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,680
Don’t you have something
to say to Mahasamut, Rak?

322
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,920
I want to end things.

323
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,800
What do you mean?

324
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,640
I’m talking about us.

325
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,560
Let’s call off the agreement.

326
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,120
No.

327
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,520
I won’t do it.

328
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,560
But I’m going to end it…

329
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,720
with you. This very moment.

330
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,720
- I refuse.
- Mahasamut!

331
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,000
Whatever you say,
I’m going to keep refusing.

332
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,880
I don’t need you anymore.

333
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,160
I don’t believe you.

334
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,800
I’m sick of you!

335
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,640
That’s not true.

336
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,400
From now on…

337
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,840
we’re over.

338
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,800
You’ve heard it loud and clear.

339
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,880
It’s time… for you to
get out of Rak’s house.

340
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,600
Good job, son.

341
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,880
You have to leave my house tomorrow.

342
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,720
You mean I don’t have to stick
to the agreement anymore?

343
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,240
Yes.

344
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,280
I don’t have to do what you say anymore?

345
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,720
Yes.

346
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,120
Good.

347
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,720
I don’t want to do what you say either.

348
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,680
And I can finally do this.

349
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,280
Ouch!

350
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,160
The fuck is wrong with you!?

351
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,880
That’s more like it.

352
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,160
Now you’re talking
straight after getting hit.

353
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,640
I’ll call the cops and get you behind bars!

354
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,440
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

355
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,120
Go ahead!

356
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,840
No! Stop it! Stop!

357
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,840
Ai Rak!

358
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,840
Ai Rak, stop him! Ai Rak!

359
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,600
Stop!

360
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,080
Let me go!
Let me go now!

361
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,840
If you don’t let go,
I'll fucking kill you! Let go!

362
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,800
That’s enough, Mahasamut! Enough!

363
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,360
- Cut it out!
- No!

364
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,520
You can’t tell me what to do.

365
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,720
Now that I don’t have to do what
you say, let me do what I want.

366
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,760
No!

367
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,520
You're the one who took off my collar.

368
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,600
Are you prepared to face me? Hm?

369
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,880
Wait. Wait!

370
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,199
How much… How much do you want?

371
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,159
My son's got money. Name your price!

372
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,679
No! Hey!

373
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,239
Ai Rak! Help me, goddammit!

374
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,719
Can’t you see he’s gonna hit me?! Help!

375
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,199
I’ll be the one to put you in your place.

376
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,960
Well? Don’t you just
love bullying the weak?

377
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,920
Isn’t ripping off your wife
and kids what you do best?

378
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,600
Cut it out, Mahasamut.

379
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,360
Didn’t you hear what my dad said?

380
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,199
He’s not going to let it slide.

381
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,920
Do you realize what you’ve done?

382
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,440
What could he possibly do to me?

383
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,719
He’s going to kill you!

384
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,840
He can’t do anything to me.

385
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,880
Of course he can!

386
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,840
- He killed Uncle Doctor--
- He didn’t do it!

387
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,080
You know it was an accident.

388
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,520
Take a look. What do you see?

389
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,760
Your dad can’t do anything to me.

390
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,040
He can’t do anything to you or your family.

391
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,160
He’s nothing but a slimy old fraud.

392
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,400
Take a good look.

393
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,440
You know he wouldn’t dare kill anyone.

394
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,560
And even if he did…

395
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,280
I’m not afraid of him.

396
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,760
He didn’t cause Uncle Doctor’s death.

397
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,120
Neither did you.

398
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,320
And no one’s going to die either.

399
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,200
You mean it?

400
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,320
Are you telling the truth?

401
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,040
Yes.

402
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,680
Take a close look at him.

403
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,920
What are you doing here?

404
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,560
You're so annoying.

405
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,520
Leave! Go away. Get lost!

406
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,720
Rak.

407
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,160
Help me, Rak.

408
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,720
Help…

409
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,160
Dad.

410
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,440
I’ve been scared of you since I was little.

411
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,400
And I still am.

412
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,800
But if you still see me as your son…

413
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,600
please leave me alone.

414
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,720
Can you leave the people I love alone?

415
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,160
Let it end here.

416
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,560
If you don’t want to end up broke,
don’t ever show your face again.

417
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,720
How do you think I got here?

418
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,200
I talked to your mom.

419
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,760
She told me he was here.

420
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,200
She even said that
he’s able to live large...

421
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,320
because of her.

422
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,120
But Khun Liw is about to end that.

423
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,600
Impossible.

424
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,960
Liw will never leave me.

425
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,840
Khun Liw knew you were gonna say that.

426
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,440
So, she wants you to know
that if you want her to choose…

427
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,720
she’ll do it.

428
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,680
And you know exactly
what that choice will be.

429
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,040
If you keep this up, she’ll take
back everything she’s given you.

430
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,280
Think it through.

431
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,360
Let’s go.

432
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,480
I won’t contact you anymore.

433
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,680
I won’t be sending you money either.

434
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,520
And I won’t listen to you anymore.

435
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,720
Let’s end it here, Dad.

436
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,280
Rak…

437
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,200
Let’s go.

438
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,720
Rak, wait!

439
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,560
Rak.

440
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,000
Rak!

441
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,800
I told everyone you’re alright.

442
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,160
You’ve been talking to my mom all along?

443
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,520
No, I only spoke to her
right before I came to you.

444
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,760
I was with Khun Kwan, and
she contacted your mom for me.

445
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,880
This whole time…

446
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,920
I had no clue my mom
was thinking the same thing.

447
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,760
We kept sending Dad money

448
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,600
because we wanted him to leave us alone.

449
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,040
You just didn’t talk to each other.

450
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,760
You’re right.

451
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,120
I wonder how long it’s been
since I last spoke to her.

452
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,400
You okay?

453
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,880
Wish I could say I’m okay, but…

454
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,120
If you’re not okay, just say so.

455
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,440
Like I told you before,
at least when you’re around me.

456
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,400
I’m not okay.

457
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,240
See?

458
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,480
You just had to say it.

459
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,520
I didn’t want to send money to Dad…

460
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,360
but I was afraid he’d cause
trouble for P’ Kwan and Meena.

461
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,320
I didn’t want to blame myself
for Uncle Doctor’s death

462
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,000
but I couldn’t help it.

463
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,480
I wanted to believe that
Dad wouldn’t hurt anyone…

464
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,920
but I was scared.

465
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,240
And I didn’t want to
call off the agreement.

466
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,600
Didn’t want to chase you away.

467
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,480
But if I hadn’t done that,
Dad would have hurt you.

468
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,880
I wasn’t okay at all
with what I did to you.

469
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,640
I’m sorry...

470
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,760
for treating you that way.

471
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,920
I didn’t mean to.

472
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,000
I didn’t want to do it.

473
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,680
I know.

474
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,240
I even said it was over between us.

475
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,200
And I said--

476
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:36,040
♪ No matter how much I want to love you ♪

477
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:43,920
♪ My heart is afraid
of reopening old wounds ♪

478
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,440
If you’re feeling guilty about me…

479
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,920
stop beating yourself up.

480
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,520
I don’t know if I can do that.

481
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,320
Sorry.

482
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,080
You’re not being fair.

483
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,680
You keep saying sorry...

484
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,440
so how can I stay mad at you?

485
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,720
You're mad at me?

486
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,160
Yeah.

487
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,720
You disappeared without telling me.

488
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,240
I was scared out of my wits, you know?

489
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:36,040
And what you said today stung like crazy.

490
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,880
But good thing I’m thick-skinned.

491
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,960
By the way, your dad’s
face is like a brick wall.

492
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,840
My hand hurt so much when I hit him.

493
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,960
Don’t know if my cut’s
going to open back up.

494
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,600
Does it hurt a lot?

495
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,560
Yeah, it hurts so much.

496
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,040
Ouch.

497
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,200
Oww.

498
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,400
Oww, it hurts. Oww.

499
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,520
Should we go see a doctor?

500
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,600
Nah, it’s just a small cut.

501
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,120
But a quick kiss from you
might make the pain go away.

502
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,120
Here.

503
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,600
Oh. If you want to hit me,
steer clear of the wound.

504
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,640
Feeling better?

505
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:48,440
With a kiss like that, I wouldn't
mind getting hurt a bunch every day.

506
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,200
I’m really fine.

507
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:09,960
Mahasamut.

508
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,200
Yes?

509
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,440
Thank you.

510
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,160
How’s P’ Rak?

511
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,800
He’s sleeping.

512
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,720
You should go home and get some rest.

513
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,760
Leave Khun Tongrak to me.

514
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,640
What’s with that look?
Do you have a problem with me?

515
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,520
No.

516
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,600
How did you do it?

517
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,600
Do what exactly?

518
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,240
Everything.

519
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,120
Everything you’ve done to P’ Rak.

520
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,480
…for P’ Rak.

521
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,120
Seeing me in a better light now?

522
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,720
Because you’ve done so much for him.

523
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:44,960
What you asked.

524
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,520
The point isn’t how.

525
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,480
I just wanted to.

526
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,640
I don’t want to regret it later.

527
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,840
I’m old enough to realize one thing.

528
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,600
Put your all into whatever you do,
so you don’t look back with regret.

529
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,600
What if P’ Rak…

530
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
…umm…

531
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,920
…rejected you?

532
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,000
I’ll just have to…

533
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:43,920
...accept it.

534
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,280
But at least…

535
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,160
I’ve given my all.

536
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,400
Can you stay with him for good?

537
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,160
It’s…

538
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,600
…up to him.

539
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:23,880
Not me.

540
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,080
Do you even realize
what month it is right now?

541
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,720
It’s already November.

542
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,040
Shops have been open since last month

543
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,240
but you’ve been gone for months, you know?

544
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,720
Are you gonna give up on the dive shop?

545
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,640
If so, I’ll find another job.

546
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,920
I know what month it is now.

547
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,400
Then when are you coming back?

548
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,360
You’re gonna run out of business.

549
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,320
You bastard, was that
your butthole talking?

550
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,720
Can you deny it?

551
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,800
Give me time.

552
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,000
Jeez, you sound like
I can just hand it over.

553
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,800
How long do you need?

554
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,000
One week.

555
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,640
Just give me… one week.

556
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,720
Why’d you come out?
It’s full of mosquitoes out here.

557
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,000
I couldn’t sleep.

558
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,120
What were you doing?

559
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,880
Well…

560
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,360
Enjoying the river.

561
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,920
Are you missing home?

562
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:17,120
Why don’t we go back to your
island once I’m done with my work?

563
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,080
You’re coming with me?

564
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:23,960
Huh?

565
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,880
Don’t you want me to?

566
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,320
That’s up to you.

567
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,160
Up to me…?

568
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,320
You’re talking weird.

569
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,160
English Subtitles by Saowalak K.

570
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,560
I came to say goodbye.

571
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,240
What’s this?

572
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,120
Ai Rak, open the door.

573
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,200
Mut’s gone back to the island.

574
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,920
You’re just gonna let it end?

575
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,680
Why did you say that?

576
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,600
How much do I need to pay you
to earn your love?

577
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,400
Don’t be like this, Ai Rak.

578
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:45,960
You can still catch up.

579
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,160
My heart… My feelings…

580
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:51,720
I love you.
