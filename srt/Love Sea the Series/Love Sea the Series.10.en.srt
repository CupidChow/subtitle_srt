1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,960
Are you okay?
Are you hurt anywhere?

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,640
I won’t contact you anymore.
Let’s end it here, Dad.

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,920
Wish I could say I’m okay, but…

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,040
If you’re not okay, just say so.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,240
At least when you’re around me.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,760
Can you stay with P' Rak for good?

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,440
It's... up to Khun Tongrak.

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,480
Not me.

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,440
Are you really not coming with me?

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,520
You’re going to be late
if you don’t leave now.

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,520
Then come with me.

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,280
It’s just lunch with
your mom. You got this.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,480
It’s… been years since I last met her.

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,200
Everything will be fine.

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,520
Then you have to come with me next time.

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,200
That’s up to you.

17
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,840
But now, you’d better
hurry or you'll be late

18
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,240
Off you go!

19
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,479
Don’t you want to think it over?

20
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,960
No. Hurry up, you’re going to be late.

21
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,880
Love Sea the Series

22
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,560
Chapter 10: Tongrak - Mahasamut

23
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,320
Mahasamut.

24
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,560
In the kitchen.

25
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,480
It went as expected, right?

26
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,800
Mm.

27
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,640
Mom’s going to deal with Dad.

28
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,800
She promised that he
wouldn’t bother us anymore.

29
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,840
But if he does

30
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,120
she’s prepared a truckload of
evidence that could send him to jail.

31
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,760
She got rid of all the clips too.

32
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,520
What clips?

33
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:50,360
My dad put security cameras
in every corner of the house.

34
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,760
He was planning to sell
the clips of me begging him

35
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,640
and breaking up with you to Prin.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,920
Son of a bitch.

37
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,600
It’s okay, my mom’s taken care of that

38
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,840
including Prin.

39
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,560
Do I sound harsh?

40
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,079
Am I allowed to say it?

41
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,520
But I’m not nearly as harsh as my mom.

42
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,200
She was out for payback until my
aunt promised to send Prim overseas.

43
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,680
That’s when she finally stopped.

44
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,800
Anyway.

45
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,720
Mom wants us to have a monthly
family meal from here on out.

46
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,800
That’s good.

47
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,040
You’ll get to chat with your family more.

48
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,400
Mom wants to see you too.

49
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,200
So, next time…

50
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,320
come meet my family with me.

51
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
What’s the matter?

52
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,440
I've got something for you.

53
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
Can you close your eyes?

54
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,640
Can I open my eyes now?

55
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,800
Yes.

56
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,880
What’s this?

57
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,160
Do you remember
the project I told you about?

58
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,960
The accessories made
from recycled materials.

59
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,520
Yes.

60
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,560
This is the first one I successfully made.

61
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,000
You’re going to sell it?

62
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,880
No.

63
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,760
These two trinkets…

64
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,640
are the only ones in the world.

65
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,360
This one…

66
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,880
represents you.

67
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,600
And this one…

68
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,480
represents me.

69
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,840
They symbolize the story of my life.

70
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,520
You see this?

71
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
See the missing heart?

72
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,800
Yes.

73
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,400
That’s right.

74
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,600
It’s no longer with me.

75
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,080
Because…

76
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,760
it’s with you.

77
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,040
- I--
- Don’t say it!

78
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,040
Please don’t say it, Mahasamut.

79
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,320
No.

80
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,600
I want to tell you.

81
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,919
And I want to do it now.
Right this moment.

82
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,440
No! I won’t hear it.

83
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,080
Come on. Come on.

84
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,320
What are you doing?

85
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,640
I’m going to draft the agreement.

86
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,880
What agreement?

87
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,240
The one between you and me.
We’re going to sign it again.

88
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,840
There’s no need for
an agreement between us.

89
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,800
Yes, there is!

90
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,360
There isn’t.

91
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,440
I’m telling you, there is.

92
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,480
No.

93
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,440
- You need to listen to me, Khun Tongrak.
- No.

94
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,240
- You’re the one who needs to listen--
- I love you.

95
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,520
You…

96
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,800
Why did you say that?

97
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,240
I just wanted to tell you.

98
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:00,960
No.

99
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,480
You don’t get it.

100
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,560
Then tell me.

101
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,760
I want to renew the agreement.

102
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,480
(5,000 baht received)
Is 5,000 enough?

103
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,360
What?

104
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,800
(5,000 baht received)
10k?

105
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Is 5,000 enough?

106
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,600
Sorry?

107
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,120
How about 7,000?

108
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,920
Or 10k?

109
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,000
(20,000 baht received)
- 30k?
- No.

110
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,360
(70,000 baht received)
- 100k?
- Stop it. That’s enough.

111
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,600
(50,000 baht received)
- 150k?
- Stop it already, Mahasamut!

112
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,320
How much do I need to pay you…

113
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,920
to earn your love?

114
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,880
Why are you doing this?

115
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,640
I’ve never been after your money.

116
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,880
The only thing I’ve always
wanted isn’t money.

117
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,160
It’s you.

118
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
Let me love you.

119
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,560
No.

120
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,200
I don’t want your love.

121
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,320
Don’t love me.

122
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,200
I won’t let anyone hurt me.

123
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,000
Don’t say you love me. Don’t love me.

124
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,680
Don’t even bother.

125
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,040
I don’t want your love!

126
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,400
I don’t want it.

127
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,040
Yes…

128
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,600
I know you don’t want it.

129
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,160
But I don’t want it back either.

130
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,760
My heart… My feelings…

131
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,280
I’ve never wanted them back.

132
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,680
I just want to tell you one last time.

133
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,240
I love you.

134
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,240
I won’t love you.

135
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:32,800
♪ No matter how much I want to love you ♪

136
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:40,880
♪ My heart is afraid of
reopening old wounds ♪
Okay.

137
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,200
♪ Despite my fears ♪

138
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:49,880
♪ Deep down inside, I still hope ♪

139
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,880
♪ That you won’t reopen my old wounds ♪

140
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,320
Tongrak - Mahasamut.

141
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
Guess it’s not happening.

142
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,119
I’m sorry...

143
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,360
for always pressuring you.

144
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,760
And…

145
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,880
goodbye.

146
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,040
Thank you.

147
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,320
What’s on your mind?

148
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,360
P’ Rak and Mut.

149
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,920
Hm?

150
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,320
If you think about it

151
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,480
P’ Rak and Mut’s situation is like
something straight out of a novel.

152
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,240
Who would’ve thought that two
opposite people would find each other

153
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
and fall in love?

154
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,960
Did you just say “love”?

155
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,440
Well, isn’t that true?

156
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,680
Mut loves P’ Rak, and P’ Rak loves him too.

157
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,080
I’ve never seen P’ Rak this
tolerant with anyone before.

158
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,440
I wish it was that simple.

159
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,800
Sometimes we don’t know what
we’ve got until it’s gone, Mook.

160
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,400
And convincing the guy who’s been
running away his whole life to accept it

161
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
isn’t easy at all.

162
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,200
But Mut won’t give up.

163
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,440
Right?

164
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,880
That totally reminds me of
when you hissed like a cat at Mut.

165
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
Switching sides now?

166
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,480
Huh? I’m not switching sides.

167
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,040
I’m always on P’ Rak’s side.

168
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,440
And when will you be by my side?

169
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,520
I should get the door.

170
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,760
Sawasdee krub.

171
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,160
I came to say goodbye.

172
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,040
I need to catch the bus this evening

173
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,040
and take the boat back to
the island tomorrow morning.

174
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,120
Hang on, why is this
happening all of a sudden?

175
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
What…

176
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,080
Please give it another thought, Mut.

177
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,680
What will P’ Rak do if you leave?

178
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,080
You’re shaping him into a better man
with every passing day.

179
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,200
What will happen to him if you’re gone?

180
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,800
That’s why I came to you guys.

181
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
What do you mean?

182
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,240
I know that…

183
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,120
you know Khun Tongrak well.

184
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,120
But he’s lonelier than you think.

185
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,960
He loves having someone around.

186
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,840
You might need to visit him more.

187
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,680
If he tells you to leave…

188
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,960
just stay put and be quiet.

189
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
If he asks for booze…

190
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,000
hand him coffee.

191
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,920
He’ll drink it.

192
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,280
But if he refuses to eat…

193
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,760
you can just take all his coffee.

194
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,800
He’ll eventually eat.

195
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,640
Wait a minute.

196
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,760
This is…

197
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,440
Please take care of Khun Tongrak for me.

198
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,000
My uncle-in-law!

199
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,320
What’s up, little rascal?

200
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,440
I'm only letting this
slide because it's you.

201
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,320
Want to order something, Mut?

202
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
I’m fine, Khun Kwan.

203
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,960
I just came to see Meena.

204
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
Right.

205
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,920
He promised to buy me sweets
if I got good grades.

206
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,920
Didn’t he say that was for all subjects?

207
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,640
I only did poorly in a couple
of subjects, Mommy.

208
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,360
But the ones you did poorly in
are physics, chemistry, and biology

209
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,360
where you got 8 scores each, right?

210
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,040
But I still scored well
in all the other subjects.

211
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,600
But you’re in the
science-mathematics program.

212
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,240
Maybe I’m just better at math.

213
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,560
But didn’t I ask you if you could actually
handle it if you chose this program?

214
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,080
Well, it’s so we can find out if
I can make it through the program.

215
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,000
What’s wrong with 8? It’s a good number.

216
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,320
It’s a good number,
but you only got 8 out of 30.

217
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,880
What’s the matter, Mut?

218
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,040
Oh… nothing.

219
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,600
I was just thinking about number 8.

220
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,800
You like that number just like your uncle.

221
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,400
8 has always been Rak’s favorite number.

222
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,360
He’s always going on about
how he’s not interested in love

223
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,120
or how he doesn’t want to fall in love.

224
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,800
But he really used to like tales
about princes slaying dragons

225
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,280
and living happily ever
after with princesses.

226
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,640
He always asked our nanny to read
the same stories to us over and over.

227
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,080
Even as an adult, he was so into love
stories that he turned it into a career.

228
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,480
So... what does that have to
do with number 8, Mommy?

229
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,520
To your uncle, 8 isn’t a number.

230
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,360
It’s the infinity symbol.

231
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,880
Isn’t he such a romantic that it
makes sense he’s a romance novelist?

232
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,000
He’s got this habit of rating things.

233
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,120
When he really likes something

234
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,960
he’ll give it an 8 instead of a 10.

235
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,960
When your uncle was little, he’d go
to toy stores and point at toys, saying

236
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,560
“That’s an 8, this one’s an 8,
that one’s also an 8.”

237
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,080
He was giving your grandma a headache.

238
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:24,720
So, an 8 basically shows how
much he really likes something.

239
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,800
It means an infinite amount
of liking, right, Mommy?

240
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,240
That’s right, honey.

241
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,440
How would you rate me out of 10?

242
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,480
8.

243
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,360
Huh?

244
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,080
I give you an 8.

245
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,040
How come?

246
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,240
I like number 8.

247
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,960
What teacher grades a student
based on his favorite number?

248
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,160
Then you get a zero.

249
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,240
Uncle Mut?

250
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,920
Uncle Mut.

251
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,440
Uncle Mut, are you crying?

252
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,080
Uncle Mut.

253
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,800
Are you okay?

254
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,120
Ai Rak, open the door.

255
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,720
Is this how you really want it to be?

256
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,680
The hell are you talking about?

257
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,560
Don’t just barge into my house
and speak nonsense.

258
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,120
Mut's gone.

259
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,040
What do you mean?

260
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,840
He’s returned to the island.

261
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,560
This isn’t funny.

262
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,440
He came to say goodbye and asked
Mook and me to take care of you.

263
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,200
You can still catch up.

264
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,320
Are you really just gonna let it end?

265
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,320
Ai Rak.

266
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,560
Why should I go after him?

267
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,920
It’s better this way.

268
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,000
Don’t be like this, Ai Rak.

269
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,360
It already hurts like hell.

270
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,920
So why should I add more pain with love?

271
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,800
Love doesn’t always equal pain.

272
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,560
But in my experience…

273
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,880
love only brings sorrow.

274
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,800
Oh. P’ Mut.

275
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,720
My dearest bro.

276
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,680
You’re finally back.

277
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,640
I spread the word all over the island.

278
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,680
By tomorrow, everyone
will know that you’re back.

279
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,640
I might as well ask.

280
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,600
What’s wrong with your phone?
I couldn't contact you at all.

281
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,880
All I got when I called you
was a sweet voice saying

282
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,560
“The number you’ve dialed cannot be reached
at the moment. Please try again later.”

283
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,760
Just like that.

284
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,640
My phone’s broken.

285
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,440
Wait. How’d you call me then?

286
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,200
I borrowed one…

287
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
but already gave it back.

288
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,600
So, you came back empty-handed.

289
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,080
Yeah.

290
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,680
Not even… a single photo.

291
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,680
It’s alright. There’s nothing
better than being back home.

292
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,920
Right?

293
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,640
Let me take your backpack.

294
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,880
Come on, just give it to me.

295
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,840
Anyway, are you going to
open the shop right away?

296
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,880
I’ll spread the news at the bar tonight

297
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,280
that our top-notch diver’s returned.

298
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,600
- Ai Palm.
- Yes?

299
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,840
- Lemme ask you something.
- Sure, go ahead.

300
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,040
Do you know…

301
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,360
any good tattoo artists?

302
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,680
Tattoo?

303
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
Tattoo artists…

304
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,440
You… You’re getting a tattoo?

305
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,520
What kind of tattoo?

306
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,160
How long has he been this way?

307
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,840
5 days since that day, P' Vie.

308
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,320
P’ Rak’s completely
stuck on the side stories.

309
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,320
He just keeps typing and deleting.

310
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,000
I really have no idea how to tell P’ Saw.

311
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,080
P’ Rak, do you want to take a break?

312
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,560
Ai Rak.

313
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,600
Can you just be quiet?
I’m trying to work here.

314
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,280
I told you I couldn’t write.

315
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,440
You hear me, P’ Saw? I can’t write!

316
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,360
You think I’m not suffering?

317
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,120
I want to write too, but I just can’t!
What do you want me to do?!

318
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,960
It’s supposed to be in here.
Where the hell is it?

319
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,960
Mook, have you seen my bracelet?

320
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,040
Sorry? Bracelet?

321
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,600
The bracelet!

322
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,639
Which one?

323
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,920
The one in the trash can.

324
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,960
I took out the trash.

325
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,000
Where’d you put it?

326
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,520
In the trash can out front.

327
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,520
Not here.

328
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,240
It’s not here. No.

329
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,480
No.

330
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,720
This isn’t how it’s supposed to be.

331
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,320
Hey!

332
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,360
Hey, stop!

333
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,600
Khun Tongrak - Mahasamut.

334
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,640
You must love me.

335
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,520
Can you not return to Bangkok?

336
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,280
Please stay with me.

337
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,480
Because you… are important to me.

338
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,440
Let me make it up to you.

339
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
Hold me.

340
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,160
Stop the truck! Please stop!

341
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,560
- I--
- Don’t say it!

342
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,640
How much do I need to
pay you to earn your love?

343
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,440
I just want to tell you one last time.

344
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,480
I love you.

345
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,040
I’m sorry.

346
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,120
Mahasamut, I’m sorry.

347
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,120
Please come back.

348
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,880
I’m sorry for being a jerk to you.

349
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,120
Can you please come back to me?

350
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,160
I… I…

351
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,040
I’m afraid you’ll end up
hating me if you love me.

352
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,480
I’m sorry.

353
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,040
Please come back to me.

354
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,040
Please come back.

355
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,520
Come back to me.

356
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,960
Looking for this?

357
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,840
Ai Vie, give it back. That’s mine.

358
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,960
What are you going to do with it?
Throw it away again?

359
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,600
Please give it back to me.

360
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,640
No.

361
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,200
Not until you tell me
what you plan to do next.

362
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,680
Ai Rak.

363
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,760
You really wanna know?

364
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,200
Well, I have no idea either.

365
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,480
Hearing the word “love” freaked me out.

366
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,280
I know how it will end.

367
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,880
It’s the same with my mom,
my sister, and everyone around me.

368
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,080
What am I supposed to do?

369
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,560
Tell me.

370
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,080
Ai Vie, what am I supposed to do?

371
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,400
Ai Rak.

372
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,080
When writing a novel, have you
ever feared that no one would read it?

373
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,640
No, I write because I want to.

374
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,360
Mm, that’s right.

375
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,600
Then don't be afraid of a loss
before it actually happens...

376
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,720
if all you want is to love.

377
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,640
All this pain, sadness, and suffering…

378
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,840
Whether you love someone or not

379
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,320
you can’t escape them
as long as you’re still breathing.

380
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:00,120
Why don’t you think about how
loving someone could make you happy?

381
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,320
You’ll never know if you’ll be happy or sad

382
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,720
unless you break down this fucking wall.

383
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,400
If you don’t want to
deal with loss or regrets...

384
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,520
you’ve just got to cherish him.

385
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,000
How should I do it?

386
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,200
Mahasamut chose to
come all this way with you.

387
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,920
Now it’s your turn to choose.

388
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,800
And you know what?

389
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,560
Whatever you choose

390
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,760
I’ll always be there for you.

391
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,120
I just want to love.

392
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,880
Yeah, you just want to be loved.

393
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,000
And should you get hurt, I’ll comfort you.

394
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,440
Oh my!

395
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,760
Who are you, handsome guy?

396
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,720
You look so familiar.

397
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,200
Save the greeting unless you have
jobs for me, Auntie. I’m broke now.

398
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,480
You bastard, you just
got back from the city

399
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,000
and now you’re being haughty with me?

400
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,840
I can be more than just haughty.

401
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,240
Jeez, you little…

402
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,680
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold your horses.

403
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,040
I haven’t seen you for
months. Let’s catch up.

404
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:20,840
I’m in a hurry.

405
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,640
Come on, let me take that for you.
Come on, come on, come on, let me help.

406
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,640
If you wanna ask, just do it.

407
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,440
Well… Umm...

408
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,840
Where’s that handsome bloke?

409
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,680
Ai Palm said you followed him back home.

410
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,040
Where else could he be but his home?

411
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,920
Huh? But you left with him.

412
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,520
Do we need to come back together?

413
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,720
Yeah, what you said is right.

414
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,600
Last question!

415
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,080
I thought you hated tattoos.

416
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,960
Why did you get one?

417
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,520
To pique the curiosity of nosy folks.

418
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,400
Hey, did you just call me nosy?

419
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,000
I was just asking a few
questions, you mouthy punk!

420
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,360
Because…

421
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,800
there’s nothing left to
remind me of him, Auntie.

422
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,440
Just… one last memory.

423
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,240
I still don’t know what to say to him.

424
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,080
Hey, isn’t that Handsome Bro?

425
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,240
Handsome Bro.

426
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,000
Remember me? It’s me, Ai Palm.

427
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,080
P’ Mut’s been hanging out
at the beach a lot lately.

428
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,760
He goes there every day to watch the stars.

429
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,800
Am I still allowed to say your name?

430
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,040
Mahasamut.

431
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,880
Mahasamut.

432
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,720
Mahasamut.

433
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:08,960
Khun Tongrak?

434
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,600
Why are you here?

435
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,400
Put it on for me.

436
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,320
Let me answer you this time.

437
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,440
Let me tell you.

438
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,480
Mahasamut?

439
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,920
You came here to hurt me?

440
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,800
What? No.

441
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,800
If not…

442
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,320
then why are you hurting me again?

443
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,960
If you’re here just to
toy with my feelings…

444
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,400
you’ve succeeded.

445
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,680
I told you, didn’t I?

446
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,400
My feelings…

447
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,720
My heart…

448
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,200
I’ve never wanted them back.

449
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,000
But seems like…

450
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,320
you don’t want them either.

451
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,120
Otherwise, you wouldn’t
be on this damn island.

452
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,520
Are you so eager to return
it to me, Khun Tongrak?

453
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,320
That’s not what I meant.

454
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,560
Then why are you here!?

455
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,080
Are you here to show me…

456
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,240
that my feelings don’t matter...

457
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,640
and that you can just
keep trampling on them?

458
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,680
Are you here to show me…

459
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,240
that all this time I’ve
been trying to forget you…

460
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,080
I’m nothing but a fool!

461
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,400
If you don't want it that badly...

462
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,440
just throw it away.

463
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,880
Or you want me to do it?

464
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,760
What did you do that for?

465
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,880
That’s supposed to be my question.

466
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,440
Do I need to remind you?

467
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,560
You don’t want love.

468
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,720
You don’t want anyone.

469
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,400
It’s nothing more than a deal between us.

470
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,840
I’m sorry…

471
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,560
for forcing my feelings on you.

472
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,720
And I just want to let you know.

473
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,840
No matter how much you pay me…

474
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,360
I’m never going back.

475
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,760
Because my feelings for you…

476
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,760
can’t be bought with money.

477
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,440
Just go back.

478
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,240
There are tons of men…

479
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,280
who’d jump at your offer.

480
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:13,920
I’m not available.

481
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,600
I’m busy improving my hometown.

482
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,640
Like I said, I don’t want it back.

483
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,680
If you don’t want it…

484
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,000
throw it away yourself.

485
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:54,920
Don’t make me…

486
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:57,960
throw my own heart away.

487
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,360
Are you crying?

488
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,680
I’m not.

489
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,240
But, Ai Vie…

490
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,360
It hurts.

491
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,560
It fucking hurts.

492
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,800
Have you told Mut about your feelings?

493
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,960
I'm too scared.

494
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,200
I don’t know where to start.

495
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,600
Should I apologize first?

496
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,000
Or what should I do?

497
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,960
I’ve never loved anyone before.

498
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,200
Mahasamut said it was painful to see me.

499
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,880
So how could I tell him I love him?

500
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,280
You should’ve seen his face, Ai Vie.

501
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,960
He looked…

502
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,240
like…

503
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,800
like I was here to hurt him.

504
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,600
Ai Vie…

505
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,200
What do I do?

506
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,360
I don’t want him to hate me.

507
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,320
So, are you just gonna give up?

508
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:44,640
No.

509
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,640
Then try it your own way.

510
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,600
Even if you can’t say it to his face

511
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,280
there are other ways to show how you feel.

512
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:29,920
Mahasamut.

513
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,080
Do you need a hand?

514
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,520
Leave me alone.

515
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,320
Just one more time.

516
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,800
Please hear me out just this once.

517
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:36,480
I'm such a fool.

518
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,480
Why do I even think he’s still here?

519
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:46,840
Idiot.

520
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,480
What a fool.

521
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:13,960
P’ Mut.

522
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,800
P’ Mut krub. Oh, sorry. Hello.

523
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,520
Why are you here?
Didn’t you ask for a day off?

524
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,080
Well, I did, but I got an urgent request.

525
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,080
Handsome Bro’s got something to give you.

526
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,040
But I don’t want it.

527
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,080
Huh? Hey, hold on.

528
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,800
Come on, just hear me out.

529
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,280
I’m not listening. Let me go!

530
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:42,560
What?

531
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,520
Look…

532
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,360
Handsome Bro’s asking for one last favor

533
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,160
and he won’t bother you again.

534
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:01,200
He said he just needs
you to hear him out once...

535
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,680
and then you won't
have to see him again.

536
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,400
(Southern dialect)
And I was going to say ...

537
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,120
(Southern dialect)
that you didn’t take all the keys.

538
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,000
I must be out of my mind.

539
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,600
Sorry!!! I didn’t have the guts
to say this in person

540
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,200
but can you please hear me out...?

541
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,960
I’m sorry, Mahasamut.

542
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,960
I’ve been hurting you.

543
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,080
I’ve been selfish.

544
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:05,360
I’m just a coward who can’t
even apologize to you in person.

545
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:13,280
But could someone as kind
as you do me one last favor?

546
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,040
Could you listen to what I’m about to say?

547
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:21,800
Throughout my life...

548
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,920
the love I've known has always
been about hurting one another...

549
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,280
constant pain...

550
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,400
and tears that never seem to dry.

551
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,000
My mom.

552
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:36,840
My sister.

553
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,800
Everyone around me.

554
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,200
I’m scared, Mahasamut.

555
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,080
And my fear has led me to ruin everything.

556
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,080
I’ve been running away like a madman.

557
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,080
Running from you, from your love...

558
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,120
from the feeling you
taught me for the first time.

559
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,280
You taught me what happiness is.

560
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:04,920
I want to wake up next
to you every morning.

561
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,080
I want us to drift off to sleep together.

562
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,040
I want to hear you ask…

563
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:12,560
“Are you tired?”

564
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,480
“Are you hungry?”

565
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,440
And I want to do things for you too.

566
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:24,160
Is it wrong if I want us to cry together...

567
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,080
be happy together...

568
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,000
and share laughter?

569
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,800
Maybe I’m asking for too much.

570
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,320
I’m sorry.

571
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,600
Sorry for loving you.

572
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:47,120
Sorry for realizing it
when it was too late.

573
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:58,560
Mahasamut.

574
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,560
I love you.

575
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:37,440
♪ (What does true love really feel like?) ♪

576
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:43,760
♪ I truly hope you won’t
reopen my old wounds. ♪

577
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,000
Mahasamut.

578
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,360
Yes, Khun Tongrak.

579
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,000
Mahasamut.

580
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,160
Yes, I’m right here.

581
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,480
Mahasamut.

582
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,600
Yes.

583
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:13,680
Mahasamut.

584
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:18,800
I love you.

585
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,520
I… I… I…

586
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,360
I… I’m sorry.

587
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,760
I’m sorry for saying mean things
to you. Sorry for hurting you.

588
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:46,880
I’m sorry. I…

589
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,280
I don’t want to hear you say sorry.

590
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:56,600
Then…

591
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:01,800
what… what… what should I say?

592
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:05,520
I’m willing to do anything
you want, just tell me.

593
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,000
I’ll do whatever you want--

594
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,280
Can you tell me…

595
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,000
how you feel about me?

596
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:21,520
Right now.

597
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,200
To my face.

598
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,480
Please tell me.

599
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,280
I love you.

600
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,080
Yes.

601
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,720
Mahasamut, I love you.

602
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:51,800
Yes.

603
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,160
I love you. I love you. I love you.

604
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,240
I love you so much. I love you. I love you.

605
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:17,960
Tongrak - Mahasamut.

606
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,520
It’s actually happening.

607
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,720
I like number 8.

608
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,160
I believe you.

609
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,480
I will love you…

610
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,480
infinitely.

611
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:14,520
Sawasdee krub.

612
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:19,640
Sawasdee.

613
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,640
Did you have sweet dreams?

614
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,400
Yes. And you?

615
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:01,320
Me too.

616
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:04,560
What did you dream?

617
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:07,640
I dreamed of you.

618
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,000
Gotta get up.

619
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,840
Not yet. 5 more minutes please.

620
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:28,280
Mahasamut.

621
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:51,640
Tongrak - Mahasamut.

622
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:56,120
Yes.

623
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,600
“Must love Mahasamut.”

624
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,080
I already do.

625
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,120
When I followed you back...

626
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,640
I set a deadline for myself from the start.

627
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,560
I couldn't leave this island.

628
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:33,400
What about later on?

629
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,240
I can stay with you
during the low seasons.

630
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:46,280
So, you’ll stay here for 6 months
and live with me for another 6?

631
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:49,840
I won’t have it.

632
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:55,400
I know I shouldn’t have brought it up...

633
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,160
especially after we’ve worked things out.

634
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,880
But I can’t leave this place.

635
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,120
This island is my life.

636
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,200
It’s my home.

637
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,560
Many lives depend on me.

638
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,800
I’m not telling you to abandon everything.

639
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,640
I’ve got an idea. I’ll come live with you.

640
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,120
I’m a writer. I can work
from just about anywhere.

641
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,520
I’ll be wherever my lover is.

642
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:52,160
I was going to tease you
for calling me your lover.

643
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,240
But there aren’t…
any aesthetic clinics here.

644
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,120
You can stay with me
in Bangkok for 6 months.

645
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,240
Alright then.

646
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,640
So, where will you be staying?

647
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:14,880
At your place.

648
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,080
Sure you can live there?

649
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,520
I'm sure.

650
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,520
Really?

651
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,560
Mm.

652
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,320
I can stay with you at the resort.

653
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,960
But I can really live with you.

654
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,920
It’s alright, we can talk about it later.

655
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,120
Time to fuel you up with coffee.

656
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,040
Come on, let’s get breakfast.

657
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,320
Mahasamut
Diving and Traveling

658
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,920
Mahasamut! Mahasamut! Mahasamut!

659
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:03,480
Hold on.

660
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,200
Relax, what’s wrong?

661
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,000
I’m excited.

662
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,600
I can tell.

663
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,400
So, what’s the matter?

664
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:16,360
And what’s this?

665
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:28,360
Khun Tongrak.

666
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,480
What’s with the face?

667
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:00,640
Well…

668
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:04,080
I was thinking that
I should’ve told you first…

669
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,800
but I wanted to keep it a surprise.

670
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,160
Are you angry?

671
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:26,920
Are you really angry?

672
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:35,840
I’m sorry, I just wanted to surprise you.

673
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:39,000
I want you to feel assured
that I’ll be staying with you.

674
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,960
I really went overboard
this time, didn’t I?

675
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,680
Why did you buy a house?

676
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:05,200
Because I want to live with you.

677
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:07,520
Without discussing it with me?

678
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:12,760
I wanted to surprise you.

679
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:19,200
What else?

680
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,560
That’s all.

681
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,400
Do you really want me to be angry?

682
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,480
You’re not?

683
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,080
That’s why I asked for your reasons.

684
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,640
You want to live with me.

685
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,720
So, how can I get angry…

686
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,320
when you’re thinking about our future?

687
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,320
Or do you want me to?

688
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,040
No.

689
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:23,720
Next time, you need to tell me
about important matters like this.

690
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,280
Because we’re lovers.

691
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:31,960
Right?

692
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,400

695
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:49,760
isn’t a place.

696
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:58,280
