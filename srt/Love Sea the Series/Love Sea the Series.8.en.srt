1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,480
Don’t you want to go up on stage?

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,800
I’m fine with being the writer
signing books at the booth.

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,280
But I don’t like making
an appearance with actors.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,240
How odd of you to be alone.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,200
You think I’ll flip out
and throw water at you?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,840
There’s one more thing I want to tell you.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,720
Don’t be stupid.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,640
Good job.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,760
I'm not a kid.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,240
I know.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,280
You're the best.

12
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,160
I’m super hungry! All this
studying’s killed my sugar levels.

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,160
Is there someone kind enough
to take me out for desserts?

14
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,400
Little rascal.

15
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,600
As expected of Meena’s uncle-in-law.

16
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,640
Doing repetitive tasks isn't always boring.

17
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,480
It’s a sign of dedication to those
who've brought meaning to your life.

18
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,520
What's got you all stressed?

19
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,120
Isn’t it obvious?
I’m not an actress.

20
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,600
I’ve never read a script before.

21
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,040
And then you just sprung
the line rehearsal on me.

22
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,760
You made it sound like “Oh Mook, change
the light bulb for me,” just like that.

23
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,720
But it’s easier than changing light bulbs.

24
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,880
Whoa.

25
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,040
How am I supposed to
teach you if you sit so far?

26
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,280
Look, see this?

27
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,680
This is the stage direction, which
specifies what the actors should do.

28
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,280
This is the dialogue.

29
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,240
For example, this is scene 5/13,
and it's set for filming on Friday.

30
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,400
Meaning I have to prep
for this scene plus 20 others.

31
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,360
Whoa.

32
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,640
You have to memorize all of this?

33
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,520
Mm-hmm.

34
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,880
And act out all of this?

35
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,560
Yeah.

36
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,000
For example...

37
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,000
According to the script, I need to approach
Khun Witt with shyness and hesitation

38
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,400
then hold his hand.

39
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,080
“Can I hold your hand, Khun Witt?”

40
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,720
You’ve got to hold my hand back.

41
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,880
P’ Vie, I can’t remember the lines yet.
I might not be of much help.

42
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,159
Could I take the script
back to memorize it first?

43
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,960
So I can help you
with the lines next time.

44
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,960
And I just remembered I have
an appointment with P’ Saw today.

45
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,040
I’ve got to go.

46
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,080
But sometimes, things stay the same
for too long and just don’t progress.

47
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,840
Love Sea the Series

48
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:37,560
Chapter 8: The Return of the Past

49
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,520
Let’s check how he’s doing.

50
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,560
Not finished yet?

51
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,040
Just a little more.

52
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,200
Hungry?

53
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,520
Let me wrap up this bit first.

54
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,480
Are you hungry?

55
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,560
No.

56
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,440
Tired already?

57
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,280
Mm.

58
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
Wanna take a break?

59
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,440
Nah, idea’s still flowing.

60
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,160
How about a coffee? I’ll make one for you.

61
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,320
What’s that?

62
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,000
A project I’m working on.

63
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,920
They’re accessories.

64
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,000
You’re closing down the dive shop?

65
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,400
No.

66
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,720
Oh.

67
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,800
Have I told you?

68
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,080
The shop’s run with a Japanese partner.

69
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,160
He puts in the money, I put in the effort.

70
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,640
And I’m planning to sell
the accessories to tourists.

71
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,720
You know?

72
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,320
All of them are made of recycled materials.

73
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,640
I’ve been experimenting for years

74
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,880
because designing and
working out costs is tricky.

75
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,920
But I think I can put them up for
sale just in time for the high season.

76
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,440
It’s pretty cute.

77
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,800
Girls are going to love it.

78
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,320
Do you like it?

79
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,040
What do you think?

80
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,600
Don’t mess with me.

81
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,960
That’s rich coming from you.

82
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,600
I’ve never messed with you.
It’s you who’s always getting on my nerves.

83
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,360
So, if you say you don’t like...

84
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,960
can I assume you’re
trying to get on my nerves?

85
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,920
What if I tell you I like?

86
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,440
It means you like.

87
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,440
What else could it mean?

88
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,040
I like. Pretty cute.

89
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
I like you too.

90
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,080
I've said it.

91
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,960
Aren’t you going to say something?

92
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,320
I...

93
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,280
- I meant the necklace--
- But I meant you.

94
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,840
I’ll check it out.

95
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,440
Where’s my slutty friend?

96
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,280
That’s harsh.

97
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,800
You can’t deny the fact.

98
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,160
Well… I’m okay if
he’s like that only with me.

99
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,480
Give me some. I’m feeling hot.

100
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,400
Just driving, getting out of the car,
and waltzing into my house

101
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,000
couldn’t have made you break a sweat.

102
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,600
Did I interrupt something?

103
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,360
Feeling cranky?

104
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,360
Look who’s talking.

105
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,600
It’s about my secretary, isn’t it?

106
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,400
Your secretary’s sharp in
everything, except for one thing.

107
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,560
And what’s that?

108
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,560
My advances.

109
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,960
I’ve been trying hard to seduce
her, but she’s not falling for it.

110
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,800
I’m starting to wonder if
my charm’s losing its touch.

111
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,320
Or maybe she never
noticed it in the first place.

112
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,960
I never noticed it in the first place.

113
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,200
Shut up. Your friend’s an A-list actress.

114
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,200
Don’t flatter yourself, sis.

115
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,560
Alright, alright. Drink some water first.

116
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
What's for dinner today?

117
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,760
What do you want to eat?

118
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,480
I’m good with whatever you make.

119
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,200
- Just no--
- Spicy foods.

120
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,560
Yes, I know that.

121
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,640
By the way, why don’t you
just confess to Khun Kaimook?

122
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,840
You knew?

123
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,680
It's pretty obvious.

124
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,720
See? The whole world knows about it.

125
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,560
The only clueless one is your secretary.

126
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,680
Why did I fake a car breakdown
and take a cab to the set?

127
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,040
Because I wanted Mook to pick me up.

128
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,520
Why did I go to such lengths
to have her as my manager?

129
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,880
Because I want to keep her close.

130
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,480
And! Why does my place
always have so many issues?

131
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,400
Because I want her to come over.

132
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,000
I’ve been going all out, but
she still doesn’t get the hint.

133
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,680
Just confess first.

134
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,760
If I confess first, I lose.
Do you catch my drift?

135
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,560
Nope.

136
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,160
How can you not catch my drift?

137
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,480
The male leads in your novels
never confess first either.

138
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,200
I’ve starred in the shows
based on your novels.

139
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,600
I had to play the poor female lead

140
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,560
opposite scumbag male leads
who don’t know how to confess first.

141
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,680
It’s written in your novels.

142
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,720
The first to confess loses.

143
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,760
But that’s just fiction.
This is real life. Don’t mix them up.

144
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,520
Oh, just shut up, will ya!

145
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,240
As if you’d help me.

146
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,400
Look, if I never helped you

147
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,160
then why would I stay quiet
whenever you prank Mook?

148
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,680
Use your head. Okay?

149
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,200
- Should I jump her?
- Who’s stopping you?

150
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,160
Bastard, I’ve got a conscience.

151
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,040
Yeah sure. I’m a slut.
I'm a bastard. I sleep around.

152
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,880
You think that too, right?

153
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,600
Of course not.

154
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,760
Are you sulking?

155
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,800
Who’s sulking?

156
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,920
Alright, alright. You’re not sulking.

157
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,520
But… let me make it up to you.

158
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Come with me.

159
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,640
- What?
- C’mere.

160
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,680
Where are you taking me?

161
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,280
Stop asking and just follow.

162
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,920
You like him.

163
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,880
What kind of nonsense are you spouting?

164
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,200
How long have you and I been friends?

165
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,520
Don’t you know how to count? 15 years.

166
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,960
Exactly, Ai Rak. 15 whole years.

167
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,120
We’ve been friends for 15 years.

168
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,520
I’ve known you since you
had that silly student haircut.

169
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,880
And you’ve known me since
I was a little girl with pigtails.

170
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
A hideous one at that.

171
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,680
Anyway, we’ve been through
every moment of each other’s lives

172
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,560
even before you came close with Connor.

173
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,120
Therefore…

174
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,320
You like Mahasamut.

175
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,360
Non--

176
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,320
The nonsense one is you.

177
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,520
When was the last time
you slept with someone else?

178
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,640
When was the last time you hit the pub?

179
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,640
Ah! Don’t argue with me.

180
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,400
Do you feel like sleeping with other dudes?

181
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,040
Have you ever acted all
sweet and cute with anyone?

182
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,600
Ah, ah, ah.

183
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,440
Hold on, I’m not done yet.

184
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,520
And have you ever wanted to
snuggle up to a man's shoulder

185
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,480
like you do with Ai Mut?

186
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,400
Mm, that’s right.

187
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,840
If you can’t answer

188
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,960
you have to admit that
everything I said is right.

189
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,400
Answer me.

190
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,000
You’re spouting nonsense!

191
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,320
Go home if you’re going to act like this.
I’m going to work.

192
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,360
No, I’m not leaving.

193
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,400
If you want me to leave,
call Mook to pick me up.

194
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,800
You’re just fooling yourself.

195
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,080
And you’re just an idiot who won’t
come clean about your feelings.

196
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,880
Fine, I’ll be serious next time.

197
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,000
Is that so?

198
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,120
Every time you get serious,
it turns into a disaster.

199
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,240
Stop it! Stop!

200
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,400
You stop!

201
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,840
- You stop!
- You stop!

202
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,840
Wanna piece of me?!

203
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,480
Ai… Ai Vie!

204
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,520
You like Mahasamut.

205
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,800
When was the last time
you slept with someone else?

206
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,680
Have you ever acted all
sweet and cute with anyone?

207
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,080
And have you ever wanted to
snuggle up to a man's shoulder

208
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,880
like you do with Ai Mut?

209
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,240
You seem to be doing well, Uncle.

210
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,360
Long time no see, my niece.

211
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
Wow, look at you, all grown up!

212
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,280
Come on, give me a hug.

213
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,000
You’re a celebrity now, I see.

214
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,240
Uncle Jak.

215
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,560
Relax, I’m not trying to rub it in.

216
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,200
Even I have to admit
that my son’s gone too far.

217
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,320
I apologize on Rak’s behalf.

218
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,800
You must have been very embarrassed, Prin.

219
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,840
I don’t really keep up with social media

220
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,320
but I still see your face everywhere.

221
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,400
Uncle Jak, drop it already.

222
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,160
Alright, alright. I won’t talk about it.

223
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,240
But looks like my niece
is really desperate.

224
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,200
Let's break up.

225
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,160
Too many books to release this year.
Can’t publish yours. Sorry.

226
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,320
I’m really busy these days.
Let’s meet up another time.

227
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,600
What have you gotten yourself into?!

228
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,080
Prin.

229
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,240
Prin.

230
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,520
Is there anything I can do to help?

231
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,760
Yes, just tell me what
you want in exchange.

232
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,960
The stocks I invested in
have just tanked recently.

233
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,000
Bullshit.

234
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,560
All this bastard’s ever done
is leech off women.

235
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,280
5 million baht.

236
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,760
Hm?

237
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,920
In exchange for destroying
the one you brought into this world.

238
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,280
And if I succeed?

239
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,440
It depends on how well you do the job.

240
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,400
If I’m satisfied, I can reward you
with more than what I promised.

241
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,200
What do you mean, reward me?

242
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,480
This simple matter
is just a walk in the park.

243
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,680
Why wouldn’t I help out my niece, right?

244
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,400
Good.

245
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,040
Where are you going?

246
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,760
None of your business.

247
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,360
Hold on, talk to me first.

248
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,120
I’m off to laser my hair.

249
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,080
I have a laser appointment.

250
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,680
Did you seriously think
I was born hairless?

251
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,480
Wait.

252
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,280
- What?
- A guy or a girl?

253
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,600
What are you on about?

254
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,240
Is it a guy or a girl doing the laser?

255
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,200
Look, as if I’d let a woman touch my thing.

256
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,280
Wait!

257
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,080
Can I come with you?

258
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,160
No.

259
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,040
What’s wrong with him?

260
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,520
Where are you going?

261
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,280
To the clinic.

262
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,400
You think I look this good just from
drinking 8 glasses of water a day?

263
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,040
- Let me come with you.
- No, I'm going alone.

264
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,200
I’m off to get a haircut.
Don’t ask. Don’t come with me.

265
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,800
- But--
- No means no.

266
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,760
I've been neglecting myself for
2 months. Time for some self-care.

267
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,840
Move.

268
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,720
Is this something you
should consult a 13-year-old?

269
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,160
I don’t have anyone to talk to.

270
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Minus 3 points for having no friends.

271
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,400
Hold on.

272
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,760
Maybe…

273
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,640
Uncle Rak’s tired of you?

274
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,000
Not a chance.

275
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,080
But didn't you say he's been
leaving the house a lot lately?

276
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,760
It could only mean one thing.

277
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,960
Enlighten me, Ms. Consultant.

278
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,040
It means…

279
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,920
The honeymoon’s over!

280
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,120
Come on, no way!

281
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,440
You keep denying it,
but how can you be confident?

282
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,120
A hot guy like him could find
someone way better than you.

283
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,080
Maybe he’s been going out…
to meet a new guy?

284
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,440
You bet I’m confident.

285
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,040
I’ve got adult techniques
that kids just wouldn’t understand.

286
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,360
You’re only 7-8 years older than me.

287
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,040
You’re not any better.

288
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,680
In Uncle Raks’ eyes…

289
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,240
you’re probably just… a kid too!

290
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,000
Where are you going?

291
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,840
I’ll be back late.

292
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,040
Don’t wait up for me.

293
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,360
You’re meeting P’ Vie?

294
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,040
Ai Vie isn’t the only friend I have.

295
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,400
Khun Connor then?

296
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,680
- No.
- Ai Kom?

297
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,560
No.

298
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,800
I’m going out.

299
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,960
Now let go of me.

300
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,760
Where to?

301
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,280
None of your business.

302
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,000
Khun Tongrak.

303
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,400
Tell me.

304
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,720
According to the agreement

305
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,280
you have no right to meddle in my business.

306
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,120
Whether I ‘eat’ someone else
is none of your business.

307
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,560
Eat?

308
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,160
Fine.

309
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,000
Mahasamut!

310
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,480
Mahasamut, what the hell are you doing?

311
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,160
The agreement doesn’t prohibit me...

312
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,080
from banging you until you
stop thinking about other men.

313
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,200
Huh? What are you--

314
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,040
You’ll enjoy this so much...

315
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,280
you’ll forget about going out.

316
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,160
What’s making you so confident?

317
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,640
Dare to bet…

318
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
whether you'll enjoy it?

319
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,360
Wait, stop!

320
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,560
Looks like you’re ready
to accept the challenge.

321
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,480
What a jerk. You’re so full of yourself.

322
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,280
What’s it gonna be?

323
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,800
Without your permission...

324
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,600
I can’t go ahead with it.

325
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,360
So, what’s it gonna be?

326
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,920
Will you ‘eat’ me…

327
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,040
or somebody else?

328
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,440
Screw Ai Vie.

329
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,360
And you’d better show me
you’re not all talk.

330
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,120
Jeez, will you just
stop smiling, Uncle Mut?

331
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:28,920
Why?

332
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,920
It’s creeping me out.

333
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,280
Quit it.

334
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,840
Who told your uncle to be so cute?

335
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,640
No one. Uncle Rak’s cute on his own.

336
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,480
What!? What’s up with
that look on your face?

337
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,240
Stop beating around the bush.

338
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,720
You’ll never get to see your
uncle’s cuteness the way I do.

339
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,880
That’s not true.
I’ve seen it ever since I was little.

340
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,760
Impossible.

341
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,280
You’ll never see it the way I do.

342
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,120
Little kid.

343
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,640
Looks like you’re having a good time.

344
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,680
Can Grandpa join you?

345
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,360
Uncle Mut, he’s my grandpa.

346
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,480
My precious granddaughter,
it’s been a while.

347
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,080
You’ve grown up so much.

348
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,560
I guess you don’t recognize me.

349
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,480
We met when you were just a tiny baby.

350
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,800
Actually, we would’ve met again by now

351
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,160
if you hadn’t kept running away from me.

352
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,120
Let's head to the back of the school.
Better not waste time.

353
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:12,840
Thank you for letting
your mom and uncle know.

354
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,760
I was able to talk
to my kids thanks to that.

355
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,080
You… did it… on purpose…

356
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,680
I was so excited to meet Meena
that I forgot my manners.

357
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,440
I’m Jak, Kongkwan and Tongrak’s dad.

358
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,960
And Meena’s grandfather.

359
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,360
- You are--
- Mahasamut.

360
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,800
Mahasamut.

361
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,640
We’ve finally met.

362
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
Do we know each other?

363
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,520
No, this is the first time we’ve met.

364
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,560
But I pay attention
to the people around my son.

365
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,400
I’m sorry if I made you feel bad

366
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,560
but you have to understand that as a father

367
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,280
I naturally worry about my kids.

368
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:15,440
Especially when someone suddenly
moves into Rak’s house, like you.

369
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:27,800
So… what business does
a good father like you have with me?

370
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,360
Don’t say it was to see Meena, or you
wouldn’t have waited for me to show up.

371
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,239
Cut to the chase—what do you want?

372
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,360
Mahasamut.

373
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,240
I've finished the manuscript.

374
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,440
Umm… good job.

375
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,480
That’s it?

376
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,840
You’re the best.

377
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,240
No writer holds a candle to you.

378
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,160
There are tons of better writers.

379
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,880
Besides, only the main story is finished.

380
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,120
I haven’t started the side stories yet.

381
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,880
I don’t know how I should congratulate you.

382
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,720
I only have one question.

383
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,760
What is it?

384
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,200
Are you tired?

385
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,320
Mm.

386
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,360
Yeah, I’m dead-beat.

387
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:31,760
Do you know how worried I was
when you were working without rest?

388
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,680
Mm, I do.

389
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,480
How about taking a break today?

390
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,080
Mm.

391
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,000
Wanna join me?

392
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,600
"Are you saying that what happened
between us is all in my head?"

393
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,880
“You know it’s not like that.”

394
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,800
“You know how I feel.”

395
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,640
“But you never said it.”

396
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,640
“You never told me.”

397
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,040
“How much longer
will you leave me guessing?"

398
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,640
I taught you about stage directions.

399
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,160
This part is where you
pull me in and hug me.

400
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,600
But it’s hugging.
Do I really have to go that far?

401
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,720
We’re both women. What are you afraid of?

402
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,960
And you promised you’d help me.

403
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,280
I never said that.

404
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,840
But you gave your word.

405
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,600
I don’t think I can help you, P’ Vie.

406
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,800
You should find someone else
to help you with the line rehearsal.

407
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,200
Okay.

408
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,240
Hm?

409
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,560
But you’ve got to help me.

410
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,840
One last scene.

411
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,240
You promise?

412
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,120
I’m a woman of my word.

413
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,880
Wait…

414
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,560
What?

415
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,160
You gave me your word.

416
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
But P’ Vie...

417
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,040
- This scene is--
- What’s wrong with it?

418
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,720
This scene’s crucial to the story.

419
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,960
Pawitt caresses Praewrung’s cheek

420
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,000
and leans in until their faces are close.

421
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,840
He asks, “Can I love you?”

422
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,000
Praewrung smiles and… kiss him.

423
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,880
Yes.

424
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
You see how crucial this scene is?

425
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,320
Even though there’s hardly any dialogue

426
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,880
it’s tough to get yourself
in the mood to touch someone.

427
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,040
That’s why I want you
to say this line to me.

428
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,640
I want to see how far
I can bring out the emotion.

429
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,720
I...

430
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,160
I just have to say the line, right?

431
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,080
And then I can leave?

432
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,440
I won’t be able to hit
that mood if you hesitate.

433
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,880
We’re not actually going to kiss, right?

434
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,240
The line.

435
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,920
“Can I love you?”

436
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,080
Look me in the eye.

437
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,200
P’ Vie.

438
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,000
I think…

439
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,160
Yes.

440
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,680
We can love each other.

441
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,200
This is your only chance, Ai Mook.

442
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,640
Mook, I…

443
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,600
P’ Vie, I’m sorry.

444
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,160
You were focusing on
the line practice, but I…

445
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,880
I’m going home.

446
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,040
- I’m sorry.
- Mook.

447
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,920
Mook. Mook.

448
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,480
Mook, wait!

449
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,440
Just get to the point.

450
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,520
How’s it been?

451
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,360
What do you mean?

452
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,600
Have we met before?

453
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,720
How’s it been living with Rak?

454
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,960
I know you’ve been living with
him since you left the island.

455
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,360
Come on, I’m Rak’s father.

456
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,360
It's only natural for a father
to care about his children's lives

457
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:00,480
especially when it comes to
who they date or bring home.

458
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,560
I don’t know if you’ve ever
heard anything about me.

459
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,760
But seeing Meena’s reaction…
you must’ve heard a lot.

460
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,000
I admit I did a lot of things...

461
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,080
to Rak, Kwan, and their mother.

462
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,560
I was a terrible husband and father.

463
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,960
And I still regret it to this day.

464
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:46,680
It’s a real shame I missed out on
the opportunity to see those two grow up.

465
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,280
I think you’ve said enough.

466
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,200
Just get to the point.

467
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,800
What do you want from me?

468
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,280
Coming here with you
is already a waste of my time.

469
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:06,120
If you want to rant about all the shitty
stuff you did, save it for someone else.

470
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,200
Come find me later when you
remember what you wanted to tell me.

471
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,880
I want you to break up with Rak.

472
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,440
Break up with him.

473
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,840
Why should I do what you say?

474
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,000
I told you I want to make up for the past.

475
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,760
Isn’t it too late for that?

476
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,080
What’s the point of playing
the good father now?

477
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,840
It’s never too late.

478
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,760
But yes, I want to fulfill
my role as Rak’s father.

479
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,720
I don’t see how it’s related
to Khun Tongrak and me.

480
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,320
It’s related.

481
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:55,480
Because you already know that
you’re not good enough for him.

482
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,040
You’re well aware of it, aren’t you?

483
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,200
Uncle Mut!

484
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,600
Uncle Mut.

485
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,880
I want to go home now.

486
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,600
Let’s go home.

487
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,600
You’d better mind your own business.

488
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,640
Mahasamut.

489
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,960
I’ve been in your situation before.

490
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,160
If you don’t want to hurt Rak’s feelings

491
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,440
make sure to think about what I said.

492
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,160
Uncle Mut.

493
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,640
It’s my fault.

494
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,080
I thought I could handle it...

495
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,920
but I was wrong, Uncle Mut.

496
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,600
It was Grandpa’s plan to let me see
him so I’d tell Mommy and Uncle Rak.

497
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,960
It’s all my fault, Uncle Mut.

498
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,720
It’s not your fault, Meena.

499
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,280
It’s that--

500
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,400
It’s because of your grandpa.

501
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,120
You never know what
someone like that is thinking.

502
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,120
Then…

503
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,520
Uncle Mut…

504
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,600
Can we keep this from Uncle Rak?

505
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,640
Let’s act like today never happened.

506
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,760
I’d hate to see Uncle Rak feeling down.

507
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,160
And don’t you do what Grandpa wants.

508
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,520
Don’t break up with Uncle Rak.

509
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,400
Don’t leave him either.

510
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,800
He has no one else.

511
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,040
I won’t leave Khun Tongrak.

512
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,320
Never.

513
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,480
Then...

514
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,120
let’s pretend this never happened.

515
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,560
I’ll keep my mouth shut.

516
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,960
You can’t tell Mommy or Uncle Rak either.

517
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,120
I don’t want to do what Grandpa wants.

518
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,520
I don’t want to be his tool.

519
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,520
If Grandpa wants us to
tell them, we could just…

520
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:58,880
…not tell them.

521
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,040
Right?

522
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,000
I will protect you.

523
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,720
P’ Rak submitted the
manuscript before the deadline?!

524
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,640
Normally, we had to pester you about it.

525
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,560
By the time you sent everything in,
the book fairs had already kicked off.

526
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,560
The editorial team had
to work around the clock

527
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,000
so the books could be sold on time.

528
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,960
But this time, you beat the deadline!

529
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,960
Who says it’s done?
I haven’t started the side stories yet.

530
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,600
- What?
- What?

531
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,200
Then it’s going to be
a last-minute rush again?

532
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,720
That’s enough, get back to work.

533
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,240
Keep it up and Rak might
not write the side stories.

534
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,080
Go on!

535
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,840
- Come on.
- Fine.

536
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,680
Looks like I’ve been making
things difficult for everyone.

537
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,640
I’m used to it.

538
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,760
P’ Saw, there’s no need to be that blunt.

539
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,720
So, what brings you here today?

540
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,360
You’re usually out partying
after you’re done writing.

541
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,920
You make it sound like I’m an alcoholic.

542
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,160
Is that not true?

543
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:56,440
I got you some snacks as a token of
apology for all the trouble I’ve caused.

544
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,840
Are you feeling unwell?

545
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,040
I’m fine, P’ Saw.

546
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,960
Just trying to be kind
like the guy at home.

547
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:11,160
Hmm… could it be
the guy I met at the Book Fair?

548
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,560
Alright, I won’t push it.

549
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,760
By the way, where’s Mook?
Why didn’t she come with you?

550
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,360
It’s rare since you’re usually inseparable.

551
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:25,960
She’s taking a week off.

552
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,760
The girl who’s all about “no breaks,
no leave, no sick days, no matter what”?

553
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,800
She called me this morning,
and now she’s totally MIA.

554
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,280
Since you’re here

555
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,400
can you help me check if
the cover needs any tweaks?

556
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,160
Sure.

557
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,480
It looks great, P’ Saw.

558
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,440
Maybe add…

559
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,720
P’ Rak…

560
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,400
I don’t know what to do anymore.

561
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:34,880
I wonder if she’s okay.

562
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,160
Rak.

563
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,160
It’s been a while.

564
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,320
Mm, you’re right.
It’s been years since we last met.

565
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,400
I’ve only received your
texts every once in a while.

566
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,680
What do you want, Dad?

567
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,600
Jeez, what’s with people around you?

568
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,720
Why do they think
I want something from you?

569
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,200
Because it’s the only thing
you’re always after.

570
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,360
What are you saying?

571
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,560
That… You gave it to me.

572
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:52,320
When have I ever asked for your money, huh?

573
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,920
I just wanted to see you.

574
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,960
- And talk to Meena, that’s all--
- Stay away from Meena!

575
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,400
Why? She’s my granddaughter.

576
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,440
I’m begging you, leave Meena alone.

577
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,160
Just tell me and I’ll give
you everything you want

578
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,200
But stay away from Meena
and don’t contact P’ Kwan.

579
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,240
Then… break up with Mahasamut.

580
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,080
Stay away from him.

581
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,080
So...

582
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:31,120
who exactly will you choose,
Meena and Mahasamut?

583
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,240
Didn’t you say you’d give me everything?

584
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:40,920
Dad… I’m begging you,
please leave Meena alone.

585
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,360
Don’t hurt Mahasamut.

586
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,880
Don’t do anything to them.

587
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,880
Don’t be greedy, Rak.

588
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,880
You have to choose.

589
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,360
Just like when you chose your mother

590
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,400
and cut ties with me.

591
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,880
If you can’t decide…

592
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,320
how about I choose for you?

593
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,320
Just like what happened
with your Uncle Doctor.

594
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:28,680
The number you’ve dialed
cannot be reached at the moment.

595
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:33,960
The number you’ve dialed
cannot be reached at the moment.

596
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,760
…leave a message after the beep…

597
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,480
…return your call as soon as possible.

598
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,560
No, not like this.

599
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,200
The number you’ve dialed
cannot be reached at the moment.

600
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,760
Mahasamut, pick up. Don’t do this.

601
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,680
The number you’ve dialed
cannot be reached at the moment.

602
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,000
Please leave a message after the beep…

603
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:16,680
Mahasamut!

604
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,840
Ai Rak, Calm down.

605
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,520
Ai Vie, I met Dad.
He’s gonna kill Mahasamut!

606
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,640
Wait, calm down and listen to me.

607
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,160
Dad’s gonna kill Mahasamut!
You hear me, Dad’s gonna kill him!

608
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,800
Just like he killed Uncle Doctor!

609
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,200
What am I gonna do
if something happens to him?

610
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,080
Hey, hold on!

611
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,400
Ai Rak, calm down.

612
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,000
Listen to me!

613
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,080
Nobody’s going to die.

614
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,120
Get a hold of yourself and hear me out.

615
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,000
Your dad sent someone after Mut.

616
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,200
What did you say?

617
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,960
Where’s Mahasamut?

618
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,960
Calm down.

619
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,520
Just tell me where he is!

620
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:53,840
I’m here.

621
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,080
That’s what I was trying to tell you.

622
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,280
I'm okay.

623
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,400
See? I’m perfectly fine.

624
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,200
I’m really alright.

625
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,680
English Subtitles by Saowalak K.

626
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,520
Khun Tongrak isn’t upstairs.

627
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:30,720
What?!

628
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,680
Was it hard to find my place?

629
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,440
Please leave him alone.

630
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:35,920
I’m willing to do everything

631
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,400
as long as you leave Mahasamut alone.

632
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,360
Everything?

633
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,160
What do you mean?

634
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:46,960
I want to end things.

635
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,800
Let’s call off the agreement.
