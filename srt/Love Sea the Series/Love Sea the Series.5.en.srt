1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,740
How much do I need to pay to
take you back to Bangkok with me?

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,140
The agreement outlines what
P' Rak and you need to fulfill.

3
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,420
This means Khun Tongrak can love me.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,220
Didn’t I tell you I don’t believe in love?

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,690
You can set the terms as you please.

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,210
Pay me as much as you want.

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,260
But there’s one thing
you can’t dictate on paper.

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,670
You can’t stop me from loving you.

9
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,840
Time is irreversible.

10
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,640
It slips away so fast.

11
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,710
If you want something, don’t hesitate.

12
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,050
Go for it.

13
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,560
Buy me chive dumplings from
Banthat Thong and bring them to the set.

14
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,640
You owe me for buying
men’s underwear with you.

15
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,509
P’ Vie.

16
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,580
I’ve just arrived at P’ Rak’s house.

17
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,950
You’re even too lazy to refill the coffee?

18
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,650
What does the agreement say?

19
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,470
Don’t disturb me when I’m working.

20
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,530
What are you doing?

21
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,579
Checking the Chinese translation
copyright sales contract.

22
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,280
Is it urgent?

23
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,370
Very urgent.

24
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,050
But... I heard Khun Mook say
you only needed to review it.

25
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,590
She shouted this to you
when she brought the clothes over.

26
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,820
I’m hungry.

27
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,010
Then eat.

28
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,060
There's no food left in the house.

29
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:28,420
The fridge is loaded with booze.

30
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,370
Then order delivery.

31
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,820
My phone’s out of juice.

32
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,400
Use mine.

33
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,640
Let’s eat out.

34
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,340
I’m not hungry.

35
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,310
But the agreement says...

36
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,610
you have to take care of my well-being.

37
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,520
And I’m famished right now.

38
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,470
Even if you aren’t hungry, I am.

39
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:05,890
Let’s go out to eat.

40
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,910
Please.

41
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:15,900
Didn’t you say I could
ask for anything from you?

42
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,900
I just... want to have a meal with you.

43
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,360
Please, Khun Tongrak.

44
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:36,900
Please.

45
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,530
You’ll achieve it one way or another.

46
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:44,520
Please.

47
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,260
Love Sea the Series

48
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,260
Chapter 5: Supporting a Guy is No Big Deal

49
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,090
Go ahead.

50
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,550
Take your time thinking.

51
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,000
I’m not thinking about anything.

52
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,380
At least, button up your shirt.

53
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,200
They were checking you out, not me.

54
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,710
It's how I like to dress.

55
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,650
Aren’t you hungry?

56
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:05,540
Let’s go.

57
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,610
Are you happy they didn’t check me out?

58
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,590
You’re jealous.

59
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,540
What are you talking about?

60
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,360
Nonsense.

61
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,090
Hurry up, I’m hungry.

62
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,640
What do you want to eat?

63
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,980
"Galloping Horse and Crystal Dragon."

64
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,659
"Three Companions of Saranrom Palace."

65
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,440
I’ll have “Lady Draped in a Blanket.”

66
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,630
“Imitation Shrimp Delight.”

67
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,060
“Off-Season Ensemble.”

68
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,900
“Veggie Symphony with a Lady's Flair.”

69
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,880
Rice.

70
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,230
And mixed butterfly pea
flower and pandan juice.

71
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,500
What about you?

72
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,950
You can order.
I'm fine with anything.

73
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,600
Then I'll also take omelet with herbs
and crab curry with betel leaves.

74
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:08,640
That’ll be all.

75
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,150
I don’t know how to order.

76
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,030
I have no idea what these dishes
with ridiculously long names are.

77
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,570
Sorry.

78
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,420
I embarrassed you.

79
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,120
Hey, who made you feel that way?

80
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,510
That waiter?

81
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,220
Where are you going?

82
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,980
I’m going to speak with him.

83
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,409
Why?

84
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,750
I don’t like it.

85
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,170
I don’t like the way you’ve been treated.

86
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,200
So what if you’ve never
been to this place before?

87
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,990
There’s always a first time for everything.

88
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,430
What’s more, you're
a customer with money in hand.

89
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,370
That's why nobody has
the right to treat you like this.

90
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,290
I’m going to speak with him.

91
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:04,540
Why are you smiling?

92
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:07,970
I’m happy.

93
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,180
Because you wouldn't have gotten
worked up for me if you didn't care.

94
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,050
Exactly. Because I care…

95
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,110
I’m fine.

96
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,610
Just felt a bit awkward.

97
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:33,020
Besides, I’m happy you’re not ignoring me.

98
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,380
I wasn’t ignoring you.

99
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:41,180
But you wouldn’t talk to me, avoided
me, and just stayed in the room working.

100
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,630
Not even eating the food I cooked.

101
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,870
I may not look it…

102
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,410
but I’m emotionally fragile.

103
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:50,920
Like I’d believe you.

104
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,320
Aren’t you thick skinned
enough to do anything?

105
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,980
It’s true that I’m thick skinned.

106
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,060
But my heart… is soft for the one I like.

107
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,350
But I don’t like you.

108
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,450
Excuse me.

109
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,760
Try it.

110
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,380
How is it?

111
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,790
It lives up to its page-long name.

112
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,230
Let’s pick up where we left off.

113
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,370
You just don’t like me yet.

114
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:14,750
What are you looking at?

115
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,720
Hurry up and eat, so we can leave.

116
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,040
I thought you were hungry.

117
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:34,810
Is it tasty?

118
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,640
(Diabolical Brat)

119
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,070
There you are, P’ Vie.

120
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,260
I went to the dressing room,
but they said you were at the set.

121
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,160
When I ran to the set, they
said you weren't in this scene.

122
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,280
And when I went back to
the dressing room again

123
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,200
they said you'd gone off to find coffee.

124
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,960
I’ve been running around
all over the set, P’ Vie.

125
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,580
While carrying these with you?

126
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,520
Yeah. I don’t know where to put them down.

127
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,800
They’re so heavy.

128
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,200
I bought you these snacks from
a famous shop in Banthat Thong.

129
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,920
Please help me hand them out to the crew.

130
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,740
Sure, Nong Vie. I’ll take care of it.

131
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,350
She bought them?

132
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,140
It was me, not her.

133
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,350
What’s wrong? Period acting up?

134
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,070
That’s not it.

135
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,740
You’ve gone too far with me.

136
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:10,640
Do you have any idea how long it took me
to drive from Banthat Thong to the set?

137
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,850
About an hour?

138
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,390
An hour and a half, with traffic jam.

139
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,220
Impressive speed.

140
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,180
P’ Vie!

141
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,040
Yes, Mook?

142
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,930
P’ Vie, even though P' Rak's gone into
hermit mode to wrap up the manuscript

143
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,170
I still have to take care of him.

144
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,610
I was already at P’ Rak’s
place when you called me.

145
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:46,020
I was going to check what P’ Rak’s
running low on so I could buy them.

146
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,420
You know what?

147
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,480
Ever since that guy started living
there, I’ve been twice as tired.

148
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,690
Yeah. And then you called me.

149
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,510
I got you the chive dumplings

150
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,450
but now I have to start over and drive to
P’ Rak’s place to check what’s running low.

151
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,760
It feels like I'm back to square one.

152
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,660
I don’t see why you need to check them.

153
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,710
Ai Rak doesn’t cook, so you just
need to get the usual stuff. That’s all.

154
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,940
But Mahasamut cooks, P’ Vie.

155
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,010
I always get a kilo of pork for
P' Rak to add to instant noodles.

156
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,850
That’s enough to last him
a month if he refreezes it.

157
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,470
But Mahasamut finished it in two days.

158
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,170
I shouldn’t have put in the agreement

159
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,120
that P’ Rak is responsible
for that guy's dining.

160
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,230
Because the one who’s actually
handling it isn’t P’ Rak, but me.

161
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,590
Me.

162
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,360
Are you very tired?

163
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,280
Yes.

164
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,090
Then I should give this
competent secretary a reward.

165
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,430
You want a kiss on the forehead?

166
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,440
No.

167
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:08,630
Okay.

168
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,460
Let me go get changed
before you get your reward.

169
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,270
Why change?

170
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,250
Well, I’m done filming for today.

171
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,440
Want me to go home in this dress?

172
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,020
Just wait here, I won’t take long.

173
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,450
And don't sneak off without me.

174
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:29,870
Did you forget that I’m a frail woman
who can’t go home on her own?

175
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,170
I have to go shopping for P’ Rak.

176
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,110
I really have to go shopping for P’ Rak.

177
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,330
Thank you.

178
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,810
I’m going home.

179
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,830
We’ll go home soon.

180
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,590
I’m leaving now.

181
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,450
If that’s what you want.

182
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,640
But I’ll go to the lost
children center if I get lost.

183
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,140
Why would you go there?
You’re not a kid.

184
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,390
I’ll have them announce that you

185
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,950
the writer using the pen name Tongrak

186
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,690
are my owner.

187
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,360
Even if you’re gone

188
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,310
there must be someone who
knows you and can take me home.

189
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,110
And Khun Mook said you’re very famous

190
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,870
for your writing and…
being a handsome writer.

191
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,420
Are you trying to piss me off?

192
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,720
Ooh.

193
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,140
So you do know that?

194
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,000
My boss is so smart.

195
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,109
60 baht for a carrot?
It’s only 10 baht in my neighborhood.

196
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,359
They’re not the same.

197
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,119
This one’s organic.

198
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,010
I understand it has
higher production costs.

199
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,160
So…

200
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,280
So?

201
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,960
Shall we go to a fresh market?

202
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,380
I know you’re going to say that it’s hot.

203
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,560
So you do know.

204
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,850
I’m giving in.
Just because it’s our first date.

205
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:33,880
What was that?

206
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,010
I said, I’m giving in.

207
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,250
No, the last sentence.

208
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,500
Look, could you just stop pushing this
damn cart and finish the conversation?

209
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,360
We’re having a date.

210
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,810
Who told you it’s a date?

211
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,410
A date’s about hanging out
with someone you’re interested in.

212
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,150
Having a meal and shopping together.

213
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,830
Am I getting the idea of a date wrong?

214
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,440
Then could you please
help this poor guy out?

215
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,150
Help me define what it means to hang
out with someone you're interested in.

216
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,520
It just means having a meal
and shopping together.

217
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,070
There's nothing more to it.

218
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,860
I don’t see why we have to define it.

219
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,690
But in one of your novels I read last night

220
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,260
the male lead took the main character
out for a meal and said it was a date.

221
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,710
Or do we have to kiss to call it a date?

222
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,090
What are you doing?

223
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,010
Grabbing the cabbage.

224
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,310
Want me to kiss you?

225
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,810
Hurry up and grab what you want to buy.

226
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,350
I want to go back to work.

227
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,790
If this were a novel,
there’d be a sizzle sound

228
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,210
with the narration of you
blushing from face to ears.

229
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,560
Oww, it hurts.

230
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,040
Not this one.

231
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:28,590
Hey.

232
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,380
That one’s a no too. High sodium.

233
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:36,370
Huh?

234
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,050
This one is also a no.

235
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,810
We’ve got plenty in the fridge.

236
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,880
You can't just live on booze and snacks.

237
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,290
Wanna die from cirrhosis, hm?

238
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,100
It’s none of your business.

239
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,800
No, you can’t take this out.

240
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:01,880
No.

241
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:02,940
No.

242
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,020
No sir.

243
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,930
No sir to you too.

244
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,460
Since you got back to Bangkok,
you’ve gone back to staying up late

245
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,810
and waking up at noon.

246
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,740
You only have snacks and booze for dinner.

247
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,110
I’m not surprised to see
the fridge full of alcohol.

248
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,660
Are you aiming for an
early death with this lifestyle?

249
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,650
I don’t want to die
early, but this is my life.

250
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:36,820
And I want to take care of it.

251
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,200
I don’t know how you’ve been
living your life this whole time.

252
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,650
But I don’t want your hard-earned
cash going to medical bills.

253
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,440
Making money for hospital visits.

254
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,920
Taking meds as if they’re food.

255
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,470
At least not while you’re in my care.

256
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,250
I will never let it happen.

257
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,150
Got it?

258
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,920
My life’s not that messed up.

259
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,380
Yes.

260
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,280
Your life’s not that messed up.

261
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,330
You’re just…

262
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,470
Old.

263
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,150
Are you age shaming me?

264
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,530
I’m not.

265
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,730
Just admit that you’re old.

266
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,140
I’m not old.

267
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,930
Come on, just accept the truth.

268
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,200
You're lucky you still look young.

269
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,270
And you should let me.

270
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,630
What is it now?

271
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,110
Apart from cursing me with early
death and bad health, and calling me old

272
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,260
what else do you want to say?

273
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,060
Let me take care of you.

274
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,050
I'll look after you until we both get old.

275
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,980
I’m going to put the beer back, old-timer.

276
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:21,920
Ridiculous!

277
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,700
I’m not old.

278
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,350
I didn’t ask him to look after me.

279
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,390
Just sleep.

280
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,580
So why do I, umm, have to sleep?

281
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,780
Didn’t you say you were tired?
I’m letting you rest.

282
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,170
Like this?

283
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:05,530
For real?

284
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,400
What's wrong with my lap?

285
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,230
This is the famous
actress’s lap you’re lying on.

286
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,580
Not even a pricey concert
ticket would get you a handshake.

287
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,650
But you’re getting a free sleep on my lap.

288
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:20,370
If I were you, I’d be grateful to
my past self for all those merits.

289
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,520
I would’ve chewed myself out instead.

290
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,990
I think I’d better get up.

291
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,120
I’m telling you to rest, so do it.

292
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,990
But I’ve got work to do.

293
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,370
Someone else is doing it for you.

294
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,340
Who is it?

295
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,520
Mahasamut.

296
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,120
Huh?

297
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,650
Mahasamut?

298
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,330
How come?

299
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:56,710
Hm?

300
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,950
You’re talking to Mahasamut?

301
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,220
Mmm hmm.

302
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,910
We exchanged our numbers last time.

303
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,480
So, when… are you going to hush?

304
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,710
Ai Rak dropped this book last year.
I finally got around to reading it.

305
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,100
Or are you going to sum it up for me?

306
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,560
What?

307
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,660
Which part are you reading to?

308
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,270
This novel’s male lead
is a total jerk, P' Vie.

309
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,440
Very selfish.

310
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,830
He thought he was entitled to
everything just because he was rich.

311
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,050
Oh, and he tried to throw
money at the main character.

312
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,660
Even called him a slut too!

313
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,140
The first time I read it,
I was so pissed off for the MC.

314
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,300
I told P’ Rak to have the MC get
him back big, big, big, big, time.

315
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,900
You know what P’ Rak said?

316
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,880
“Oh, I’m done editing the manuscript."

317
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,990
“Won't do it again. Too lazy.”

318
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,360
“Just plot the revenge
in your imagination.”

319
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,580
Can you believe him, P’ Vie?

320
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,010
He burst a reader’s bubble.

321
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,100
We all want a shot at revenge.

322
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,920
Well… I think I’d better hush.

323
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,570
So you can get back to reading.

324
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,400
Keep going. I’m still enjoying it.

325
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,320
I’m not spilling anymore.
It’s more fun if you read it yourself.

326
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,870
Is it really more fun?

327
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,030
Please stop teasing me, P’ Vie.

328
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,860
You have no clue at all.

329
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,930
You don’t even like women.

330
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,210
I don’t eat spicy food.

331
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,560
If you’re going to cook it like
you did on the island, I won’t eat it.

332
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,120
I know that.

333
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:37,130
You took one bite of the fish entrails
curry and then chugged a liter of water.

334
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,040
‘Cause it was spicy.

335
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,810
P’ Rak, why didn’t you answer my call?

336
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,320
Who’s she, Khun Tongrak?

337
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,670
Prin.

338
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:14,950
Yes, P’ Rak?

339
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,470
What are you doing here?

340
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:25,090
What’s up with that expression, P’ Rak?

341
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:27,440
Your little sister came
all this way to see you.

342
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,060
Excuse me.

343
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,500
I only have an older sister.

344
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,650
And I don’t accept
anyone else as my sibling.

345
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,550
So, who’s that guy?

346
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,610
Your new servant?

347
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,010
Looks like a hillbilly.

348
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,560
Here’s the thing, P’ Rak.

349
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,640
I swung by a department
store the other day.

350
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,260
And saw your secretary
and your potty-mouthed…

351
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,820
Oops, your best friend.

352
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,490
I was surprised to see them
buying men’s clothes.

353
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,680
Because it's the kind of style
you wouldn't be caught dead in.

354
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:12,280
When I called you,
you wouldn’t pick up.

355
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,140
And here I thought you were busy.

356
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:18,160
Turns out... you’re rolling with…

357
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,330
Are you free or something?

358
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:20,990
Yes.

359
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:22,730
How nice.

360
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,910
I’m jealous of you.

361
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:28,380
Because I’ve been so dead tired.

362
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,220
That’s why I don’t get
people with so much free time.

363
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,240
And I especially don’t get

364
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,490
those who’re so free that they
pry into other people’s affairs.

365
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,100
If I had the luxury of your free
time, I would’ve stayed home.

366
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,770
Or…

367
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,790
Invested it in educating myself

368
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:53,390
instead of prancing around
showing how brainless I am.

369
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:53,980
P’ Rak.

370
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,650
Did I hit a nerve?

371
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,190
Look who’s talking.

372
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,810
You’re the one who lacks manners.

373
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:08,220
What kind of person chases off
his little sister when she visits?

374
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,030
I told you I don’t have a little sister.

375
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:17,070
And who I spend my time with
is none of your business.

376
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,740
I’m only worried about you
as someone in your family.

377
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,980
I don't want your reputation to be sullied.

378
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:32,650
You know all too well how
things turned out for Auntie.

379
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:39,710
As her junior relative,
I couldn’t help but worry.

380
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,650
It saddens me to see
Auntie living a life like that.

381
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,960
I don’t want you to end up like her.

382
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,760
It’s bad enough with Auntie alone.

383
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,900
What if people shame you
for following in her footsteps?

384
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,190
Think about it, P’ Rak.

385
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,680
How would it affect our family’s image?

386
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,220
Prin.

387
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,780
Yes, P’ Rak?

388
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,160
How’s your boyfriend?
Is he doing well?

389
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,820
You’re trying to change the subject?

390
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,260
No.

391
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,540
You’re the one who
started talking about family.

392
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,340
So, I’m worried.

393
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,290
Worried?

394
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,710
Why are you worried about my boyfriend?

395
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,910
I heard it was 10 million baht.

396
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,370
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

397
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,600
The money you gave him for investment.

398
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,820
10 million baht.

399
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,040
So what?

400
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,400
You should be worried
about yourself instead.

401
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,800
What’s there to be worried about?

402
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,570
Whether I give my boyfriend
money is none of your business.

403
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,100
- What does it matter to you?
- ‘Cause it’s about to flop.

404
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,370
Nonsense.

405
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,870
I don’t believe you.

406
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,740
Don’t you lie to me.

407
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,140
Suit yourself.

408
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,170
But what did he say to you?

409
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,220
“The business is going well.”

410
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,640
“We’ll get our investment back in no time.”

411
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,630
“Give me a little more time.”

412
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,160
“Don’t you trust me?”

413
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,000
I still saw that guy
picking up hookers last month.

414
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:35,830
That’s not true.

415
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,130
Is that all you can say?

416
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:38,500
Hm?

417
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,700
That’s why I told you to stop
prying into other people’s business

418
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,790
and grace yourself with some education.

419
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,220
instead of stocking up your
vocabulary vault with insults.

420
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:55,990
Because when you lose an argument,
all you can say is “That’s not true.”

421
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,310
P’ Rak, are you insulting me?

422
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,250
Just you wait, I’m going to tell my mom.

423
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:06,240
And I’ll tell Auntie about
how you’re talking to me.

424
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,860
Now that I’m paying
attention, you start flipping out.

425
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,760
But what you’ve said is true.

426
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:20,750
People in our family…
are all obsessed with men.

427
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,170
It’s different.

428
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,750
I never buy men with money.

429
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,530
I just lent it to my boyfriend.
He’ll pay me back.

430
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,860
Come to think of it…

431
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,170
We’re actually different.

432
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,320
Because my standards for men…

433
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,040
...are way higher than yours.

434
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:57,740
Khun Tongrak.

435
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:05,800
Get out.

436
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,140
I just want to ask you something.

437
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,120
Get out!

438
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,020
You haven’t told me…
what you feel like eating.

439
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,250
I told you to get out.

440
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:38,660
But…

441
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,190
You still haven’t answered me.

442
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:56,360
May I… walk to you?

443
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,110
Don’t you understand what I’m saying?

444
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,410
I’m telling you to get out!

445
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,000
Will I have to kick you
out to make you listen?

446
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:26,570
Go away.

447
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,160

Go take a shower.

480
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:01,530
Huh?

481
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,810
Go take a shower.

482
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,350
We’ll be going out.

483
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:08,850
Okay.

484
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:11,600
Shower.

485
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:17,150
I’ll take that one and that one.

486
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:17,870
Certainly.

487
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,780
- This one too.
- Sure.

488
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:28,120
- Get me this one too.
- Alright.

489
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:30,940
Why are you stopping me?

490
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:33,810
I wouldn’t have stopped you
if you were shopping for yourself.

491
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,360
But you’re buying them for me.

492
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,240
Yes, I’m buying them for you.

493
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:45,790
Why?

494
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,930
I won’t let anyone look down on you again.

495
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:59,670
Give me two colors of this style.

496
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,850
I’d like you to measure this man up.

497
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:05,760
And could you show me
what fabric options you have?

498
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,450
Mahasamut!
Let me go, I’m still talking.

499
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:18,730
I’m going to buy them,
and you can’t stop me.

500
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,350
Is it because you’re my sugar daddy?

501
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,600
Or because you agree with that woman?

502
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:26,150
No, I don’t agree with that brat.

503
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:27,700
But you’re buying suits for me.

504
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,850
Trying to transform me.

505
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,990
Isn’t it because you don’t like Ai Mut

506
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,150
an average Joe who’s not
picky about what he wears?

507
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,920
I told you, didn’t I?

508
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,450
I don’t care if anyone looks down on me.

509
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,400
It doesn’t faze me when
people give me money.

510
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,300
Because it’s how I earn a living.

511
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:57,210
But there’s one thing I’ve never told you.

512
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:02,720
I care about what
the people I care about think.

513
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:05,060
Whatever their opinions are...

514
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:07,920
I’ll listen to them.

515
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,080
Are you looking down on me?

516
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:17,450
No.

517
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,200
Am I pitiful?

518
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:25,170
Well… no.

519
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,570
Am I not good enough?

520
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,380
No!

521
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:39,640
If that’s what you think…

522
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,450
I’ll pay attention to it.

523
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,240
Because you’re the one I care about.

524
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,440
Besides…

525
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:57,880
I don’t care what that
immature diabolical brat said.

526
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:01,230
What?

527
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:03,210
I don’t care.

528
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,170
Not that. What did you call her?

529
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,570
Diabolical brat.

530
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:13,290
Prin’s older than you.

531
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:14,580
So what?

532
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,020
If this were my hometown,
she’d be called a fucking bitch.

533
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:23,350
I wonder how much of a tantrum
she'd throw if she heard that.

534
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:31,430
This is a fitting room.

535
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:35,660
Come on, do you think people outside
actually believe we're trying on the suits?

536
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,370
You think we’re in a novel or what?

537
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:40,630
Banging in the fitting room?

538
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,970
I like a writer.

539
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,600
That’s why... I have to be imaginative.

540
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:04,580
How about…

541
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:09,060
...we try using our imaginations?

542
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:29,840
Is everything alright in there?

543
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,790
Yes, we’ll be out in a sec.

544
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:53,190
Do you think he thinks
we're arguing or screwing?

545
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,910
Either way, I’m gonna tear him to pieces.

546
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:00,970
He killed the mood.

547
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:12,500
But I’ll do it after buying you the suits.

548
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:13,250
Huh?

549
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,670
I'm not looking down on you.

550
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:18,970
Nor do I pity you.

551
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,860
And I’m not trying to
insult you with money.

552
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,280
I... just want to repay you.

553
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:30,960
Repay me? For what?

554
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,450
For... the omelet rice.

555
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:38,260
Time to go.

556
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:46,660
Do you know what the best
way you can pay me back is?

557
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,090
Just knowing you'll eat what I cook

558
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,530
makes it worth the effort.

559
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,600
Gosh, you’re so darn cute.

560
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:10,520
Come on, let’s go.

561
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:18,000
“Sizzle” is a blushing sound?

562
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:22,760
Wonder if it’s cheeks or a frying pan.

563
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:31,900
Come to think of it.

564
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:34,600
They were pretty red.

565
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,450
English Subtitles by Saowalak K.

566
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:54,520
Ai Kom!

567
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:55,870
Why are you here?

568
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:56,730
Who’s come over?

569
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:00,160
I know Connor paid you to look
after P’ Rak while on the island.

570
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,020
And I’m not that naïve enough to think

571
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,620
that you and he would
only keep it professional.

572
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:06,150
You seem close to Kom.

573
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,880
If your crush slept on
your shoulder for hours

574
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:11,300
but you left without saying a word

575
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,450
would they hate you?

576
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:14,190
I was a bad boy yesterday.

577
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,170
Let me make it up to you.
