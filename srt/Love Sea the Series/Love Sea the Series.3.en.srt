Do I have to leave now?

00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,910
Yeah.
What are you staying here for?

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,170
P' Mut, have you heard
about your handsome guest?

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,690
Many want to take a chance
with someone out of their league.

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,150
Once I’ve paid you, you’re mine.

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:21,810
That’s it.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,770
I’m not your servant
who you can order around.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,550
I’m not stopping you from going home.

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:27,640
I just want to give you a reward.

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,500
Don’t tell me you want me
to clean the bathroom.

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,630
Why is your name Mahasamut?

12
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,010
It’s so that our names can rhyme, I guess.

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,000
Must love.

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,270
Mahasamut.

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,470
You know love is just a figment
of our imagination, right?

16
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,790
What is the loudest sound...

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,620
when we feel sad...

18
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:13,920

00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,780

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,890

You wanna take the role

But I just saw the news

50
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,230
And you know what I did?

51
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,300
Flashed my Miss Universe smile
and put on my pretentious act.

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,380

00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,100

I'll post a pic squishing my boobs

62
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,020
And you know P’ Frost’s bringing along
his young beau who, I repeat, is a guy.

63
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,990
Why did you wake up so early?

64
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,020

Hello, P’ Vie.

86
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,200
I bought you some snacks
because I was passing by.

87
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,320
Not because of the scandal about me?

88
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,830
It’s not about you.

89
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,590
There are tons of actresses
whose initial is V.

90
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,280
And how many people do you think
believe it’s about Vivie Veerapapha?

91
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,550
You also think everyone
believes that about me, right?

92
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,970
Are you okay, P’ Vie?

93
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,090
Do you think I’ll be okay with
random people trash-talking me?

94
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:35,039
Making fun at how I could
get head with my boobs.

95
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,890
Comparing my acting to a rock.

96
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,200
Saying I owe my fame to
my friend backing me up.

97
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,650
And that I wouldn’t have gotten
the lead role in Rak’s series

98
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,730
if I weren’t his friend.

99
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,910
They sure enjoy gossiping.

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,710
I’m just teasing you.

104
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,500
You know I get stressed for
a bit and then forget about it.

105
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,480
I should just use your concern

106
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,070
as an excuse to get you
to scrub my bathroom.

107
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,520

108
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,230
Go ahead.

109
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,490
You always make me do stuff anyway.

I don’t know about you

111
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,450
but nobody likes seeing nasty
comments about themselves.

112
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,740
P’ Rak used to tell me that
people who trash-talk others

113
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,070
are empty-minded and
have nothing better to do.

114
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,440
They don’t even realize
how hard you’ve tried

115
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,530
or what you’ve been through.

116
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,580
Have they ever experienced what
you have to judge you like that?

117
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,200
Do they think you can’t cry?

118
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,690
Are you angry?

119
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,140
Can’t I?

120
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,420
Why are you angry for me?

121
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,100
Because I…

Forget something?

165
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,910
- Thank you.
- Very good.

166
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,340
Here.

167
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,630

You won’t go hungry as long

Don’t you say it.

174
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,640
Why did you stop me?

175
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,510
If you start a sentence
with “Kids these days…”

176
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,990
it means you’re old.

177
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,930

No.

239
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,170
I said I had work to do.

240
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,820
And I said, no.

241
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:00,900
Get on.

242
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,000
Do you not understand what I’m saying?

243
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,400
I said, no.
I have work to do.

244
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,020
Can you really write?

245
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,750
Let’s go somewhere else for a change.

246
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:23,650
I promise.

247
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,880
That you can get back to work after.

248
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,610
Are you stupid beyond repair?

249
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,800
Seriously.

250
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,690
How many times have I said no?

251
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,820
Couldn’t you even get a simple
word through your thick skull?

252
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,080
Who do you think you are?

253
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,430
Just an islander.

254
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,810
What makes you think you can order me?

255
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,180
Did you forget that I paid you
to bark like a dog?

256
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,700
So, be an obedient one.

257
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,230
If I say no, it means no.

258
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,120
How about we have a staring contest?

259
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:58,960
This dog...

260
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,090
is patient enough.

261
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,690
I’ll even howl for you.

262
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,630
Finally.

263
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,710
Hang on tight.

264
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,710
Where are we going?

265
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,590
Almost there.

266
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,280
You won’t see if it's not far enough.

267
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,260
This is it.

268
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,190
Sit down.

269
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,450
Come on.

270
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,400
I won’t prank you.

271
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,030
Trust me just this once.

272
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,450
Believe me now?

273
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,560
I brought you here for something good.

274
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,970
I've never watched the stars before.

275
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,200
Not even once?

276
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:33,710
That’s a shame.

277
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,240
You’re right.

278
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,230
What?

279
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,370
Don’t believe me?

280
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,170
You’re so handsome when you smile.

281
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,070
That's the best you could come up with?

282
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,830
I hear that all the time.

283
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:01,960
Go easy on me.

284
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,800
I’m just a simple guy.

285
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,510
That’s the best I’ve got.

286
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,500
You’re a simple guy?

287
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,480
Believe me.

288
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,130
You’re beautiful when you smile too.

289
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,450
What exactly do you want me to be?

290
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:26,630
Be...

291
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,460
the beautifully handsome guy.

292
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,260
I’m sorry.

293
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,670
For calling you a dog.

294
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,560
Why are you apologizing?

295
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,170
Woof, woof, woof.

296
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,510
I’m ready to be a dog for you.

297
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,550
Woof, woof, woof, woof.

298
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,050
You know what?

299
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,620
I used to feel jealous when
my friends went on family trips.

300
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,860
Camping.

301
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,630
Stargazing.

302
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:26,850
Diving.

303
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,750
I never had those kinds of memories.

304
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,750
My family is different.

305
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,140
My mom bought my dad with money.

306
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,010
And he lived off
the money he got from her.

307
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,490
She was so obsessed with him...

308
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,310
that she named my sister
“Kongkwan.” (Gift)

309
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,780
She was lost in delusions like a madwoman.

310
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,060
As if my sister was a gift from him.

311
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,540
And she had me when
everything was going downhill.

312
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,080
Many people say my name's beautiful.

313
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,120
But the truth is…

314
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:26,160
It’s my mom’s message to that man.

315
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,850
Telling him he must love her.

316
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,530
That’s why I never had
any memories of family trips.

317
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,990
Why am I telling you this?

318
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,590
Don’t smile like that.

319
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,010
Didn’t you say it was beautiful?

320
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,390
You said love is a figment of imagination.

321
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,500
Yes.

322
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,560
It’s all in our heads.

323
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,990
I’m an imaginative guy.

324
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,540
Wanna try?

325
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:42,800
No.

326
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,210
Just while you’re on this island.

327
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,200
You want me to buy love?

328
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,680
You can try by buying me.

329
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,400
Let’s give it a shot.

330
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,880
Or are you scared?

331
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,000
How much?

332
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,720
As much as you want to pay.

333
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,910
How did you get here, P’ Vie?

334
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,040
By driving, of course.

335
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,400
Did you think I walked here?

336
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,580
Do you need something?

337
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,100
I’ve been thinking about the scandal.

338
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,080
And I need your help.

339
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,010
My help?

340
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,490
How can someone like me help you?

341
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:27,870
You can.

342
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,430
Will you be my girlfriend?

343
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,640
I mean a fake girlfriend.

344
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:50,030
If I go out with a woman, people will
stop saying I steal other women’s husbands.

345
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,760
Or that I live by
“Sleep with me, get free wi-fi.”

346
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,500
What do you think?

347
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,110
I don’t think I can be your girlfriend.

348
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,960
I have a dinner date with my mom.

349
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,080
Excuse me.

350
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,460
I told you no!

351
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,550
My butt’s getting wet!

352
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,540
Let me go, Mahasamut.

353
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,270
Let go!

354
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,520
You can’t avoid getting wet at the sea.

355
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:35,190
Not many people can enjoy the sea at night.

356
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,190
Count me out of this.

357
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:37,940
Let go.

358
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,350
You really want me to let go?

359
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,260
I’ll kill you if you let me go.

360
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,890
What exactly do you want?

361
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,310
Want me to let go or not?

362
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,520
So hard to please.

363
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,000
Is it fun messing with me?

364
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:50,970
Yeah.

365
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,680
That’s why I’m doing it.

366
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,120
Ouch! Fine, I’ll let you go.

367
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:21,730
Oww.

368
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,400
Something’s in my eye.

369
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,780
What’s so funny?

370
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,750
I’m completely soaked.

371
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,500
I’m just as soaked.

372
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,390
Feeling refreshed?

373
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,630
The night sea’s got a good
vibe too, don’t you think?

374
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:56,280
Khun Tongrak?

375
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,630
Are you tricking me?

376
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:00,920
Into talking to myself?

377
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,110
If you don’t speak, I’ll kiss you.

378
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,070
I want to kiss you.

379
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,550
Are you a dog or something?

380
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,250
Woof.

381
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,350
Your bite stings and your bark’s loud.

382
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,940
Possessive of my owner too.

383
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,220
In case you didn’t know.

384
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,960
Let’s call it a night.

385
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,590
I’ll hug you to sleep.

386
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,260
Who said I wanted that?

387
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:37,720
Is it pressing?

388
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,740
No.

389
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:45,430
I’ve agreed with the publisher
that there’d be no set deadline.

390
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,590
It'll be finished when it's finished.

391
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,850
Then let’s go to sleep now.

392
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,490
No, you sleep first.

393
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,160
How could I sleep before my owner?

394
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,290
I'll be working for a while longer.

395
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,260
I’m not sleepy yet.

396
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,460
Go to bed.

397
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,430
Why do you keep urging me?

398
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:16,810
You’re thinking too much.

399
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:18,590
I...

400
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,370
I can’t work when you’re watching me.

401
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,960
You had no problem with it before.

402
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,420
I promise.

403
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,950
I’ll be watching quietly.
Won’t get in your way.

404
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,690
If you don’t go to bed...

405
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,870
I’ll make you leave.

406
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,450
Close your eyes.

407
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,400
Sleep.

408
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,340
Sleep.

409
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:00,640
Mahasamut.

410
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,290
Mahasamut.

411
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,410
Are you sleeping?

412
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:54,980
Mahasamut.

413
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,210
Hey!

414
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,180
You’re not asleep?

415
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:36,650
No.

416
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,750
I…

417
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,740
I’m going to sleep now.

418
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,210
I wasn’t sleeping.

419
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,570
And you were waiting for me
to sleep and snuggle with me.

420
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,140
You really are a cat.

421
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,730
Khun Tongrak.

422
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,050
You're setting the AC too cold.

423
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:15,990
Then turn it up.

424
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,150
No.

425
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,540
Hugging you warms me up.

426
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,560
Sawasdee ka.
Please watch your step.

427
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,540
That seat’s free.
Please have a seat.

441
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:35,710
Did you know corals are one
of the protected wildlife species

442
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:39,580
according to the Wildlife Preservation
and Protection Act, B.E. 2535 (1992)?

443
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:46,120
It’s illegal to harvest, destroy, own,
sell, or breed them without permission.

444
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,310
In coral regeneration, we won’t
lift corals above the sea surface.

445
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,850
Not even for a moment.

446
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,580
Does anyone know why?

447
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,520
I know.

448
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:55,510
Go ahead.

449
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,160
Because P' Mut will chew
me out and dock my pay.

450
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,030
Incorrect.

451
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,720
The stress of being removed
from their natural habitat

452
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,870
makes them more sensitive
and prone to dying.

453
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,940
After all, corals are
a type of aquatic creature.

454
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:10,620
Got that, Ai Palm?

455
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,500
Yes, sir. I got that.

456
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,730
(Southern dialect) Got that, Auntie?

457
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,630
(Southern dialect) She said you
mustn’t take them out of the sea.

458
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,650
(Southern dialect) You can’t
dry them in the sun and sell them.

459
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,660
(Southern dialect) Quit it.

460
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,220
(Southern dialect) You brat,
why are you scolding me?

461
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,280
(Sothern dialect)
I stopped doing it ages ago.

462
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,610
(Southern dialect)
You keep picking fights with me.

463
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,960
(Southern dialect)
I don’t need you to remind me.

464
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,140
(Southern dialect) I don’t do
it anymore. Stop accusing me.

465

466
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:00,820
Are you bored?

467
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:07,280
Come on, bro.
Aren’t we chums?

468
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,330
Don’t tell me off just yet, handsome bro.

469
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,990
I’m just worried you might get bored.

470
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,320
And if I am?

471
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,850
If you’re bored, just a sec.

472
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,850
I’ll tell you about my dearest bro.

473
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:26,760
P’ Mut’s the main advocate for
protecting the entire sea in this area.

474
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,660
He always says...

475
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,970
“Without the sea, we will all die.”

476
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,130
Like that.

477
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:37,790
And these uncles and aunties said
he was being nonsense and foolish.

478
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,580
But P’ Mut was very
stubborn and hardheaded.

479
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,840
Before things really got going like today

480
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,360
it was a challenge
for him, I'm telling you.

481
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,970
Talking is one thing.

482
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,250
But doing is a whole different matter.

483
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,720
If you ask who loves the sea

484
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:01,360
I'd say without hesitation
that it's P’ Mut.

485
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:20,880
What’s wrong?

486
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,050
Nothing.

487
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,330
I’m feeling hot.

488
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:28,670
Need medicine?

489
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,750
Feeling hot?

490
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,890
Isn’t it obvious?

491
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,630
Thank you.

492
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,530
What’s wrong with you
suddenly thanking me?

493
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,800
Don’t be so wary of me.

494
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:06,990
I’m just…

495
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,950
thankful that you’ve come with me.

496
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,260
I happened to wake up early.

497
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,740
6 in the morning?

498
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,480
I’ve been waking you up every day.

499
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,280
Noon’s hard enough.

500
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:21,820
Don’t even mention 6 a.m.

501
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:22,670
Look.

502
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,760
If you’re trying to start a fight,
go back where you came from.

503
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,110
I just had nothing better to do.

504
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,250
Besides, you asked me to come.

505
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,740
I’m here to gather material for my novel.

506
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:37,810
Otherwise, I wouldn’t have come.

507
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,100
Yes.

508
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,690
I asked you to come.

509
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:51,150
Hey.

510
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,700
What are you doing?

511
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,570
Don’t move.

512
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,710
It’s hot.

513
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,260
Could you stay still?

514
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,490
You can't, Khun Tongrak.

515
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,380
Why can’t I?

516
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,310
We’re at the sea, not a church.

517
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,870
I don’t have to be covered up like a nun.

518
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,420
Yes.

519
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,720
I know you’re a sinner.

520
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,310
Hey.

521
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,000
But no means no.

522
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,120
Your neck’s covered in bite marks.

523
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:34,630
If…

524
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:39,190
you want the whole village
to find out what we did…

525
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,150
I don’t mind.

526
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:42,590
It’s better this way.

527
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,110
Now everyone will know that

528
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,700
the hot guy who's
been around for weeks...

529
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,120
is raising a dog.

530
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,240
A fierce one too.

531
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,650
He bites his owner.

532
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,770
And people who approach his owner.

533
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:58,750
And he’ll never let go.

534
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,590
More like a dog in rut.

535
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,490
Then I guess his owner’s in rut as well.

536
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:09,650
Who was it that wouldn’t
let me leave the room?

537
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,540
Give me an earful.

538
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,570
Don’t hold it in.

539
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,330
Jerk! Hypocrite! Creep!

540
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,350
That’s the best you’ve got?

541
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:25,740
Want me to teach you?

542
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:28,640
Psycho!

543
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,040
It’s afternoon.

544
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:37,320
Wanna go somewhere?

545
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,760
You’re done with your work?

546
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,460
I’m done for the day.

547
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,750
Wanna go somewhere?

548
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,860
Or find something to eat?

549
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:09,670
I know a good place.

550
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:12,620
Or check out the waterfall?

551
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,260
This island’s got a waterfall.

552
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,930
Or go back to your room?

553
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:19,990
Bring your laptop to work by the beach.

554
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,340
Just like you always do.

555
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:23,880
No.

556
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,040
Then, let’s go diving.

557
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,140
No, hate suntan.

558
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:28,630
Where do you want to go?

559
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:32,620
Your place.

560
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,120
I want to go to your place.

561
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:38,570
Take me there.

562
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,750
You know I can’t do this.

563
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,740
I have a fiancée.

564
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:52,940
Who you don’t love.

565
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,970
Are you going to deny it?

566
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,010
Cut!

567
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,220
Okay, good.

568
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,350
Alright, let’s move the set upstairs.

569
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,030
Both of you, go get changed.

570
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:30,760
Excuse me, where’s P’ Vie?

571
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:32,140
I don’t know.

572
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,100
Over here, Mook.

573
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:34,880
P' Vie!

574
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:41,610
Wait.

575
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,230
Here, the thing you forgot.

576
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,550
Then I’m leaving.

577
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,850
Hold on.

578
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:00,270
Stay with me.

579
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,040
Why do you want me to stay?

580
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,130
I’m going home.

581
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,080
P’ Vie, what are you doing?

582
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,230
Following the plan.

583
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,610
What plan?

584
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,030
The “Babe Mission” plan.

585
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:21,950
What?

586
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,380
It’s shortened from

587
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,560
“The Mission to Conquer Your Heart.”

588
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,810
“You’re the Love of My Life, Babe.”

589
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:29,950
Huh?

590
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,460
Are you really a writer’s secretary?

591
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:34,800
What’s my job got to do with it?

592
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:35,890
You see.

593
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:41,310
We all know that Ai Rak always
gives his novels three-page-long titles.

594
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:42,480
You're exaggerating.

595
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,150
They’re just full-line long.

596
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:44,860
You know what I mean.

597
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,510
It's “Babe Mission” for short.

598
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:50,310
I still don’t get it.

599
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,320
Let me break it down for you.

600
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:00,020
I’m the rumored actress with the initial V.

601
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,450
who’s been slammed for
boobing her way to the top.

602
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:03,690
And you.

603
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:07,460
You're the actress' real girlfriend
who's been kept away from public eye.

604
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,100
But thanks to the scandal

605
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:11,600
you’ve decided to make
a grand appearance on the set.

606
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,250
No, no, no, P’ Vie.

607
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:15,330
This doesn’t feel right, P' Vie.

608
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:16,770
It’s right how I want it.

609
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,360
It hasn’t felt right
since the girlfriend part.

610
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,370
We have made a deal.

611
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,460
When did I make a deal with you?

612
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:26,650
Last week.

613
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,850
When I went to see you at Ai Rak’s place.

614
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:30,780
No.

615
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:33,410
I already refused.

616
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,450
Really?

617
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:47,090
Oh, I need to refill the water!

618
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,050
But I’ve already spread the news.

619
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:50,630
What?!

620
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:53,090
How’s it?

621
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:54,760
I’ve come up with such a good story

622
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,420
proving that my 15-year
friendship with a writer paid off.

623
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:01,470
Reading novels with him every day
during high school was totally worth it.

624
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,850
But you’re not into women.

625
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:08,860
My plot isn’t actually bad.

626
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,680
Maybe I should quit acting
and become a writer?

627
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,760
It’s going to be a rough start.

628
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:16,840
But once I make it big,
I’ll hire you as my assistant.

629
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:21,060
Wait, I won't need an assistant
if I'm not as famous as Ai Rak.

630
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:25,980
But I’m sure I can create
better novel titles than he can.

631
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,270
What a tough call.

632
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:40,080
This fake girlfriend thing...

633
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,510
Babe Mission.

634
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:44,080
Yeah.

635
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,080
You mustn’t tell P’ Rak about it.

636
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:47,370
You’ve finally agreed?

637
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,340
Do you think I have a choice?

638
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:52,730
You’re going to twist my arm anyway.

639
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:55,120
Bullseye.

640
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,640
You finally understand me.

641
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:02,900
P’ Vie.

642
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:05,080
Listen to me.

643
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,000
I’ll help you until
the scandal quiets down.

644
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,860
You wouldn't want another gossip
piece about you being bi, right?

645
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:15,620
I’m not bi.

646
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:20,610
I know.

647
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:22,870
So.

648
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:25,550
What do you want me to do?

649
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,580
Stay close to me.

650
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:31,170
And…

651
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:35,090
Come with me to the set at 5 a.m.

652
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,800
Impossible!

653
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,680
5 a.m.

654
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:41,860
That early?!

655
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,310
No way!

656
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,690
Are you sure?

657
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,070
My house isn't quite what you're used to.

658
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:00,420
Wanna change your mind?

659
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,200
Why would I change my mind?

660
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:06,440
Stubborn.

661
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:18,290
(Mahasamut)

662
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,940
Looking for inspiration for your novel?

663
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:01,120
Well…

664
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:02,360
Yeah.

665
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,600
Why did you become a volunteer?

666
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:08,580
‘Cause I love the sea.

667
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:10,610
That’s it?

668
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:13,070
What more reason do I need?

669
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:14,990
I love my home.

670
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:16,880
Love the sea.

671
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:18,700
I fought with my dad over it.

672
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:25,350
My dad and I never saw eye to eye.

673
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:27,540
All he cared about was…

674
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:30,410
catching as many fish as possible.

675
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,620
He couldn't care less
about the environment.

676
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,110
Or whether there’d
be any fish left to catch.

677
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:39,630
He only cared about
how many he'd catch in a day.

678
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:43,370
It’s funny when I think about it.

679
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,420
I still remember the day
I went fishing with my dad.

680
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:52,050
A sea turtle was caught in the fishing net.

681
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,290
Guess what he did.

682
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:02,240
He threw it back into the sea
without removing the net.

683
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:06,850
I protested and told him to save it.

684
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:08,760
So, he…

685
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:10,670
threw me into the sea...

686
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:12,830
to join the turtle.

687
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:13,790
What?

688
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:17,170
Didn't see that coming?

689
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,770
He cast me into the deep waters.

690
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:22,810
And said to me…

691
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,940
“If you wanna help, do it yourself.”

692
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,080
“You’ve lived a comfortable
life all thanks to me.”

693
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,560
“Try surviving on your own
before you educate me.”

694
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,270
But weren’t you only 15?

695
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:37,880
I was a stubborn kid.

696
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,790
I wouldn’t ask anyone for help.

697
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:45,560
My dad’s deckhand felt pity
for me and jumped in to help.

698
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,240
But that guy got fired after.

699
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,670
So, I ran away from home
and never returned.

700
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:07,750
Are you going to comfort me?

701
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:19,320
Can I?

702
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,740
I must’ve earned a lot
of brownie points today.

703
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:27,800
And you’ll earn even more.

704
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:41,430
Screw me.

705
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,390
Go ahead.

706
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:55,970
Do it.

707
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,810
The walls are paper-thin.

708
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,860
Let them hear it all.

709
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,830
What a hungry beast you are.

710
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,740
You gave me your permission.

711
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:20,780
There’s no way I could resist you.

712
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:26,810
If it were someone else,
they would’ve cried by now.

713
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,660
You cried though.

714
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:30,550
Loudly too.

715
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:35,190
The neighbors must’ve
realized what we did by now.

716
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:40,090
Your neighbors, not mine.

717
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:46,390
Stop.

718
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,650
I can’t do it anymore.

719
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:51,020
Looks like…

720
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:53,990
I’ve used up all my lifetime’s luck.

721
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:56,410
I never imagined someone like me...

722
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,860
would have you at my place.

723
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:02,750
Lying on my bed.

724
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,140
Wrapped up in my arms.

725
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,390
No one would believe me if I told them.

726
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:14,080
You’ve never brought anyone here before?

727
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:16,690
It’s not easy for someone like me.

728
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:25,720
That’s right, you’re lucky.

729
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:29,740
And you'll never be this lucky
again in your whole life.

730
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,090
Mark my words.

731
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:37,390
If I’m a good boy, could you use
your mouth with me next time?

732
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:39,350
When?

733
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:55,590
I’m leaving the day after tomorrow.

734
00:53:58,510 --> 00:53:59,430
On the morning boat ride.

735
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:03,950
Time sure flies.

736
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:15,970
Could you not leave?

737
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,740
I’m just kidding.

738
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:22,950
Someone like me…

739
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,900
wouldn’t dare ask you to stay.

740
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:28,900
Give it a try.

741
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:32,880
Try asking me.

742
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,740
Try saying it.

743
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,290
Can I really say it?

744
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,670
What happened to your guts?

745
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,800
Try acting your age...

746
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,440
and beg me.

747
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:05,860
Maybe if you’re the one asking…

748
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,210
I might agree.

749
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,170
You want me to try asking, right?

750
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:32,480
Yes.

751
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,130
I know that...

752
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:42,180
there’s usually an exchange
when you ask someone for something.

753
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:45,440
It’s been ages...

754
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:49,040
since I asked anyone without giving back.

755
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:53,470
I have nothing to offer you.

756
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,230
I never want anything from you.

757
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:02,060
I didn’t even dare to ask my parents.

758
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:05,210
I’m not trying to pressure you.

759
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:09,930
But I just want to tell you.

760
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:13,670
If I ask…

761
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:16,090
and you refuse…

762
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:24,550
I might never dare to ask anyone again.

763
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:39,880
Can you not go back to Bangkok?

764
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:42,750
I promise.

765
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:45,080
I won’t pull a prank on you.

766
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,850
I won’t bother you while you’re working.

767
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:50,820
I won’t wake you up early.

768
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:54,350
I’ll do anything you say.

769
00:56:58,920 --> 00:56:59,890
Please stay with me.

770
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:03,830
That won’t do.

771
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:19,050
If you’re not pranking me,
then you’re not really you.

772
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:29,000
If you’re not waking me up...

773
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:32,200
how am I supposed to work?

774
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,490
If you do everything I say…

775
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:41,000
you’re no different from an obedient dog.

776
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:48,680
Because you are you.

777
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:52,470
You’re Mahasamut who’s bold around me.

778
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:59,240
Bold enough to screw me in this
shabby hole, on this small mattress.

779
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:01,680
That's why I agree.

780
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,380
I’m not asking you to be nice to me.

781
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:08,510
But because you’re begging me.

782
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:11,140
That’s why I agree.

783
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:16,710
What are you doing?

784
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,290
I don’t want you to look at me now.

785
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:38,330
Stop it.

786
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:41,080
Trying to bite my head?

787
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,840
𝘕𝘰!

788
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:48,840
𝘕𝘰 𝘮𝘦𝘢𝘯𝘴 𝘯𝘰.

789
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,580
𝘠𝘰𝘶 𝘮𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝘳𝘦𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘯 𝘵𝘰𝘥𝘢𝘺.

790
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,600
Fine, all I have to do is go back, right?

791
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:32,560
I’m sleeping.

792
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:34,290
Soundly.

793
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:36,530
Like a log.

794
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:38,420
You can hug me if you want.

795
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:41,250
I’m entering shutdown mode.

796
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:52,690
I’m already asleep.

797
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:54,760
I really am.

798
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:56,220
Completely dead to the world.

799
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,250
Don’t move.

800
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:17,530
I’m sleeping.

801
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:19,210
Not dead.

802
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:20,770
Don’t argue with me.

803
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,810
This is an automated response.

804

English Subtitles by Saowalak K.

805
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:05,740
How much do I need to pay you to
take you back to Bangkok with me?

806
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:08,240
P’ Vie, what should I do?

807
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:10,220
P’ Rak bought some guy
and brought him along!

808
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:16,480
The contract mostly covers
what P’ Rak and you need to do.

809
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:19,680
So, it means that Khun Tongrak can love me.

810
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:21,810
Nonsense!

811
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:25,120
Loving me is easier than leaving me.
