1
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:10,960
Who told you it’s a date?

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,570
What does it mean when you hang out

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,220
have a meal, and go shopping
with someone you’re interested in?

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,140
This is the famous
actress’s lap you’re lying on.

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,830
You have no clue at all, P' Vie.

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,130
P’ Rak, why didn’t you answer my call?

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,610
Who’s she, Khun Tongrak?

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,030
Go take a shower.

9
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,570
We’ll be going out.

10
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,160
Okay.

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,040
Are you good now?

12
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,990
Let’s get you a few belts.

13
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,789
That’s enough.

14
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,490
But I want to buy them for you.

15
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,570
Please?

16
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,670
Why do we find someone
adorable every time we look at them?

17
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,840
Adorable in everything they do
and whenever they smile.

18
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,370
Please, Mahasamut.

19
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,930
No, it’s lunch time.

20
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,930
You need to eat.

21
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,190
No, no, no, no, no.

22
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,380
I want to eat at home.

23
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,840
I… don’t want to waste the
food you cooked last night.

24
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:35,290
It’s in the fridge.

25
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:36,920
Right?

26
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,340
Is it because this person is
adorable in whatever they do?

27
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,020
Or because our feelings… have changed?

28
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,800
Let's go home.

29
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,340
Love Sea the Series

30
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:17,260
Chapter 6: Jealousy is a Sign of Love

31
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,880
Top up my rice for me.

32
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,880
You don’t have to force
yourself for me if you’re full.

33
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:44,200
You usually eat like a bird.

34
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,950
I'm hungry.

35
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,530
How’s the food?
Better than your 8,000 baht meal?

36
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,220
It’s alright.

37
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,380
Then, stick to eating these
“alright” foods from now on.

38
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:08,880
You’ll cook for me?

39
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,210
Will you eat?

40
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,620
Give me two scoops of rice.

41
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,840
Okay.

42
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,050
Do you want to talk about it?

43
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,880
You know my story from Ai Vie.

44
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,580
She texted me, saying
you called her last night.

45
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,020
How’s it?

46
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,530
Isn’t my family just full of drama?

47
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,450
No.

48
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,630
I hung up first.

49
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,740
I told P’ Vie that I wanted
to hear it straight from you.

50
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,540
What do you wanna know?
I'll let you in on what I can tell you.

51
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,110
I want to ask about Prin.

52
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,200
Why? You like her?

53
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,640
If liking her means wanting
her to suffer the most torment

54
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,690
and unbearable misery to
the point of wishing for death...

55
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,150
then I like her enough to love her.

56
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,500
Bet that brat started it with
Ai Rak and got smacked down.

57
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,670
If it’s about her, I can tell you.

58
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,080
You’ll eventually find out about her
anyway if you’re staying with him.

59
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,230
I think I’d better stop at this point.

60
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,770
Oh? Why?

61
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,180
It’s about Khun Tongrak.

62
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,700
So, I want to hear it straight from him.

63
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,680
I don’t want him to think
that I’m trying to pry.

64
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,490
He'll open up to me when he trusts me.

65
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,170
I’m willing to wait.

66
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,170
Can I ask you for one thing?

67
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,480
What is it?

68
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,280
Don't let this end as just a transaction.

69
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,230
You just told that bitch to invest
her time in educating herself

70
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:40,280
instead of being nosy.

71
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,340
I don’t want to be like her.

72
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,580
So, I’d rather hear it straight from you.

73
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,020
Besides, I told P’ Vie I’d keep waiting.

74
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,000
Until you’re ready to talk about it.

75
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,390
Are you alright?

76
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,380
It’s just…

77
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:19,390
Usually, everyone hears
about me from someone else.

78
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,040
What do you want to know?

79
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,670
What do you want to tell me?

80
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,590
That girl is my cousin.

81
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,800
But I don't know if her whole
family's just nuts or spoiled rotten.

82
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,840
Because my aunt doesn't
get along with my mom either.

83
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,300
My mom’s a competent woman.

84
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,840
She can make money out of anything.

85
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,460
This house belongs to her.

86
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,860
The condo Connor lives in is also hers.

87
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:13,890
As well as the one I rent to Ai Vie.

88
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,970
I guess my aunt couldn’t find
a way to match up to my mom

89
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,760
so she sent her daughter instead

90
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,010
even though they have
a complete, loving family.

91
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,050
With a loving father.

92
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,100
I told you about my family, didn’t I?

93
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,750
My dad was a gigolo.

94
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,360
My mom was obsessed with the guy.

95
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,830
She gave birth to my sister and me,
believing we were gifts from him.

96
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,530
Tons of money were taken from her.

97
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,080
And my dad always took
different women home.

98
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,440
In the end, the story concluded…

99
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,230
with the son’s face covered in blood.

100
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,540
What?

101
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,120
What do you mean?

102
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,040
That day, they were fighting.

103
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,740
My dad was usually a brute.

104
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,920
The fight ended with him hitting me
on the head with a bottle of booze.

105
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,210
My face was covered in blood.

106
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,160
I turned to look at my sister.

107
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,670
She was trembling.

108
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,920
And my mom just sat there
bawling her eyes out.

109
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,870
I turned to look at my dad.

110
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,940
The look he gave me was like
he was very annoyed with me.

111
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,880
He kept ranting about how
annoying my crying was.

112
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,900
Then he went back to drinking.

113
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,410
I passed out and woke up at the hospital.

114
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,040
After that day…

115
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,120
My mom sent my dad packing with money

116
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,080
and forbade everyone from contacting him.

117
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,330
But it was far from over.

118
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,800
Because my mom bought
a guy to bring home...

119
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,670
my relatives wasted no time
rubbing salt in the wound.

120
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,360
I even heard them say that I…

121
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,410
…was nothing more than a gigolo’s son.

122
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,210
I really don’t get why that
brat is so jealous of me.

123
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,800
Or why she's so hell-bent on beating me.

124
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,750
When I was a school rep

125
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,060
she wanted to be one as well.

126
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,380
When I went to study abroad

127
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,170
she wanted to follow suit.

128
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,660
Even when I started writing

129
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,670
she just had to go and copy me.

130
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,210
When she couldn’t get as popular as me…

131
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,310
she started spreading the word
that I ripped off other people's work.

132
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,060
I don’t get it!

133
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,470
Why is she so dead set on besting me

134
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:26,010
when I’d give anything in the world
to have a happy family like hers?

135
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,320
What am I supposed to do?

136
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:40,650
Does someone from my family
have to die to make them satisfied?

137
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:50,750
You know what?

138
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,120
Everyone has the right to cry.

139
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,640
I won’t cry.

140
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,310
It’s too far in the past.

141
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,550
You don’t have to cry.

142
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,260
But can I ask you for something?

143
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,390
What?

144
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,290
Can I hug you?

145
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,110
I didn't say you could hug me.

146
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,710
Isn’t my chest warm?

147
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,860
That’s not the point.

148
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:58,510
Then you can cut my pay for disobeying you.

149
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,650
I’m gonna cut your pay.

150
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,810
I’m gonna cut all of your pay.

151
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:22,340
Your man called me to ask
about that brat. Just talk to him.

152
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,630
Not gonna pick up?

153
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,869
Are you alright?

154
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,780
Every time there’s
an incoming call, you’ll be like

155
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:21,990
“Yes. Sawasdee ka.”

156
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,160
“Sure, I’ll take care of it.”

157
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,089
What are you, a call center agent?

158
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:27,069
No.

159
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,710
How come you're free today?

160
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,560
You're always with P' Rak whenever we call.

161
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,020
If I didn’t know P’ Rak swung that way

162
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,950
I'd think there was
something between you two.

163
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,090
It’d be nice if he calls
so I can get to work.

164
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,190
Ever since that guy showed up,
he hasn’t called me again.

165
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,720
- Bummed out.
- Bummed out.

166
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,110
Guys.

167
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,440
Let me ask you something.

168
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,770
- Sure.
- Go ahead.

169
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,700
If your crush slept on
your shoulder for hours

170
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,190
but you left without saying a word

171
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,010
would they hate you?

172
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,470
What’s the tea? Spill it.

173
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:14,400
Come on.

174
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,380
Spill the tea.

175
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,350
Nothing! It’s nothing.

176
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,430
Like I'm gonna buy that.

177
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,470
Is this about…

178
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,950
P’ Rak’s new novel?

179
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,800
Is this a spoiler?

180
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,410
From which novel?
Which couple?

181
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,620
Which novel is he gonna
expand the universe of?

182
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,450
We’re gonna gear ourselves up for it.

183
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,120
Right.

184
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:41,840
A new novel.

185
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,330
That’s all I can say.

186
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,420
- What?
- What?

187
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,060
Can't you just give us a little spoiler?

188
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,000
Yeah. Aren't we friends?

189
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,310
Just a little bit.

190
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,470
Don’t hold out on your friends.

191
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,670
I'm sleepy.

192
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,080
Got sore eyes too.

193
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,660
I didn't get a wink of sleep last night.

194
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,290
Are you going to sleep now?

195
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:47,630
Mmm.

196
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,030
Like this?

197
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,660
It's all your warm chest's fault.

198
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,540
And it's because you made me cry.

199
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,990
So, I have to take responsibility?

200
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,280
Mmm.

201
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,170
Dammit.

202
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,840
Bangkok's record is a clean zero?

203
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,790
You’re so mean…

204
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,160
for seducing me like this.

205
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,230
What’s poking me?

206
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,520
It's hard.

207
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,550
If you keep poking me…

208
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,960
I won't be able to sleep.

209
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,910
I know that.

210
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,000
And do you know?

211
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,380
If you keep rubbing it…

212
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,340
I won't be able to sleep either.

213
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,310
What do you want me to do?

214
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,410
Can you use more than just your hands?

215
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,130
I’m sleepy.

216
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:40,570
Gonna sleep.

217
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,380
Are you sure?

218
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:45,960
Mmm.

219
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,220
But I think you’re up.

220
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,570
You’re “up,” aren’t you?

221
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,130
If you keep staring at my lips…

222
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:16,880
just kiss me.

223
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:33,990
I think you want me
to use my lips elsewhere.

224
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,260
So you do know.

225
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,580
Goddammit!

226
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,230
Go see who’s coming.

227
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,150
Or do you want me to go?

228
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,740
Fine. Can I chase them away?

229
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:14,740
Go ahead.

230
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,670
If it’s Khun Mook?

231
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,000
Scold her.

232
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:17,920
If it’s P’ Vie?

233
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,710
Chase her away.

234
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:19,980
- What if it’s--
- Gosh!

235
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,660
Just kick them out so we
can pick up where we left off.

236
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
Who could it be?

237
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,150
Y… You…

238
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,430
(Southern dialect) Why are you here?

239
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,700
Ai Kom!

240
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,020
(Southern dialect) When did
you get back from overseas?

241
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,520
I landed this morning.

242
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,730
Where’s Khun Connor?

243
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,850
He’s off to his office.

244
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:58,840
No.

245
00:24:59,230 --> 00:24:59,760
You.

246
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,610
Why are you here?

247
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,210
This is P’ Rak’s house.

248
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,350
I've got souvenirs for him.

249
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,640
So, how did you get here?

250
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,310
Well… I… I…

251
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,140
I…

252
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,870
Umm…

253
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,090
Who’s come over?

254
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,470
So, how did you get here?

255
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,350
By plane, duh.
You expect me to walk?

256
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:39,970
Ai Mut.

257
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,200
You’re scaring me.

258
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,990
You've become intimidating
since getting a man.

259
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,790
Don’t change the subject.

260
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,870
You caught me.

261
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,250
You know my hubby and what
his relationship with P’ Rak is.

262
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,050
Khun Connor is Khun Tongrak’s best friend.

263
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,360
You sure aren't shy about
calling him your hubby.

264
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,310
Then I’ll ask P’ Rak.

265
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,480
No! Sit down!

266
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:19,390
And I wanna know why he’s dressed
like that and was alone with you.

267
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,040
It’s nothing.

268
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,300
Ai Mut, I’m worried.

269
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:29,330
I know Connor paid you to look
after P’ Rak while on the island.

270
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,730
And I’m not that naïve enough to think

271
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,190
that you and he would
only keep it professional.

272
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,560
How many years have we been friends?

273
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,260
I know you can fend for yourself.

274
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,940
Even if you got tossed in the sea

275
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,970
you'd find a way to swim back to shore.

276
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,190
But I’m worried.

277
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,770
You're the only friend
I'm caving in for this much.

278
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,250
Fine.

279
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:00,760
It’s just as you think.

280
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,000
I was bought.

281
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,150
Are you out of your mind?!
You know that--

282
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,240
You know Connor bought me.

283
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,220
And you know how it went down.

284
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,530
Hey, don’t look down on your friend.

285
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,490
Maybe I can pull it off, just like you.

286
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,960
Don’t look at him!

287
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,160
He’ll find out what we’re talking about.

288
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,290
What you’re saying is…

289
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:27,840
Yeah.

290
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,800
I told him I’d make him
fall in love with me.

291
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,200
If you look, my prey’s gonna be alarmed.

292
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,400
Are you serious?

293
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,420
I came all the way here.

294
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,830
Because you’re money hungry.

295
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,500
But as greedy as you are

296
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,250
you couldn’t have abandoned
the sea just for money.

297
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,830
So, you left the sea because...

298
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,290
it’s the real deal?

299
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,140
More real than I thought.

300
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:04,950
Don’t worry about me.

301
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,090
How can I not worry? P’ Rak, he's...

302
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,850
“Too close, honey.”

303
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,140
Connor said, “Too close, honey.”

304
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,800
“I’m jealous.”

305
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:18,760
What should we do?

306
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,220
Don’t mind him, P’ Rak.
That’s just how he is.

307
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,420
Won’t he sulk at you?

308
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,550
Let him.

309
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:29,970
Dang, aren’t you just fearless, dude?

310
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:35,940
What now?

311
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,730
- Where were we?
- You’re worried about me.

312
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:38,790
Yeah.

313
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,700
Just go home.

314
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,380
I know P’ Rak well.

315
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:43,710
So do I.

316
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,460
Why are they so close?

317
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,300
Let me talk to my honey.

318
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,780
Why don’t you just call him?

319
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,180
He rejected my calls.

320
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,350
You’ve got to interrupt them.

321
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,250
Those two are just friends.

322
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,110
I’m still not cool with it.

323
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,050
Then why don’t you interrupt them yourself?

324
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,620
Am I your lackey or something?

325
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,080
Hey.

326
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,700
Why are you worked up?

327
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,230
How close are those two?

328
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,600
Heard they’ve been friends since way back.

329
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,540
Oh…

330
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,390
You’re jealous.

331
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:50,970
Fuck off!

332
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:04,880
Call me anytime.

333
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:07,270
Alright.

334
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,870
You gotta let me know if something's up.

335
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,260
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay!

336
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,020
If something happens
and you need help, just--

337
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,200
I won’t get dumped soon.

338
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,070
And don’t worry about me.
I can fend for myself.

339
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,810
Hello.

340
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,880
I’m about to leave, Connor.

341
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,420
What do you mean? It’s not late.

342
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,800
Ai mut and me?

343
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,740
We’re just friends.
Stop your wild imagination.

344
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:49,590
Connor.

345
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,560
Ai Mut wants to talk to you.

346
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,280
Hello, Khun Connor.

347
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,660
Put your friend back on the line

348
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,830
or I'll come get him myself.

349
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,540
He’s about to get in the cab.

350
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,040
Khun Connor.

351
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,010
Don’t you want to say something to me?

352
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,070
About Khun Tongrak.

353
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:20,930
That’s a tough question.

354
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,640
Is Kom getting in the cab?

355
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,600
I know you understand what I mean.

356
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,800
I think it’s good.

357
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,160
Someone’s finally taking
my place in hugging him.

358
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,780
So, is Kom getting in the cab yet?

359
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,490
What do you mean?

360
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,620
Who do you think hugs Ai Rak
when he’s got writer’s block?

361
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,650
Let me talk to Kom.

362
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,610
Hello, Connor.

363
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,090
I’m about to leave.

364
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,290
I mean it. Don’t worry.

365
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,040
- I’m leaving.
- Mmm.

366
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:06,940
My ride’s here.

367
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,110
I’m hanging up.

368
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,250
Really?

369
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,790
How long are you gonna stand outside?

370
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:37,230
Until you come and get me?

371
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,240
- I--
- I--

372
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,010
You go first.

373
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,120
You first.

374
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,990
I told you to speak first.

375
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,180
I'm making way for you to speak first.

376
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,430
Geez!

377
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,040
Oh?

378
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,690
What did I do wrong?

379
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,700
You seem close to Kom.

380
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:57,180
And you seem close to Khun Connor too.

381
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,430
Are you trying to pick a fight?

382
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,490
No.

383
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:06,840
Then how is that relevant?

384
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,550
It’s relevant because I’m curious too.

385
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,710
Answer me now.

386
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,960
Then you answer me too.

387
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,110
But I asked you first.

388
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,400
Fine!

389
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,690
If I answer you first

390
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:25,520
you must tell me why you hug Khun Connor.

391
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,310
What kind of nonsense question is that?

392
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,130
Exactly.

393
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,710
That’s what I want to know too.

394
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,080
I’m going back to my room.

395
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,420
I’m going back to my room too.

396
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,750
And don’t you dare come into my room.

397
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,989
(Southern dialect) Sorry, sir.

398
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:52,580
Because Ai Mut’s going back to his room.

399
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,440
You’re a jerk!

400
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,140
Dammit!

401
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:26,840
So childish.

402
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,660
The fuck are you jealous for, Ai Mut?

403
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,950
After you fought with him, you came to me.

404
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:43,810
I’m touched.

405
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,920
I’m always on your mind.

406
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,780
We didn’t fight.

407
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,660
Then why don’t you go back home?

408
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,250
No.

409
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,680
Hey!

410
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,820
Don't smear your cushion on my cushion.

411
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:16,080
So, you two fought because
your guy asked about you

412
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,350
from me?

413
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,480
I told you he wouldn’t even listen to me.

414
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,570
What a great guy.

415
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,490
No, it’s not about that.

416
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,680
I don’t care if anyone
digs into my business.

417
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:40,870
‘Cause you’re used to it.

418
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,510
Exactly.

419
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,350
It’s been like this since I was young.

420
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,910
First, everyone wanted to know
why my parents got divorced.

421
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:50,450
As I got older, they
wanted to know if I was gay.

422
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,750
Now that I’m working, they still
won’t stop prying into my business.

423
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:56,120
And don’t forget those who
gossip behind your back.

424
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,880
You know I'm used to dealing
with these kinds of people.

425
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:06,970
So, after a nice guy wanted to
hear your story straight from you

426
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,400
when you were ready

427
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:13,650
you started freaking out
and made a bolt to find me?

428
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,240
No.

429
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,200
It feels good.

430
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,500
It feels fanfuckingtastically good
when someone cares about my feelings.

431
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:29,990
And?

432
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,190
I don’t like anyone
messing with what’s mine.

433
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,030
Even if they’re friends,
I still don’t like it.

434
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,240
1 to 10.

435
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,570
Pissed-off level: 8.

436
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,050
My ego's too big to say sorry.
Happy now?

437
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,830
I don't care. I'm gonna sleep here.

438
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,870
Fine.

439
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,140
The boss is crashing at my place.

440
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,060
And the assistant keeps avoiding me.

441
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:16,550
Ai Rak.

442
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,590
Lend me your phone.

443
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,210
Oh.

444
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,090
P’ Vie.

445
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,120
How did you get here?

446
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,850
I heard from Ai Rak that you’ll be
handling the rental contract here today.

447
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,600
Are you okay, P' Vie?

448
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:08,930
Hey.

449
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,880
Are… Are you crying?

450
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:13,890
Who did this to you?

451
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,950
The press wrote another scandal about you?

452
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,480
Don't just keep quiet.

453
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,190
You're making me worried.

454
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:27,260
No.

455
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,950
No one’s gossiping about me.

456
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,270
But I had a scene today where
my character's grandma died.

457
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,220
What happened?

458
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,520
I couldn’t shake off this character, Mook.

459
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,800
It's hitting me like when
my own grandma died.

460
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,260
It reminds me of when I lost her.

461
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,090
I know Ai Rak’s been busy lately

462
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,700
so I couldn’t meet with him.

463
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,230
I don't know who else I can turn to.

464
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,040
I don’t want others to know

465
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,430
that I can't manage my
emotions as an actress.

466
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,870
That’s why I thought about you.

467
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:14,710
Me?

468
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,160
How can I help you out?

469
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,840
Hug me.

470
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:21,730
Huh?

471
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:25,870
Please, Mook.

472
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,200
Umm…

473
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,780
There, there.

474
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,190
Feeling better now?

475
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,270
No.

476
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,450
What do I do?

477
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,140
Please don’t cry.

478
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,100
Please don’t avoid me again.

479
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:52,860
I didn’t avoid you.

480
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:57,300
Promise me that you won’t avoid me again.

481
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:58,500
But…

482
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,400
I miss my grandma.

483
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:05,880
I still remember when I held her hand

484
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,440
while she slowly slipped away.

485
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,930
Okay, okay, okay, P’ Vie.

486
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:19,770
I promise I… I won’t avoid you again.

487
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,230
Don’t cry anymore.

488
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,060
Yeah.

489
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:35,230
I know your man and
Khun Tongrak are friends.

490
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,490
But think about it.

491
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,080
A guy his level is still just a friend.

492
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,920
Do I even stand a chance?

493
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:46,100
Where’s your confidence from last night?

494
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,480
I can guarantee they're just friends.

495
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,680
Yeah, I know.

496
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:00,710
Even if I could turn back time,
I’d still follow him here.

497
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,150
What else can I do?

498
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:05,800
I’ve only got one choice.

499
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,650
But don’t forget what I warned you.

500
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,550
P’ Rak says he doesn't believe in love.

501
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,510
I know that.

502
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,260
Too well, I’m telling you.

503
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,610
He even put in the contract
that we can’t fall in love.

504
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,160
So what are you gonna do?

505
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,690
Don’t know. Still stumped.

506
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:29,820
But first, he's got to come home.

507
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,070
Or else I can’t apologize to him.

508
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,620
Dammit.

509
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:35,970
I’m totally lost.

510
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,990
Meena, let’s go get some ice cream.

511
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,550
Sure, but only if it’s choc mint.

512
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,640
Eww, the toothpaste flavor again?

513
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,510
Geez, what’s wrong
with choc mint ice cream?

514
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:01,570
It’s so good.

515
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,460
Better than your colorful
rainbow ice cream, Ing-Ing.

516
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:07,600
Don’t bully rainbow ice cream.

517
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,030
Let’s get going.

518
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,910
If Pa comes to pick me up,
I can’t go. Come on.

519
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,220
Wait, Ing-Ing!

520
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:22,700
Pa pointed at me and said if I get
higher than a 3.5 this semester

521
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:26,090
I get to pick the country
we go to for our vacation.

522
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:30,150
So, I decided I'm gonna
nail it this semester.

523
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:39,820
What’s the matter, Meena?

524
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,120
We need to go before Pa comes.

525
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:51,690
Who’s that?

526
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:57,870
My grandpa.

527
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,230
Ing, can you ask your pa
to pick us up at the back?

528
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:02,820
We’ll get the ice cream at the mall.

529
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,000
Oh… and…

530
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:08,060
Can you drop me off too?

531
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:11,610
That’s fine by me,
but what about your mom?

532
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:14,360
Oh, I’ll tell Mom that I’m going with you.

533
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,140
Okay, I’m going to call Pa.

534
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,290
Let's head to the back of the school.

535
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:21,360
Better not waste time.

536
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:22,020
Come on.

537
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:32,850
Have you sent my stuff yet, Ai Palm?
It’s been days already.

538
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,670
Alright.

539
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:36,820
Send me the tracking number.

540
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:00,700
You’re in my way.

541
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,080
The button came off.

542
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:07,880
Leave it alone.

543
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,700
Out of the way.
I’m going to make some coffee.

544
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:12,740
Leave it to me.

545
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:15,270
I’ll do it myself.

546
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:16,720
Just go sit down.

547
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,940
What?

548
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:24,060
What are you doing?

549
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,200
Let me go.

550
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,730
Just sit here.
I’ll get you the coffee.

551
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,410
Am I so in the wrong?

552
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,210
Did I go too far?

553
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:00,060
Khun Tongrak.

554
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,810
I’m sorry for touching you.

555
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,500
Guess you’re still upset.

556
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,020
I acted like a jerk yesterday.

557
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:23,190
No wonder you're still mad.

558
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:30,720
I shouldn’t have done that.

559
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:32,640
Well…

560
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:38,250
Who'd be okay with the guy they
bought raising his voice at them?

561
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:43,300
And you spent a hefty sum on me.

562
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:53,380
You should drink it.

563
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:56,280
Before it gets cold.

564
00:46:58,820 --> 00:46:59,290
Oh.

565
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:02,660
You’re still upset with me.

566
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,730
Then I’d better head out
so you don’t have to see me.

567
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:16,040
Where are you going?

568
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,310
I…

569
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:26,910
Are you leaving me?

570
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,220
I…

571
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,400
Answer it.

572
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:46,580
Hello.

573
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:49,760
Oh.

574
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:51,740
I’ll come get it.

575
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,100
Let me go get my package.

576
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,710
After I come back…

577
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,560
Come back?

578
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:15,730
Come back what?
Finish the sentence.

579
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,370
Let me make it up to you.

580
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:31,100
Mmm.

581
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,700
You’re crazy, Ai Rak.

582
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,240
You’re asking for it.

583
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:37,450
What’s up, Uncle’s baby girl?

584
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:54,690
Hey.

585
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:06,150
I’m impressed.
How did you get here?

586
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:08,790
Come on, let’s get inside.

587
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:22,430
This is your type, Uncle Rak?

588
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,530
Height. Passed.

589
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:34,700
Body.

590
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:36,880
Passed.

591
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,470
Tanned skin.

592
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:43,220
It’s a pass alright.

593
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,670
As for his face…

594
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:48,450
Passed with flying colors! So cute!

595
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:53,390
Can I ask?

596
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:55,040
No.

597
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,920
Come on, Uncle Rak.

598
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,730
I’m your niece.

599
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:04,990
Your precious, cute,
adorable, little niece.

600
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:09,630
No.

601
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:10,220
Huh?

602
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,210
Precocious girl.

603
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:12,780
Tsk.

604
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:15,250
I’ll take on that title.

605
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,270
But you can’t compare me
to your 13-year-old self.

606
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:23,700
Kids grow up so fast these days.

607
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:25,750
Besides.

608
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,830
It's the grown-ups who
let me play with phones.

609
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:33,300
I'm going to  tell your mom
to cut back your phone time.

610
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:34,880
Huh?

611
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,190
Then I’ll read your novels instead.

612
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,410
So, is he your boyfriend?

613
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,190
Oww!

614
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:49,500
It hurts.

615
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,610
Even how you punish is old-fashioned.

616
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:54,390
Hey.

617
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:56,580
You still want pocket money?

618
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,320
Yes, please!

619
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:00,800
Be good.

620
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:01,780
What?

621
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:05,930
So, why did you come to see me?

622
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:15,090
It's okay.

623
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:22,800
The truth is…
I saw Grandpa at school.

624
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,030
What?

625
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:27,800
But… But he didn’t see me.

626
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:32,340
I ran to the back of the school
as soon as I saw him.

627
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,730
Oh, I snapped a pic.

628
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:38,970
Here.

629
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:45,730
Uncle Rak, you okay?

630
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:46,850
Hm?

631
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,200
I’m… completely fine.

632
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:54,900
Look, you don’t have to worry about me.

633
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:56,720
I can escape fast.

634
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,220
If I see him, I run.

635
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:01,630
Besides, I’m getting bigger every day.

636
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,300
- He won’t recognize--
- This is serious, Meena.

637
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:15,030
I’m sorry.

638
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,100
It’s okay.

639
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:22,620
I’m not angry with you, but
you can’t be angry with me too.

640
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:26,040
Have you told your mom?

641
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,450
I can’t.

642
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,000
It’ll stress her out.

643
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:31,700
She got stressed last time too.

644
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,000
That’s my good girl.

645
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:41,910
I’ll take care of this matter.

646
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:44,370
How?

647
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:50,420
Don’t worry, I can handle it.

648
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:54,550
I’m going to pick you up for the week.

649
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,310
No.

650
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,530
You’re more scared of
Grandpa than Mommy is.

651
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:04,110
And I’ve already got a plan.

652
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,840
I’ll be going home with Ing for the week.

653
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,700
Her dad picks her up every day.

654
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:10,340
Your mom won’t let you.

655
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,120
What will you tell her?

656
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:22,720
Then… you can have P’ Mook pick me up.

657
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,720
No.

658
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,600
Mook is so tiny.

659
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,260
She won’t be able to help
you if something happens.

660
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:39,630
I can pick her up for you.

661
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,920
You can tell Khun Kwan that
you need to give me some work.

662
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:48,840
I think she won’t mind.

663
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:53,580
Besides, I think I can protect your
niece better than Khun Kaimook.

664
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:59,550
If you’re worried,
we can sync our phones.

665
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:02,570
So you can see if I pick her up or not.

666
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:07,720
But it’ll waste your time.

667
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:14,010
For me...

668
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:19,530
there’s no such thing
as a waste of time if it’s about you.

669
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:24,070
And you know I have plenty of time.

670
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,850
You can depend on me.

671
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:49,220
Well, in case you forgot, this
matter isn’t just about Uncle Rak.

672
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:53,220
If want to pick me up,
you’ve got to pass my test first.

673
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,190
Okay?

674
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:02,220
Okay.

675
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,730
You pay.

676
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,410
Settle with Uncle Rak.

677
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,180
Do you have a dessert limit at home?

678
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:29,810
So, is your test about seeing
if I’ll pay for your cake?

679
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:32,660
No.

680
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:36,980
So...

681
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,180
Do you like Uncle Rak?

682
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:45,410
So… is this another test for me?

683
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:53,510
Mommy taught me not to answer
a question with another question.

684
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:03,190
Huh? Answer me.

685
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:08,310
So, do you like Uncle Rak?

686
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:11,430
Like him?

687
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:13,410
Love him?

688
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:19,310
Even though he’s a guy…
he’s absolutely perfect.

689
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:23,650
Handsome. Fair-skinned.

690
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:25,320
And…

691
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,280
Sexy too!

692
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,300
So fabulous!

693
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,670
He’s… handsome.

694
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:39,330
Sexy.

695
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:41,360
Cute.

696
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:44,310
Huh?

697
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:45,740
And?

698
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:47,710
What else?

699
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:49,950
Anything else?

700
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,510
Alright, I don’t want to
keep secrets from a kid.

701
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,130
Do you want to know

702
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:04,980
why I’m staying with Khun Tongrak?

703
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:10,150
What? Do I need to know?

704
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:16,530
He’s paid me for my company.

705
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:19,830
Do you know what it means?

706
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:30,510
Why did Uncle Rak do it like… Grandma did?

707
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:33,910
But I don’t want money.

708
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:37,060
Huh?

709
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:39,260
Then why did you accept it?

710
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:41,680
If you make Uncle Rak cry

711
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:44,720
- I’ll make sure--
- I’m going to make Khun Tongrak love me.

712
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,240
No.

713
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,360
I’m going to make him “must love” me.

714
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,750
You know? I used to
read Uncle Rak’s book.

715
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:08,590
But the story has gloomy and sad vibes.

716
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:13,590
So, I’m hoping for a happy
ending for his own story.

717
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:16,960
Uncle Rak takes care of everyone.

718
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:21,290
But… no one takes care of him.

719
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:36,280
Then root for me to get that role.

720
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,130
And I’m... pretty confident about it.

721
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:49,950
I like thick-skinned people.
You passed!

722
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:52,860
A kid shouldn't call
an adult thick-skinned.

723
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:57,670
There’s your cake.

724
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:11,560
Try it.
Here’s to our deal.

725
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:25,160
Now you're my partner in crime
for exceeding the dessert limit.

726
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:27,170
The rest is mine.

727
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:32,340
From now on, I’m going
to call you Uncle Mut.

728
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:36,510
And I won’t ever need to change it again.

729
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:41,930
Dig in.

730
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:10,900
I saw Meena off to Khun Kwan’s car.

731
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:18,750
Oh, I didn’t get your approval,
but I exchanged numbers with her.

732
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,610
I’ll send you her class schedule.

733
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:26,330
Okay.

734
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,230
So, do I start picking her up tomorrow?

735
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:31,680
Mmm.

736
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:34,340
Use my car.

737
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:36,610
Okay.

738
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:50,460
Are you okay… about your dad?

739
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:56,830
No.

740
01:01:58,870 --> 01:01:59,680
I’m not okay.

741
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,770
Can I… hug you?

742
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:27,320
It’s alright.

743
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:30,890
You have me.

744
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,070
You can depend on me.

745
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:51,580
Thank you, Mahasamut.

746
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:56,070
For being here.

747
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
For taking care of my niece.

748
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:03,120
I can do that much for you.

749
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:15,580
You’re surprisingly docile today.

01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:40,300
♪ No matter how much I want to love you ♪

751
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:48,420
♪ My heart is afraid
of reopening old wounds ♪

752
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,730

753
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:57,400
♪ Deep down inside, I still hope ♪

754
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:03,330
♪ That you won’t reopen my old wounds ♪

755
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:05,570
Is this your way to say thank you?

756
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,410
Go ahead and do it.

757
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:46,270
I'm all yours.

758
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:08,100

759
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:21,010
Hi, Mom.

760
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:25,160
Vie, what are you up to?
Grandma wants to chat with you.

761
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:28,050
Grandma wants to chat? Sure.

762
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:31,580
Hi, Grandma.

763
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:33,720
Miss me already?

764
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:39,660
I miss you and Grandpa a lot too.

765
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:41,450
Yes.

766
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,110
I promise that once the filming wraps up

767
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:48,360
I'll make time to visit you in France.

768
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:50,810
I promise.

769
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:56,190
Love you too, Grandma.

770
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:58,450
Yes. Kisses, kisses.

771
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:01,280
Okay.

772
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:05,100
Kisses.

773
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,600
P’ Rak has a stage
appearance at the Book Fair.

774
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:09,100
Don’t you want to be on stage?

775
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:12,200
I’m fine with being the writer
signing books at the booth.

776
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:13,710
Thank you, everyone.

777
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:16,620
How odd of you to be alone.

778
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:19,410
Are you afraid someone might discover

779
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,110
how terrible Khun Tongrak truly is?

780
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:22,660
Can't I worry about you?

781
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:24,870
Why?

782
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:28,990
Because you are important to me.
