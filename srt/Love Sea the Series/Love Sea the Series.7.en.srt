1
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,410
You seem close to Kom.

2
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,910
I acted like a jerk yesterday.

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,850
Let me make it up to you.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:15,950
P' Vie.

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,750
Please don't avoid me again.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,990
I met Grandpa at school.

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,120
What?

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,990
Uncle Rak takes care of everyone.

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,330
But... no one takes care of him.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,570
I'm going to make him "must love" me.

11
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,770
Who gave you permission?

12
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:10,940
I’m thick-skinned.

13
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:16,880
Who gave you permission?

14
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,960
Let me ask you something.

15
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,030
It’s about my dad, right?

16
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,930
Can I help you?

17
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,640
I can handle it.

18
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,710
But I want to help.

19
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,080
Just help me pick Meena up.

20
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,920
Would you be more at ease if I did that?

21
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,860
And what's it got to do with you?

22
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,500
Can’t I worry about you?

23
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,140
Go ahead.

24
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,620
No take backs.

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,170
The problem with my dad…

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,870
I can handle it.

27
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,140
I know what he wants.

28
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,380
But if you really want to help…

29
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,010
Meena is important to me.

30
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,690
Then she’s important to me too.

31
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,990
Why?

32
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,490
Because you… are important to me.

33
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:22,970
♪ No matter how much I want to love you ♪

34
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:32,350
♪ My heart is afraid
of reopening old wounds ♪

35
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,590
Hey, how would you rate me out of 10?

36
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,090
What are you talking about?

37
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,060
Sex.

38
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,890
I'd say I'm quite skilled.

39
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,360
But 10 is still too low.

40
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,430
The full score should be out of 100.

41
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,370
8.

42
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,240
Huh?

43
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:56,970
I give you an 8.

44
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,140
What’s this?
The score of a student who wouldn’t study?

45
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,140
I deserve a perfect 100.

46
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,580
You mean for being slimy?

47
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,250
I know I’m skilled.

48
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,450
I like number 8.

49
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,290
What teachers grade students
based on their number preferences?

50
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,560
Then you get a zero.

51
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,330
Hey.

52
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,570
You’d better tell your “son”
to stop poking me.

53
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,440
Because our son’s naughty.

54
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,350
Only an 8?

55
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,650
Hm?

56
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,550
Come on, just an 8?

57
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,190
Come on.

58
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,690
Wacko.

59
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,530
And you’re sleeping with this wacko.

60
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,550
Love Sea the Series

61
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,080
Chapter 7: The Role of Drama Creators

62
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,430
Everyone has their fears.

63
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,710
The fear of someone
important disappearing

64
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,280
like dust vanishing into thin air.

65
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,280
The fear of giving their all
but still losing that important person.

66
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,920
The fear of being disappointed in
the love they've dreamed of since youth.

67
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,309
Thank you.

68
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,650
(One million baht transferred)

69
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,090
Don’t call P’ Kwan anymore, Dad.

70
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,860
Don’t call P’ Kwan anymore.

71
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,960
Can't you just leave us alone?

72
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:39,370
The fear of a painful past
haunting you, even in your dreams.

73
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:52,180
If you want money, just tell me.
Stay away from Meena.

74
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,790
Turn off. Turn off, goddammit.

75
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,080
Khun Tongrak?

76
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,790
Hold me.

77
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,970
You’re so mean.

78
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,570
You tricked me into holding you
then sneaked off to work.

79
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,920
I’m not going anywhere.

80
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,830
Please don’t go anywhere either.

81
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,970
Nong Mook, these are sis’s earrings.

82
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,230
Umm… Okay.

83
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,670
We won’t be needing them
anymore, so I’m returning them.

84
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,280
Sorry? Why are you giving them to me?

85
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,410
Who else could it be but you?

86
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,180
Aren’t you the one managing her right now?

87
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,080
I see that you give her rides.

88
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,420
It’s okay, sis already told me.

89
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,790
I get that between you guys…
there’s a thing going on.

90
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,990
I gotta go.

91
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,030
Huh?

92
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,930
What the heck?

93
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,540
Geez, Ai Mook.

94
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,520
My car broke down.

95
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,220
Come get me.

96
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,350
I need to rush to the set.

97
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,660
What the fudge?

98
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,530
Gosh, what sins did Ai Mook commit?

99
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,130
I shouldn’t be treated like this.

100
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,770
What are you doing?

101
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,940
Channeling spirits?

102
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:31,970
No.

103
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,880
P’ Vivie, your shoot’s done for today.
You can change and go home.

104
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,480
Oh, what about scene 10/7?

105
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,210
We’re out of time.

106
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,950
The team won’t do OT, so we’ll
have to push it to another session.

107
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,150
I hope you won’t have to do OT tonight.

108
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,460
Amen, I so wanna go home and sleep.

109
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,260
- Catch you later.
- See you.

110
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,670
Hey! Wh… Where are you going?

111
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,240
I’m going to change.

112
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:09,040
I know you’re going to change,
but why are you bringing me along?

113
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,340
I can’t reach the zipper.

114
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,310
What?

115
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,150
Fine, I won’t get in the tent.

116
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,550
Let’s take it off here.

117
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,150
Pull it down.

118
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,740
Hurry up before someone comes.

119
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,510
How about you do it yourself first?

120
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,120
I did. Couldn’t reach it.

121
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,190
Hurry up, I’m dying to change.

122
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,620
Pervy girl.

123
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,360
Oh! Hurry up and change, P’ Vie.

124
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,430
You want me to get naked?

125
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,690
Are you crazy?

126
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,030
Oh? Then where are my clothes?

127
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,000
I’d be left in only panties if I undress.

128
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,170
Here.

129
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,740
P’ Vie, go change now. Hurry up!

130
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,510
Get inside.

131
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,580
Why are you embarrassed?
We’re both women.

132
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,420
Just zip it up already!

133
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:04,460
If I didn’t know any better,
I’d think you hate me.

134
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,460
I hate you because you always tease me.

135
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,560
‘Cause you’re fun to tease.

136
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,829
How so?

137
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,369
Look in the mirror.
Every part of you is fun to tease.

138
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,940
But even though you hate me

139
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,180
have I ever told you that I like you?

140
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,520
What?

141
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,200
Oh! Today… Umm…

142
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,500
Today I just have to drop you off, right?

143
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,100
Mmm.

144
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,970
Come pick me up the day after tomorrow too.

145
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,310
How come?

146
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,710
Well, I don’t have a car, remember?

147
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,280
But it’s not my job.

148
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,480
Oh, right. I have to pick P’ Rak up.
He’s got an event.

149
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,650
He hasn't mentioned it to me.

150
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,890
See this? P’ Rak is scheduled for
a stage appearance at the Book Fair.

151
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,500
I’m going to be busy.

152
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,700
Does Ai Rak know he’s got an event?

153
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,240
Yes, I told him.

154
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,870
I've also booked it in the calendar.

155
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,610
Has he ever checked it?

156
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,650
When did you remind him?

157
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,590
Last week or last month?

158
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,390
Well…

159
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:52,900
Believe me, his head is filled with
the thoughts of Mahasamut right now.

160
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:58,740
You’ve worked for him for 4 years.
Has he ever remembered his work schedules?

161
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,010
His memory’s not that bad.

162
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,880
I guess.

163
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:10,780
I think you should remind him before
he decides to cancel it in his head.

164
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,190
P’ Rak, pick up the phone.

165
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,770
Gosh, I hope not?

166
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,400
He wouldn’t forget, would he?

167
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,740
Would he, P’ Vie?

168
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,440
I'm willing to bet as a friend
who's known him for half a lifetime.

169
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,210
He definitely forgets.

170
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,950
I don’t remember.

171
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,120
Huh?

172
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,860
It’s okay if I miss it.

173
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,190
No, it’s not okay.

174
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,560
Just the actors, director,
and producer should do.

175
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,600
What do I do?

176
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,770
If you don't go, I'm going to quit!

177
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,590
Are you hungry, P’ Rak?

178
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,100
No.

179
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,970
Is there anything you need?

180
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,130
Nothing.

181
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,940
I’m screwed.

182
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,240
Don’t you want to go up on the stage?

183
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,340
I thought it was something
every writer wanted.

184
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,750
I’m fine with being the writer
signing books at the booth.

185
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,250
But I don’t like making
an appearance with actors.

186
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,560
First, too crowded.
Second, too much hassle.

187
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,160
Third, too many dramas.

188
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,290
And there’s someone threatening to quit.

189
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Are you achy, P' Rak?

190
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,200
Are you?

191
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,210
We were stuck in the traffic
for like an hour and a half.

192
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,540
Do you think I’m achy or not?

193
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,610
Well…

194
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,720
Then wait for me here, okay?

195
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,520
I’m going to look for P’ Saw

196
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,420
and ask if the VIP room is available now.

197
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,300
Why are you angry?
Your secretary is feeling down now.

198
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,340
I’m not angry.

199
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,140
If you’re not angry,
then how about a smile?

200
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,540
Got sore cheeks.

201
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,080
Is that so?

202
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:58,350
Just flash a smile.
Can’t you see she’s about to cry?

203
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,060
I’m not angry with Mook.

204
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,690
Then what’s upsetting you?

205
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,440
Oww, stop!

206
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,340
Stop!

207
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,610
What? Does hurting me make you feel good?

208
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,010
Not yet.

209
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,380
But my scalp hurts.

210
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,950
It’s not like I yanked your hair.

211
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,420
Fix my hair now.
You messed it up, you fix it.

212
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,290
Why do I have to fix it?

213
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,300
Because I want you to.

214
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,960
Please.

215
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:47,900
Come on.

216
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:06,150
Looking sharp now.
As expected from my guy.

217
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,820
Are you…

218
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,620
Are you P’ Rak?

219
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:11,860
Yes.

220
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,730
You see…

221
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,960
I’m a fan of your novels.

222
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,930
I really love your Mafia series.
Been following it since the first book.

223
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,370
Whoa, that one was so long ago.

224
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,710
And who’s your favorite?

225
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,310
The male lead.

226
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,410
Ruthless yet handsome.

227
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,650
And twisted but awesome.

228
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,880
I convinced my friend to check it out too.

229
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,550
I’m happy to hear that.

230
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:45,660
Well… Then… Could you
sign this book for me?

231
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,490
Sure.

232
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,460
Yeah!

233
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,200
Here.

234
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,770
So happy.

235
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:00,540
I came all the way to this
book fair just to meet you.

236
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,970
Thank you.

237
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,740
Please sign this for me too.

238
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,080
Hey, isn’t that P’ Rak?

239
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,580
It’s really him!

240
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,550
Will you be okay on your own?

241
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,280
Where are you off to?

242
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,880
Getting you some water.

243
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,990
I'm sure you'd like to talk with the fans.

244
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,520
Go ahead, I’ll be fine.
I love talking to the readers.

245
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,230
Okay.

246
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,330
- Here.
- Thank you.

247
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,500
P’ Rak, could I get a photo with you?

248
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,030
Of course.

249
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,370
Thank you, everyone.

250
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,110
The new book might take a while

251
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,410
but if you're willing to wait,
I'll definitely keep writing.

252
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,320
Hey, I want a word with you.

253
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,660
No, I’m busy.

254
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:03,440
Wait.

255
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,870
Keep touching me and you’ll
get the laborer stench on you.

256
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,640
As if I want to touch you.

257
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,080
Yes, I’m just a low-class guy.

258
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:19,750
Someone as high and mighty as you
wouldn't want to talk to me.

259
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,620
Oh, wait. Hey.

260
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,720
I’m still not done talking to you.

261
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,360
I’ve got nothing to say.

262
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,230
200k.

263
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,830
I’ll give you 200k.
You just have to do as I say.

264
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,840
What do you say?
It’s a simple job.

265
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,870
Better than selling yourself to P’ Rak.

266
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,210
Where are you going?

267
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,250
Since I’m doing this much

268
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,720
you should be smart enough
to know I’m turning you down.

269
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:56,820
300k.

270
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,120
400k.

271
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,260
600k.

272
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,830
Look, just take the Beemer.

273
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:29,920
This is yours.

274
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,590
Selling myself to Khun Tongrak…

275
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,830
is probably more fun than working for you.

276
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,800
- Hold on--
- And stop following me.

277
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,330
I need to rush to the restroom.

278
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,670
My hands need a quick wash.

279
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,110
I touched something dirty.
Can’t pass it to Khun Tongrak.

280
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,840
Look, you…

281
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,210
Oh…

282
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,920
I forgot to tell you.

283
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,920
I’m a scumbag.

284
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,420
You’re so…!

285
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,000
Rak, you can take it easy for now.
Let me know if you need anything.

286
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,930
I'll come fetch you when it's about time.

287
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,470
You can get back to work, P’ Saw.

288
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,100
I know how wearing these events can be.

289
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,210
I’ll be fine.
It’s not my first time anyway.

290
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:25,540
I’m good. Just the fact that you’re here
for the event already makes me happy.

291
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,010
You know that if it’s your request

292
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,380
no matter how whiny I am,
I’d definitely come.

293
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,690
So, you do realize that you’re whiny.

294
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,560
P’ Saw, you’ve known me
since I was in my early 20’s.

295
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,090
It’s too late for me to pretend now.

296
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,400
Alright, I’m getting back to work.

297
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,100
Okay.

298
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,570
Let’s go.

299
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,300
Yes?

300
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:56,340
Oh.

301
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,350
Yes, go on.

302
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,410
Maybe you should give it another thought?

303
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,810
P’ Rak, I'm going to pick up
the TV series team.

304
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:38,120
They’re waiting in
the parking lot downstairs.

305
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,320
Just go, I’ll be fine.

306
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,720
And you have only 15 minutes to get ready.

307
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,860
I know that.

308
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,060
You think I’d throw a fit at the organizer?

309
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,460
A dashing smile is what I’ll throw at them.

310
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,430
- You should go.
- Okay.

311
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,910
You have some books
you want to buy, right?

312
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,340
Go ahead.

313
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,840
I’ll leave right after
getting off the stage.

314
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,980
Nah, I’d better stay with you.

315
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,420
That brat can’t do anything to me.

316
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,620
Besides, there are books
you need to buy for me.

317
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,520
Just go.

318
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,130
Fine, I’ll be back in a jiffy.

319
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,560
Mmm.

320
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,440
How odd of you to be alone.

321
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,910
Weren’t you already aware that I was alone?

322
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,180
Out in public, you act
like we’re on good terms.

323
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,210
Why?

324
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,650
Are you afraid someone might discover
how terrible Khun Tongrak truly is?

325
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,260
Aren’t you just the same?

326
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,770
I didn’t say you could sit down.

327
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,340
Don’t be shameless.

328
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:45,240
Inviting someone to take a seat
is a common courtesy, P’ Rak.

329
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,080
How can you not know something so basic?

330
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,620
Figured as much.
No one taught you.

331
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,620
Don’t you have any work to do?

332
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:06,200
In case you didn’t know, I’m also a writer.

333
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,670
I'm holding an autograph
session at the booth too.

334
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,500
Aren’t you just imitating me?

335
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,610
Whenever I make an appearance, so do you.

336
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,880
No wonder I meet you every time.

337
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,250
You know.

338
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:25,720
It’s not too late to admit
that you’re my fan.

339
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,190
Are you so unloved that
you're deluding yourself?

340
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,630
You should drop the whole
“me being unloved,

341
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,830
my dad abandoning me,
my mom buying men” thing.

342
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,600
Don’t you think that’s old news?

343
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:44,500
Even a middle schooler could
come up with something more original.

344
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,010
It’s boring to hear the same
thing over and over, Prin.

345
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,340
You’re a writer.
Try coming up with new plots.

346
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,480
You’re right.

347
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:05,760
It’s no secret how
messed up your family is.

348
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:14,500
It’s gotten to where your mom
buys men to fill your dad’s shoes.

349
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:15,900
Oh.

350
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,670
I wonder how many
new dads you have right now.

351
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,540
Have you hit 100 yet?

352
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,880
Why are you looking at me like that?

353
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,480
Did I hit your sore spot?

354
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,480
But I understand your feelings.

355
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,620
You’re getting older every day.

356
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:40,330
No one would want you, even if you
offered yourself for free like you used to.

357
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,360
That’s why you pay for sex.

358
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:47,000
But… I just don’t get why
you’ve chosen that guy.

359
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,840
Anyway, I don’t want
to judge your taste in men.

360
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,840
It’s quite… low class.

361
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,010
By the way, I’m curious.

362
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,080
Do you actually think
that he really loves you?

363
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,250
Are you angry?

364
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:11,120
Do you honestly believe he'll love
you, given that you bought him?

365
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:17,560
Are you so starved for a father's love
that any man’s affection will do?

366
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,000
That’s funny, P’ Rak.

367
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,830
I can't believe that's the best

368
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:25,470
someone with your level of
education could come up with.

369
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,370
I'll tell you this out of charity.

370
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,780
No matter how much you beg or cry

371
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,110
nobody will love someone like you.

372
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,380
Are you finished?

373
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,920
No, not yet.

374
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,590
Eventually... you’ll end up like Auntie.

375
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,400
Driven mad from getting dumped.

376
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,620
You think I’ll flip out
and throw water at you?

377
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,880
Use your head like an adult for once.

378
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,820
I'm kind of hoping for that.

379
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
So?

380
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,960
Are you going to grab
my hand to splash yourself

381
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,530
and then tell everyone I did it?

382
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,900
No, it’s much easier if I do this.

383
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,780
The publisher team says the MC
will be here to brief you in 5 minutes.

384
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,050
As for the interview questions
I sent the other day

385
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,389
if you have any queries,
feel free to ask the MC or P’ Saw.

386
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,060
- Okay.
- Okay.

387
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:52,719
This is it.

388
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,030
P’ Rak, I’m back--

389
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,330
What was that for, P’ Rak!?

390
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,670
P’ Rak, why did you throw water at me!?

391
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,340
I was just worried.

392
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:11,740
You could have told me nicely
if you didn't like it.

393
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,410
Why did you do this to me?

394
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,510
Aren’t we family?

395
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,280
What did I do to deserve this?

396
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,450
I know you've been jealous
of me since we were kids.

397
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:27,930
But I… I’ve never felt jealous of you.

398
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:32,800
I just wanted to congratulate
you on the new TV series.

399
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,570
But why did you have to do this to me?

400
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,070
Everyone, P’ Rak would
never do something like that.

401
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,140
There must be some misunderstanding.

402
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,380
But the evidence is clear, Khun Mook.

403
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,250
I know it’s a private matter

404
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,880
but if outsiders find out
what Khun Tongrak did

405
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,480
it’ll affect his reputation.

406
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,320
The series hasn’t even started filming.

407
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,490
I don’t believe it.
It can’t be true.

408
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,190
- P’ Rak wouldn’t hurt anyone--
- I did it, Mook.

409
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:03,690
P’ Rak!

410
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,810
In fact, I’m about to do it.

411
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,050
Hey! You’ve gone too far.

412
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,620
You can’t do this to a woman.

413
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,790
I was just trying to tell you I did it.

414
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,490
I always own up to my wrongdoings.

415
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,860
If I'm going to be held responsible

416
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,930
I might as well make it count.

417
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,670
What do you mean?

418
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,110
Prin.

419
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,750
Any idea what this is?

420
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,850
I don’t know.

421
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,150
This is how it works.

422
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,650
You think I’ll flip out
and throw water at you?

423
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,790
Use your head like an adult for once.

424
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,660
I'm kind of hoping for that.

425
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:40,890
So?

426
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,630
Are you going to grab
my hand to splash yourself

427
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,360
and then tell everyone I did it?

428
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,640
No, it’s much easier if I do this.

429
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,910
It wasn’t me.

430
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,510
I didn’t do it.

431
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,440
It really wasn’t me.
I didn’t do anything.

432
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,350
Believe me, I really didn’t do it.

433
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,320
There’s one more thing I want to tell you.

434
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,970
Don’t be stupid.

435
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,920
Seriously, you threw water at yourself?

436
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,460
No, I didn’t do anything.

437
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,990
But there’s proof.

438
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,760
But I really didn’t do it.

439
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,430
I didn’t do it.

440
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,640
Are you satisfied?

441
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,640
Not as much as I thought.

442
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:08,810
Good job.

443
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,020
I’m not a kid.

444
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,520
I know.

445
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,460
You’re the best.

446
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,390
Thank you.

447
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:28,800
I met your cousin.

448
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,840
I’m not surprised.

449
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:37,170
She’s also a writer, so it’s normal
to run into her at the Book Fair.

450
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,050
What did she say to you?

451
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,650
She wanted to poach me.

452
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,490
I turned her down.

453
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:53,960
Why?

454
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:01,470
I know that I’d discover
her plan if I played along.

455
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,300
But you wouldn’t like it.

456
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,550
I don’t want you to think
that I betrayed you.

457
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:17,850
Not even a bit.

458
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,850
And if I did it...

459
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,790
you might walk away from
me without looking back.

460
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,730
If winning means you have to get hurt...

461
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,430
it’s a defeat from the start for me.

462
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:43,110
So, all I can tell you
is that I met your cousin.

463
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,110
But I don’t know what
that bitch is planning.

464
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,300
What’s this?

465
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,900
Let’s see what trick
she has up her sleeve today.

466
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,560
The series just had its
pre-production blessing ceremony

467
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,460
but it's already attracting
a large number of fans.

468
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:41,400
Could you tell us about
the characters you play?

476
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:06,020

477
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:09,490
How so?

478
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,230
I believe we all have moments of weakness,

479
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,870
days when we cry,

480
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,140
and feelings that, for once in our
lives, we just can't take it anymore.

481
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,980
Until we meet someone…

482
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,180
who becomes our shelter,

483
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,250
our safe place, our strength.

484
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,020
Someone important in our lives.

485
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,160
Just like those two characters

486
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:43,660
who’ll end up being each other’s
shelter in one way or another.

487
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,130
And…

488
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:54,810
I want viewers to be empowered by that.

489
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:57,910
Wow, what a great speech, Khun Tongrak!

490
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:02,550
Well, looks like the actors
have a big responsibility to…

491
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:22,800
P’ Rak, I’m back--

492
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:25,470
What was that for, P’ Rak!?

493
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:28,670
Ai Rak.

494
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:32,740
That clip of Prin throwing water
at herself is all over the net now.

495
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:36,550
Mm, and?

496
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,820
You did it, right?

497
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:42,450
What the hell?

498
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:45,490
I was at work for just half a day,
but I missed out on all the fun.

499
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,160
I should’ve canceled
the gig and gone with you.

500
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,360
Well, it’s nothing.

501
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,370
Quit it, dude.

502
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:58,370
Now, how did you pull it off?
Spill the deets.

503
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,210
Nothing much.

504
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,710
I just…

505
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:11,220
Things have gone too far this time.

506
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,220
I’m going to tell Prin’s
publisher about this

507
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,920
so they can stop publishing her books.

508
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,190
And I’m going to reveal
the truth to everyone.

509
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,430
People are still skeptical
because that witch keeps denying it.

510
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:23,990
But it’s alright.

511
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,230
We’ve got the CCTV.

512
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,670
See?

513
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:32,740
You’re loved by many people.

514
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,240
Hey!

515
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,110
Now’s not the time for
lovey-dovey eye contact.

516
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:46,420
So, you let the editor team
listen to the voice clip.

517
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,890
Don’t know how they did it,
but the CCTV clip was leaked.

518
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,160
And eyewitnesses are coming forward
to share every bit of what happened.

519
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,730
Why’d you have to complicate things

520
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,630
when you could’ve just
dropped the voice clip?

521
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,530
Hey.

522
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,130
The thing is…

523
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,900
Khun Prin mentioned P’ Rak’s mom, P’ Vie.

524
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:09,640
Oh.

525
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,640
You got serious because
she crossed the line, right?

526
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,880
I bet she’s having a meltdown right now.

527
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,620
Look at the comments.
They all tell that brat to go see a shrink.

528
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,860
She's brought it on herself.

529
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,900
Who knows what would’ve happened
if P’ Rak didn’t have the recording pen.

530
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:39,570
Ooh, look at all these
people offering to treat her.

531
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:44,510
Whoa, one comment says Ai Rak did
the right thing by splashing her again.

532
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,810
I'd do the exact same thing
if I were gonna get accused.

533
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:51,980
Wait a minute.

534
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:54,050
The recording pen you’re talking about…

535
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:56,790
Don’t tell me it’s that pen.

536
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,460
Hey, that one?

537
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:03,690
Mm, the one you gave me
as a birthday present.

538
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:07,500
See, I told you it’d come in handy.

539
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:11,740
I figured you could use it to record those
who dissed you so you could sue them.

540
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:19,640
Would you like red or white?

541
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,550
I’ll go with red wine.
What about you?

542
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,310
I’ll have what you have.

543
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:31,290
They’ve been acting
this way since the event.

544
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:32,690
What are we going to do?

545
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,030
This is starting to get concerning.

546
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,730
I wanna eat pizza.

547
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:39,860
Order it.

548
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,830
Order a whole pizza just to eat one slice?

549
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,030
I’m sure these two won’t help me finish it.

550
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,570
They keep whining about getting fat.

551
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,810
Just order it. I’ll help you eat.

552
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:56,050
Are you two together?

553
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:58,820
Wacko.

554
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:03,020
Oh my, don’t call me a wacko
if you’re just gonna blush.

555
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:04,760
I’m hot.

556
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,160
You're not fooling anyone with
the AC blasting and the long sleeves.

557
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:14,770
What about us, Mook?

558
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:16,800
Sorry?

559
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:18,640
What about us?

560
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:21,810
There's no us.

561
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:24,310
What are you talking about?

562
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,540
Our plan tomorrow.

563
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,750
What plan?

564
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,380
The line rehearsal.

565
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,150
Didn’t I tell you my manager’s busy?

566
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,220
And this scene's a real struggle.

567
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,320
I need someone to help
me rehearse my lines.

568
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:43,230
If I can't perform and it leads to OT

569
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:44,900
it's gonna stress out the whole crew.

570
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,300
Please help me, Mook.

571
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,270
Umm…

572
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:03,480
Oh, I can get you a different shirt
if you’re hot.

573
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,350
No need.

574
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:09,290
Just stay here.

575
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:51,800
Is that you in the clip?

576
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:58,370
What have you done?
My friend sent me the clip.

577
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:04,640
Are you out of your mind?
You've brought shame on me!

578
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,150
That’s not me, just a lookalike.

579
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:15,050
You think I’m an idiot? That’s definitely
you. The other guy’s your cousin.

580
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:19,890
I told you it wasn’t me!
Why won’t you just get it?!

581
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:57,060
Stop reading.

582
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,630
It’ll stress you out.

583
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:04,330
Don’t argue.

584
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:06,770
You act like you’re fine.

585
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,570
But do you know how you look
when you read those comments?

586
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,220
I tried not to think.

587
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,250
But seeing all the crap
people say online...

588
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,060
I couldn’t help it.

589
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,000
We’re human.

590
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,070
We can’t stop thinking.

591
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,210
Just as we can’t shut those trolls up.

592
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:54,720
But I just want to ask you
to focus on those who care about you.

593
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:57,050
And it’ll be even better…

594
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:02,930
if you stop acting like you’re fine
when you’re actually not.

595
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:05,700
Just admit you're not okay.

596
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,070
At least around me.

597
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:22,550
Quit stressing.

598
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,780
It'll make you look run-down.

599
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:27,350
It’s bad enough that you’re old.

600
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:30,320
Mahasamut.

601
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:33,690
What? It's the truth.

602
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,290
You’re almost 10 years older than me.

603
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:44,600
I look run-down?

604
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,400
But my skin’s still good.

605
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,170
Who told you that?

606
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:51,140
Hm?

607
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,480
Where are you going?

608
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,080
Nosy!

609
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:18,540
Don’t worry.

610
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:22,340
Even though you’re old, you’re still cute.

611
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,340
Just shut it.

612
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,990
English Subtitles by Saowalak K.

613
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:36,990
You seem to be doing well, Uncle.

614
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,160
Anything I can do for you?

615
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:44,330
5 million baht in exchange for destroying
the one you brought into this world.

616
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:46,260
I want you to break up with Rak.

617
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,470
I like.

618
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:50,130
Pretty cute.

619
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:51,300
I like you too.

620
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:52,700
You like him.

621
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,470
When was the last time
you slept with someone else?

622
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:01,580
Do you want to snuggle up to every
man's shoulder like you do with Ai Mut’s?

623
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:03,650
- P’ Vie, I think--
- We can love each other.
