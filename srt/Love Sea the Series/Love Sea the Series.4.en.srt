1
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,420
You said love is a figment of imagination.

2
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,500
I'm an imaginative guy.

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,010
Just while you’re on this island,
you can try by buying me.

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,650
You want me to buy love?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,980
I've been thinking about the scandal
and need your help.

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,420
How can someone like me help you?

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,690
Will you be my girlfriend?

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,360
I'm leaving the day after tomorrow.

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,000
Can you not go back to Bangkok?

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,770
I promise.

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,600
I'll do anything you say.

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,260
Please stay with me.

13
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:54,780
Nong Mut!

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,080
Nong Mut, Nong Mut, Nong Mut.

15
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,830
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

16
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,120
Your handsome guest’s checking out today?

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,460
How did you know?

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,459
Well, I checked the records.

19
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,130
He was only booked until last night.

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,020
Yeah, you got it right.

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,480
What a pity.

22
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,080
Because he’s a big tipper.

23
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,350
Wait, what if the girls
at the bar find out?

24
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,730
They’ll freak the hell out!

25
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,700
They were fighting like
cats in heat to seduce him.

26
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,420
What else can we do?

27
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,550
He's got a home to go back to.

28
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,920
You want him to stay
 and keep tipping forever?

29
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,950
I was only asking.

30
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,710
And I was only answering.

31
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,000
Look there.
Just go back to work.

32
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,450
Dear guest!

33
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,810
Hello, please have a seat.

34
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,090
Are you here to check out?

35
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,259
Don’t forget the tip box, my dear guest.

36
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,970
Just a moment, please.

37
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,660
Every meeting...

38
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,510
always ends with a farewell.

39
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,190
Shall we get going?

40
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,420
Love Sea the Series

41
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,350
What’s this?

42
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,080
Your suitcases.

43
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,020
Already forgot about them?

44
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,730
That’s not what I meant.

45
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,230
I’m talking about this.

46
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,040
This.

47
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,600
This pickup.

48
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,450
Didn’t you say you didn’t own one?

49
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,050
When did I ever say that?

50
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,080
But…

51
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,730
You picked me up in a cargo tricycle.

52
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,510
Took me around on a motorcycle.

53
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,980
I never saw this goddamn pickup even once.

54
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,480
And have I ever told you
I don’t own a pickup?

55
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,950
I use it to tow the boat.

56
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,660
Are you a boat that needs to be towed?

57
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,440
Calm down.

58
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,650
Let’s not say goodbye while being upset.

59
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,820
You’re not that mean, are you?

60
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,270
I’m sorry I couldn’t keep my promise.

61
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,390
I understand.

62
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:26,730
It’s alright.

63
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,790
I was there too...

64
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,140
when you called your
assistant to extend your stay.

65
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,800
Come to think of it.

66
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,280
Your assistant’s voice was so loud.

67
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,790
I could still hear her refusing
even from where I stood.

68
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,409
But I gave my word.

69
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:51,930
It’s okay.

70
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,260
I’m used to it.

71
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,720
Let me ask again.

72
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,360
Can I choose my return date?

73
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,580
No!

74
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,420
No means no.
You must return today.

75
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,360
- But…
- Listen to me, P’ Rak.

76
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,800
You have a meeting tomorrow.

77
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,510
You’re returning today, aren’t you?

78
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,810
Aren’t you?

79
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,590
You didn't forget that you
had a meeting with the agency

80
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,380
handling your foreign copyrights, did you?

81
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,039
They informed us last month
that they were coming to Thailand.

82
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,340
And you said you could make it.

83
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,600
You can’t back out on me now.

84
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,420
Besides, you remember
they've just sold the copyrights

85
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,150
for Japanese and
Spanish translations, right?

86
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,760
And they want to discuss Vietnam's
interest in a web series adaptation too.

87
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,650
You must attend, P’ Rak.

88
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,830
I’m begging you.
Please, please, please.

89
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,030
Please.

90
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,170
Are you crying?

91
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,270
I’m not crying.

92
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,500
But if you’re not
coming back, I really will.

93
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,030
Fine, all I have to do is go back, right?

94
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,880
You’re the best, P’ Rak!

95
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,390
I’m hanging up.

96
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,930
Are you getting on the boat?
I’ll pick you up at…

97
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,810
Did you forget anything?

98
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,770
(50,000 baht received)

99
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,720
Your service fee.
(50,000 baht received)

100
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,610
(50,000 baht received)

101
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,080
With such a generous tip…

102
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,460
Feel free to request my service next time.

103
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,300
I won’t be coming back
to this island again.

104
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,130
True.

105
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,290
You were forced to come here.

106
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,910
I still remember the first day I met you.

107
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,870
You raised your chin like this too.

108
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,600
Don’t make it into a habit.

109
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,650
You’ll get a stiff neck.

110
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,520
I’m worried about you.

111
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,820
Don’t worry about me.

112
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,120
Worry about yourself.

113
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,440
And…

114
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,990
Remember to eat breakfast.

115
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,260
Or you’ll get gastritis.

116
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,800
Are you a doctor?

117
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,880
Most importantly…

118
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,300
Don’t stay up too late.

119
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,130
You’re getting older.

120
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,350
Wrinkles might start showing.

121
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,200
You...

122
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,620
Jerk!

123
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,220
Damn you, Mahasamut!

124
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,030
That’s me.

125
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,230
Khun Tongrak.

126
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,700
I’m leaving.

127
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,410
I’ll help with the suitcases.

128
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,010
They're worth a fortune.

129
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:42,990
Aren’t you coming?

130
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:12,930
Khun Tongrak.

131
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,010
What?

132
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,740
Khun Tongrak.
(You must love...)

133
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,860
Mahasamut.

134
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,100
I’ll never forget about us.

135
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,780
Take care of yourself.

136
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,820
Why is your name Mahasamut?

137
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,330
Strange.

138
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:01,490
I guess…

139
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,040
It’s so that our names can rhyme.

140
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,010
Did you fail Thai?

141
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,620
They don’t rhyme at all.

142
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:10,540
You see...

143
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,690
Tongrak. (Must love)

144
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,420
Mahasamut.

145
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,270
Ridiculous.

146
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,110
Nonsense.

147
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,720
Khun Tongrak – Mahasamut.

148
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,310
You must love me.

149
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,140
How much?

150
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:00,850
Sorry?

151
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,510
I’m asking you how much.

152
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,980
You already know the rate
for my private diving course.

153
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,270
It hasn’t changed.

154
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,360
That’s not what I meant.

155
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,060
I want to know how much I need to
pay to take you back to Bangkok with me.

156
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,760
Are you sure about this?

157
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,950
Just name your price.

158
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,920
I’m expensive.

159
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,040
I can afford it.

160
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,660
I believe you can.

161
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,690
But if you don't want to say goodbye...

162
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,230
just buy the guy and
take him home with you.

Chapter 4: From Seaside to Skyline

174
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,090
So excited P’ Rak’s coming back!

175
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,870
Okay.

176
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:31,730
Perfect!

177
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,000
Oh, P’ Rak’s coming!

178
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,740
P’ Rak.

179
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,830
P’ Rak.

180
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,030
Mook.

181
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,270
This is Mahasamut.

182
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:48,790
Get acquainted.

183
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,220
I bought him back with me.

184
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,420
What?!

185
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,070
What floor is your room on, Khun Tongrak?

186
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,770
Third floor.

187
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,760
What are you doing?

188
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,350
Going to bed.

189
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,750
Khun Tongrak’s tired.

190
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,650
P’ Rak’s tired, then let him go to bed.

191
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,950
Why are you following him?

192
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,840
I’m sleeping with him, of course.

193
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,710
You can’t.

194
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:19,720
No.

195
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,340
You’re not allowed to enter P’ Rak’s room.

196
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,180
Why?

197
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,580
I don’t trust you.

198
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,260
Mook, let him be.

199
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,330
P’ Rak.

200
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,100
But…

201
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,440
But he’s a complete stranger.

202
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,560
How could I easily let him into your room?

203
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,600
Even if he doesn’t get into my room now

204
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,720
he’ll eventually end up there anyway.

205
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:48,910
P’ Rak!

206
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,690
It’s the truth.

207
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,730
Because if he doesn’t get into my room…

208
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,310
how else would we have sex?

209
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,290
P’ Tongrak!

210
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,760
Mook.

211
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,960
I bought him, so I have to get
my money’s worth out of him.

212
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,720
Khun Tongrak’s right.

213
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,700
You won’t let me into his room.

214
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,280
Do you want us to do it here?

215
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,790
I’ve got no problems with it, though.

216
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,660
You can see for yourself
whether I'm worth the money or not.

217
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,600
Are you crazy?

218
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,160
What are you doing?

219
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,090
Alright.

220
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,110
It’s getting late.
You should go home.

221
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,230
P’ Rak.

222
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,680
Not yet.

223
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,080
But… But…

224
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,130
I'm not done talking just yet.

225
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,440
Or do you want to see us having sex?

226
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,470
P’ Rak.

227
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,170
Go home now.
It’s already late.

228
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,320
Do you know what time it is, hmm?

229
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,040
If you don’t leave,
I’ll bail on the meeting.

230
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,150
You can’t.

231
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,860
You absolutely can’t.

232
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,010
You can bail on anything but this meeting.

233
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,890
That’s why you’ve got to leave now.

234
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:16,060
You know what will happen
if I don’t get enough sleep...

235
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,620
and wake up late.

236
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,550
But…

237
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,140
No but.

238
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,170
Go.

239
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,200
Not yet, P’ Rak.
I’m still not done talking.

240
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,770
We’re done here.

241
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,720
Hold on.

242
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,360
Go home.

243
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,300
- P’ Rak!
- I’m sleepy.

244
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,000
- I’m still talking.
- Leave now.

245
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,270
P’ Rak.

246
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,560
You really need to think this through.

247
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,970
You’ve only known him for two weeks.
You can’t take him in like this.

248
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,680
We don’t know who he is
or if we can trust him.

249
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,290
Besides.

250
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,550
What if he’s got something like...

251
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,300
What if he’s carrying something?

252
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,700
You mean STDs?

253
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,840
You’ve got a good point there.

254
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,150
I know, right?

255
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,290
Then take him to the hospital
tomorrow to get tested.

256
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:21,790
What?!

257
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,690
Oww, my ears are bleeding.

258
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:26,420
I’m getting sleepy.

259
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,870
Come on, go home now.
It’s late.

260
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,260
- No.
- You should leave now.

261
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,590
And make sure you get him
tested tomorrow, okay?

262
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,260
Why does it have to be me?

263
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,170
Who am I?

264
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,420
My boss.

265
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,700
And that's my order.

266
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,670
Ouch! Oww!

267
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,840
P’ Rak.

268
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,150
Wait, hold on.

269
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,850
Open the door, P’ Rak.
We’re still not done talking.

270
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,150
Oh no, Ai Mook!

271
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:58,930
Think.

272
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,560
What do I do?

273
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,760
Wait, Khun Tongrak.

274
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,630
You’re really not expecting me
to let you in my room, are you?

275
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,160
You're free to sleep
in any room you want.

276
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,320
Or sleep on the couch, if you’d like.

277
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,860
Or if you want to sleep in
the bathroom, that’s up to you.

278
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,790
But you must never enter my room.

279
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,590
I’m sleepy.

280
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,640
You can take the suitcases
upstairs tomorrow.

281
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,350
Empty.

282
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,760
Don’t they eat or something?

283
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,350
At least they’ve got coffee.

284
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:37,680
What’s up?

285
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,500
Don’t you “What’s up” me.
Where are you?

286
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,730
Bangkok.

287
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,740
Ai P’ Mut!

288
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,600
You really jumped onto the boat
and followed P’ Rak back?

289
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,420
Did you know the whole
island’s buzzing with gossip?

290
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,440
They say you eloped with P’ Rak.

291
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:56,640
Can you believe how many people
showed up at my place this morning?

292
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,700
Even folks from across the island rushed
over by boat to my place this morning.

293
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,520
I was baffled.

294
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,400
No matter how much you love money

295
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,800
I argued that you're not that greedy.

296
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,560
And why didn’t you take me with you?

297
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,180
I wanna go to Bangkok too, you know.

298
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,130
So, you’re calling me to say
you wanted to tag along?

299
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,240
Damn right!

300
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,110
You little shit.

301
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,240
When are you coming back?

302
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:25,680
Can’t say.

303
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,650
Haven't made any plans.

304
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,040
Are you really out of your mind, P’ Mut?

305
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,590
I’m perfectly sane.

306
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,360
By the way, Ai Palm.

307
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,220
Head over to my place.

308
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,410
I'll list out what I need.

309
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,830
I'll give you the address so
you can send everything to me.

310
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,290
You’re now living a fancy life
while I’m left behind.

311
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,260
I’ll wire you money.

312
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,930
Okay, alrighty then!

313
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,880
You’re the best, P’ Mut.

314
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,510
Alright, call me when you get there.

315
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,680
I’m going to the hospital now.

316
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:54,470
What?

317
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,020
Didn’t you say you weren’t crazy?

318
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,120
I’m completely normal.

319
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,520
But we’ve got a snoozy cat and
a paranoid mouse in the house.

320
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,350
I’m hanging up.

321
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,040
What do I do?

322
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,030
I won’t screw Khun Tongrak here.

323
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:01,940
Don’t use the word “screw”!

324
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,520
- Then…
- Don’t you say that word!

325
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,870
Don’t!

326
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,230
P’ Rak.

327
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,390
Wake up now.

328
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,360
You have a meeting to attend.

329
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,950
Don’t whine.

330
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,390
Get up now.

331
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,540
Come on, P’ Rak!

332
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,520
(Satapornbooks)

333
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,700
Oh, P’ Rak!

334
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,480
Please give it some more thought.

335
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,170
This is a serious matter.

336
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,400
Please, P’ Rak.

337
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,200
This is different from what P’ Connor did.

338
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,620
I admit I’ve heard that...

339
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,160
P’ Connor used to pay for sex.

340
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,490
But he did it occasionally.

341
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,340
And now he's already in a relationship.

342
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,070
But it’s still different.

343
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,120
You bought Mahasamut
from the South and took him in.

344
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,510
This isn't far from being occasional.

345
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,820
Now you’re responsible
for a complete stranger

346
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,290
and we don’t know if he can be trusted.

347
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:24,880
Kaimook.

348
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,790
The person Connor paid for is now his wife.

349
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,080
Do you think Mahasamut
will be the one for you?

350
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:38,980
No.

351
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,250
I’ve made up my mind.

352
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,000
Are you saying I made a bad move?

353
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:51,600
Well?

354
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,070
So, what are you going to do next?

355
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,540
I need my work schedule updated.

356
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,290
Got it.

357
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,890
Should I send it today?

358
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,350
The medical examination
report’s on the table.

359
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,230
Can you make sense of it?

360
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,230
No.

361
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,870
I've never taken this kind of test.

362
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,390
I’m clean.

363
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,840
It’s in case…

364
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,940
We’re out of condoms.

365
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,670
There’s nothing going on.

366
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,350
You have no idea
what P’ Rak's smile means.

367
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,410
You know nothing, Ai Mook! Nothing!

368
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,160
How about we try...

369
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,210
barebacking next time?

370
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,080
No way!

371
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,440
You absolutely can’t do that.

372
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,820
And who even talks
about this stuff in public?

373
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:22,060
Cut it out with all that dirty talk!

374
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,460
No subordinates want to
hear about their boss' sex life.

375
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,530
P’ Rak.

376
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,440
Can you believe him?

377
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,140
Please think twice about having
someone like him live with you.

378
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:38,970
You heard what he said to me.

379
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,280
I was speaking to Khun Tongrak,
not you, Khun Mook.

380
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,180
You’re really rude.

381
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,750
Let’s try it next time.

382
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:51,680
What?

383
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,390
Nothing.

384
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,750
You know nothing.

385
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,730
Okay, Ai Mook.
Pull yourself together.

386
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,240
You need to review all
the English contract papers

387
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,290
summarize them, and send them to P’ Rak.

388
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:12,900
Call the publisher to discuss
the cover design for the new novel.

389
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,370
P’ Rak wants a Chinese artist
with a sharp line art.

390
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,100
But…

391
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,100
Korean art is cute too.

392
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,000
I’m torn.

393
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,020
I’m going to shower.

394
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:26,640
I’m hot.

395
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,090
P’ Rak, don’t go.

396
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,560
Hey!

397
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:37,770
Look, Mister.

398
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,450
Who allowed you to use the kitchen?

399
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,160
I’m hungry.

400
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,460
If you don’t let me cook,
am I gonna have to eat raw pork?

401
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,000
Haven’t you heard eating raw pork
makes you lose your hearing?

402
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,850
That’s not what I meant.

403
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,400
Who eats raw pork anyway?

404
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,870
I mean, why aren’t you ordering takeout?

405
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,380
It’s cheaper to cook.

406
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,320
P’ Rak doesn’t eat this kind of food.

407
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,790
Why?

408
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,670
It's food too, you know.

409
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,170
Or does Khun Tongrak
live on oil instead of food?

410
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,580
Read through everything.
Ask me about the part you don’t get.

411
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:33,890
What’s this?

412
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,100
The cohabitation agreement
between P' Rak and you.

413
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,620
If there's anything you disagree with
or want to modify, just let me know.

414
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,010
Have you finally accepted me?

415
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,620
No.

416
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,640
But P’ Rak’s made up his mind.

417
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,600
The content mostly outlines
what P' Rak and you need to fulfill.

418
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,870
P’ Rak will be taking care of the expenses.

419
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,610
And you’re not allowed to do anything
that goes against P’ Rak’s wishes.

420
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,510
"The agreement will terminate
whenever Khun Rak wishes."

421
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,140
Does this part imply Khun
Tongrak’s and my relationship?

422
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:36,940
Yes.

423
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,970
What if I tell you that I refuse to go?

424
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:56,900
You can’t.

425
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,790
It’s been decided.

426
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,620
Which means…

427
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,700
Khun Tongrak can kick me out
whenever he's had enough of me.

428
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,310
You've got it right.

429
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,810
Apart from...

430
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:15,179
the mandatory requirements,
I can change anything for you.

431
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:19,130
P' Rak says if you want to
study, he'll support you.

432
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,010
Let me know if there’s
anything you want to do.

433
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,100
P’ Rak will back you up in everything.

434
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,989
But you absolutely mustn’t
neglect the mandatory requirements.

435
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,190
Especially the clause that forbids love.

436
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,100
Works for me.

437
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,699
Then let’s move on.

438
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:36,610
P’ Rak wants to know how much
compensation you’re looking for.

439
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,909
Do you prefer monthly or weekly?

440
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,400
P' Rak proposes to pay on a monthly basis.

441
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:44,770
Living expenses will be covered separately.

442
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,030
If there's anything else you need,
feel free to let me know.

443
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:52,630
These expenses won't be
deducted from your compensation.

444
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,620
Do writers typically earn high income?

445
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,250
P’ Rak isn’t just a writer.

446
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:08,440
He receives income from various sources.

447
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,640
I’m just rich.

448
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,940
Income from writing novels alone
doesn’t bring in that much money for me.

449
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,840
I make 100-200k at best.

450
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,310
New writers entering the scene
earn much more than I do.

451
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,500
Then why are you giving me so much?

452
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,640
Selling novels isn’t
my only source of income.

453
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,320
And more importantly…

454
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,900
I’m already well-off.

455
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,150
So?

456
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,000
How much do you want?

457
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:02,910
Any amount’s fine.

458
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,550
It’s up to you.

459
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,030
It’s settled then.

460
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:19,030
My friend’s officially
become a sugar daddy.

461
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,610
Oh no, Ai Mook!

462
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,350
Think.

463
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,020
What do I do?

464
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,250
P’ Vie!

465
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,580
What do I do?

466
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,500
P’ Rak bought some guy
and brought him along!

467
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,760
Really?

468
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,800
What an unusual souvenir this time.

469
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,500
This isn’t funny, P’ Vie.

470
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,050
He’s a man, as in a real man.

471
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,550
A live man in the flesh.

472
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,680
A man who’s got arms and legs.

473
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,490
The kind with the third leg?

474
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,450
P’ Vie!

475
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,160
It’s not funny at all.

476
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:09,910
Alright, alright.

477
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,970
I'm paying attention now.

478
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:13,200
What happened?

479
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,020
You went to pick Ai Rak up at the airport.

480
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:18,890
He showed up and surprised you by saying

481
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,300
“This is the guy I’ve brought with me.”

482
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:20,940
Right?

483
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,270
Yes.

484
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,510
My friend's such a badass.

485
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,770
This is no laughing matter, P’ Vie.

486
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,580
We don’t know who he is,
where he’s from, or what he’s like.

487
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,780
And… If…

488
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,100
What if he hurts P’ Rak?

489
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,260
What do I do?

490
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,150
I’ve left them alone in there together.

491
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,060
I’m so worried.

492
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,560
Ai Rak’s taken him in?

493
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,500
Yeah.

494
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,860
I don’t know what to do anymore.

495
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,670
I’ve got to see him.

496
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,840
Then I’ll be there tomorrow
after the set wraps.

497
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,200
Umm… Okay.

498
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,480
That’s Ai Vie, my friend.

499
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,320
I’m Mahasamut.

500
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,870
Sawasdee ka, Mr. Tongrak’s boy toy.

501
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,040
So, that’s my title now?

502
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,580
Are you saying it’s not?

503
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:21,980
It’s not.

504
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,740
You should call me
Daddy Tongrak’s sugar baby.

505
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,280
A more correct term.

506
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,140
You’ve got a good eye.

507
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,190
Thank you.

508
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,140
I guess I do have a few good
qualities, if I’m being honest.

509
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,100
I don’t see what’s good about you.

510
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:47,440
There, there, feeling jealous
that your brother got stolen?

511
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,600
That’s not what I meant.

512
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,170
Listen.

513
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,740
Don’t be sad, Mook.

514
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:59,570
It’s something us girls without
a third leg just have to accept.

515
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,340
P’ Vie!

516
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:06,190
P’ Rak, did you see?
P’ Vie’s teasing me again.

517
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:06,640
I’m not.

518
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,090
Ai Vie’s right, Mook.

519
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,530
I love you.

520
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,290
But as long as you don’t have…

521
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,270
I can’t love you like that.

522
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,630
P’ Rak, I’m not feeling like that with you.

523
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,730
Is it fun messing with me?

524
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,200
So, it means...

525
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,190
Khun Tongrak can love me.

526
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,180
Because I have that thing…

527
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:41,670
Khun Tongrak…

528
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,620
can love me.

529
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:51,740
Sick!

530
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,100
Loving me is easier than dumping me.

531
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,030
What’s it gonna be?

532
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,310
Ridiculous!

533
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:19,950
Nonsense!

534
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,730
Sweet dreams.

535
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,690
I want to ask you something.

536
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,710
I don’t sell my friend out.

537
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,270
And I don’t take shortcuts.

538
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,640
Then, ask away.

539
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,090
I want to buy some clothes.

540
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:48,920
Do you have any suggestions?

541
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,490
I came empty-handed.

542
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:58,720
And Khun Mook won’t let me
into Khun Tongrak’s room.

543
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,200
So, I couldn’t borrow anything from him.

544
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,690
What’s that got to do with me?

545
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:07,020
What will you do if I
end up disgustingly dirty?

546
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,210
Then why didn’t you tell me?

547
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,090
Would you buy them if I told you?

548
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:11,440
Oh.

549
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,370
It’s a secretary’s job.

550
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,170
No, it’s not.

551
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:17,310
Why does everyone assume
this job has to handle everything

552
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:19,690
including buying clothes for my boss’ man?

553
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,560
That's not part of my work.

554
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,250
It’s not.

555
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:23,790
It is.

556
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:24,990
- It’s not.
- It is.

557
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:25,970
Mook.

558
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,010
Go buy some clothes for Mahasamut tomorrow.

559
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:31,500
What?!

560
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:33,440
Me?

561
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,220
Yeah.

562
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,470
Who’s going to do it if it’s not you?

563
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:44,920
You specified in the agreement that I’m
responsible for Mahasamut’s well-being.

564
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,410
Or do you want me to buy them myself?

565
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,110
It’s settled then.

566
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,290
And you, Ai Vie.

567
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,140
You can go home if you want.

568
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,110
I’m sleepy.

569
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:02,780
Okay.

570
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,520
Hold on.

571
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:08,870
What else does he want?

572
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,710
I want…

573
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:16,360
I want underwear too.

574
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:17,740
What?

575
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,120
Un… un… un... underwear?

576
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:28,030
You heard him.

577
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,980
Underwear.

578
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:32,750
Underwear.

579
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,470
Oh.

580
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,440
Underwear.

581
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,950
Underwear.

582
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:49,410
Why do I have to buy them for you?

583
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,430
I’m leaving it to you.

584
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:54,090
Anything but underwear.

585
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,090
I’m free tomorrow.

586
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:57,440
I’ll go with you.

587
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,040
Okay?

588
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:37,580
What is it?

589
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,390
I’ve signed it.

590
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:47,890
Now, I’m all yours.

591
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:56,500
I want to talk about the deal.

592
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:00,940
The pay’s too low?

593
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:03,430
No.

594
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:05,630
It’s not about money.

595
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,800
If I understand correctly,
despite my lack of education…

596
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,600
It’s just the deal between us.

597
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,280
There won’t be anything more, right?

598
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,370
Now that you mention it.

599
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:27,950
Why did you say something like that?

600
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:32,380
I told you I don’t believe in love.

601
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:34,300
Not interested.

602
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:35,790
No faith in it.

603
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:38,060
I don't even believe it exists.

604
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:41,350
What's with all the talk about
me loving you or you loving me?

605
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:42,950
It’s pointless.

606
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:45,350
Between us…

607
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,570
There’s nothing more than sex.

608
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:02,990
I…

609
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:05,270
Umm…

610
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:07,020
Yes.

611
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,030
I know.

612
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:11,820
I know you don’t believe in love.

613
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,400
But that doesn’t mean I feel the same.

614
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,550
You can set the terms as you please.

615
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,860
Pay me as much as you want.

616
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:24,860
Have me do whatever you want.

617
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,340
But there’s one thing
you can’t dictate on paper.

618
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,040
It’s something you need to know…

619
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,530
before we start this new relationship.

620
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:46,970
You can't stop me from loving you.

621
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:54,350
But I’ll never fall in love with you.

622
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:56,470
Yes.

623
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,220
I know.

624
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,580
But you can’t stop me.

625
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:06,760
Take it as a heads-up…

626
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,790
before I make a serious move.

627
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,600
I figure kissing is allowed.

628
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:25,160
The agreement doesn't forbid it.

629
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:28,710
But you can’t do things I don’t like.

630
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,180
And did you like it?

631
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:40,010
Feel free to request my service any time.

632
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,480
I'll do my best.

633
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,050
If you have time…

634
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:55,780
Think about what I said.

635
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:58,440
I refuse.

636
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,010
You can’t force me.

637
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,190
What’s this love nonsense!

638
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:43,240
Actually, you didn’t have to come with me.

639
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,470
I can buy… on my own.

640
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:47,840
I didn’t come because of you.

641
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:49,260
I was just bored.

642
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,540
Then why aren’t you resting?

643
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:55,090
Didn’t you say you were tired from filming?

644
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:57,940
That was then.

645
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,550
Today's a new day.

646
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:07,760
By the way…

647
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:11,270
Your outfit totally gives
away that you’re an actress.

648
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,000
I’m not trying to hide, though.

649
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:17,730
Oh.

650
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:22,110
That way.

651
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:26,020
P’ Rak told me to buy
10 shirts and 10 pants each.

652
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,860
As if he wants the guy to
wear them until the next life.

653
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:31,830
He wants the guy to stay for the long term.

654
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,300
P’ Vie.

655
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:37,730
Do you think P’ Rak will
fall into that guy’s trap?

656
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:40,770
Can’t say about the trap.

657
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:42,620
But fall in love, maybe.

658
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,380
P’ Vie.

659
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,380
Be serious.

660
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:50,820
When I finally get serious,
you won’t believe me.

661
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:54,130
There, there, don’t pout.

662
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,340
Come on, let’s go shopping.

663
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:04,920

Yeah. Why?

670
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,450
I always buy this style for P’ Rak.

671
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,470
And who are you shopping for today?

672
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:27,810
You’re right.

673
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,410

P’ Vie!

679
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:45,700
P’ Vie.

680
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:47,160
Put it down.

681
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,160
Why are you embarrassed?

682
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,980
We have to buy it anyway.

683
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:54,210
What style do you want?

684
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:56,650
Briefs, trunks, or something else?

685
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:59,560
You’re a celebrity.

686
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:02,840
What would people say
if they saw you like this?

687
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,440
They’d say I’m so into my new guy
that I’m buying him underwear.

688
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:10,530
Stop it.

689
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,480
Come on.

690
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,530
- Hm?
- Let’s go that way.

691
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,610
I’m good at picking
men’s outfits. I’ll do it.

692
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:23,600
I'm sure he definitely won't
wear the clothes you pick out.

693
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,110
Huh?

694
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,040
- Here you are.
- Oh, thank you.

695
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:37,130
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

696
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:55,260
Excuse me.

697
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,150
Could you tell me what
those two women bought?

698
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,050
T-shirts, jeans, jackets.

699
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:03,690
All men’s clothing.

700
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,800
Is there a problem?

701
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:06,520
Oh, I just...

702
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:09,230
I want to know which ones they bought.

703
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,500
That was Khun Vivie, Veerapapha, right?

704
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,470
Can you show me what she bought?

705
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,680
Certainly. This way, please.

706
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,210
What are you doing?

707
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:38,090
Taking a shower.

708
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,650
As you can see, I’m making an omelet.

709
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,050
What about you?

710
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:49,670
Why did you come downstairs?

711
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:52,250
To do the laundry.

712
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:54,320
Someone like you...

713
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:56,460
know how to do it?

714
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:03,750
I’m hungry.

715
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:05,780
I see.

716
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:07,980
You’re hangry.

717
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:09,600
Would you like some?

718
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,480
No, I’m not gonna eat yours.

719
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,340
Good thing you’re saying no.

720
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:20,900
Nothing’s gonna come out of me.

721
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:22,620
Since I’m dead tired.

722
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:24,620
As for you…

723
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:28,820
Eat this instead.

724
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:32,820
I wasn't talking about...

725
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,480
Yours.

726
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,210
Dig in.

727
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,070
Before it gets cold.

728
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:42,650
What about you?

729
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,910
I was just about to cook another one.

730
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:47,560
This one’s too bland for my taste.

731
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:00,780
Eat up.

732
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:03,010
Khun Mook said you don’t eat spicy food.

733
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:04,470
It’s not spicy.

734
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:08,940
You can get angry again once you’re full.

735
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:26,440
Careful, it’s hot.

736
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,860
Is it good?

737
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,020
Well...

738
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:46,900
It's alright.

739
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:19,070
This isn’t a date.

740
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:21,100
I read one of your novels last night.

741
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:26,040
The ML took the MC out for lunch
and shopping and told him it’s a date.

742
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:27,990
Or do you have to kiss to call it a date?

743
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:29,180
I think I’d better get up.

744
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:33,180
I told you to rest, so do it.

745
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,610
Please stop teasing me, P’ Vie.

746
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,190
You know nothing at all.

747
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:39,410
I’m interested.

748
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,420
Because you’re the one I care for.
