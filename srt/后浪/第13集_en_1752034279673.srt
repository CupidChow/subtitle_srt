1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,120
For us to be the heir

4
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,400
is really difficult.

5
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,600
Taoists are particular about finding a disciple.

6
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,120
I agreed to let you take this course.

7
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,720
Not to help you, but to help myself.

8
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,600
I think that if there are too many in the class,

9
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,800
you will always find a disciple who is of your own faith.

10
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,720
You are willing to change the way of the Tao, and to inherit everything.

11
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,520
If that is the case,

12
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,640
then I can at least give my own master some advice.

13
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,320
As long as you have this wish, you will definitely succeed.

14
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,640
How good of you to say that.

15
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,720
Taoism Grandmaster

16
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,520
Can I have some beef?

17
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,720
Beef is fine.

18
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,320
I'm coming!

19
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,320
You are too tall!

20
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,120
Didn't we agree to meet at 7?

21
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,520
I can't go over there alone.

22
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:52,920
Here!

23
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,520
You can't go over there alone.

24
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,720
Here!

25
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,120
And then?

26
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,920
You haven't ordered yet?

27
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,520
I haven't ordered yet.

28
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,320
I'll do it.

29
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,720
Here!

30
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,520
Tianzhen, don't rush.

31
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,720
It's not that I'm rushing.

32
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,320
There are a lot of seafood.

33
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,920
We can change clothes.

34
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,920
Really?

35
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
Do you want to eat something?

36
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,520
Their crayfish is good.

37
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,720
Okay.

38
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,320
I'll get a crayfish.

39
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,320
There are a lot of seafood in our house.

40
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,120
Yes, seafood is very fresh.

41
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,920
Then you get me more seafood, okay?

42
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,520
Okay.

43
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,520
You can count our personnel.

44
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,520
Look, you still need to order other things.

45
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,120
That's why I came here first.

46
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,520
I was just brought in, but they didn't order.

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,320
I was waiting for you.

48
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,120
Because you were late.

49
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,520
The seafood is good.

50
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,120
It's so poisonous and fresh.

51
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,720
I've been looking for this place for a long time.

52
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,520
Why are you so late?

53
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,920
Look at him.

54
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
If it weren't for Xiao Lu,

55
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,120
I wouldn't have come.

56
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,520
What's wrong?

57
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,120
There's no electricity.

58
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,320
Hello, Xin Xin.

59
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,120
Let's go.

60
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,920
I'll give you a refill.

61
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
Is it a steamed bun?

62
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,320
Eat.

63
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,520
Boss.

64
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
Two skewers of steamed buns.

65
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,120
Three skewers.

66
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,520
I want it.

67
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:47,920
Really?

68
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,520
I want one, too.

69
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,120
Mengmeng wants one, too.

70
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,520
Four.

71
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,920
Five skewers.

72
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
Five.

73
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,720
Why is there someone here?

74
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,920
Tao Tao.

75
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,320
I can't do it, either.

76
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,520
I think I'll wait for a while.

77
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,120
Wait a minute.

78
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,720
No.

79
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,520
Zhao Yichuan, can you hurry up?

80
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,520
Oh, no.

81
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,920
I've been here for five times.

82
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,720
Tao Tao.

83
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,520
It's all your fault.

84
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,120
If it weren't for you,

85
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,320
I wouldn't have been in the bathroom so many times.

86
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
It's all my fault.

87
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,920
It's all my fault.

88
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,720
You should be happy.

89
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,120
Why don't you believe me?

90
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,720
I tell you.

91
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,920
You deserve it.

92
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,120
I didn't force you.

93
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,720
Hurry up.

94
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,320
Open the door.

95
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,120
Okay.

96
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,520
I deserve it.

97
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
I've been too much.

98
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,720
I'm going to the wild ground.

99
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,320
I'm going to the toilet.

100
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,720
Wild ground.

101
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
No.

102
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,320
Hurry up.

103
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,720
Hurry up.

104
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
Is it okay?

105
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
I know.

106
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,520
Oh, no.

107
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,120
This is a misunderstanding.

108
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,920
First Lord is not to beождения anymore.

109
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,920
Re мades all cases…

110
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,720
You are so late to call me?

111
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,120
Isn't he downstairs?

112
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,520
Why he didn't come back yet?

113
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,040
I'm all wet.

114
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
I'm all wet.

115
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,440
I can't. I'm so cold.

116
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,560
I'm so cold.

117
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,080
I'm so cold.

118
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,880
I'm so cold.

119
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,760
How are you?

120
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,600
Get better.

121
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,720
I'm cold.

122
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,560
You can't die.

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,560
There must be something wrong with the seafood today.

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,640
I ate it in the underground.

125
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,320
Why did it become like this?

126
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,600
There must be something wrong.

127
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,560
Did someone force you to eat it?

128
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,960
You guys.

129
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,120
You're all eating bad food.

130
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,200
Drink the Chinese medicine later.

131
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,160
Mr. Song.

132
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,000
We're in the Western Army.

133
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,440
Let's not work on it.

134
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,520
The anti-virus is ready tomorrow.

135
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,440
This medicine...

136
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,160
How long will it take to get better?

137
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,720
You can stop drinking it.

138
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,560
You can use the Western medicine to cure it.

139
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,280
I have something to say.

140
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,360
I have something to say.

141
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,000
It's already like this. What are you saying?

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,800
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

143
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,360
I can't wait until tomorrow.

144
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,480
Today at the barbecue shop,

145
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,560
I saw that crybaby.

146
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,400
It's that one.

147
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,640
The man who came in with you today.

148
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,880
The man who is very thin.

149
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,800
Listen.

150
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,880
We're pulling it like this.

151
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,240
He even ordered a table of seafood.

152
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,360
I saw the nutritionist's face.

153
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,400
It must be more serious now.

154
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,160
This meal.

155
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,400
Everyone thinks that...

156
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,000
Do you want to call and ask?

157
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,680
And Xing Xing.

158
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,800
Xing Xing also ordered a medicine.

159
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,120
What medicine? I don't know.

160
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,840
Give me one.

161
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,040
Here.

162
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,320
What is this smell?

163
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,560
Drink it while it's hot.

164
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,800
I...

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,360
This won't do. This is too bitter.

166
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,320
This is too bitter.

167
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,760
The medicine is bitter.

168
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,720
You went out to eat seafood.

169
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,520
And you ate it like this.

170
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,200
I stayed up all night to make medicine for you.

171
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,240
And it's bitter.

172
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,080
If it's bitter, don't drink it.

173
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,840
Just carry it.

174
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,760
Teacher Song.

175
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,400
We know we're wrong.

176
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,880
Thank you. I'm sorry.

177
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,360
Okay. Drink it quickly.

178
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,520
After drinking it, rest early.

179
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,600
You scared me.

180
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,920
I thought we would die this time.

181
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,120
I didn't expect that someone would scold you.

182
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,600
Everyone.

183
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,400
Don't be upset with your health.

184
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,360
If you can't handle it,

185
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,640
don't carry it.

186
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,960
Shen Ye.

187
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,520
Put your hand in.

188
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,240
Two than one.

189
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,280
Stop.

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,360
I need to go to my room quickly.

191
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,320
Rest for a while.

192
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,680
That's okay.

193
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
It won't go far.

194
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,560
That's okay.

195
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,400
Goodbye.

196
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,400
Goodbye.

197
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,440
Goodbye.

198
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,160
Goodbye.

199
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,880
Don't fight with science.

200
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,600
I'm not saying

201
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,160
Chinese medicine is bad.

202
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,720
It's just good and slow.

203
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,200
Don't you think so?

204
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,000
Don't you think so?

205
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,160
Give me one.

206
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,320
Zhenzhen.

207
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,360
Let's just forget about

208
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,120
the old men.

209
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,080
Mengmeng is so weak.

210
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,200
What if she has

211
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,320
some problems in a few days?

212
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,880
How will you explain to her parents?

213
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,600
Mengmeng,

214
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
do you still feel bad?

215
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,040
Mengmeng is in a low condition.

216
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,080
Okay, don't force him.

217
00:09:45,760 --> 00:10:01,040
That's why you want to

218
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,560
go with him?

219
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,160
Mengmeng is strong.

220
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,200
Even if he dies out of parchment,

221
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,840
he could secure his father's life.

222
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
You have no idea

223
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,520
what's going on

224
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
with Sun Ming.

225
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,300
How could I identify them with the two цMen?

226
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:29,680
My uncle

227
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,280
I'll drink it if it's not good.

228
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,040
I admire you.

229
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,760
You're really a good friend.

230
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,280
Well,

231
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,680
I won't persuade you.

232
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,120
I'll give you this as a reward.

233
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,160
If you really hang up...

234
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,840
It's the time to tell me the truth.

235
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,400
I don't mean that.

236
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,560
I have friends in the funeral.

237
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,480
I can't be wrong.

238
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,400
Burn it first.

239
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,320
I'll burn you.

240
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,400
I'll burn you.

241
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,840
I'll...

242
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,320
Be careful!

243
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,640
For my nephew and niece,

244
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,560
drink this.

245
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,440
Wait for me

246
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,120
Brother, you feel so cold

247
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:53,760
I feel oil

248
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,760
it is actually a very unique kind of food

249
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,800
The iron breaks my head

250
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,120
You can't tell

251
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,640
which one is the Chinese medicine

252
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,440
or Western medicine.

253
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,640
Which one comes faster.

254
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,920
Different samples.

255
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,760
You're so self-willed.

256
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,640
You didn't tell me the medicine.

257
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
I've found it.

258
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,960
Brother Tou, I'm telling you the truth.

259
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,560
Don't spread the news

260
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,520
that you're on Chinese medicine

261
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,320
and can't eat.

262
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,360
It'll kill you.

263
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,920
Many people don't understand

264
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,360
the small probability

265
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,280
as a way to resist the enemy.

266
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,800
You're so stubborn.

267
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,640
You can get pregnant

268
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
without Chinese medicine.

269
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,880
You don't know that

270
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,960
Brother Tou has a

271
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,200
drum machine in his stomach.

272
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,640
Even a wire

273
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,240
can't be blown into a steel flower.

274
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,120
What did your dad

275
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,200
call us for?

276
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,680
I guess it's about

277
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,800
Mr. Dong's magic class.

278
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,760
Magic class?

279
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,400
Let's go.

280
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Get up.

281
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,400
Is everybody okay?

282
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,080
Who else want to get pregnant?

283
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,160
Yunshun, we're better.

284
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,320
Much better?

285
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,280
Great.

286
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,240
Now let's talk

287
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,080
it over to me.

288
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,960
MustVINSAI

289
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,120
date,

290
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,920
date alone,

291
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,800
or I and you

292
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,800
clothing them together for合法

293
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,560
and get it in a good relationship.

294
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,960
It's谢谢 unused the instructions right.

295
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,320
I have you.

296
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,080
Tian.

297
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,720
Dad,

298
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,080
it's just spasms.

299
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,980
Dear I want to apologize

300
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,880
to your markedWarruf

301
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,680
You want to hairstyle

302
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,120
I understand

303
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,560
You most liked it

304
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,440
the hope of Chinese medicine.

305
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,440
What do you have to bear?

306
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,040
Hope.

307
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,640
If the stars and fire

308
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,840
are like you,

309
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,240
they can do whatever they want.

310
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,840
Then the Chinese civilization

311
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,240
would be like other ancient civilizations

312
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,840
and be cut off.

313
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,040
I have told you many times

314
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,640
what the time should be

315
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,840
and what to do and what not to do.

316
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,840
Are you not as smart

317
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,840
as your elementary school students?

318
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,640
Why is Chinese culture

319
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,240
so important?

320
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,840
You can't do it if you are smart.

321
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,240
You will be deaf after you learn it.

322
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,840
Now we are in a ten-person class.

323
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,440
Everyone is sick and sick.

324
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,440
How can you make people

325
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,840
believe that Chinese medicine

326
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,240
is a health-reliant?

327
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,640
Sir, I can.

328
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,400
I didn't.

329
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,800
I didn't say that.

330
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,000
I have always thought

331
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,200
that the inheritance of Chinese medicine

332
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,000
is our common goal.

333
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,600
But today,

334
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,200
it's just my wishful thinking.

335
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,800
If you really don't want to do it

336
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,000
and don't want to learn it,

337
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,400
I won't do it

338
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,600
in the ten-person class.

339
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,200
You are the ones who free me.

340
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,600
I don't need to hurt my mind

341
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,800
for the ten-person class.

342
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,200
Let's free each other.

343
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,600
Sir, it's unfair to me.

344
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,000
If they don't fit,

345
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,200
they can leave.

346
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,800
But I have been

347
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,400
doing it

348
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,000
according to your request.

349
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,800
I think I am

350
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,400
a very qualified student.

351
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,200
If the ten-person class is dissolved,

352
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,200
you should allow me

353
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,200
to continue learning from you.

354
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,000
I have told you

355
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,600
on the first day of class.

356
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,200
All the classmates in the class

357
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,560
are mirrors and thorns

358
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,160
between each other.

359
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,760
Look at them.

360
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,360
I look at you from their point of view.

361
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,560
You are not right.

362
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,560
I have persuaded them.

363
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,360
No one listens to me.

364
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,360
Now,

365
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,160
it's unfair to me

366
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,560
to let the only one

367
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,160
who has not made mistakes

368
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,360
to take responsibility with them.

369
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,760
Do you think you are right?

370
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,960
Why don't they listen to you?

371
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,320
You have studied a PhD, right?

372
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,120
You are a lawyer.

373
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,120
Why don't all the classmates

374
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,920
trust you?

375
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,920
How can you pass on the legacy?

376
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,720
I am not here to learn the legacy.

377
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,320
I am here to learn to live.

378
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,520
I am here to learn to live.

379
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,320
I don't care what others say.

380
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,520
Sir.

381
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,520
Sir.

382
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,280
Sir.

383
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,280
Well.

384
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,280
Yesterday,

385
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,480
I asked you to go with me.

386
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,280
Because

387
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,080
I wanted to have barbecue.

388
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,280
I asked you to go with me.

389
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,080
And it was my order.

390
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,280
So I think

391
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,880
it's because of my order.

392
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,480
It's not clean.

393
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,880
You want to take the responsibility.

394
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,480
Can you afford it?

395
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,480
Mr. Yu.

396
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,080
I called you here

397
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,480
not to make a mistake.

398
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,480
I am the monitor.

399
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,640
I didn't take the responsibility.

400
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,840
It's my responsibility.

401
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,840
Mr. Yu.

402
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,040
We all went there willingly.

403
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,240
I am also responsible.

404
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,040
I am also willing to be punished together.

405
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,840
Yes.

406
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,440
Yes.

407
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,440
We are all responsible.

408
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,640
We are all responsible.

409
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,640
The law is not a law.

410
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,040
If you want to fire,

411
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,440
you can fire together.

412
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,840
Sir.

413
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,840
You are the monitor.

414
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,240
You are the monitor.

415
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,440
You are the monitor.

416
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,840
You are the monitor.

417
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,240
It's really me.

418
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,840
It's my responsibility.

419
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,840
Sir.

420
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,640
Don't disband Shicheng Class.

421
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,440
They can be inherited

422
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,440
after they learn Chinese medicine.

423
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,840
I'm just a mouthful.

424
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,240
I know I'm not serious

425
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,640
and let you down.

426
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,240
Why don't you punish me?

427
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,000
You want to

428
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,800
put this matter

429
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,800
into action, right?

430
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,000
Okay.

431
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,600
It seems that I,

432
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,200
a small foodie,

433
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,000
can't be your big shark.

434
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,800
From now on,

435
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,600
you are not a student of Shicheng Class.

436
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,400
You can leave now.

437
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,000
I can't teach you.

438
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,000
You can't teach me.

439
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,400
Dad.

440
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,400
Don't follow me.

441
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,800
I have to work.

442
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,600
Where are you going?

443
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,200
I'm going to work.

444
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,400
I have something to do.

445
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,800
Where are you staying tonight?

446
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,800
Tianzhen can't go back.

447
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,200
How about this?

448
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,200
You move back to live with Xingxing.

449
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,200
I'll move the stuff.

450
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,400
I can't stay in your place.

451
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,600
Zhao Lixuan, are you stupid?

452
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,400
You have many people here.

453
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,000
You can live in peace.

454
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,600
I have a place to live.

455
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,600
You didn't lie to me.

456
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,400
Why would I lie to you?

457
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,800
I really have a place to live.

458
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,200
It's still a single room.

459
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,000
Listen.

460
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,400
You are the hope of your village.

461
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,760
You are a talent of the society.

462
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,760
You can live in many places.

463
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,160
You are going to be a doctor.

464
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,960
Don't live in those messy places.

465
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,560
Just live in Xingxing's place.

466
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,760
Don't care about other things.

467
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,160
I'm not one of you.

468
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,960
So I'm going to

469
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,560
wander around with Xiao Lu.

470
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,160
I'm leaving.

471
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,560
Go back.

472
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,360
I think

473
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,560
in the whole life,

474
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,560
as long as you don't harm people on purpose,

475
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,560
you deserve to be forgiven.

476
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,160
Like me.

477
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,360
I beat people to death.

478
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,960
But I have my own reasons.

479
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,360
I can't write it

480
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,360
in my own dark history.

481
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,400
Everything

482
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,360
should be done

483
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,760
with a bright angle.

484
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,160
I don't think

485
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,160
you should be like that.

486
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,360
You should be a good person.

487
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,360
I think

488
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,360
you should be a good person.

489
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,160
I think

490
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,760
you should be a good person.

491
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,360
You should be a good person.

492
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,960
You should be a good person.

493
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,360
You should be a good person.

494
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,360
You should be a good person.

495
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,760
Don't blame yourself.

496
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,160
I suggest

497
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,360
you learn medicine from me.

498
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,760
Learn Chinese medicine.

499
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,560
I really think

500
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,760
you have the talent to learn Chinese medicine.

501
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,360
Chinese medicine.

502
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,360
As long as you find the right disease,

503
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,760
save it out,

504
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,560
defeat it,

505
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,160
cure the patient's disease,

506
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,120
that sense of achievement

507
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,120
is much better than catching a doll.

508
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,320
You are really angry.

509
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,720
What's wrong with me?

510
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,720
Why did you recruit such a student?

511
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,120
He is your apprentice.

512
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,720
He is the apprentice

513
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,520
sent by God to you.

514
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,720
The master of the world.

515
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,720
Your master

516
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,120
is my apprentice.

517
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,680
Your master, my father,

518
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,280
he sent you such a student.

519
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,080
You should take him in.

520
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,280
Right?

521
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,880
You can't blame others.

522
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,280
Don't blame yourself

523
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,280
for not being able to

524
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,080
beat your apprentice.

525
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,680
Good job.

526
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,280
Good job.

527
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,680
I did my best.

528
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,840
It's not that I didn't take him in.

529
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,840
He didn't let me.

530
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,840
He didn't let me steal his clothes.

531
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,040
Enough.

532
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,240
I don't know you.

533
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,440
Don't be so arrogant.

534
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,440
Listen,

535
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,040
through what happened today,

536
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,840
I really

537
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,840
have a good eye for him.

538
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,640
He can be taken in.

539
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,000
He is really a good boy.

540
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,000
Really.

541
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,000
Look at him today.

542
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,000
He took the initiative

543
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,000
to admit his mistake.

544
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,000
I have carefully observed

545
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,000
the other kids.

546
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,400
In fact, each of them

547
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,600
has a bad look.

548
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,600
So this matter

549
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,600
is not really his fault.

550
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,200
Princess Taiping made a mistake.

551
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,200
Did he admit it?

552
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,960
Wu Zetian also said

553
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,360
it's a pity that he is not a man.

554
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,960
He is just a stone monkey

555
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,760
compared to the princess.

556
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,960
Since he is a stone monkey,

557
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,560
why are you so angry?

558
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,160
You should be more careful.

559
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,160
Look at him.

560
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,360
Look at him.

561
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,560
He is thinking

562
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,960
about the people

563
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,560
who are not important.

564
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,160
What is this?

565
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,160
It's related to him.

566
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,560
How many students did you say?

567
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,560
Why is there no one

568
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,760
who has this look?

569
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,960
What does it mean?

570
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,360
You have praised him twice.

571
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,160
It's related to him.

572
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,560
If you want to keep him,

573
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,160
call him back

574
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,160
and ask him to come back.

575
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,960
I won't.

576
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,360
If he doesn't come back,

577
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,160
our teacher-student relationship

578
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,160
will be like this.

579
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,560
You are against them.

580
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,160
How many people in the world

581
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,360
want to be my teacher?

582
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,560
I will go to beg him.

583
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,360
I am old.

584
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,760
Yes.

585
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,360
You are old.

586
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,360
I won't come back.

587
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,560
You are all gone.

588
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,560
We won't do this class.

589
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,160
You can also

590
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,360
go home and beg for money.

591
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,560
I can't do that.

592
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,160
If I can do that,

593
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,960
you wouldn't have married me.

594
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,760
Our division is very clear.

595
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,360
You are doing the housework.

596
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,360
I am outside.

597
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,960
I will do it.

598
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,760
You have done it.

599
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,360
What's the benefit?

600
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,760
Can you tell me?

601
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,960
I teach books.

602
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,560
I am a fisherman.

603
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,960
Although I am a doctor,

604
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,160
it's a good benefit.

605
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,760
But how many people

606
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,360
are there in the world?

607
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,560
Even if I have great skills,

608
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,160
I can't manage so much.

609
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,560
I have thought about it.

610
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,760
If I want to

611
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,560
find a famous doctor,

612
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,760
I will have one more hand.

613
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,960
I want to find three thousand famous doctors.

614
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,760
After so many years,

615
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,920
I haven't seen you

616
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,920
train some famous students.

617
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,720
Ten years of disaster

618
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,720
and a hundred years of survival.

619
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,120
I haven't lived long enough.

620
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,120
Enough.

621
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,320
What my father said

622
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,720
is right.

623
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,120
Do you know

624
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,920
what God wants you to fix?

625
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,120
Face.

626
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,720
You still can't

627
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,120
let go of your body.

628
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,720
It's because we

629
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,880
are all ashamed of you.

630
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,880
You took all the savings

631
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,680
to support the poor.

632
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,680
But my daughter

633
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,080
took her son back to the countryside.

634
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,680
Do I have to be ashamed?

635
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,080
Say it twice.

636
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,880
Okay.

637
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,480
Okay.

638
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,280
Let's not talk about this.

639
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,880
Let's talk about your resignation.

640
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,880
You are embarrassed to go back to school.

641
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,240
You want me to move things for you.

642
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,040
Do I feel ashamed?

643
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,640
No.

644
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,040
Look.

645
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,640
All the difficulties

646
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,640
you have,

647
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,040
you want me to go through them for you.

648
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,640
What is this?

649
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,640
This shows

650
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,240
God really wants to

651
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,440
put your face

652
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,440
on the ground

653
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,040
and wipe it.

654
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,640
Just wipe it.

655
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,240
If you can do it,

656
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,240
you can do it.

657
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,640
If you don't want

658
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,440
your apprentice to come back,

659
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,440
okay.

660
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,640
Then you

661
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,440
ask Liu

662
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,040
to find you a teacher.

663
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,240
He just wants to

664
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,840
do something with your name.

665
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,400
In this society,

666
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,000
there are many kids

667
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,000
who are doing things

668
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,200
for the sake of their parents.

669
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,600
What is this?

670
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,800
There are two sides.

671
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,600
If you don't want to,

672
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,600
you can find him

673
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,800
a person who wants to.

674
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,400
You are right.

675
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,000
He is not doing it for me.

676
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,200
He is doing it for Zhong Yi.

677
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,200
You are right.

678
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,000
It seems that God is helping me.

679
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,800
God or your wife?

680
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,200
God wants me

681
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,800
to marry you.

682
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,000
Say it five times.

683
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,000
God wants me to marry you.

684
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,000
God wants me to marry you.

685
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,400
God wants me to marry you.

686
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,800
God wants me to marry you.

687
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,000
God wants me to marry you.

688
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,400
God wants me to marry you.

689
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,800
God wants me to marry you.

690
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,000
God wants me to marry you.

691
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,400
God wants me to marry you.

692
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,800
God wants me to marry you.

693
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,800
God wants me to marry you.

694
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,800
God wants me to marry you.

695
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,800
God wants me to marry you.

696
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,080
Professor

697
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,680
it's a real treat today.

698
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,600
I didn't expect you would be so willing to help me.

699
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,000
Just you come alone?

700
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,000
Where are those investors?

701
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,040
You

702
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,600
are soquela, let me show you today.

703
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:35,600
I wanted you

704
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,920
Boss, actually, I've been wanting to ask you.

705
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,800
Do you really want to

706
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,000
be a Chinese doctor?

707
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,720
I don't understand.

708
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,440
So I want to borrow your name.

709
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,480
But you don't agree.

710
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,560
Borrow my name?

711
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,840
I have two legs.

712
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,040
What if I want to run away?

713
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,240
You're doing it for nothing.

714
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,520
Where are you going?

715
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,160
Who doesn't know that

716
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,680
you're a highly respected Chinese doctor?

717
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,400
Besides, I have a

718
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,080
passionate heart for

719
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,720
Chinese medicine culture.

720
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,320
I'm not kidding.

721
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,520
Really?

722
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,360
Okay.

723
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,680
I'm relieved.

724
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,880
Actually, I'm here today

725
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,640
to introduce you

726
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,960
a high-ranking Chinese doctor.

727
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,400
He's good for you.

728
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,960
What high-ranking doctor?

729
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,120
You'll know when you're here.

730
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,200
Sorry, I'm late.

731
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,640
I'm not a high-ranking doctor.

732
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,200
Let me introduce you.

733
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,080
This is the president of the Chinese Medicine University,

734
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,360
Wu Shandao.

735
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,400
President Wu.

736
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,040
President Dai.

737
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,920
President Dai.

738
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,840
This is Mr. Liu,

739
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,320
the Chinese medicine industrialist.

740
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,800
Mr. Liu.

741
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,920
Long time no see.

742
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,360
We'll talk alone

743
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,880
in the west room.

744
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:58,720
Okay.

745
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,440
I hope you'll be more careful.

746
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,480
I hope we'll have a good cooperation.

747
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,240
Thank you.

748
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,240
Sit down.

749
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:03,720
Come on.

750
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,520
Sit down.

751
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:04,920
Sit down.

752
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,480
Mr. Liu.

753
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,520
This is...

754
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:06,920
Come on.

755
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,080
I'm from Yunnan.

756
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,680
I'm from Yunnan.

757
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm from Su Long.

758
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:12,800
Come in.

759
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,160
Please tell me

760
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,720
the...

761
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,240
the direction.

762
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,400
Look.

763
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:23,880
The direction.

764
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,840
765558.

765
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,720
One more, please.

766
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,120
765558.

767
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:30,720
I can't see it well.

768
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,600
You can't see it well, either.

769
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,680
365558.

770
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,240
Okay.

771
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,960
I'll put it here.

772
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,880
I've been waiting for the food.

773
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,440
You know what, Mr. Liu?

774
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,440
Wu Yuan.

775
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,760
Come in.

776
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,240
Well.

777
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,160
You haven't

778
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,520
contacted Toto recently?

779
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,680
No.

780
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,120
Why don't you care about him?

781
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,440
You don't even know what he does.

782
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,560
He's your teacher.

783
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,560
He's your classmate.

784
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,920
He's your elder, too.

785
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,680
He's your student.

786
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,960
If you're interested,

787
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,120
why don't you ask me?

788
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:31,800
By the way,

789
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,040
you drove him away.

790
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,800
Since you drove him away,

791
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,400
he's not my classmate

792
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,520
or your student.

793
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,080
We're both concerned about him.

794
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,920
Don't we seem too much?

795
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,520
You're going to be a doctor in the future.

796
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,880
You've been in the family for so many years.

797
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,880
Your official ID

798
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,920
is not approved now.

799
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,280
It's far worse than Toto.

800
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,240
Dad.

801
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,440
If you have anything to say,

802
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,280
just say it.

803
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,680
Write your words.

804
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,360
Wait,

805
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,060
I'm afraid I twelve years old.

806
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,400
My attacks are painful.

807
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,480
I must learn to think color.

808
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,520
I'll sudden contact for a moment.

809
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,400
Piggy.

810
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,060
Piggy.

811
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,520
What happened?

812
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,480
What happened to him?

813
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,340
How did he react?

814
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,320
No

815
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:44,280
It's an

816
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,860
Deceiver

817
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,620
I'm sorry.

818
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,020
Uncle Tao.

819
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,100
Why are you still lying here?

820
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,100
I've seen you before.

821
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,060
How many times have I told you?

822
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,740
You still have to go to see him.

823
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,380
It's not a big deal to keep lying here.

824
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:04,660
It's okay.

825
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,660
I'll go to the hospital and ask Yaoyao to help me.

826
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,620
You're so kind.

827
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,260
Don't you have social security?

828
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,220
Are you stupid?

829
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,420
The company has transferred our social security

830
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,540
to other places.

831
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,060
It's useless to stay in Jiangzhou.

832
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,700
You can't drag it.

833
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,700
I've learned it before.

834
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,300
From my experience,

835
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,660
if you drag it,

836
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,060
you'll definitely leave a mark.

837
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,340
Stop talking nonsense.

838
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,060
It's useless.

839
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,460
This is your pen and ink paper.

840
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,340
Remember to wear it.

841
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,420
It's not necessary.

842
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,900
Do you think I can write after I leave?

843
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,700
You can't throw things you've used

844
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,620
away from me.

845
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,180
If you want to throw it away, throw it yourself.

846
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,700
Do you think people can't write even if they write it?

847
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,380
What is this writing?

848
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,180
Look at you.

849
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,060
Look at your handwriting.

850
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,100
Do you think they're like humans

851
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,740
I thought you were just trying to climb.

852
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,540
You can't even write with a pen.

853
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,540
You have to...

854
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,100
What are you doing?

855
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,700
I'm talking to you.

856
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,860
What are you doing?

857
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,820
Uncle Tao,

858
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,540
if you're free,

859
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,900
you can go back to rest.

860
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,420
I'm doing my homework.

861
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,860
You're doing your homework?

862
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,460
My master designed it.

863
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,420
My master said

864
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,860
I should practice like this for ten years.

865
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,900
After ten years, I'll be 32.

866
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,740
When I open the book and write the paper,

867
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,260
the patient will have confidence.

868
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,060
Do you know that?

869
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,100
Stop it.

870
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,460
I don't believe you'll send me a delivery for ten years.

871
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,060
You can even get a doctor's appointment ten years later.

872
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,380
Miss, let me tell you.

873
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,900
If you're the first person

874
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,780
who tells you about ten years later,

875
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,740
you're just acting.

876
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,740
Remember that.

877
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,140
You're quite serious.

878
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,460
I think

879
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,520
you're just a

880
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,900
girl with a heart of a dragon.

881
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,540
You're a delivery man

882
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,020
even if you write for ten years.

883
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,340
What's wrong with that?

884
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,460
That's different.

885
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,300
I used to be a busy delivery man.

886
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,740
I was poor and poor.

887
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,380
Now I'm a delivery man.

888
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,180
I'm poor and poor.

889
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,620
What does it mean?

890
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,620
When you're a girl,

891
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,660
you'll be happy.

892
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,660
You'll be happy with everything you do.

893
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,860
Do you understand?

894
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,060
Yes, I do.

895
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,580
You're quite reasonable.

896
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,900
People

897
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,140
have dreams.

898
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,060
Miss, let me tell you.

899
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,700
You must be careful

900
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,820
when you move the goods.

901
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,860
If you're like me,

902
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,940
you can't even send me a delivery for ten years.

903
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,620
I might not enjoy playing catch-up.

904
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,540
Nan breaking in for delivery.

905
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,340
I'm running out of time.

906
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,500
I have some Beef loaf supply.

907
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,020
Do you know

908
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,300
how to cook it well?

909
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,420
I just kitchen committed my last duty.

910
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,380
You have to take from the rest of the business.

911
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,380
Why do people say

912
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,180
you're travelling around,

913
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,060
but I fail in taking it.

914
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,540
You have to earn your salary,

915
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,220
but I fail in always keeping my promise.

916
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,380
You have to learn to pay me up,

917
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,380
and I have to l another labour inёл sign.

918
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,620
Are you kidding me?

919
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,620
You're an old man.

920
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,020
You're an old man.

921
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,620
You're an old man.

922
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,900
Why are you here?

923
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,140
Well,

924
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,500
I have a friend.

925
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,860
He has a backache.

926
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,340
Can you check him out?

927
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,940
Check his patient number.

928
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,860
Can you check him out first?

929
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,260
Because

930
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,540
he has no money.

931
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,900
He has no money, either.

932
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,620
But I'll pay him back

933
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,100
for this money.

934
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,740
Do you know how much I paid for the treatment?

935
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,820
Your salary for a month.

936
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,340
So expensive?

937
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:35,980
Didn't you say

938
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,940
the treatment of the disease

939
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,700
is forced to be prescribed by God of Mercy?

940
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,460
The heart of the first-born death

941
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,260
I said I had no money.

942
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,300
Can't I take advantage of it?

943
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,740
I can't just do it.

944
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,340
It seems that Chengdu is really useful every day.

945
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,220
It's a good place for us to go.

946
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,340
I know he has no money.

947
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,900
But I know you have money.

948
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,780
I don't have money.

949
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,060
Why don't you have money?

950
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,620
If you have no money,

951
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,060
the facts will come to you.

952
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,740
This money

953
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,460
is nothing to you.

954
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,220
Master, I was wrong.

955
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,260
I didn't study hard.

956
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,460
I was too lazy to pay attention to others.

957
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,100
I misled the class style of the first-born death.

958
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,060
You're still so stubborn.

959
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,820
You want to carry this thing to the end, right?

960
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,460
Okay.

961
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,060
Pay the medical fee first.

962
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,060
Then bring your friend in and let me see.

963
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,900
Can you see the person first?

964
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:50,780
Then pay the money separately, okay?

965
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,060
Do you think this is a good place for me?

966
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,380
You're quite talkative.

967
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,300
Say it.

968
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,140
It's amazing.

969
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,140
It's amazing.

970
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,100
It's okay.

971
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:04,660
You...

972
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,460
Look at me.

973
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,300
Does it still hurt?

974
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,300
Look.

975
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,060
It's okay.

976
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,100
I understand.

977
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,100
Thank you.

978
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:10,700
Thank you.

979
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,220
You're welcome.

980
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:11,860
Mr. Gao,

981
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,460
can you teach me that?

982
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,580
Because I have many colleagues.

983
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,020
They all have problems with their back.

984
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,700
When you teach me,

985
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,940
I'll go back and massage them.

986
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,540
Yes.

987
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,460
I'm afraid I still have a lot of work to do.

988
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,260
I'm sorry.

989
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,020
I'm sorry.

990
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:22,780
I'm sorry.

991
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,540
I'm sorry.

992
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,380
I'm sorry.

993
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,140
I'm sorry.

994
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:25,940
I'm sorry.

995
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,860
I'm sorry.

996
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,620
I'm sorry.

997
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,460
I'm sorry.

998
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,420
I'm afraid I can't teach you now.

999
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:03,140
There will always be some youth

1000
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:07,940
that has no regrets when meeting.

1001
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:13,420
There will always be some people

1002
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:17,220
like the stars in the long night.

1003
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:21,980
Time is silent.

1004
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:26,740
Memories are remembered.

1005
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:32,380
The food and drinks in memories

1006
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:35,580
are warm and equal.

1007
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:40,300
If there is no pain in life,

1008
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:44,140
I will light a city for you.

1009
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,780
People in the light

1010
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:50,060
are just ordinary identities.

1011
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,780
Light ordinary people's souls

1012
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:56,180
with ordinary bodies.

1013
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:59,500
Burn a city of passion.

1014
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,260
We are just ordinary people

1015
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:05,660
in this world.

1016
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,900
People in the light

1017
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,660
are just ordinary identities.

1018
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,460
Light ordinary people's souls

1019
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:15,020
with ordinary bodies.

1020
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:18,340
Burn a city of passion.

1021
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,060
We are just ordinary people

1022
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:24,500
in this world.

1023
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,780
We are just ordinary people

1024
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,300
in this world.

1025
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,860
Burn a city of passion

1026
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:37,180
with ordinary bodies.

1027
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,900
We are just ordinary people

1028
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:42,740
in this world.
