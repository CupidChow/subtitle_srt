The Untamed

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You're so good at serving me.

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You must be very considerate.

5
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Grandpa, I told you I don't want to eat.

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Look.

8
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're not eating.

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You're feeling down.

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Are you sick?

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm not sick.

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I said you're sick.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm sick.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm experienced.

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm sick.

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm so worried.

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
How can you talk about this?

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sure it's Ke'ing.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Who is she?

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Who?

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Who is she?

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Don't guess.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You're wrong.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Fine.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll ask you directly.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Did you confess your love to her?

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Does she know your feelings?

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I understand.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
How is it?

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You're afraid your mom won't agree.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Why should I be afraid?

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
My mom will definitely disagree.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Okay, let's not talk about this.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Come and eat.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
While it's hot,

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll secretly leave you the best essence.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This is the stomach bone.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And with yogurt.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Nutritious.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Perfect.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Don't let down her heart.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Come on.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
She's a little cold.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Come on.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Okay.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You're young.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You're very kind.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You don't believe it.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Take her home.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Leave early.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Maybe I'm a bad person.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't need you to say that.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're a kind kid.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Last time,

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
you liked that girl.

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
To be honest,

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
your mom is very sad.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You have to find her a matchmaker.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Am I getting married or she?

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If you don't believe her,

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
how can you get married?

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Then I'll be single.

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I've checked your son's mouth.

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm sure he's a good man.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That girl is the one

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
who has the same taste as your grandson.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Ling Lan can't accept this.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No one can accept it.

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Ling Lan is not that naughty.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If it goes on like this,

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
my grandson will be single forever.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What's wrong with being single?

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We don't have a king to succeed.

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This...

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I haven't heard you sing for a long time.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You seem to be in a good mood.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Here, add some hot water.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Add some wine.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Contact Mr. Tu tomorrow

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and ask him to have a meal.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Let him wear a hat.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I suggest you

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
ask for his opinion first.

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If he doesn't cooperate,

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
you'll be treated for nothing.

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Isn't it just a meal with Uncle?

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'll talk to him.

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Just have a meal.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Give him some respect, okay?

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Mom, I know your heart.

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I have someone in my heart.

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't waste your energy.

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Then you just suffocate him in your heart.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The address has arrived.

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
This is Mr. Wu.

139
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This is Mr. Wu.

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He is looking for me.

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Sit down.

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Newly-wed couple

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,760
President Lin,

144
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,800
Unless you sign these mimics,

145
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,640
it will not work.

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,720
Are you serious?

147
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,320
I feel in tears

148
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,360
when I heard

149
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,360
the development team

150
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,680
came back to China.

151
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,800
What did you bring back?

152
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,960
Something important.

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm not embarrassed.

154
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Listen,

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
when I was your age,

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I was even poorer than you.

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I was so

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
shy at that time.

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I didn't dare to

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
confess my love to the girl I liked.

161
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I was afraid of being rejected

162
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
and I was afraid of delaying others.

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But I was thinking,

164
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
if you really

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
have a big demand

166
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
for the medical profession,

167
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
it's not a long-term plan

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
to do the treatment.

169
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So I was thinking,

170
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I should introduce you

171
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
to be the medical representative.

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'll tell Mr. Zheng,

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
who needs our cooperation,

174
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
that I took you there last time.

175
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You've seen him, right?

176
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'll say hello to him.

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
How about it?

178
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What's wrong?

179
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Do you have any concerns?

180
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Mr. Wu,

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
my brother is in high school

182
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
in the town.

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He has to spend a lot of money every year.

184
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Now he's in a hurry.

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
My dad has a stroke

186
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and can't get out of bed.

187
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So I can only

188
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
stay outside.

189
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I still have to thank you for your kindness.

190
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But I may not be

191
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
qualified to be a doctor.

192
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm different from Tianzhen.

193
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't have any resources

194
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
or connections in this city.

195
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't think I can buy it.

196
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Don't worry.

197
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
We Han people

198
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
don't have connections.

199
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But we can fight, right?

200
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
There's no winning or losing in this world.

201
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
A person,

202
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
whether he's

203
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
a man of the capital,

204
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
or a man of the land,

205
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
he has to work hard on his own.

206
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What's the connection?

207
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
If you have a sweet tongue,

208
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
you can be more diligent.

209
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You can make connections.

210
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Don't worry.

211
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But I have a piece of advice.

212
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I hope you don't

213
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
be the representative of the whole system.

214
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You have to spend time

215
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
on learning.

216
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I believe you.

217
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I also hope you can become

218
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
a great doctor in the future.

219
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The real Ni Tang

220
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
can't meet

221
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Kunpeng's dream.

222
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I remember

223
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
how you were in school.

224
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
If I remember correctly,

225
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
you were the new representative,

226
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
right?

227
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I was impressed

228
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
by your speech.

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
From your speech,

230
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I can feel that

231
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
you are a person

232
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
who is passionate about medicine.

233
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Don't waste it.

234
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

235
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's hard to roll.

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yes.

237
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Is it hard to roll?

238
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's hard to roll.

239
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's hard to roll.

240
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Good.

241
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Tao Tao,

242
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
you can do it.

243
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm a little bit emotional.

244
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I know.

245
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Not bad.

246
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Uncle is here.

247
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Hello, everyone.

248
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Hello, Mr. Dong.

249
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Hello, Mr. Dong.

250
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's good here.

251
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You can go to class

252
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
and see a doctor.

253
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You can also follow

254
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Mr. Dong's method.

255
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I will also

256
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
have a class here tomorrow.

257
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I will also

258
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
have a bed

259
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
when the method class is over.

260
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Tao Tao,

261
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
press the sun line

262
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
on this master.

263
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
He is a person

264
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
who is passionate about medicine.

265
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
He is a man of great power.

266
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
He must be

267
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
a man of great power.

268
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Okay.

269
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Tao Tao,

270
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
when the bed is empty,

271
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I will also

272
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
have a class with your uncle.

273
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Okay.

274
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I have no luck today.

275
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I brought someone here

276
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
to tell you something.

277
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Who is it?

278
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Mr. Dong.

279
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Li Quan is back.

280
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You heard it.

281
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Okay.

282
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Hurry up.

283
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Change your clothes.

284
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
See who is free.

285
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You two

286
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
get a blanket

287
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and practice.

288
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Is Li Quan okay at home?

289
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
He is fine.

290
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I have solved it.

291
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Everything is fine.

292
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You are his mentor.

293
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
He is closer to you.

294
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Of course.

295
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So every time I see him,

296
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I will think of

297
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
the past me

298
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
who can help me.

299
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yes.

300
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I have something to tell you.

301
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You must come

302
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
to the school committee

303
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and the military committee this year.

304
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I don't go every year.

305
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I will go this year.

306
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I knew you would say that.

307
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Forget it.

308
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
This year is different.

309
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This year,

310
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
the female student committee member

311
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
in our class

312
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
is the female student.

313
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Do you remember?

314
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The key is

315
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I heard

316
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
she contacted

317
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Xiaobai Ling.

318
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
My dad has a girlfriend.

319
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
This is Xiaobai Ling.

320
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Be careful.

321
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
No, that...

322
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Your neck is broken.

323
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
No, it's too slippery.

324
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Dad is not a good teacher.

325
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
This is it.

326
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That's it.

327
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You can click

328
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
in the Qiong Guang

329
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
and sign up.

330
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Okay, bye.

331
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Take care, sir.

332
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Okay.

333
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Okay, that's it.

334
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What?

335
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Go.

336
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Go to my office

337
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
and get my phone.

338
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I don't need to stay.

339
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I can do it later.

340
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You don't need to care.

341
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I can do it myself.

342
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Go.

343
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Can you?

344
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Go.

345
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Why are you leaving?

346
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I have something to do at school.

347
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'll come next time.

348
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Uncle.

349
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Wu Shandong

350
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
has come

351
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
to arrange something for you again.

352
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The class reunion.

353
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Class reunion?

354
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yes.

355
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You never attend it.

356
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I never attend it.

357
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You must go there

358
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
after 30 years of graduation.

359
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'll tell you.

360
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Don't go.

361
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Toto.

362
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Come.

363
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Then...

364
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Come here.

365
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Send these to him.

366
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Okay.

367
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Go to work.

368
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Class monitor.

369
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
My phone is shaking.

370
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Can I answer it?

371
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Hello.

372
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Hello, mother Lele.

373
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Who will pick up Lele

374
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
today?

375
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Didn't grandma go?

376
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Lele.

377
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I can't hold it.

378
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Mrs. Zhang.

379
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Mom.

380
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm sorry

381
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
for keeping you waiting.

382
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I didn't

383
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
communicate well

384
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
with grandma today.

385
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's okay.

386
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I called grandma

387
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
but she didn't answer.

388
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I thought there was something urgent.

389
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So I called you quickly.

390
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Really?

391
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Then

392
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I called her

393
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
to try it.

394
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Okay.

395
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Doctor.

396
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Our old man is getting old.

397
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You should give him

398
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
a bed.

399
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You should take care of us.

400
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What if he gets cold?

401
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Doctor.

402
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Hello.

403
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Grandma.

404
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Shouldn't you

405
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
pick up Lele today?

406
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Why didn't you come?

407
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Grandpa

408
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
was buying

409
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
a car for Lele

410
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
on the way down.

411
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm in the hospital now.

412
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Today

413
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm giving Lele to you.

414
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Is it serious?

415
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I lied to you.

416
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I said it was a fracture.

417
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm going to the hospital.

418
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But

419
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I don't have a bed now.

420
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm waiting for a bed.

421
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Then I'll take Lele

422
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
to see grandpa quickly.

423
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
No, no, no.

424
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Don't come.

425
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Lele's father went on a business trip.

426
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm alone in the hospital.

427
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You said you came.

428
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I have no way

429
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
to take care of you.

430
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Don't come.

431
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You take Lele

432
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
to see your dad.

433
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Okay, okay.

434
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm hanging up.

435
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Bye.

436
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I have to go to the bathroom.

437
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You wait for me.

438
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm hanging up.

439
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm here to help you find a

440
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
housemate.

441
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Hello, Miss.

442
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I have something to bother you.

443
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What's wrong?

444
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Mengmeng?

445
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You want to see my phone,

446
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
just say it.

447
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Who wants to see your phone?

448
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I saw you

449
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
looking so sad.

450
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Did Mengmeng get hurt?

451
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What's wrong?

452
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
She didn't contact me

453
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
after she came home.

454
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I didn't even

455
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
send her a message.

456
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You're disappointed?

457
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm worried about her.

458
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm worried about her.

459
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm worried about her.

460
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm worried about her.

461
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm worried about her.

462
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm worried about her.

463
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm worried about her.

464
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Why are you worried?

465
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Her parents.

466
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Will Mengmeng

467
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
be controlled

468
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
by her parents again?

469
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Xiao'er,

470
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I have a good plan.

471
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Do you want to listen to it?

472
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Say it.

473
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Change the secret.

474
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What secret?

475
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Your dad's.

476
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Little white face.

477
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
No way.

478
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Why are you like this?

479
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You don't want to sacrifice

480
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
your dad's woman

481
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
for your own woman.

482
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Besides, that's not your mom.

483
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Who's my woman?

484
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
How can I not know?

485
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Let me tell you.

486
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I heard from Wu Shandong today

487
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
that your dad

488
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
immediately got a phone.

489
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I thought this was

490
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
not right.

491
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm not sure.

492
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What you said may be true.

493
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What does Xiao Bailing

494
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
have to do with the phone?

495
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Don't worry.

496
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's a long story.

497
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Anyway,

498
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
tell me about

499
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Xiao Bailing.

500
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'll tell you

501
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
how to get Mengmeng out.

502
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You talk about Mengmeng first.

503
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
If you really decide,

504
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'll tell you right away.

505
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Okay, I'll talk first.

506
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's a deal.

507
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's a deal.

508
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Didn't your grandpa

509
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
have a habit

510
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
of drinking summer juice?

511
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
We'll use the body as oil.

512
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
With this oil head,

513
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
his parents

514
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
can't say anything.

515
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Mengmeng

516
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
can be taken out

517
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
naturally.

518
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Right?

519
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Summer juice?

520
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Smart.

521
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
If you don't say it,

522
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'll forget about it.

523
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Say it again.

524
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You're so smart.

525
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Little brain.

526
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Stop!

527
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Can you touch

528
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
my little head?

529
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Mom.

530
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Is it more comfortable

531
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
lying down?

532
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's okay.

533
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Look at the room.

534
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's so noisy.

535
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's killing me.

536
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's so noisy.

537
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Don't move.

538
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
No, no.

539
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Don't move.

540
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Why are you here?

541
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's okay.

542
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Lele,

543
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
you left her alone at home?

544
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
How could that be?

545
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
She's with a good friend of mine.

546
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Don't worry.

547
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
How is your grandpa?

548
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Mom.

549
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'll run with you.

550
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Mom.

551
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
There are so many people.

552
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
There are no double rooms

553
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
or three rooms here.

554
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's too crowded here.

555
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
We can't even

556
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
put down the bed.

557
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What about you tonight?

558
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Who knows?

559
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You can stay here

560
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
until afternoon.

561
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I know.

562
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Let's go.

563
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
We can only eat

564
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
some water today.

565
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Don't cry.

566
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Don't cry.

567
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Hello, Ren Shi.

568
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Can you

569
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
help me with

570
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
the housework?

571
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Grandma,

572
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I want to go home.

573
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Thank you.

574
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I want to go home.

575
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's here.

576
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Don't move.

577
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I want to go home.

578
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Be patient.

579
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I want to go home.

580
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I want to go home.

581
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I want to go home.

582
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I want to go home.

583
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I want to go home.

584
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I want to go home.

585
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
This room is much better.

586
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
No one lives in the bed

587
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
in the middle.

588
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
If you're tired

589
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
at night,

590
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
you can rest here.

591
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I asked the nurse.

592
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
There's one in the hospital.

593
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'll help you find one.

594
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The meal is in the canteen.

595
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I've already

596
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
ordered a meal for you for a week.

597
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
If you can't walk,

598
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
the nurse

599
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
or nurse will help you.

600
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'll get some hot water.

601
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Thank you.

602
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Don't move.

603
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You're welcome.

604
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's my duty.

605
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I told you not to move.

606
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You're the one who drew it.

607
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Your son is really good.

608
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
My ex-husband

609
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
has divorced my son.

610
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Ex-wife?

611
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
He divorced your son

612
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
and he's so nice to you.

613
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Is there something wrong

614
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
with your son's eyes?

615
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
He's afraid that

616
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'll ask my grandson back.

617
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So he's acting well.

618
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Madam,

619
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
listen to me.

620
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
If you're going to court,

621
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
you can't ask your grandson back.

622
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Who are you?

623
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You're his grandmother.

624
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Who is she?

625
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
She can't be your grandson.

626
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Who is she?

627
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
She's his mother.

628
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
He's trying to help you.

629
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You can say that

630
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
he's not a good person.

631
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You...

632
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What else can I do?

633
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
He's just a son-in-law.

634
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
He's busy

635
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and he's running around.

636
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What's he after?

637
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I've got the water.

638
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I bought a new towel.

639
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
If you need anything,

640
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
call me anytime.

641
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Lele is still young

642
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
and she can't help you now.

643
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'll just

644
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
send a filial son

645
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
for Lele.

646
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'll go now.

647
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You're so unlucky.

648
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yes.

649
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You're so unlucky.

650
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You talk too much.

651
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'll go now.

652
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Is that her?

653
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I just sent it

654
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,840
I'm sorry.

655
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,000
It's wind,

656
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,440
fire,

657
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,600
rain water.

658
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,360
Is there ice,

659
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,640
snow,

660
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,000
and dew?

661
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,440
Hong,

662
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,880
you know me best.

663
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,400
What are you waiting for?

664
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,400
I'll deal with this medicine myself.

665
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,640
This is the closest

666
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,200
to the world of the monster.

667
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,760
I'll go with you.

668
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,160
The pharmacy is my territory.

669
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,280
Wait.

670
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,680
Are you really going to drink this with Jianxi?

671
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,040
Of course.

672
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,640
This is the treasure

673
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,640
that so many people

674
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,760
have been looking for.

675
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,640
Of course.

676
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,720
Why don't you eat?

677
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,440
Li Chuan,

678
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,400
enough.

679
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,760
Let's go.

680
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,440
I'll go and have a look.

681
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,120
It's okay.

682
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,480
Please tell me, Mr. Ren,

683
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,560
what kind of tools

684
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,560
do you need to make a bowl of wate?

685
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,840
You have the nerve to ask me?

686
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,720
You've been learning for so long.

687
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,640
What have you learned?

688
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,800
Anyway, we can't use

689
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
plastic bowls

690
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,480
or stainless steel bowls.

691
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,720
What kind of method is this?

692
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,160
Tangsir.

693
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,040
Let's use wooden plates.

694
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,280
I think wooden plates are the most reliable.

695
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:07,960
Okay.

696
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,880
Wait a minute.

697
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,680
That...

698
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,040
Tongzi urine.

699
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,880
I'm sure it's not.

700
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,720
Why are you looking at me?

701
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,200
No.

702
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,760
Why are you looking at me?

703
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,560
I can see

704
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,560
that you look like Tongzi.

705
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,320
No.

706
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,240
You don't look like Tongzi.

707
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,880
Tongtong.

708
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,200
Tongzi means a child.

709
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,560
I know.

710
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,840
How can I not know this?

711
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,840
I mean, you three

712
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,560
go and find Tongzi urine.

713
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,320
Understand?

714
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:37,840
Yes.

715
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,360
Right?

716
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,440
Go. Go. Go.

717
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,520
You put it here.

718
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,800
Go. Go.

719
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,480
Tongzi urine.

720
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,280
Okay?

721
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,720
Choose this Tongzi urine strictly.

722
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,360
Okay.

723
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,240
What are you doing here?

724
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,200
I'm here for your reputation.

725
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,840
If this news is out,

726
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,880
you will be in trouble.

727
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,920
Nonsense.

728
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,920
Sir.

729
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,640
I'm telling you.

730
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,720
Think about it.

731
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,480
Open or close?

732
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,080
Grandma Jiang found a bowl

733
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,680
that is more than 300 years old.

734
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,520
Take it back.

735
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,280
Counselor Hong is at the door of the toilet now.

736
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,400
Waiting for the child to pee.

737
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,480
It's still closed.

738
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,640
Then we should close it.

739
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,440
I'm not a poor teacher.

740
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,560
I am free.

741
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,960
I'mм pretty sure it's been 300 years.

742
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,360
So you trust your grandma Jiang.

743
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,600
Ferenc atti was looking for you.

744
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,160
It's 300 years.

745
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,880
The certificate and the copy of the seal.

746
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,400
And the second certificate.

747
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,520
Grandma Jiang was afraid that people would be suspicious.

748
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
So she went to the spy agency.

749
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,160
She didn't run away for 300 years.

750
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,360
Okay, master.

751
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,080
I'm afraid that you won't believe it.

752
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,320
So I recorded a video for you.

753
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,440
Have you seen it?

754
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,400
Here's more.

755
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,640
How much does it cost?

756
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,640
It's not expensive.

757
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,480
Grandma Jiang's three-inch snake is not rotten.

758
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,680
It's small and sharp.

759
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,240
It's for nothing.

760
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,160
I didn't expect that Grandma Jiang

761
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,160
is so reliable.

762
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,440
This 300-year-old frog,

763
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,920
if we knew it earlier,

764
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,400
we would have brought it back

765
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,640
and put it back.

766
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,960
If we let it go,

767
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,440
it would be a flying fish.

768
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,320
Yeah.

769
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,400
But this frog...

770
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,480
Wake up.

771
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,000
Is that what you're talking about?

772
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,640
What's wrong?

773
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,320
What's wrong?

774
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,920
You're the master. You ask me?

775
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,000
Of course I ask you.

776
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,800
You're so smart.

777
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,960
I don't know medicine.

778
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,400
How can I fool them?

779
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,240
You're the master.

780
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,560
You're so smart.

781
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,600
If the radish is hurt,

782
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,440
it won't take this much effort.

783
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,320
You've been here for so long.

784
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,920
Tell you,

785
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,800
it's nothing.

786
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,440
You'll have to

787
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,680
deal with hurt and injury.

788
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,320
哦

789
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,360
Dig a hole.

790
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,200
Breakибz and

791
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,040
spl해주 uo

792
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,520
I'm so happy.

793
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,600
I'm so happy.

794
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,560
Are you talking about the machine?

795
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,320
What are you talking about?

796
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,480
You're about to be in the play.

797
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,320
But it's full of...

798
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:52,840
It's...

799
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,160
It's full of people.

800
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,440
I'm so excited.

801
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,240
It's a miracle.

802
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,200
You're still here

803
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,560
enjoying yourself.

804
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,560
What should I do?

805
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,040
Why are you asking me again?

806
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,240
Do you know what I can do?

807
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,160
You should have told me

808
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,160
that you shouldn't have lied to me.

809
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,840
Enough.

810
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,320
It's useless.

811
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,960
Do as you want.

812
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,120
It's easy to play.

813
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,560
But what about the smell?

814
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,200
I've been playing for 21 days.

815
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,680
How can I find the bread?

816
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,360
It's easy.

817
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,840
I'll add some wafers.

818
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,480
I see.

819
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,320
Be careful.

820
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,280
Boy.

821
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,560
I find it easy from my mom's hand.

822
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,200
We were born Eastern China.

823
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,160
Look at you.

824
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,760
You're like a boy now.

825
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,960
You're more like a girl if you act like a boy.

826
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,000
You're tired.

827
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,760
Get out.

828
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,640
Can I do it?

829
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,040
How can I do it alone?

830
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,280
I'm here to help you.

831
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,440
It's too big.

832
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,640
It's okay.

833
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,880
I can do it alone.

834
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,000
You shall all leave.

835
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You can go back to your work.

836
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,640
Go back to your work.

837
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,040
Miss, I'll stay. Don't worry.

838
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,080
Well, let's go.

839
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,400
Only Sun Tou Tou can

840
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:32,580
take care of this kind of

841
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,780
Miss Xia, don't worry.

842
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,500
Don't worry.

843
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,540
Go to the toilet.

844
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,740
Okay.

845
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:50,980
Is it okay?

846
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,860
Before we start,

847
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,300
I have something to tell you.

848
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,980
But you have to make sure

849
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,140
that the sale is as good as the product.

850
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,260
Okay.

851
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:08,860
Here is how it works.

852
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,220
What about you?

853
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,460
Aren't you worried about Cinnamon,

854
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,660
or your son,

855
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,020
how should we deal with this?

856
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,380
That's why

857
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,140
you are swapping plants

858
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,420
with me, right?

859
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,580
No. I have to tell them the truth.

860
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,340
Go!

861
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,580
Just tell me.

862
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,580
Tell Jian Xi and Xia that there's no hope.

863
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,580
You can only be like this for the rest of your life.

864
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,060
Just tell me. I've wanted to say it long ago.

865
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,420
I've been holding it in for too long.

866
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,580
You think I'm thinking about something?

867
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,380
I'll admit it if I say it.

868
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,980
Okay. Say it.

869
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:06,420
Xiao à Dường

870
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,300
Silly.

871
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,700
Second-简选 or the west wing.

872
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,540
It's all human nature.

873
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,300
You don't have the heart to say it out well, right?

874
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,140
This is on I wanted.

875
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,940
Do you know that if we don't do this,

876
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,660
Jianxi may die from starvation

877
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,340
and may not live until now?

878
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,860
It's a terrible thing

879
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,220
to have no hope.

880
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,660
But if Jianxi takes this medicine,

881
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,700
it won't work.

882
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,980
She'll die of starvation.

883
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,540
Yes.

884
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,660
But Master said

885
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,420
life is like turning a hill.

886
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,220
This slope is turned over.

887
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,020
There's another slope.

888
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,500
But we have to find a way

889
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,140
to cross this slope first

890
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,580
before going to the next slope.

891
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,780
This slope would be a long way back.

892
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,500
It's quite short.

893
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,900
Say this only once

894
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,900
but never return.

895
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,260
Never return.

896
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:32,180
Really

897
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,060
Then you can go

898
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,500
A little skillful

899
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,120
One firmly

900
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,000
Gu Leave

901
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,900
Don't wait

902
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,420
W designated

903
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,340
going

904
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,220
Shifu

905
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,020
Why should this Summer Drink

906
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,100
This soup

907
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,060
In the summer

908
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,060
This soup

909
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,740
In a year,

910
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,900
there are two very important seasons.

911
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,140
One is summer,

912
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,540
and the other is winter.

913
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,020
These two days,

914
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,300
are the triggers of the change in the world.

915
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,500
It's especially important for men.

916
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,620
For example,

917
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,620
people who want to be tired from the soup,

918
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,660
they usually drink summer soup,

919
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,500
and winter soup.

920
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,900
Is there any benefit to drinking this?

921
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,660
Let me give you an example.

922
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,660
If you want to

923
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,820
make a person's life

924
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,500
a lamp,

925
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,780
then you should drink summer soup,

926
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,820
and winter soup.

927
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,980
Then you should go for the lamp.

928
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,700
Go for it.

929
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,940
So you just said

930
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,540
there are benefits for men,

931
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,540
but not for women?

932
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,980
Of course.

933
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,420
Look.

934
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,940
Every month,

935
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,300
we women

936
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,260
have a meeting.

937
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,460
So,

938
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,580
we have more opportunities

939
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,340
to rest and rest.

940
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,540
I don't think so.

941
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,740
I think men and women are the same.

942
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,740
Because I read in the book that

943
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,180
spring is deep,

944
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,540
autumn is deep.

945
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,260
Actually,

946
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,460
every day is a meeting.

947
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,700
Only to hold on to this meeting every day,

948
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,420
it's okay to rest and rest

949
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,460
every day.

950
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,340
Well,

951
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,540
Congdong is

952
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,260
really a smart little monkey

953
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,860
I never know.

954
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,020
He is a big world expert.

955
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,660
Always challenges under his master's shoes.

956
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,260
They make sense.

957
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,020
Give me valence.

958
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,540
I'll keep working.

959
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,900
The soup is burning.

960
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,180
When did you sleep last night?

961
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,260
Wasn't we sleeping together?

962
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:54,780
of the

963
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,300
n screw loose

964
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,500
this

965
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,300
You forgot

966
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,540
us

967
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,900
What came back

968
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,180
and then slept

969
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:09,700
That fucking

970
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,740
What matter

971
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,180
Let's eat, let's eat

972
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,180
Really can't say it to you

973
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:17,940
remember

974
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,180
Fir orbital also called

975
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,660
Summer Lake Soup

976
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,240
Know this O nin

977
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,240
There are

978
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,920
plaster, semen,

979
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,600
rice, and dried grass.

980
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,400
Do you know what the effect of the soup is?

981
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,400
It's a medicine to reduce heat.

982
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,000
But what does it have to do with watermelon?

983
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,800
Because it's summer.

984
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,400
Summer is the summer heat.

985
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,400
In the summer,

986
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,400
people start to play the air conditioner,

987
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,400
drink cold drinks,

988
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,800
wear shorts, and walk barefoot.

989
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,000
The other day,

990
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,000
the director of the city council told me

991
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,000
that modern people

992
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,560
don't have any signs of coldness.

993
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,760
Wrong.

994
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,760
In fact, modern people

995
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,960
are more likely to get cold than ancient people.

996
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,360
Especially in summer.

997
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,760
Summer is the time to grow.

998
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,560
What's wrong with sweating?

999
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,160
So modern people

1000
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,960
don't go to work.

1001
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,560
They hide in their rooms and play the air conditioner.

1002
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,560
Some people are very young.

1003
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,160
They start to have wealth and wealth.

1004
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,320
Do you know what wealth and wealth are?

1005
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,320
Our ancients used to work in the field.

1006
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,720
When they sweat,

1007
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,320
the cold air goes out.

1008
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,120
If it's about to get hot,

1009
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,320
they eat two pieces of watermelon and it's over.

1010
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,320
Only the owner of the field

1011
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,920
has a maid behind him.

1012
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,920
They start to climb the mountain.

1013
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,120
It's not hot.

1014
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,720
The cold air is all on their foreheads.

1015
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,520
So it's called a rich bag.

1016
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,720
If you don't want to feel pain,

1017
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,120
or have a headache,

1018
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,320
you should pay attention to it.

1019
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,320
You can't get cold.

1020
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,120
If you have a stomachache,

1021
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,920
it means you can't wear a long vest.

1022
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,920
It's like you can't wear a long vest

1023
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,120
all the time.

1024
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,520
You must wear a long vest with a three-pattern tape.

1025
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,320
No.

1026
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,120
It's summer.

1027
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,520
Why don't you wear a short vest?

1028
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,280
It's hot.

1029
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,480
The heat is the cause of the sun.

1030
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,080
The oxygen is on top.

1031
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,480
You just need to keep the oxygen.

1032
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,080
After the sun is in the air,

1033
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,880
the temperature of your body will increase.

1034
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,480
The basic temperature of your body will increase.

1035
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,280
Even if it's 0.5 degrees,

1036
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,080
your body won't feel hot.

1037
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:42,880
Okay.

1038
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,680
The watermelon is ripe.

1039
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,080
Let me see.

1040
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,840
Don't eat too much.

1041
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,840
It's edible.

1042
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,440
It's edible.

1043
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,440
Just a little.

1044
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,840
Please try it.

1045
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,040
Why don't you let us see him?

1046
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,840
We can't let him do everything.

1047
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,440
Our problem before was too bad.

1048
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,640
He's a sick child.

1049
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,800
You can't treat him like this.

1050
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,200
So I don't want my child

1051
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,400
to be a sick child forever.

1052
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,000
He's been well at our home.

1053
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,400
Why does he have problems when he comes home?

1054
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,600
Is it appropriate for an 18-year-old girl

1055
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,200
to be out every day?

1056
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,200
Mr. Xu.

1057
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,400
Let me remind you.

1058
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,800
This is called a prison.

1059
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,200
You can call the police.

1060
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:53,460
Let's make this momentczy

1061
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:01,800
Let's make this moment

1062
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,800
Digital literacy

1063
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,680
and doctorate

1064
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,520
You and me

1065
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,160
We are in the same place.

1066
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,080
This youth

1067
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,960
is getting more complete.

1068
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:34,560
Missing you is happening.

1069
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,040
There are always people

1070
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,400
who deserve to be crossed over mountains and rivers.

1071
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,280
We're getting IPH-11FE years out.

1072
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,840
Yes, it's true.

1073
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,440
I have to admit

1074
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,080
that you're totally mine.

1075
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,640
I already sa ver your beauty,

1076
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:09,080
hearing and using away my feelings,

1077
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:13,080
I'll wait for you to come back.

1078
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,080
There's always someone

1079
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:19,080
who's worth crossing mountains and rivers to complete.

1080
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:24,080
We'll share our years and stars together.

1081
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,080
I'm sure.

1082
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,080
Who are you?

1083
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,080
I admit

1084
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:37,080
I'm not wearing the clothes that are so heavy.

1085
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:41,080
I'm already trapped in your eyes.

1086
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,080
The feeling of love is so fast.

1087
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:51,080
The fate of the dream.

1088
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:57,080
The God of Cat.

1089
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:12,080
The God of Cat
