00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Untamed

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,760
Now we're in front of Mr. Huang's tomb.

4
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,200
Let's read the Great Book of Worshipping.

5
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,200
Dear immortals,

6
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,560
there's someone behind you.

7
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,000
You're not changed at all.

8
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,160
You're just a wounded man.

9
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,840
It's the wisdom of martial arts.

10
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,400
Great Book of Worshipping.

11
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,080
You read it.

12
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,920
Can he understand?

13
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,280
If you read it,

14
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,360
can he understand?

15
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,680
He can't.

16
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,800
In this case,

17
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,400
I think Xiyi should be better.

18
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,520
At least Xiyi

19
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,880
is not so mysterious.

20
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,400
Look at you.

21
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,480
We also have to swear.

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,000
The Swear of the Cipucaradi.

23
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,320
Okay.

24
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,560
You all have the same.

25
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,600
Swear is for yourself.

26
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,360
Just like when you get married.

27
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,040
Say,

28
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,080
I will love you for a lifetime.

29
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,320
I will love you for a lifetime.

30
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,960
In the end,

31
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,160
it's also a lie.

32
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,160
Have you ever been to the tomb?

33
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,280
Have you ever attended

34
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,800
any ceremony?

35
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,920
Do you want others to be in front of your tomb

36
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,240
so casually?

37
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,760
I don't have a family.

38
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,000
So I haven't been to the tomb.

39
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,600
I'm an orphan.

40
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,240
I grew up in a welfare home.

41
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,240
I haven't seen this kind of ceremony.

42
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,560
The biggest ceremony I've ever attended

43
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,760
is every time on the opening day,

44
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,040
every child is holding a red head.

45
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
Sitting at the gate,

46
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,120
waiting to raise parents

47
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,440
to adopt us.

48
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,520
Later,

49
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,840
obedient children were adopted.

50
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,880
Incompetent children were also adopted.

51
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,040
Even the sick children

52
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,800
were adopted.

53
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,120
No one wants me.

54
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
For me,

55
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,720
my closest family is

56
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,840
the welfare home.

57
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,560
Take care of my aunt.

58
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,120
Tao Tao.

59
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,120
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,280
Rebecca doesn't know

61
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,400
your background.

62
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,840
I was just kidding.

63
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,440
You...

64
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,320
Is it fun to lie to others?

65
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,160
What else can you do

66
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,960
besides lying to others?

67
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,880
You're a child of the Pugong family.

68
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,760
You're a mother.

69
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,000
We all have

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,400
our own families and ancestors.

71
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,680
Even if you don't understand

72
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,280
or agree with us,

73
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
will you keep your silence?

74
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,920
Or do you think

75
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,760
everyone will sympathize with you

76
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,440
and pity you?

77
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,920
I don't need to pity.

78
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,640
I don't need to sympathize.

79
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,800
I just think...

80
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,840
What do you call this?

81
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,480
It's a superstition.

82
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,440
Do you know?

83
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,160
A group of people

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,960
take a bunch of things

85
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,960
and put them here

86
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,640
for the people who passed away.

87
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,400
Do you know that

88
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,000
there are many people

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,840
who can't eat

90
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,680
or drink anything?

91
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,880
Do you know

92
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,600
what it is for me?

93
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,080
It's a waste of food.

94
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,600
I really don't understand

95
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,080
what you people think.

96
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,200
If you go to this war,

97
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,120
you'll be a teacher.

98
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,040
What?

99
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,280
You can only know it.

100
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,600
I don't know

101
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,520
what it is.

102
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,240
The first thing to do is to be honest.

103
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,400
The first thing to do is to be honest.

104
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,880
What's the point of praying there?

105
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,400
I'm not my own family.

106
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,920
What's the relationship?

107
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,400
The first thing to do is to be honest.

108
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,040
The first thing to do is to be honest.

109
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,280
There are people who are different from others.

110
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,920
They are different from others.

111
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,880
So there is no need to be different.

112
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,520
This slope is quite steep.

113
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,240
You come here every year.

114
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,480
We come here every year.

115
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,240
You all come here?

116
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,480
This year is much earlier than last year.

117
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,040
No.

118
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,920
Every year,

119
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,880
you come here earlier than me.

120
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,280
Yes.

121
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,240
Thank you.

122
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,560
The food is ready.

123
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,360
We can have lunch now.

124
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,960
Thank you.

125
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,720
Mr. Song.

126
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,880
These are your father's patients?

127
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,120
They are all villagers in the nearby village.

128
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,120
They know that we come to the mountains to sweep the tomb every year.

129
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,200
So they clean the room in advance

130
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,120
and cook.

131
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,000
My parents also take this opportunity

132
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,120
to show you their health.

133
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,440
It's good.

134
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:46,880
Let's go.

135
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,120
This is still the same as before.

136
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,240
I tell you.

137
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,400
Three times a day.

138
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,000
Half an hour after that.

139
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,320
Three times a day is good.

140
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,480
It's very effective.

141
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,000
OK.

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,600
Thank you.

143
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,280
Thank you.

144
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,800
When I was waiting for the delivery,

145
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,760
I put a lot of tribute there.

146
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,680
Professor Ren, don't worry.

147
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
You can't waste it.

148
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,040
When life is difficult,

149
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,120
I remember that no one took it home as a food.

150
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,200
Although the tribute is

151
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,600
to the ancestors,

152
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,280
it's a souvenir.

153
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,360
It's better than

154
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,680
what we usually eat.

155
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,800
Can we waste it?

156
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
How is it now?

157
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,520
Now,

158
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,400
I have to say,

159
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,960
it's like the New Year.

160
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,360
It's like the beasts in the mountains.

161
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,280
The beasts in the mountains?

162
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,640
Tongtong,

163
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,000
listen to what that big brother said.

164
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,960
Do you have any worries?

165
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,160
Can't sleep?

166
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,760
Three times a day.

167
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,800
I'm tired during the day.

168
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,600
Relax at night.

169
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,680
You're not relaxing.

170
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,240
You're committing suicide.

171
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,720
The sacrifice

172
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,040
is just a kind of ritual.

173
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,240
It's a kind of

174
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,320
gift to the ancestors.

175
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,760
A kind of feeling.

176
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,240
You can't waste

177
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,320
the fruit and snacks

178
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,520
you care about.

179
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,120
What is superstition?

180
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,600
It's like you don't do anything

181
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,120
and wait for the cake to fall in the sky every day.

182
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
Actually, we should

183
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,000
do good deeds.

184
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,280
What is that?

185
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,240
It's called righteousness.

186
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,040
Tongtong,

187
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,400
remember

188
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,360
every word I say.

189
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,760
It's not much better than last time, right?

190
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,720
No.

191
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,920
Last year, after you told me,

192
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,560
I didn't eat anything.

193
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,160
I don't even dare to drink.

194
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,840
You must hold on.

195
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,680
I'm not.

196
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,080
I'm not trying to scare you.

197
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,520
If you keep going like this,

198
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,280
your liver will be broken.

199
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,080
Really?

200
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,720
Plus, you smoke and drink.

201
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,640
You must sleep

202
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,720
before 11 o'clock.

203
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,600
Okay.

204
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,680
Okay.

205
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,280
Come on.

206
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,160
What time do you sleep?

207
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,120
There's no time to sleep now.

208
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,680
I'll go to sleep.

209
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,280
Okay.

210
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,480
Can you look at this?

211
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,560
Let me see your fetus.

212
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,080
How do you write fetus?

213
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,240
Li Qiong,

214
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,640
tell him how to write fetus.

215
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,200
It's not a big problem.

216
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,400
You should have treated your illness

217
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,760
with one prescription.

218
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,800
Did you remember it?

219
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,000
I did.

220
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,280
I didn't say it.

221
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,840
Ten o'clock, disconnect the network.

222
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
Treat the sickness?

223
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,440
Yes.

224
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
Treat the sickness?

225
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,520
Sickness.

226
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,360
Remember.

227
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,080
After ten o'clock,

228
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,760
don't do anything.

229
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,520
Go to bed and sleep.

230
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,080
If you sleep well,

231
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,200
and stick to it for three to six months,

232
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,120
you'll be almost cured.

233
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,120
Professor Ren, you're really funny.

234
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,040
What era is it now?

235
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,440
Who sleeps at ten o'clock?

236
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,480
You should pay attention to

237
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,320
sleeping early and waking up early.

238
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,640
It's very important for your health.

239
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,720
Sleeping is also a medicine.

240
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,760
Professor Ren,

241
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,360
the ancients sleep day and night.

242
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,080
But the average life is only more than forty.

243
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,800
It seems that sleeping early is not bad.

244
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,400
Don't listen to him.

245
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,200
He likes to wake me up.

246
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
The rain has stopped.

247
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,840
The meal is ready.

248
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,880
Let's eat.

249
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,840
Let me do it.

250
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,520
Thank you, doctor.

251
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,160
Let me do it.

252
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,800
Stand up.

253
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,840
Sit down.

254
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,880
Okay.

255
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,720
Let's eat.

256
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,120
Sit down.

257
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,680
Sit down.

258
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,520
Let's eat.

259
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,360
Doctors are happy and proud.

260
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,760
This is the will of the gods.

261
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,560
What the gods don't do

262
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,760
is the original intention.

263
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,720
Explain it.

264
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,880
Just say it.

265
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,760
It's fake.

266
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,360
If there is a person with a pain in the room,

267
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,880
the whole room will be unhappy.

268
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,160
The pain will continue to follow.

269
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,440
Especially doctors like you.

270
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,680
You care about yourself at this time.

271
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,560
Are you full?

272
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,360
Are you happy?

273
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,840
This is the will of the gods.

274
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
Do you understand what I mean?

275
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,640
What's wrong, Tangtang?

276
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,240
Here, open your mouth.

277
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,280
Linglan.

278
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,000
Did you bring the brown sugar and ginger?

279
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,600
Yes.

280
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,880
It's cold.

281
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,240
You can't let the girl

282
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,080
go out.

283
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,360
Listen.

284
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,720
From today on,

285
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,160
you have to wear socks every night.

286
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,560
After you go back this time,

287
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,240
you have to drink the golden soup for half a month.

288
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,440
Brother Lu.

289
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,920
I made you a bowl of chicken soup.

290
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,520
It's still hot.

291
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,680
If you don't drink it, I'll drink it.

292
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,440
I want to drink it.

293
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,520
You keep it for me.

294
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,720
I'll drink it in a while.

295
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,160
Where can I keep it?

296
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,760
Peng Shiyan.

297
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,560
We share the same fate.

298
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,840
We should do what we should do.

299
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,680
He drank my chicken soup.

300
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,960
Calm down.

301
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,040
He drank my chicken soup.

302
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,200
He didn't leave me any food.

303
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,480
I left it for you.

304
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,120
Mom.

305
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,720
Chicken soup?

306
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,400
Brown sugar water.

307
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,280
Okay.

308
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,280
Here.

309
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,280
You drink the brown sugar water first.

310
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
Then I'll make you steamed.

311
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,720
Yanzhen.

312
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,920
Give me my steamed.

313
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,720
Okay.

314
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,800
I'll give you this.

315
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,280
It's okay.

316
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,880
Thank you.

317
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,640
Have some soup.

318
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,520
Let me warm my hands.

319
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,600
He's so smart.

320
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,560
He didn't read the book of the past few years.

321
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,760
He really did it.

322
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,920
He never forgets it.

323
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,200
He just said it out.

324
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
We share the same fate.

325
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,360
We should do what we should do.

326
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,040
In fact,

327
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,880
we have to go through two stages in our life.

328
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,960
One is the sense of existence.

329
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,400
The other is the sense of belonging.

330
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,360
He doesn't have the sense of belonging.

331
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,040
So he tries his best to be present

332
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,120
and let himself feel it.

333
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,520
In fact, he's not the type to be blind.

334
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,680
Yes.

335
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,480
I hope we can

336
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,080
help him find the sense of belonging.

337
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,840
Okay.

338
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,520
Hurry up.

339
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,640
Have some soup.

340
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,280
Later,

341
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,440
you can go home

342
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,080
and rest in the car.

343
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,880
Have some soup.

344
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,840
I don't want to.

345
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,320
Shao Ying.

346
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,320
No.

347
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,720
The weather in the mountain

348
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,880
changes every day.

349
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,600
Don't catch a cold.

350
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,760
Don't worry.

351
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,960
You must get cured.

352
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,600
You'll see less

353
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,520
of the pneumonia.

354
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,200
I know.

355
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,240
Go home and rest.

356
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,120
I've got the course list.

357
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,960
From today,

358
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,880
we'll have a closed course

359
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,520
in WeChat.

360
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,200
But before that,

361
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,680
we've talked about

362
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,320
the real Chinese medicine

363
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,280
and the real acupuncture.

364
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,560
From today,

365
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,240
we'll read the classics

366
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,560
and get in touch with the sages

367
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,120
to develop the habit of studying.

368
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,560
As you know,

369
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,880
the moon rises in the spring.

370
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,520
The sky and earth are full of life.

371
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,120
The moon rises early in the night.

372
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,920
The sky is full of life.

373
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,360
The sky is full of life.

374
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,680
The sky is full of life.

375
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,520
March is the season of life.

376
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,960
So we'll use this chance

377
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,440
to grow in the air.

378
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,440
So,

379
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,240
we must obey the moon

380
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,640
to rise early in the night.

381
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,400
Master.

382
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,200
May I ask

383
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,480
if there's a standard time

384
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,400
for the night and the morning?

385
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,880
The ancients paid attention to the time.

386
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,440
The time for the sun and the moon

387
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,400
is from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.

388
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,760
During this time,

389
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,680
the moon sleeps the sweetest.

390
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,680
I think it's the best time to sleep.

391
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,880
If the students

392
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,760
still don't sleep at this time,

393
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,800
it's not good.

394
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,360
I know that

395
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,760
it's hard for them

396
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,760
to get up early.

397
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,960
So,

398
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,680
we can sleep

399
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,320
at 11 a.m. at the latest.

400
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,600
But remember,

401
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,480
you must get up at 5 a.m.

402
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,360
You must start studying and practicing.

403
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,480
But the weather forecast says

404
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,120
the average temperature of the air

405
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,320
will be about 10 degrees

406
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,520
before entering the spring.

407
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,240
The air temperature in the mountains

408
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,120
hasn't entered the spring yet.

409
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,120
And the cold air is so strong in the morning.

410
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,520
It's worse than our health.

411
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,800
Remember,

412
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
the temperature is not the key

413
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,560
to change the weather forecast.

414
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,360
For example,

415
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,480
this student is thinner.

416
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,400
No matter how many clothes he wears,

417
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,880
he looks very fat.

418
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,800
But he's actually still thin.

419
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,560
As we all know,

420
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,280
the weather forecast says

421
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,320
the temperature will be about 10 degrees before entering the spring.

422
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,400
Sometimes it's colder than winter.

423
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,640
But the weather forecast says

424
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,320
the air temperature will be different.

425
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,040
I see.

426
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,320
He can't see or touch it.

427
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,720
How do you know if he's here or not?

428
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,360
What did you say?

429
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,280
Air?

430
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,560
Can you feel the oxygen?

431
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,680
Don't you breathe?

432
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,000
Today,

433
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,360
we're going to start reading

434
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,880
the Emperor's Inner Sutra,

435
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,800
the Quick Question.

436
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,480
After reading

437
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,200
the Four Seasons, the Four Devils, and the Great Lessons,

438
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,840
students will know

439
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,280
what it means to be angry.

440
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,440
The sun appears early in the mountains.

441
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
All of you please remember

442
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,760
that Japan Enshouü need to beлось

443
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,880
the first city of spring.

444
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,760
In order to start today,

445
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:32,300
we'll start our

446
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:32,860
No.

447
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,420
I hope that from now on,

448
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,420
every student must have

449
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,980
a clear mind.

450
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,020
Can you not

451
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,020
take your phone?

452
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:41,940
No.

453
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,220
Take your phone.

454
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:44,620
Why?

455
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,380
Okay, monitor.

456
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,020
Lead the students to start

457
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,860
reading the capital of the camp.

458
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,900
The Four Seasons of the Great God.

459
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,740
The Four Seasons of the Great God.

460
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,260
Second,

461
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,180
in the third month of the spring,

462
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,700
the purple position is eight times,

463
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,460
the heaven and earth are full of life,

464
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,180
everything is in full bloom,

465
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,140
and wood and land,

466
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,940
night and flora and fauna,

467
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,780
inside and out.

468
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,900
Feather and paper.

469
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,180
One betrothed,

470
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,900
without a slaughter,

471
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,460
without healing.

472
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,420
Defe萬世ед listing

473
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,380

00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,140
Restaurant Leng.

477
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,700
Why am I here?

478
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,460
Why do I come?

479
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,020
Shi.

480
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,340
Ye Lin,

481
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,180
great that the Double T enorme

482
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,640
then what?

483
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,400
There must be a premier in Asia that could defend our democracy

484
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,740
and we shouldn't just let the kids die easily.

485
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:28,060
'm again

486
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:29,780
Okay.

487
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,820
Excuse me,

488
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,740
are you here to see Professor Ren?

489
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,140
He has very

490
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,140
good mid-astipiej.

491
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,100
So we are taking him here.

492
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,220
That's really not anhoppy.

493
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:50,860
He took his student to

494
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,100
H Standards.

495
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:52,980
He'll be back

496
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,980
in at least a week.

497
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,060
I'm his wife.

498
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,340
And I am a doctor, too.

499
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,180
How about I show the baby first?

500
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,100
What is wrong with him?

501
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,180
It was my birthday that day.

502
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,340
He ran out

503
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,420
to buy me a cake

504
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,740
and say he wanted to give me a surprise.

505
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,700
He was waiting for the red light

506
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,700
at the intersection.

507
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,740
He was so desperate.

508
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,940
He ran over me

509
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,740
like crazy in a car.

510
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,940
Dr. Song,

511
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,940
I'm sorry.

512
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,940
Why is my life

513
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,860
so miserable?

514
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,060
His father left early.

515
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,540
I was the only one who took care of him.

516
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,020
I was afraid that he would suffer.

517
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,460
I didn't look for him.

518
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,460
I didn't even try to persuade him.

519
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,260
He was so desperate.

520
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,220
I don't know

521
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,660
how many bad things I did in my previous life.

522
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,060
God punished me like this.

523
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,340
You punished me.

524
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,340
You made me suffer.

525
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,100
You...

526
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,460
Jianxi is only 22.

527
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,940
His good life hasn't started yet.

528
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,140
It's not my fault.

529
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,620
Why did I let him go out that day?

530
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,060
Zhu Xia,

531
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,140
don't think like that.

532
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,060
I...

533
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,060
We have a son.

534
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,180
He is a few years older than Jianxi.

535
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,020
He gave me a birthday gift.

536
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,060
I guess

537
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,420
he doesn't even remember

538
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,380
which day I had my birthday.

539
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,380
Look at Jianxi.

540
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,380
He is so sensible

541
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,140
and filial.

542
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,580
It's your blessing.

543
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,780
Yes.

544
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,780
We can't control

545
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,420
the natural disasters,

546
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,780
right?

547
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,980
You must not

548
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,980
put all the blame on yourself.

549
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,020
You must be strong.

550
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,060
You must remember

551
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,580
that you are the one who can rely on and hope for Jianxi.

552
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,700
I took the film

553
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,180
to look for the famous doctors

554
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,700
in the north.

555
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,700
I thought of all the ways.

556
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,180
But I still said no.

557
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,940
I might be like this for the rest of my life.

558
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,980
I'm just worried about

559
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,980
what if I get sick one day?

560
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,260
What if I leave one day?

561
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,420
Jianxi really

562
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,540
doesn't dare to think about it.

563
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,660
Zhu Xia, Zhu Xia.

564
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,060
I hope you

565
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,100
don't have such thoughts from now on.

566
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,100
I promise you

567
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,020
we will try our best.

568
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,420
But you must be confident.

569
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,940
Yes.

570
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,980
You must be brave.

571
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,860
We are brave.

572
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,540
We are brave.

573
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,180
We are brave.

574
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,180
We are brave.

575
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,660
We are brave.

576
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,820
We are brave.

577
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,460
We are brave.

578
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,540
We are brave.

579
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,100
We are brave.

580
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:17,180
We are brave.

581
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:22,060
We are brave.

582
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,700
We go in later in the day

583
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,420
We cry and laugh

584
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,380
The final иour hair

585
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,040
A resident singer

586
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,860
We women instead of going

587
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,840
Opp Cong

588
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:47,860
Same- Sports

589
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,740
A resident singer

590
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,860
Jun' he!

591
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,020
What did you do?

592
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,560
I wanted to tell my monitor

593
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,460
Why did he kill him?

594
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,240
Do you look tired?

595
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:10,980
I do

596
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,060
I was so worried

597
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,280
You looked like you were unearthed

598
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,420
Don't worry

599
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,660
I found a high 2000 comida

600
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,320
and it wasacht пойд compliment

601
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,440
You look upset

602
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,640
and fight with him.

603
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,800
Yes, sir.

604
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:37,920
Brother Tao.

605
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,120
Brother Tao, get up.

606
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,040
It's time to study.

607
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,000
Time to sleep.

608
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,040
Brother Tao, you're about to wake up.

609
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,240
The teacher is going to give you a lecture.

610
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,680
Get up.

611
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,320
Get up.

612
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,440
Good.

613
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,760
Okay.

614
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,160
If I die,

615
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,240
if you don't get up,

616
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,280
I'll do it.

617
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,720
Okay.

618
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,040
Three, two, one.

619
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,520
I want to be a shark.

620
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,520
Brother Tao.

621
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,800
You're really a patient.

622
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,160
It's been days.

623
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,880
Why do you finally remember

624
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,080
to visit Xiaobai?

625
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,360
I almost thought

626
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,760
you were going to give up.

627
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,120
We're here to teach.

628
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,040
We're not here to find our old classmates.

629
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,120
Okay.

630
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,920
Why are you calling me today?

631
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,560
I'm going down the mountain in two days.

632
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,560
I have to do what I should do.

633
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,600
Brother Tao.

634
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,280
The moon is falling.

635
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
The three gates of the mountain are opening.

636
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,960
If it really happens they're old acquaintances.

637
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,400
They are old acquaintances.

638
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,680
He's a mute.

639
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,480
His Ninja Soul

640
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,920
is out of the register.

641
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,360
Please come in.

642
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,080
We were going to find an old friend.

643
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,040
Sorry to bother you.

644
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,880
I'm not the person you're looking for.

645
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,560
But you're the person I'm looking for.

646
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,760
I know you.

647
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,160
Come in.

648
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,000
He's really good at sleeping.

649
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,120
He fell asleep so early.

650
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,880
Girls are so naive.

651
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,920
Who will be in the same boat with him?

652
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,640
We will.

653
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,960
Why isn't he sleeping?

654
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,280
He's not answering the phone.

655
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,040
I can't sleep.

656
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,120
Tao Tao.

657
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,120
Don't sleep in a daze.

658
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,600
Get up.

659
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,600
He's gone.

660
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,720
He's gone.

661
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,760
He's gone.

662
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,720
He's gone.

663
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,720
He's gone.

664
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,640
He's gone.

665
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,640
He's gone.

666
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,840
He's gone.

667
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,400
Get up.

668
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,680
He's gone.

669
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,480
Look at you.

670
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,960
You're early in the morning.

671
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,280
You're late in the morning.

672
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,080
When I get back,

673
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,960
I can still be the same.

674
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,400
Let me learn.

675
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,680
How to write?

676
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,080
I'll do this.

677
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,520
I'll learn from you.

678
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,360
I'm a writer.

679
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,520
I want to eat and drink.

680
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,880
When I'm hungry,

681
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,800
I'll eat and drink.

682
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
You play with your phone.

683
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,800
I play all night.

684
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,400
I don't sleep for half the night.

685
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,240
Oh, right.

686
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,280
Why do I practice Kungfu?

687
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,280
I'm so smart.

688
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,560
I'll...

689
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,240
I'll...

690
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,720
I'll eat and drink every day.

691
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,920
I can't control it.

692
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,400
I can't stop this.

693
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,520
I'm free!

694
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:14,920
Good boy.

695
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,440
I can feel I've been here before.

696
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,420
The building is right here.

697
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:41,800
Hey,

698
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,400
Where's the red thread?

699
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,800
I'm going to pick it up.

700
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
Did you see it?

701
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,800
Why is there a hole in the red thread?

702
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,800
Why?

703
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
Why?

704
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,800
Why is it here?

705
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
I put it here, right?

706
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,800
I can't get out!

707
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Is there anyone?

708
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,800
What should I do?

709
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
I'm really done for.

710
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,800
I'm going to...

711
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
I'm really done for.

712
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
I'm really done for.

713
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,800
I'm so unlucky.

714
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,800
Unlucky!

715
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
What should I do?

716
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
Let's wait for the dawn.

717
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
Let's wait for the dawn.

718
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,800
I can't get out.

719
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,800
I'm so done for.

720
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,800
No!

721
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
You!

722
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,800
Stop!

723
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,800
Stop!

724
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,800
Don't touch me!

725
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Don't touch me!

726
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,800
Stop!

727
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,800
Stop!

728
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,200
Don't!

729
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,200
Hurry!

730
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,400
Go!

731
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,600
Don't run!

732
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
Don't run!

733
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,400
Don't run!

734
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,400
Help!

735
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,200
Help!

736
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,800
Help!

737
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,600
Hurry!

738
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,200
Boss!

739
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,200
Someone's here!

740
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
I'm here!

741
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
What?

742
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,200
I'm here!

743
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,000
Help!

744
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,800
Help!

745
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,600
Don't rush!

746
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,400
Don't run!

747
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,600
Help!

748
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,200
Hurry!

749
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,000
Help!

750
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,800
What's going on?

751
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,000
It's okay.

752
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,200
It's okay.

753
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,600
It's okay.

754
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,000
Come on.

755
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,600
It's okay.

756
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,400
Come on.

757
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,200
Are you okay?

758
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,600
I'm okay.

759
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,400
I'm okay.

760
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,200
It's okay.

761
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,200
It's okay.

762
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,000
The wind is gone.

763
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It's okay.

764
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Are you okay?

765
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It's okay.

766
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It's broken.

767
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Why are you still laughing?

768
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
How can you laugh so hard?

769
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,400
I, the doctor,

770
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
will be in the hospital

771
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
to be treated with a good doctor.

772
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,200
I have no desire.

773
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,000
I'll give you a big heart.

774
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
If you want to suffer,

775
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,400
just bear the pain.

776
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,200
What's wrong with you?

777
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,000
You can't be a doctor!

778
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,200
Now I even know how to speak.

779
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,200
Is it here?

780
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,000
It's here.

781
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Where?

782
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
This way.

783
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,600
You're ready to leave, right?

784
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,400
Okay.

785
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,600
You're still alive.

786
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,600
That's good.

787
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,000
Let's go.

788
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,600
No, no, no.

789
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,800
Master.

790
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
I won't go.

791
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,400
I won't go.

792
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,800
I really won't go.

793
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,400
I'm really, really,

794
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,800
really grateful

795
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,800
that you can come to me.

796
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,000
Because I...

797
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,400
I'll go that way.

798
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,400
This way.

799
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,200
We're two people.

800
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,000
Two.

801
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Master, I'm really sad.

802
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I really, I really,

803
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I really,

804
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I really,

805
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I really won't go.

806
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I really won't go.

807
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I'll go back

808
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
and write well,

809
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
study well,

810
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
and practice hard.

811
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You're really leaving?

812
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I'm really leaving.

813
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I really won't go.

814
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You're going to sleep after studying?

815
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I'm going to sleep.

816
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
You're going to sleep?

817
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I'm not sleeping.

818
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Practice your words.

819
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I'm going to sleep.

820
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I'm going to sleep.

821
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Did you write well?

822
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I wrote well.

823
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
If it were the next time,

824
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I wouldn't look for you.

825
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Customers won't trust me.

826
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I won't go.

827
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I won't go.

828
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Let's go.

829
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Chang Hong, don't bite my tongue.

830
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
He聽不到我的脱gel了.

831
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Alright.

832
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Go.

833
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I'm really sad.

834
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I can't go with the chic.

835
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Can't you ride on the bike with me?

836
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
You can do it.

837
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
You can do it.

838
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,800
Bruce dragged her straight ahead,

839
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
yet you didn't go.

840
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,800
You're going the wrong way.

841
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,160
Let's go.

842
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,560
Stop looking. Let's go.

843
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,320
Let's go.

844
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,840
The wind is coming.

845
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,280
What's wrong?

846
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,280
I'm sick.

847
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,280
You reminded me.

848
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,840
There should be something milder.

849
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,280
Who wants to pee?

850
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,240
Pee?

851
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,520
Yes.

852
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,680
You want to pee?

853
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,400
Bring it here.

854
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,040
I'll make it into a pot.

855
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,160
It's milder.

856
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,040
I'll go.

857
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,840
Master.

858
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,520
Don't be sick.

859
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,840
I feel quite comfortable.

860
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,040
No.

861
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,640
You reminded me just now.

862
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,840
My master told me

863
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,840
that urine is a good medicine for detoxification.

864
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,880
Slowly.

865
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,280
Slowly.

866
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:54,880
Slowly.

867
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,840
You have to chew it.

868
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,280
Am I not getting any help?

869
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,600
You are.

870
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,040
You usually get dizzy.

871
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,080
That's why you're not getting any help.

872
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,760
I'm dizzy now.

873
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,280
Master can cure you if you get dizzy.

874
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,160
As long as you don't have shortness of breath,

875
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,920
you'll get the cure.

876
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,520
I...

877
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,040
I just have shortness of breath.

878
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,760
I feel like

879
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,320
I can't...

880
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,120
I can't...

881
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,400
Don't talk.

882
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,280
Dad.

883
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,400
Is Tou really...

884
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,520
Is he really dizzy?

885
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,400
He's not dizzy.

886
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,000
He's just tired and sleepy.

887
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,080
He's asleep.

888
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,760
You're really a good brother.

889
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,280
We're tired and sleepy.

890
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,080
He's been looking for a night.

891
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,920
Look at him.

892
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,960
He fell asleep right after turning around.

893
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,120
That's right.

894
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,360
It's true.

895
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,400
Guys.

896
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,240
The last lesson of our B-class is to practice footwork.

897
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,040
We've completed the lesson tonight.

898
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,840
We'll leave the mountain tomorrow morning.

899
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,200
Okay.

900
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,600
Tianzhen.

901
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,840
Take care of the rest.

902
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,440
Okay.

903
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,320
Be gentle.

904
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,080
Okay.

905
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,800
I'll open the quilt for you.

906
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,040
Tianzhen.

907
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,320
This one.

908
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,280
Do you have it?

909
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,600
I'll get it for you.

910
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,520
This one?

911
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,400
Is it still necessary?

912
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,120
This one is not necessary.

913
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,480
You're really a man of great family.

914
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,640
I was too kind to you before.

915
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:52,720
Quan.

916
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
Let him pay for the meal in the future.

917
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,040
It's a big deal.

918
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,360
It's not mine.

919
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,640
Look at you.

920
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,840
It's yours in the future.

921
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,720
I don't need it.

922
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,720
Besides, there's no rule

923
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,440
that this thing must be passed on to me.

924
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,080
Listen to him.

925
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,200
If you don't pass it on, pass it on to me.

926
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,800
You're just a man of great family.

927
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,520
I'm telling you.

928
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,960
Such a good quilt.

929
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,640
If it's mine,

930
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,160
I'll be so happy.

931
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,360
You two are so weird.

932
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,320
What does my grandfather, grandmother

933
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,360
and my parents have to do with me?

934
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,080
Besides, being their children

935
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,640
is not my own choice.

936
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,440
You two are like

937
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,600
I'm taking advantage of you.

938
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,560
Zuyin.

939
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,960
You really stand below and try.

940
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,320
You don't work hard to grow up.

941
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,920
You can't even see the sun above.

942
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:34,880
Say hello.

943
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,840
Come on, guys.

944
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,560
Come on, guys.

945
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,640
Everyone, focus.

946
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,560
What's wrong, Toto?

947
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,760
It's so messy.

948
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,960
Guys.

949
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,520
Practicing is the only standard

950
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,480
for testing the truth.

951
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,200
Before, we basically

952
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,840
had a break from the test.

953
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,080
Then, next,

954
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,080
we'll come to the clinic

955
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,760
to help us study every week.

956
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,600
On Saturday,

957
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,640
we'll continue to go back to the city class.

958
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,840
Am I a needle or a needle?

959
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,640
Sweeping the floor.

960
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,920
During this period,

961
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,960
we'll invite some

962
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,320
different classes,

963
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,240
different specialists

964
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,360
and very influential teachers

965
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,520
to teach us.

966
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,600
I hope that every student

967
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,720
can make it clear

968
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,880
that they like

969
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,440
the most suitable goal during the study.

970
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,480
You don't have to choose.

971
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,080
Just follow me.

972
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,360
The more you love, the more you love.

973
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,360
The more you love, the more you love.

974
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,360
The more you love, the more you love.

975
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,360
The more you love, the more you love.

976
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,360
The more you love, the more you love.

977
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,360
The more you love, the more you love.

978
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,360
The more you love, the more you love.

979
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,360
The more you love, the more you love.

980
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,360
The more you love, the more you love.

981
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,360
The more you love, the more you love.

982
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,360
The more you love, the more you love.

983
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,360
The more you love, the more you love.

984
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,360
The more you love, the more you love.

985
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,360
The more you love, the more you love.

986
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,360
The more you love, the more you love.

987
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,360
The more you love, the more you love.

988
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,360
The more you love, the more you love.

989
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,360
The more you love, the more you love.

990
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,360
The more you love, the more you love.

991
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,360
The more you love, the more you love.

992
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,360
The more you love, the more you love.

993
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,360
The more you love, the more you love.

994
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,360
The more you love, the more you love.

995
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,360
The more you love, the more you love.

996
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,360
The more you love, the more you love.

997
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,360
The more you love, the more you love.

998
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,360
The more you love, the more you love.

999
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,360
The more you love, the more you love.

1000
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,360
There's always someone

1001
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,360
who's worth crossing the mountains and rivers to meet.

1002
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,360
We'll share our years and stars together.

1003
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,360
I'm sure of it.

1004
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,360
Who are you?

1005
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,360
I admit

1006
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:42,360
that I'm not as sincere as I thought.

1007
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:47,360
I'm already trapped in your eyes.

1008
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:53,360
I'm already trapped in your eyes.

1009
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:58,360
I'm already trapped in your eyes.

1010
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:03,360
I'm already trapped in your eyes.

1011
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:08,360
I'm already trapped in your eyes.

1012
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:13,360
I'm already trapped in your eyes.
