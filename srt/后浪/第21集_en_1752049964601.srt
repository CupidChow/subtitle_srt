00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Watch your step.

4
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
Be careful.

5
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,160
Hurry up.

6
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,840
Hurry.

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,760
Zhenzhen.

8
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,240
I see it.

9
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,240
We have to be careful later.

10
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,600
If we fail,

11
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,640
we'll be in vain.

12
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,600
And we have to hurry up.

13
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,400
If we miss the song,

14
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,520
we won't be able to go back.

15
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,120
No.

16
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,720
We've already had a bad day.

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,200
That's why I came here.

18
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,240
Be careful.

19
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,880
Follow me.

20
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,400
Okay.

21
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,040
Be careful.

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,600
Yes.

23
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,600
Great.

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You did a great job.

25
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,400
See you on the flat.

26
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
It's really long.

27
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,200
Yes.

28
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,400
It's really long.

29
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
I've never seen

30
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,200
such a long...

31
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,400
It's really long.

32
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,200
What happened?

33
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,200
It's water.

34
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:13,560
Green

35
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,400
What happened?

36
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,720
What happened?

37
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,720
It's okay

38
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:27,880
It's okay

39
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,880
Don't move

40
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,440
Don't move

41
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,560
Give me your hand

42
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,680
Slowly

43
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,920
Be careful

44
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,400
What's wrong?

45
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,280
What's wrong with your tongue?

46
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,560
Don't

47
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,600
Breathe out

48
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,760
You've seen too much TV series

49
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,080
No, I don't care

50
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,200
Take me back

51
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,040
I want to go back

52
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
No, no, no

53
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,600
You can't take me back

54
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
What if you bite me with your tongue?

55
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,520
Call me

56
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,120
I'm not breathing

57
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,240
Boss, find the rope

58
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,120
Find the rope

59
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,720
I don't have a rope

60
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,280
I don't have a rope

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,560
Wait

62
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,600
Don't worry, it's okay

63
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,840
Don't worry

64
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,120
Don't move

65
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
I don't

66
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,560
Don't worry

67
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,880
You're not the one who bit me

68
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,520
Call me if you need help

69
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,480
I'm fine

70
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,200
I'll close the door

71
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,920
Thank you

72
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,720
Chen Freeze

73
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,080
Turn on the Major

74
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,240
Check

75
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,840
No

76
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,680
Don't touch me

77
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,440
You can't view from here

78
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,120
You can't

79
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,800
You see

80
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,400
You see

81
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,200
Open your eyes

82
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,960
Go, go, go.

83
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,120
Come here!

84
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,160
Be quiet!

85
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,960
Quiet!

86
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,160
Go, go, go.

87
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,160
Hao!

88
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,160
Hao!

89
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,680
He's here!

90
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,160
I'm here!

91
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,560
Here, here, here!

92
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,880
Here, here!

93
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,520
Here, here, here!

94
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,480
What's going on?

95
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,520
Here!

96
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:21,840
At the чтобы of

97
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,680
the defense

98
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
Of career

99
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,180
The investigation

100
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,280
has proceeded

101
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,240
Chen Zhaoniang

102
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,200
will out як

103
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,840
Coward.

104
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,040
Want some water?

105
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Can I sit by your side

106
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,200
and be covered by the sea of water

107
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,200
and meet you again

108
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,200
and meet you again

109
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
How is it?

110
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
The thread is not long enough

111
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
It's handled in time

112
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,200
No wound left

113
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
That's good

114
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
By the way, this is the medicine

115
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,200
that Mr. Shen just made

116
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
to cure the snake poison

117
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Put it on

118
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,200
The person you love

119
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,200
I stand on the back of the line

120
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,200
You once said

121
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Can I sit by your side

122
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,200
and be covered by the sea of water

123
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,200
and meet you again

124
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,200
and meet you again

125
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
When did it happen?

126
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
The one who was bitten by the heart is not you

127
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Honey, the one who was bitten by the heart is not you

128
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:36,200
How to find

129
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:43,200
to bear more

130
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,200
to bear more

131
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
The truth is out of danger

132
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Don't worry

133
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Stop

134
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
What are you going to do?

135
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
I'm going to see him

136
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
See what?

137
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
I'm going to see him

138
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
See how he died, right?

139
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Mr. Ren emphasized again and again

140
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
that you are not allowed to dig the body

141
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
and the body

142
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
It's okay if you don't listen

143
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
You still have the audacity to be naive

144
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
and go with you secretly

145
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
I only have one son

146
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
No

147
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
He is my life

148
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
It's Mr. Liu

149
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Mr. Liu, he

150
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
Mr. Liu

151
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,200
What did Liu Changqing give you?

152
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
He asked you to go with Mr. Liu

153
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
What's the benefit of that?

154
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
He asked you to go with Mr. Tianzhen

155
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Do you know that

156
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Liu Changqing has taken my son's life

157
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
and left it behind?

158
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
Lingnan, don't be a dream

159
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
What's wrong?

160
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Am I wrong?

161
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
If it weren't for him

162
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,200
my son is so good

163
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
How could he go to dig the body secretly?

164
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
How could he be bitten by a snake?

165
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
How could he be like this?

166
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
Lingnan

167
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Sun Toto

168
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Sun Toto

169
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Go with me

170
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Lingnan

171
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
If he doesn't go today, I'll go

172
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
It's me

173
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
It's me

174
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
It's Liu Changqing

175
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
Liu Changqing said

176
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
he would kill you if he didn't

177
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Shut up

178
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Don't drive me away

179
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Don't drive me away

180
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,200
Don't drive me away

181
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,200
Don't drive me away

182
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,200
Don't drive me away

183
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
It's really not me

184
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
It's Liu Changqing

185
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Toto

186
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
I'm sorry

187
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
I didn't mean it

188
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
I didn't mean it

189
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Wait a minute

190
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Get down

191
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
You send her down

192
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Toto

193
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Don't worry too much

194
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
Your mother is just in a hurry

195
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
She's naive

196
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
She's just angry

197
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
She doesn't want to leave

198
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Go back

199
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Really, Toto

200
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
I said you should go

201
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
I'm sorry

202
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
I'm sorry

203
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
I'm sorry

204
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
I'm sorry

205
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
I'm sorry

206
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
I'm sorry

207
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
I'm sorry

208
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
I'm sorry

209
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
I'm sorry

210
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
I'm sorry

211
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
I'm sorry

212
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
I'm sorry

213
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
I'm sorry

214
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
I'm sorry

215
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
I'm sorry

216
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
Really, Toto

217
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I'm serious

218
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
I believe you too

219
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
You didn't mean it

220
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
I'm serious too

221
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
You really go back

222
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
I can find my way down the mountain

223
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
You go back and see Tianzhen

224
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
They said it's okay

225
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
But I didn't see it with my own eyes

226
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
I still feel uneasy

227
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
Then you go back and let him

228
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Call me by himself

229
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Did you hear that

230
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
You're okay

231
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
What can I do

232
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
I'm not bitten by a snake

233
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
I'm really okay

234
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
You go back and see him

235
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,200
I'm in the village down the mountain

236
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Waiting for your news

237
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Know?

238
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Go

239
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Go go go

240
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Remember to let him call me

241
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,200
You pay more attention

242
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Let everyone not worry

243
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
it is good

244
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,200
What's in the past

245
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,200
People cannot find that

246
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
You will want to do more

247
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,360
You

248
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,200
Ask me

249
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Did you set it up

250
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Me

251
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,840
No.

252
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,480
We don't know what will happen.

253
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,320
We can't rush to the next step.

254
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,440
Let's go.

255
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,680
Tianzhen.

256
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,680
Tianzhen, you're awake.

257
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,560
Mom.

258
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,600
What's wrong?

259
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,760
I'm a little thirsty.

260
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,320
Drink some water with egg.

261
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,600
The child must be hungry now.

262
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,000
I'll go get some food for him.

263
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,120
reservoir

264
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,280
Slowly.

265
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,840
Gently.

266
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,560
Easy.

267
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,680
Let's go.

268
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,160
Why?

269
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,920
Have you been thinking about Shan?

270
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,240
You've sent Liu Changqing

271
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,040
down the mountain long time ago.

272
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,160
Look at you.

273
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,440
You are interdisciplinary.

274
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,240
You do whatever they ask you to do.

275
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,440
Can you be a little more stupid?

276
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,160
Mom, I...

277
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,720
Slow down.

278
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,480
I'm fine.

279
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,440
You...

280
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,560
Don't worry.

281
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,960
I'm not worried.

282
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,800
You almost died, you know?

283
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,760
That means

284
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,440
you were bitten by a snake.

285
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,000
Listen.

286
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,520
Go.

287
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,640
Taotao,

288
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,560
Taotao...

289
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,760
Stop calling him.

290
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,920
I've kicked him out.

291
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,560
No...

292
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,280
You kicked him out?

293
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,080
Mom.

294
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,600
You said yes this time...

295
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,680
I'm the one who risked my life.

296
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,880
You still want to

297
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,880
help him?

298
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,000
This time,

299
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,120
it's not my fault.

300
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,480
I insisted

301
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,640
on listening to my dad.

302
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,640
It's me.

303
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,880
I want to leave a way for the student squad.

304
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,000
Yes.

305
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,760
After all, it's my dad's hard work.

306
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,280
That's why I agreed to leave.

307
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,040
To help me,

308
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,760
he went with me.

309
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,040
Mom.

310
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:15,960
You...

311
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,360
You really blamed him.

312
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,680
You...

313
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,960
You gave up your life

314
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,600
to help others.

315
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,440
Mom.

316
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,400
You...

317
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,600
You really can't

318
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,000
leave without telling me.

319
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,240
This time,

320
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,000
it's all my fault.

321
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,200
Linglan.

322
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
I heard what you said.

323
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,000
Control your emotions

324
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,560
is a lifetime's work.

325
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,320
You lost your job today.

326
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,680
Dou Dou.

327
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,880
Where is Dou Dou now?

328
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,520
Dou Dou is not here.

329
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,600
Your mom is in a bad mood.

330
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,960
What are you doing?

331
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,640
I'm going to find her.

332
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,800
How can you do that?

333
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:29,760
You...

334
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,320
You should take care of yourself.

335
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:31,960
Mom.

336
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,400
Dou Dou is not a good person.

337
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,800
She was lost

338
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,240
when she went into the mountain.

339
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,200
I'm really worried.

340
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,320
Dad.

341
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,280
Don't worry.

342
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,480
Call her.

343
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,720
Fatty.

344
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,280
Fatty.

345
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:32,960
Anyone here?

346
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,880
Help!

347
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,840
Help!

348
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,960
Fatty.

349
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,200
Help!

350
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,120
Fatty.

351
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,600
Fatty.

352
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:40,920
Move.

353
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,760
Help me.

354
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,320
Move.

355
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,040
Hurry.

356
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,600
She fainted.

357
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,600
You have a electric shock?

358
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,680
I don't know.

359
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,280
She never had this before.

360
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,120
She said she was going to school today.

361
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,720
Right.

362
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,560
What are you doing?

363
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,000
It's a doctor. Listen to me.

364
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,640
Okay.

365
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,360
No.

366
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,560
Son.

367
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,400
It's off.

368
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,040
Mom.

369
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,360
How long has Dou Dou been gone?

370
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,520
I'm sorry.

371
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,120
I'm sorry.

372
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,320
Yuan Shun, you called me?

373
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,080
What's wrong with you?

374
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,600
I told you to go down the mountain with her.

375
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,120
She didn't want me to follow her.

376
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,320
She said she wanted me to come back

377
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,320
to see the natural situation.

378
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,720
Then...

379
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,040
Then you let her go alone?

380
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,880
She has only one way down the mountain.

381
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,080
There should be nothing wrong.

382
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,040
And she said

383
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,520
his primary school is filled with

384
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,280
stone of the lab��,

385
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,880
so it's not that difficult for someone

386
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,600
to take a DNA2000 soon.

387
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,320
I'm sorry.

388
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,960
I don't want it in the lab tema.

389
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,480
Dou Dou.

390
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,120
Dou Dou's phone isilimit.

391
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,480
We can't get in touch with her.

392
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,800
Last night she was sharpened in the garden.

393
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
I'm fine now.

394
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,800
I'm fine now.

395
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
That's great.

396
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Thank you, Miss.

397
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
You should go to the hospital

398
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,800
for a check-up.

399
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,800
It's a rare condition.

400
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
You won't be so lucky next time.

401
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
Right.

402
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
We have a car to the hospital.

403
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
What are you waiting for? Go.

404
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Right.

405
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,800
Go.

406
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Help him hold the wheel.

407
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
He's precious.

408
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,800
Thank you.

409
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,800
Han Zao.

410
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Hold on.

411
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Han Zao.

412
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,800
Hold on.

413
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Miss.

414
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
Coming.

415
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Hold on.

416
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Is he injured?

417
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
We asked the villagers downstairs.

418
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
He's locked up.

419
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,800
No one is in.

420
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Right.

421
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
No one in the nearby restaurant.

422
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
They said he was bitten by a double-edged sword.

423
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
They said they didn't see anyone.

424
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
Are you sure?

425
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Yes.

426
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
The car in the city

427
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
started to move in the morning.

428
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
We didn't see him.

429
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Where can we go?

430
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,800
It will be dark in a while.

431
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
It's Lin Liwei.

432
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,800
That girl.

433
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
What if something happens to her?

434
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
It's all my fault.

435
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
It's all my fault.

436
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Lin Lan.

437
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
Don't worry.

438
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,800
Qiu Shi.

439
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
Take Lin Lan

440
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
and the others

441
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
to the next class.

442
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Go home now.

443
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
I won't.

444
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
I'm going to find Tou Tou.

445
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
Don't worry.

446
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,800
Okay.

447
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
Don't worry.

448
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
You guys.

449
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,800
Follow me.

450
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
You stay with me.

451
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
Wait for Tou Tou.

452
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
Don't worry.

453
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
Dad.

454
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Mom.

455
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
I'll stay too.

456
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
Tianzhen will stay.

457
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
Don't worry.

458
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
I'm here.

459
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Yiquan.

460
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Take care of Shi.

461
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
Yes.

462
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
Go.

463
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
If you see Tou Tou,

464
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,800
you must apologize for me.

465
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
Don't drive at night.

466
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,800
You must go home before it gets dark.

467
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Take care of yourself.

468
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Go.

469
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Go.

470
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Miss.

471
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
Brother.

472
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Miss.

473
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,800
You're not in a big trouble.

474
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Don't.

475
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,800
Miss.

476
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,800
I told you.

477
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Don't be polite.

478
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,800
Miss.

479
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,800
I haven't thanked you yet.

480
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
This time,

481
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
I'm glad I met you.

482
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,800
You're a doctor.

483
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Thank you so much.

484
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
You saved his life.

485
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
It's okay.

486
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
It's okay for a child.

487
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Besides,

488
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
isn't being a doctor

489
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
just to save people?

490
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
You're right.

491
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
It might be a good thing for you.

492
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
But for the child,

493
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,800
you saved his life.

494
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
I don't know

495
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,800
how to repay you.

496
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,800
Let me kowtow to you.

497
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Brother.

498
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
It's not okay.

499
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
I tell you.

500
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
It's okay for the child to be fine.

501
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
It's okay for the child to be fine.

502
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,800
It's okay for the child to be fine.

503
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
If you really want to repay me,

504
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
you can give me this.

505
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
What's this?

506
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,800
It's not worth it.

507
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,800
It's not worth it.

508
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
It's worth it.

509
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
It's worth more than money to me.

510
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,800
Really?

511
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,800
Yes.

512
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
Okay.

513
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,800
I'm so embarrassed.

514
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
Miss.

515
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
How about going to have dinner?

516
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
No.

517
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
Go back and see the child.

518
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
Brother.

519
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Really. Go back and see the child.

520
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Miss.

521
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
You're a good person.

522
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
Thank you.

523
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Thank you.

524
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,800
Thank you.

525
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
Thank you.

526
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Thank you.

527
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Thank you.

528
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
The city is in a trance.

529
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:22,800
The story seems to be very interesting.

530
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,800
The sunset in the sunset.

531
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,800
This time, it's really thanks to you.

532
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
My child is lucky.

533
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Fortunately, I met you.

534
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
You're a doctor now.

535
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
I'm really grateful to you.

536
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
You saved his life.

537
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,800
The world is slowly becoming complete.

538
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,800
Missing you is happening.

539
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:52,800
There are always people who are worth crossing mountains and rivers.

540
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,800
Let's fly to the years and stars together.

541
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,800
I'm sure.

542
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,800
Who are you?

543
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,800
I admit that I'm not purely sincere.

544
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,800
I'm not purely sincere.

545
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,800
I'm already trapped in your eyes.

546
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
Hello.

547
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Sun Teng Teng.

548
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
Is it fun to disappear?

549
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
Where are you now?

550
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,800
No.

551
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
Are you still fun?

552
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,800
You...

553
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
I'm in the town's sanatorium now.

554
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Hello.

555
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Teng Teng.

556
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
Teng Teng.

557
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Teng Teng.

558
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Is it fun to disappear?

559
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
I didn't disappear.

560
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Why are you running away?

561
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
I didn't disappear.

562
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Do you know that

563
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
many people are worried about you?

564
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,800
I'm fine.

565
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
You're fine?

566
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,800
My mom is worried about you.

567
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
I'm fine.

568
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
I'm fine.

569
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
I'm fine.

570
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,800
I'm fine.

571
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,800
I'm fine.

572
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
I'm fine.

573
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
I'm fine.

574
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
I'm fine.

575
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
I'm fine.

576
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
I'm fine.

577
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
I'm fine.

578
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
I'm fine.

579
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
Can you tell me

580
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
why you're here?

581
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Sorry to make you worried.

582
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Why are you here?

583
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
Did you fall?

584
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
Then why did you come here?

585
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,720
I saved him

586
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,040
and sent him to the sanatorium.

587
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,600
His father...

588
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,960
His father called me a doctor.

589
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,440
It was the first time I heard

590
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,720
someone call me a doctor.

591
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,120
Master.

592
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,560
I think I've found

593
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,080
the mission of being a doctor.

594
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,080
I want to be a doctor.

595
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,840
I really want to

596
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,760
become a good doctor.

597
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,360
Master.

598
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,200
I know you're my master.

599
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,440
You're my master for life.

600
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,160
You're my master for life.

601
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,120
So please teach me.

602
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,000
I'll definitely study hard

603
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
and do my best.

604
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,920
When I'm done,

605
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,600
I'll definitely be a good doctor.

606
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,360
But you must be a big talker.

607
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,080
Believe me.

608
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,200
I'll definitely not fail the mission.

609
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,720
I'll definitely not fail the master.

610
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,880
I'm not that big of a snake.

611
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,640
I don't need you

612
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,320
to be proud of me.

613
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,600
My only hope is that

614
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,080
when you make trouble in the future,

615
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,320
you'll tell me your name.

616
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,560
That's all?

617
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,000
I have nothing to ask for.

618
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,000
Okay.

619
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520
I'm not sure.

620
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,840
I'll make a decision.

621
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,000
You don't trust me?

622
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,600
No, I don't.

623
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,400
I was told that

624
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,120
if I want to be a doctor,

625
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,880
I must sign a contract with the city.

626
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,280
After the deadline,

627
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,760
I'll go through the city assessment.

628
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,480
That's how I pass the test.

629
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,240
I didn't mean to do that.

630
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,440
Now I want to study hard.

631
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,640
I have to make a decision.

632
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,040
That will make me feel relieved.

633
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,880
You've already signed it.

634
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,120
When we first met,

635
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,200
we signed it.

636
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,720
When?

637
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,040
Just a few days ago.

638
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,440
Okay.

639
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,200
Read it.

640
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:23,520
311199708094120.

641
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,480
You're really a loyal doctor.

642
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,320
Look at the characters.

643
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,000
I didn't see any of them clearly.

644
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,160
Sign it.

645
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,280
Here you go.

646
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,000
Here?

647
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,040
Where?

648
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:55,560
Here UEF of 꼘

649
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,640
Take this.

650
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,920
Put it back.

651
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,840
We're using it later.

652
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,120
What use?

653
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,880
If you don't give me money,

654
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,080
I can't sue you with this.

655
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,760
It's all that.

656
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,120
That's not proper.

657
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,920
And that's not serious.

658
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,680
You have to give me

659
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,320
a printout anyway.

660
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,480
I'm not a man.

661
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,680
All right, go home.

662
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,000
Wait a minute, master.

663
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,720
You keep this.

664
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,320
What's this shit?

665
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,440
This is not shit.

666
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,040
This is the first time I've received a deposit.

667
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,800
Didn't we all say

668
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,840
that the first deposit

669
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,160
will be yours?

670
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,440
All right, I'll keep it.

671
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,120
Perfect.

672
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,480
When you make another mistake,

673
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,080
I'll beat you with it.

674
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,920
All right.

675
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,520
Master.

676
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,920
Is this jar

677
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,160
worth ten yuan?

678
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,600
This jar

679
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,280
is worth ten yuan.

680
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:07,880
You think I'm...

681
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,440
No, no, no.

682
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,720
I mean, give me ten yuan.

683
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,800
You're so mean.

684
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,320
No, no, no.

685
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,240
Hold it and I'll talk.

686
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,840
I'll talk.

687
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,000
You don't buy it?

688
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,440
You don't buy it?

689
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,720
It's not worth ten yuan.

690
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,800
Isn't this a rescue?

691
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:20,920
Right?

692
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,240
Let me have a drink.

693
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,960
Let me have a drink.

694
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,520
All right, master.

695
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,680
Can you help me?

696
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,240
No, no, no.

697
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:34,920
Here.

698
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,280
Tianzhen, give me my bag.

699
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,000
Tianzhen.

700
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,560
No.

701
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,520
What's going on?

702
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,280
What's wrong with Liu Changqing?

703
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:56,920
What's going on?

704
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,440
What's wrong?

705
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,160
What's wrong?

706
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,440
Liu Changqing really didn't make it?

707
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,680
I don't care.

708
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,840
He took the money away.

709
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,320
Put it down.

710
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,600
We paid for it.

711
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,480
We're all here for you.

712
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,400
Move it away.

713
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,480
What?

714
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,440
Come on in and have a look.

715
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,880
They've started to clean up the dorm.

716
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,560
That's enough.

717
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,400
It's too expensive.

718
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,320
Liu Changqing,

719
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,760
don't you have anything to say to him?

720
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,320
Uncle, call him.

721
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,280
Call him.

722
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:21,920
Hurry up.

723
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,200
I'm sorry.

724
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,120
I'm sorry.

725
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,960
I'm sorry.

726
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,680
I'm sorry.

727
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,840
Professor Lin, Mr. Song.

728
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,600
I'm sorry, Liu Changqing.

729
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,680
I'm sorry, everyone.

730
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,360
Liu.

731
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,760
Did you not make up for your loss

732
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,840
or did you make up for the loss?

733
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,760
Liu Changqing, tell me.

734
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,880
Where's the kidney?

735
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,320
Did you send it out?

736
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,240
Say something!

737
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:46,600
Mr. Tao.

738
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,280
That's a gift from heaven.

739
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,880
What do you mean by giving it away?

740
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,080
Your kidney...

741
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,560
I really can't pay it back.

742
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,080
I...

743
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,000
Mr. Tao.

744
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,400
Mr. Tao.

745
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,200
You're a kid.

746
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:00,640
Come out.

747
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,320
Mr. Tao.

748
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,360
I'm sorry to interrupt.

749
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,320
Are you a cop?

750
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,520
Are you a hacker?

751
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,560
I don't know.

752
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,640
I don't go any safety know-how.

753
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,680
We can meet up at the police station.

754
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,620
I'm going.

755
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,920
Come in, Mr. Tang.

756
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,900
Yuan,

757
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,480
hello, Mr. Tang.

758
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,440
I'm not saying you should drink the rest.

759
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,440
You're a saint.

760
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,160
This is not water.

761
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,760
This is gold.

762
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,160
You drink it all the time.

763
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,960
It's not expensive.

764
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,400
Is there anything else?

765
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,640
I have

766
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,200
a treasure here.

767
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,400
Changbai Mountain.

768
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,600
I dug it up.

769
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,800
It's definitely a hundred-year-old mountain.

770
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,200
I guarantee it's a real one.

771
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,200
Professor Ren has been looking for this for ten years.

772
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,400
I'm sure it's a treasure.

773
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,800
I'm sure it's a real one.

774
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,560
I've been looking for this for ten years.

775
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,160
All the counties are protecting it from digging.

776
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,160
I dug it up.

777
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,160
It's expensive.

778
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,760
It's almost back.

779
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,960
In a critical moment,

780
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,160
I killed

781
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,960
that poisonous snake.

782
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,960
If it weren't for me,

783
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,360
Professor Ren's son

784
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,960
would be dead.

785
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,760
The savior of Professor Ren's son.

786
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,360
No wonder Professor Ren

787
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,160
gave you such a precious treasure.

788
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,160
Not me.

789
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:32,960
It's for you.

790
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,160
Professor Ren said

791
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,720
it's for you.

792
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:36,920
With you,

793
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,120
the Chinese medicine industry

794
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,320
will not disappear.

795
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,120
Mr. Nie.

796
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,920
You don't know.

797
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,120
It's really hard

798
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,920
to find this body.

799
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,920
We have to walk

800
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,320
along the tree

801
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,720
one by one.

802
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,720
Mr. Liu is too modest.

803
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,520
You're really a kind hearted person.

804
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,920
The Chinese medicine industry

805
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,920
will definitely be solved.

806
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,920
I heard you say that

807
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,520
my son risked his life to get it.

808
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,120
Yes.

809
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,520
I don't dare to sell it.

810
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,320
Mr. Liu.

811
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,720
Mr. Neng.

812
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,520
No.

813
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,920
The forest is deep.

814
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,120
Where can you find it?

815
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,520
Which year are you going to find it?

816
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,520
The forest is deep.

817
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,720
Don't talk about investment.

818
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,720
I'm sure

819
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,320
Boss Liang has 100%.

820
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,120
I ask you.

821
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,320
Where is the body?

822
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,520
Where did the body go?

823
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,920
Give me a reasonable explanation.

824
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,120
The soulmate is here.

825
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,720
I don't know where the body went.

826
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,640
You don't know?

827
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,320
Yes

828
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,880
I took off the ginseng myself

829
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,200
When I got home

830
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,400
I found a very expensive

831
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,760
stone box

832
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,600
and put it in

833
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,920
I put it in the safe

834
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,200
and never left

835
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,400
I asked Boss Liang

836
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,720
to open it at the scene

837
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,400
because nothing was left

838
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:21,920
Yes

839
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,400
Did someone take it away?

840
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,800
Who else

841
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,280
knows about the ginseng except you?

842
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,560
No one

843
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,680
Only me and my assistant

844
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,240
But I never left

845
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,080
this box

846
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,760
What you said

847
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,040
is unreasonable

848
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,200
No one took it away

849
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,760
Did the ginseng grow up and run away?

850
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,000
I did check online

851
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,960
that ginseng has a spiritual nature

852
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,760
It can run away by itself

853
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,720
Think about it

854
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,920
There are so many strange things

855
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,440
Did it run away?

856
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,320
It ran away

857
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,480
Liu Changqing

858
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,960
Don't make a fool of me

859
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,680
Today

860
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,720
I'll either return the classroom

861
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,880
or return the mountain

862
00:38:59,280 --> 00:38:59,840
or

863
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,840
I'll kill you

864
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,600
Boss

865
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,320
Boss

866
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,000
Get out of here

867
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,560
Boss

868
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,440
Boss

869
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,520
Master, don't let him get away from me

870
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,080
Boss

871
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,120
Boss

872
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,760
Listen to me, boss

873
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,280
Listen to me

874
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,520
Believe him

875
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,400
He didn't lie

876
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,680
Master

877
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,480
Think about it

878
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,960
The big garden is gone

879
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,880
It will be more harmful

880
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,600
What should we do now?

881
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,720
The pig's den

882
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,160
The pig's den

883
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,880
has a few decades of ginseng

884
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,840
We can find it

885
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,560
Find it

886
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,480
It's too late

887
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,640
I just called to confirm

888
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,880
The bank has started to go through the mortgage procedures

889
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,920
Now even if someone is willing to invest

890
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,640
it's a waste of money

891
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,000
あれ

892
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,080
Erm, don't come

893
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,520
Is this act real?

894
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,760
Our class is going to beぉ

895
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,080
I wrote a premisesjapaness fora

896
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,120
to study here

897
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,560
I didn't expect this

898
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,240
Where can I go now?

899
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,240
These are not the most important.

900
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,840
The key is where to live.

901
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,040
We have our own house.

902
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,840
What about the students from other places?

903
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,040
Do we have to take them home?

904
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,640
Why don't you find a job in the state like me?

905
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,240
Come here on weekends to take lessons and follow me?

906
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,640
I came to study medicine in the city.

907
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,840
I didn't expect that the state was really so heavy.

908
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,840
When I go back, my wife will laugh at me.

909
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,440
She said that

910
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,640
it's hard to raise yourself.

911
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,840
I didn't expect that

912
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,840
there is no place for teachers

913
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,040
for such famous people like Professor Ren.

914
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,040
Is there any hope for me to be a doctor?

915
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,240
I'm going to be the medical representative of Xiyi.

916
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,440
I don't know if I have a medical background.

917
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,840
What a sad story.

918
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,640
It hasn't been resolved yet.

919
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,440
Besides, there are so many people.

920
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,440
You can't solve it by yourself.

921
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,440
I'll ask my friends.

922
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,040
I saw many cheap and affordable places before.

923
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,240
I'll contact them.

924
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,840
I'll tell you when I'm done.

925
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,840
Wait for the news.

926
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,840
Chen.

927
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,240
You're not the worst.

928
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,040
You have a job and a place to live.

929
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,040
You can take it.

930
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
I'll seduce you.

931
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,040
Xiaoming's mom, I'm telling you.

932
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,640
Our Le Le likes Mr. Meng the most.

933
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,640
So do we.

934
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,440
Right?

935
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,720
Yes, I do

936
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,360
Really?

937
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,440
Now they have two or three children

938
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,800
The policy benefits are very good

939
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,480
Miss Meng has been wanting a baby

940
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,760
Finally, she is pregnant

941
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,520
Yes

942
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,720
Why are you here?

943
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,840
Tomorrow is the weekend

944
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,520
I want to take Lele back to live for two days

945
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,520
to have a weekend

946
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,680
You remember the wrong day

947
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,160
Next week

948
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,040
is the time for Lele to go to dad

949
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,720
I'm going to the hospital

950
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,960
I'll be back in a few days

951
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,080
I'll be back in a few days

952
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,080
I'll be back in a few days

953
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,080
I'll be back in a few days

954
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,080
I'll be back in a few days

955
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,080
I'll be back in a few days

956
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,080
I'll be back in a few days

957
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,080
I'll be back in a few days

958
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,080
I'll be back in a few days

959
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,080
I'll be back in a few days

960
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,080
I'll be back in a few days

961
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,080
I'll be back in a few days

962
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,080
I'll be back in a few days

963
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,080
I'll be back in a few days

964
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,080
I'll be back in a few days

965
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,080
I'll be back in a few days

966
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,080
I'll be back in a few days

967
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,080
