00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
On Saturday, we will continue to return to the city class.

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,200
Am I a needle or a drug?

5
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,000
Sweeping the floor.

6
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,400
During this time, we will be giving our classmates

7
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,600
different classes, different specialties,

8
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,800
and very influential teachers to give you lessons.

9
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,000
I hope that during this time,

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,600
each student can clearly determine their favorite and most suitable goal.

11
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
You don't have to choose. Just follow me.

12
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,400
Master, my loan is over. I have to go back to the hospital to work.

13
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,800
I have to take classes after the class.

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,200
No problem. Because you and Xing Xing are both medical workers.

15
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,800
The reason I am teaching you is to hope that you can

16
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,800
be able to respond to your daily life.

17
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,200
Go. You should go to work.

18
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,400
Master, when you are lacking in classes, ask your classmates.

19
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,200
I will make up for it.

20
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,000
It is good classes. Only when you have the extra money can you improve.

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You should just burn the salt and soil by yourself.

22
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,400
I think I should still look for our college boss, Lawyer Yang.

23
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,000
I will trouble you in the future. Thank you in advance.

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The landlord doesn't have any extra money.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,200
You are a rich man who is living in a poor place.

26
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,200
Professor Lin!

27
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
It is the person you told me about.

28
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Yes, yes, yes. The assistant and Ding Jianxi.

29
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,200
Hello.

30
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,000
Professor Lin, I finally waited for you.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,200
Please save my daughter.

32
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,200
If you say that there is no other way, then we can only wait to die.

33
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,800
Don't just say it. Just say it.

34
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,000
It is not easy to die here.

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,600
The situation of the child, let me briefly introduce it.

36
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,000
Let me take a look.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,800
Come, come, come. No rush, no rush.

38
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,800
Excellent.

39
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,000
All teaches the bright troubles of A student who was born wrong.

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,800
Professor Lin,

41
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,200
Raide's life and killed at

42
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,900
buying films during the branch coat 꽃,

43
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,000
you still take the initiative to sell them to the plum seeker.

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,400
Besides, as for drama and

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,740
art,

46
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,640
I combat against every tyrants.

47
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,120
What social media do you use?

48
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,240
They are social media.

49
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,280
Rock-paper-scissors!

50
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,320
People tell of the players.

51
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,360
Hurry, please, quick.

52
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,240
You have a solution.

53
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,240
Yes.

54
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,600
I thought of this at once.

55
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,880
I once worked with a master.

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He taught me the T luxury

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,640
and your rec warship works...

58
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,800
I'm afraid I can't find it.

59
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,960
Right.

60
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,480
There's a small notebook

61
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,880
in the drawer of my desk.

62
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,840
Help me get it back.

63
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,120
That means my daughter is still alive.

64
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,440
This medicine

65
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,120
is not easy to find.

66
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,160
It's okay.

67
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,840
You can tell me.

68
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,000
I can find it

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,040
no matter what I do.

70
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,880
Is it this one?

71
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,120
Let me see.

72
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,480
Don't peek.

73
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,600
Go to the other side.

74
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,400
It should be this one.

75
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,480
The old house that has been here for over 300 years

76
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,320
was made of tiles on its head.

77
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,920
The child was taken in

78
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,040
and soaked for 21 days.

79
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,560
After being crushed,

80
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,080
the child was sent home with old yellow wine.

81
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,880
Sent... sent home?

82
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,840
I... I'll drink it.

83
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,480
The urine

84
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,480
is still in the bowl.

85
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,280
Great.

86
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,720
You finally got it.

87
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,120
I'll go and get it right away.

88
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,080
It's none of your business.

89
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,280
It should be this house.

90
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,840
But you said

91
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,520
it's not easy to find

92
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,920
an old house that has been here for over 300 years.

93
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,360
There are so many places in the country.

94
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,760
As long as I can find it,

95
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,840
I... I'll have to

96
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,000
take off the roof.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,960
I'll have to find it.

98
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,000
That's not good.

99
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,800
You're breaking the law.

100
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,800
The Public Security Bureau

101
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,000
is looking for someone like this.

102
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,160
You know what?

103
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,880
Last time, I...

104
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,400
Xiao Zhou.

105
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,040
You don't have an appetite. Why don't you eat?

106
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,480
What are you looking at?

107
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,400
Why are you still sighing?

108
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,640
This dish is really bad.

109
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
It's not as good as you made it.

110
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
It's quite healthy.

111
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,360
It's not bad.

112
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,240
You can have some sugar.

113
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,720
A little bit of salad.

114
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,560
Do you want it?

115
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,400
I'm thinking about Ding Jianxi and her mother.

116
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,800
Right?

117
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,880
Do you think

118
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,200
the person in the room is too bad?

119
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,200
I think the parents in the world are pitiful.

120
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,400
You see,

121
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,800
how hard it is for their parents.

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,520
If this matter is on my head,

123
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,920
I'll be so sad.

124
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,360
If this matter is on my head,

125
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,080
my parents will be so sad

126
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,680
when they hear this news.

127
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,600
Yes.

128
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,880
It's really miserable.

129
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,400
Ding Zhen.

130
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,640
People are so miserable.

131
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,160
Why does your father

132
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,520
still talk nonsense?

133
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,640
Listen.

134
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,240
The 300-year-old opium

135
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,080
plus the child's urine

136
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,880
can cure a patient

137
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,640
with a broken spine.

138
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
This is not medical technology.

139
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,880
This is witchcraft.

140
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,760
It doesn't matter if it's medical or witchcraft.

141
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,600
It's useful.

142
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,160
The first letter of the Chinese medicine

143
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,360
is the first letter of the Chinese medicine.

144
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,320
Ding Zhen.

145
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,760
It's not like you.

146
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,720
You've been

147
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,000
taught basic medical education.

148
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,000
As a scientist,

149
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,280
do you really believe

150
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,720
that opium plus child's urine

151
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,000
can cure a patient?

152
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,840
I think it can.

153
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,320
I don't know why

154
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,120
the streets in Europe

155
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,840
are full of old houses

156
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,600
with more than 300 years.

157
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,800
We have fewer of them.

158
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,400
Are you Chinese medicine all like this?

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,560
In Li Shiren's book,

160
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,960
it says that

161
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,000
the bottom of the blood is mud, the bottom of the feces is mud,

162
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
and the foot is medicine.

163
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,680
Look at the West.

164
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,560
Moscow's math books,

165
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,280
Linde's math books,

166
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,000
and the calculations of the original combination.

167
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,520
I can understand

168
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,120
the reaction of several lines.

169
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,800
But such a formula

170
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,520
sounds poisonous.

171
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,960
How can it be useful?

172
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,640
This is the difference between

173
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
the science of the National Department of Science

174
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,880
and the real science.

175
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,560
What do you mean?

176
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,760
But your nephew

177
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,880
said that opium is old.

178
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,000
What's the difference between opium and medicine?

179
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,160
Brother Lu,

180
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,160
the spine

181
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,160
is like a bone.

182
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,680
The bones of the spine

183
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,640
are connected to

184
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,040
the muscles and nerves.

185
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,240
So that the central nerves of your brain

186
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,840
can transmit

187
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,160
to every part of your body.

188
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,200
You can run,

189
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,200
you can jump,

190
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
and you can feel the cold, hot and painful.

191
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,800
Now, the liver,

192
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,080
from the waist,

193
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,400
you can break it,

194
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:06,880
and it breaks.

195
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,120
The bone is broken and the muscle is connected.

196
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,920
Now, in medicine,

197
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,480
in medicine,

198
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,000
the broken bones,

199
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,080
nerves,

200
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,040
and even muscles

201
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,080
can be reconnected.

202
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,760
But it is said that

203
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,280
once the middle is broken,

204
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,960
it can be reconnected again.

205
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,080
That's too complicated.

206
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,960
Now, in medicine,

207
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,280
it's not solved yet.

208
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,160
I

209
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,760
don't know much about nerves.

210
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,080
But I think

211
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,920
the rebirth of nerves

212
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,760
can be done by

213
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,520
some methods like acupuncture and angina.

214
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,120
Through repeated stimulation,

215
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,720
it can still work.

216
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,360
But you said

217
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,400
only by taking medicine

218
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,040
can you make a paralyzed person

219
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,080
have a sense of it.

220
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,800
I think this is

221
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,080
really

222
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,280
hard to explain.

223
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,920
Rebecca,

224
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,000
you are a hero.

225
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,040
Give me five.

226
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,840
Tianzhen,

227
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,320
how sure are you

228
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,600
of the human body?

229
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,600
I don't understand.

230
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,440
I have said it.

231
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,400
The human body is useful.

232
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,240
Thank you.

233
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:08,920
OK.

234
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,520
I want to change.

235
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,520
Turn around.

236
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,560
Fu Ren.

237
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,440
You are pretty handsome.

238
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,760
You are pretty even when you work.

239
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,440
I was spectating the sea,

240
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,480
so I saw the same thing.

241
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,840
I just know they are near here.

242
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,560
I wonder

243
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,480
they are at your place?

244
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,960
했 is quite scared.

245
00:10:47,880 --> 00:11:05,360
So I asked my floods

246
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,240
to be on my account on my account card.

247
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,080
The functions I claim

248
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,720
I just stepped on it and broke it.

249
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,920
I'm sorry.

250
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,440
Okay.

251
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,600
Don't explain so much.

252
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,960
How do you solve this?

253
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,160
Well,

254
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,680
I'll pay you.

255
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,080
How much money did you buy?

256
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,680
How much money did you pay?

257
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,800
More than ten thousand yuan.

258
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,560
More than ten thousand yuan?

259
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,160
He'll pay you.

260
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,600
Sir, don't worry.

261
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,520
He'll pay you for the original price.

262
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,800
Three months' salary.

263
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,480
Sir, here's the thing.

264
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,480
I'll tell you a logic.

265
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,000
I just praised him.

266
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,960
I said he was handsome.

267
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,680
Is it wrong?

268
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,480
It's not wrong, right?

269
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,120
He hit me when he turned around.

270
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,080
I hit you when he hit me.

271
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,560
Right?

272
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,960
If he doesn't hit me, I can't hit you.

273
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,040
If he doesn't hit me,

274
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,560
I can't step on your glasses, can I?

275
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,360
If he doesn't hit me,

276
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,000
I don't have to pay you more than ten thousand yuan.

277
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,880
Isn't it?

278
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
He's the culprit.

279
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,760
You ask him to pay you.

280
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,560
Because he's rich.

281
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,680
Such a big clinic is all his.

282
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
He's a rich man.

283
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,960
He's rich.

284
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,960
Do you know?

285
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,360
What are you looking at?

286
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,600
You're just a moral abuser.

287
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,480
What's wrong with you?

288
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,120
Are you Professor Ren's son?

289
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,440
Yes, you are.

290
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,920
You're my daughter's savior.

291
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,440
I'm Xu Meng's father.

292
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,960
Xu Meng, do you remember?

293
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
How is she now?

294
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,000
Not very good.

295
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,640
Is your eyes still open?

296
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,600
She's crazy.

297
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,640
Crazy?

298
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,920
Mengmeng has been very good since she was a kid.

299
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,800
We didn't care much about her life and study.

300
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,840
Maybe she was too strict with her child since she was a kid.

301
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,160
She can't tell the difference between good and bad.

302
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,480
That's why she was cheated.

303
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,400
Do you know this boy?

304
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,200
No, she doesn't tell me.

305
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,880
I'm too close to her mother.

306
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,040
Actually,

307
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,040
we know this.

308
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,520
It's much earlier than you.

309
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,760
You must have never asked.

310
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,680
Maybe she said it before.

311
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,800
You just don't know.

312
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,120
Mr. Xu,

313
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,080
Mengmeng has some new problems recently.

314
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,840
What's the specific situation?

315
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,640
Shall we ask her?

316
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,720
She's in a bad state.

317
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,320
Her personality before was gentle.

318
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,960
She's very nice.

319
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,760
Now she has only two real homeless kids.

320
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,640
She can kick and

321
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,520
use her magnetic energy.

322
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
Magic energy?

323
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,360
She has done all the anything she could!

324
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,400
But now I don't dare bring all kinds of Pour Whip or Umbrella.

325
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,840
I have no isle!

326
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,560
For your embarrassment

327
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,320
I can't cook at all.

328
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,720
I only can have dinner.

329
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,320
Have you tried to go to other hospitals?

330
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,320
Before,

331
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,760
we took him to the fourth hospital.

332
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,200
They gave him an electric shock treatment in the fourth hospital.

333
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
Electric shock?

334
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,440
But you know what?

335
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,040
After that electric shock treatment,

336
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,400
the child

337
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,360
broke down even more.

338
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,160
Now, you know what?

339
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,600
He doesn't talk,

340
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,000
he doesn't want to move,

341
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,840
he doesn't even go to school.

342
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,100
Do you mean this child

343
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,040
was actually birthed on the fourth day people died?

344
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,960
I am really helpless.

345
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,920
Doctor Geng,

346
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,440
I was wondering

347
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,040
that this child's life is gifted to you

348
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,200
so that I can only come back to you

349
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:57,400
to ask for

350
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,900
your help.

351
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,080
Everything's fine now.

352
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,800
I'll find Kean pomers now,

353
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:13,440
and leave to Jin

354
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:23,760
Give him any advice

355
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,120
feelings

356
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,240
I'm sorry.

357
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,600
Mengmeng.

358
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,000
Mengmeng.

359
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,400
Mengmeng, just take a foot massage.

360
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,040
Are you cold?

361
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,800
Put on your shoes.

362
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,400
Mengmeng.

363
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,680
Mengmeng.

364
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,960
Mengmeng.

365
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,320
Mengmeng.

366
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,280
I'm Dr. Song.

367
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,640
Do you remember me?

368
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,880
Dr. Song.

369
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,000
We met in the hospital.

370
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,840
Dr. Song.

371
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,840
Mengmeng.

372
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,360
Don't be afraid.

373
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,440
It's okay.

374
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,680
Don't be afraid.

375
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,840
Don't be afraid.

376
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,240
Don't be afraid.

377
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,120
Don't be afraid.

378
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,400
Mr. Xu.

379
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,280
Please go out for a while.

380
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,160
I'll talk to my husband.

381
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,440
Please.

382
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,080
Don't be afraid.

383
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,440
It's okay.

384
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,640
It's okay.

385
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,080
Come on.

386
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,280
Look at Mengmeng.

387
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,840
How is she doing recently?

388
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,680
Look.

389
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,880
Look.

390
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,000
She's still beautiful.

391
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,160
She's still pretty.

392
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,160
Du Caixing.

393
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,600
Didn't we agree?

394
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,320
We must have someone

395
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,680
to watch Mengmeng at home.

396
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,600
Aunt.

397
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,320
What does she have to do with it?

398
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,440
Why do you have to leave today?

399
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,200
You're just a poor exhibition.

400
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,800
Why do you still have a meeting?

401
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,960
I...

402
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,800
I even quit my job.

403
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,360
Listen.

404
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,920
If anything happens to Mengmeng,

405
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,200
I'll kill you.

406
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,040
I'm telling you.

407
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,280
Your hand is a little cold.

408
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,720
Right?

409
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,200
Why is it so cold?

410
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,000
Let me touch it.

411
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,800
Okay?

412
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,880
Your hand is so cold.

413
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,800
It's okay.

414
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,480
It's okay.

415
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,240
I'm afraid you'll get sick.

416
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,520
Mengmeng.

417
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,880
Don't be so cold.

418
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:14,920
Come on.

419
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,680
Get on the bed.

420
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,160
Sit on the bed.

421
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:17,840
Come on.

422
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,520
Take your time.

423
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,080
Right.

424
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,780
Sit on the bed.

425
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:34,680
educated man

426
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,680
Dr. Ren.

427
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,560
I'm sorry.

428
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,200
Our family doesn't do that.

429
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,120
Her mom really has an emergency today,

430
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,360
otherwise she even can't

431
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,720
don't treat the patient today.

432
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,120
Yes, I understand.

433
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,760
But your daughter

434
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,680
is not sick.

435
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,440
Not sick?

436
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,560
Dr. Ren.

437
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,480
So

438
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,440
it's not as serious as you think.

439
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,960
In the Chinese medicine,

440
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,440
it's a temperamental anemia.

441
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,360
Just adjust the liver.

442
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,280
That simple?

443
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,520
It's a simple thing.

444
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,040
Lift it up.

445
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,520
Yes.

446
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,320
Lift this foot up.

447
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,640
Let's put the foot on.

448
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,600
It won't be cold

449
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,360
right away.

450
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,640
Right?

451
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,520
Yes.

452
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,960
Your parents

453
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,400
will treat it with your daughter.

454
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,160
Together?

455
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,680
Yes.

456
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,360
Us?

457
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:37,960
Yes.

458
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,960
What?

459
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,040
Your parents and daughter are in love.

460
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,560
So your family

461
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,640
should treat her disease together.

462
00:19:51,400 --> 00:20:10,840
You makeInka

463
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,800
So I heard you say

464
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,400
two girls' housing

465
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,480
is awful because of the disease.

466
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
to the doctor?

467
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,760
I understand.

468
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,400
We can put the end

469
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,040
on the girl

470
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,240
who has public health.

471
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
She has skin disease.

472
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,080
It's relatively easy.

473
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,280
Dad,

474
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,320
I think

475
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,080
Xu Meng's disease

476
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,200
is more difficult to cure than Ding Jianxi's.

477
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,320
In fact, for Ding Jianxi,

478
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,520
the purpose of the drug

479
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,760
is to give her hope.

480
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,320
Dad.

481
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,720
How did you see the patient?

482
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,760
Didn't you see my mom

483
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,920
waiting for 40 minutes?

484
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,160
You don't have a mother.

485
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,040
I tell you,

486
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,800
if you don't look after my mom today,

487
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,840
you won't live a good life.

488
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,960
You're a man.

489
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,480
Why do you bully a nurse?

490
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,720
The nurse didn't have 40 minutes.

491
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,680
What do you know?

492
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,560
Her mom's stomach is so full.

493
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,480
But the nurse

494
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,920
asked her to go to the clinic tomorrow morning.

495
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,640
It's true.

496
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,400
Yes, it's true.

497
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,040
You're right.

498
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,720
That's why the nurse is busy.

499
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,720
The nurse just saved a child

500
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,120
from a stuck-up child.

501
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,000
She didn't show them.

502
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,520
I've told you.

503
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,360
Emergency room is a place to save lives.

504
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,400
Wei Zhangxin has been in the emergency room for more than ten days.

505
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,120
She will go to the clinic tomorrow.

506
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,720
You're a nurse.

507
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,080
What do you know?

508
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,040
If my mom has a problem,

509
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,200
you can't take responsibility.

510
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,600
No check-up is done.

511
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,920
Since we're gone,

512
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,320
you have to do a check-up with my mom today.

513
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
Otherwise,

514
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,520
you'll all be fired.

515
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,720
Yes.

516
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,880
You can't do it.

517
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,600
Come on.

518
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,320
What's wrong with you?

519
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:41,920
Come here.

520
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,840
Let go of me.

521
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,960
I'll help you check her.

522
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,160
Let go of me.

523
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,480
Let go of me.

524
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,680
Let go of me.

525
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,680
Let go of me.

526
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,320
Who are you?

527
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,160
What are you doing?

528
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,560
You're helping me.

529
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,160
Why are you shouting? Call the police.

530
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,240
Call the police now.

531
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,840
Who are you?

532
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,360
Who am I?

533
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,680
Listen to me.

534
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,880
I'm in charge of all the nurses.

535
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,400
I'm taking care of all the nurses.

536
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,320
What's wrong with you?

537
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,360
You don't know the emergency room is a place to save lives.

538
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,440
What's wrong?

539
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,640
You don't know how to line up?

540
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,720
Do you have any quality?

541
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,840
Listen to me.

542
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,280
From now on,

543
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,240
you should respect the medical staff.

544
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,000
Do you understand?

545
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,240
Can't you line up?

546
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,000
Right?

547
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,040
We're in an emergency.

548
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,840
There are so many people.

549
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,400
Auntie is fine.

550
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,920
She looks fine.

551
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,000
Right?

552
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,680
You're talking nonsense.

553
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,520
From now on,

554
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,880
we're all responsible for our respect.

555
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,480
Do it.

556
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,240
Teach her.

557
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,160
Do you understand?

558
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,400
Do you understand?

559
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,800
Don't worry.

560
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,240
We went to the Meng family today.

561
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,280
She was very reserved to her family.

562
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,560
She was kind to us.

563
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,200
Actually, her parents loved her very much.

564
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,680
But I think

565
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,120
she hates her parents.

566
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,160
She should give up

567
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,320
her hatred.

568
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,480
I'm afraid

569
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,200
she may

570
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,280
commit suicide

571
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
and jump off the building

572
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,760
one day.

573
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,840
It's so serious.

574
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,360
Did her parents

575
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,520
accompany her?

576
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,760
Her parents were busy.

577
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,920
Actually, the way they love their children is wrong.

578
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,920
Mom, I'm telling you.

579
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,000
Her mother

580
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,800
has installed countless cameras

581
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,320
in the house.

582
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,600
You know, she has a

583
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,520
wide-angle surveillance camera.

584
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,120
The house in her house

585
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,960
looks like

586
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,280
a model house.

587
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,200
It's luxurious.

588
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,400
But the child

589
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,920
lives in a luxurious

590
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,720
bird cage.

591
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,880
This kind of case

592
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,280
is a problem

593
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,640
for people to treat.

594
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,600
But

595
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,760
their patients

596
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,800
have to be treated together.

597
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,800
I asked her parents to come here.

598
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,640
I gave her

599
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,840
a five-step needle.

600
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,840
She needs to be treated together.

601
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Xinzheng told her father today.

602
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,440
But she said

603
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,680
she was going on a business trip.

604
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,920
She will be abroad for more than half a month.

605
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,640
She is not even in a good condition.

606
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,080
Her children

607
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,000
are all

608
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,560
hard-hearted.

609
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,440
But they are

610
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,640
hard to be broken.

611
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,280
If you really love your child,

612
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,120
you should listen to her.

613
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
She doesn't cooperate with you.

614
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,680
I have a divine hand.

615
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,400
It's hard to save her.

616
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,120
I just made it.

617
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:54,640
It's hot.

618
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,440
Sorry.

619
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,000
Have a look.

620
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,360
Is it good?

621
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,280
It's good.

622
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
It's getting better.

623
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,920
You.

624
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,200
Why are you so quiet?

625
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,920
Look at you.

626
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,040
You didn't eat enough oranges, right?

627
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,240
Tian Xinxin.

628
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,640
You should be kind.

629
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,040
I was talking for you.

630
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,920
Okay.

631
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,160
Okay.

632
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,640
I don't care about this anymore.

633
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,440
I'll watch you.

634
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,800
I don't care.

635
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,720
You are here.

636
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,240
No one is bullying me.

637
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,840
I tell you, it's because of you.

638
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,320
I don't even have a boyfriend.

639
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,160
What's the use of finding a boyfriend?

640
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,000
Well,

641
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,680
if you find a boyfriend

642
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,720
and he bullies you,

643
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,440
I'll still keep him.

644
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,720
Actually, the key now

645
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,520
is that Mengmeng

646
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,880
must get out of the circle

647
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,600
she drew for herself.

648
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,800
She needs to re-establish her confidence and dignity.

649
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,160
Mom.

650
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
Let her come to the clinic.

651
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,640
I'll help her.

652
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,040
If she can't go to school now,

653
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,120
let her come to the city class.

654
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,400
I'll take her to school.

655
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,440
If her parents are busy,

656
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,520
let her stay at home.

657
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,360
I'll take care of her.

658
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,160
If you do this,

659
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,800
do you know how big the risk is?

660
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,120
Yes.

661
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,120
She was my patient.

662
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,360
She almost died

663
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,800
because of my mistake.

664
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,320
I must take full responsibility this time.

665
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,200
No.

666
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,600
Your dad is right.

667
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,760
This is too big a responsibility.

668
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,760
We can't

669
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
watch her

670
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,520
24 hours a day.

671
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,320
What if something happens?

672
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,480
What should we do?

673
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,240
Mom.

674
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,800
The medicine king Sun Si Miao said

675
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,360
if there's an emergency,

676
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,120
we can't ask for help.

677
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,640
We're all equal.

678
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,080
We can't separate.

679
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,600
Is that true?

680
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,760
How does this girl look like?

681
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,280
Dad.

682
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,800
I heard you say that.

683
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,120
This girl is

684
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,160
both rich and strict.

685
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,680
I'm worried

686
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,360
you have a good heart.

687
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,080
But it's easy to misunderstand the city

688
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,320
and be heartless.

689
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,960
You...

690
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,880
I'm so angry.

691
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,200
Hello?

692
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,800
You caught her again?

693
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,320
Yes, she still��

694
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,120
That's good.

695
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,880
I'll go out for a while.

696
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,520
Who told you that?

697
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,260
You didn't tell me

698
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,160
if you weren't responsible.

699
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,940
Who did?

700
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,120
What,

701
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,240
I.

702
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,640
I'm not.

703
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,240
What does it belong to? It belongs to honor.

704
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,840
I'll share it with you.

705
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,840
Understand?

706
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,880
Pack up your things and live in our house.

707
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,080
Live in your...

708
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,000
No.

709
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,040
No.

710
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,040
Why should I live in your house?

711
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,280
You...

712
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,240
Stop.

713
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,880
You're the one who lives in his house.

714
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,480
Listen.

715
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,440
You have to be under my surveillance for 24 hours.

716
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,520
Do you know why?

717
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,480
My master gave me this job

718
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
to bring you out.

719
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,840
Please don't add more work for me.

720
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,960
I can't afford to pay for my family.

721
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,480
You can't afford it today.

722
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,720
This...

723
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,440
No.

724
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,080
Master.

725
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,000
Master.

726
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,240
I...

727
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,440
I won't go back.

728
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,040
My best friend...

729
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,840
My best friend...

730
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,880
You can think I'm missing.

731
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,240
Master.

732
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:55,880
Master.

733
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,440
You don't know how many rooms there are in the house?

734
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,160
The worst thing is

735
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,720
to pick up a cat or dog.

736
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,320
You two are so lucky.

737
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,720
You have a son.

738
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,560
You can pick up people at home.

739
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,000
How many things should I do

740
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,400
if I have two more people?

741
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,520
You two are so careless.

742
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,680
You don't do anything.

743
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,720
We're two girls.

744
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,800
They'll take care of themselves

745
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,760
one more time.

746
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,840
They're both

747
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,480
the best.

748
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,680
They said they'd take care of themselves.

749
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,400
I have to be worried.

750
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,160
I asked Toto to stay at home.

751
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,680
I have to consider it.

752
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,200
Mengmeng can't leave her for 24 hours.

753
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,400
I'm worried about her sleeping at night.

754
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,440
Who can stay with her for 24 hours?

755
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,960
Toto is here.

756
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,800
They have a son.

757
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,000
Sun Toto.

758
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
He's a second-rate.

759
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,200
Can you count on him?

760
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,320
I have to stand by Toto this time.

761
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,040
Although I made a mistake,

762
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,480
he's definitely standing by you.

763
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,600
Okay.

764
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,640
I'll help you move this.

765
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,640
You?

766
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,840
You can't carry or lift your shoulders.

767
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,760
You'll hurt yourself later.

768
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,360
You didn't discuss with me

769
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,480
before you did anything.

770
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,400
I know you're a reasonable person.

771
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,600
You asked Toto to stay outside.

772
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,080
You lost money when something happened.

773
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,240
You kept all the money.

774
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,000
You have to follow the teacher.

775
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,040
What do you think?

776
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,680
It's not about learning.

777
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,520
It's about asking for the same thing.

778
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,000
I did it for the teacher.

779
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,160
I married you.

780
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,400
I have to make sure

781
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,640
I'm in the same room with the teacher.

782
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,560
I heard that

783
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,480
she has a boyfriend, right?

784
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,160
Human heart disease.

785
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,240
You're calling me by my name.

786
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,040
I guess you're really angry.

787
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,240
I'm sorry.

788
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,920
I'm sorry.

789
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,560
Tell me what you did wrong.

790
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,720
This is the fourth

791
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,320
philosophical test of my life.

792
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,560
You pity me and I pity you.

793
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,960
Whoever can reach the construction site

794
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,400
you are the best.

795
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:25,960
Trust me!

796
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,600
I'll go myself!

797
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,080
So sad!

798
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,080
I'm sorry.

799
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,080
I'm sorry.

800
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,080
I'm sorry.

801
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
I'm sorry.

802
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,080
I'm sorry.

803
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
I'm sorry.

804
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
I'm sorry.

805
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
I'm sorry.

806
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,080
I'm sorry.

807
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,080
I'm sorry.

808
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,080
I'm sorry.

809
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,080
I'm sorry.

810
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,080
I'm sorry.

811
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
I'm sorry.

812
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
I'm sorry.

813
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,080
I'm sorry.

814
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
I'm sorry.

815
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,080
I'm sorry.

816
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,080
I'm sorry.

817
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,080
I'm sorry.

818
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,080
I'm sorry.

819
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
I'm sorry.

820
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,080
I'm sorry.

821
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,080
I'm sorry.

822
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,080
I'm sorry.

823
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,080
I'm sorry.

824
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,080
I'm sorry.

825
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,080
I'm sorry.

826
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,080
I'm sorry.

827
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,080
Director Lin,

828
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,080
her mom nearly broke the deal

829
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,080
because of this.

830
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,080
Got it.

831
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,080
Doc Peng.

832
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,080
There's a kid to ואיר דה unforg.

833
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,080
Okay, I'll be there at once.

834
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,080
Okay.

835
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,080
Weрон ε弃 all want to deal with

836
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,080
calls ofAlmeida.

837
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,220
You're brave,

838
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,220
right?

839
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,220
Of course you won't cry,

840
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,220
come,

841
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,220
now we'll make an mote.

842
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,480
Mom, it's all his fault.

843
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,400
What are you doing?

844
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,320
You're all doing this to my kid.

845
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,960
Mom, it's all my fault.

846
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,440
Mom,

847
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,880
why don't you tell the kids

848
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,960
to get the surgery done first?

849
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,360
I'm sorry.

850
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,120
Mr. Ye, you're the best, right?

851
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,000
Do you want to go play?

852
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,120
Thanks, Lu Han.

853
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,200
If it weren't for you,

854
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,520
I'd be beaten to death.

855
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,440
This is all written in the textbook.

856
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,720
You're an intern.

857
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,320
You have a lot to learn.

858
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,880
Hello.

859
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,200
Mengmeng.

860
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,680
Mengmeng,

861
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,200
do you remember me?

862
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,360
We met at the supermarket.

863
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,760
I have an injection here.

864
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,280
I'm Ren Tianzhen.

865
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,280
Hello?

866
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,240
It's the knightship today.

867
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,080
Later,

868
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,440
we're going to pick the chrysanthemum tea.

869
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,240
There might be water lilies

870
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,640
at the backstage.

871
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,600
It's very Mind-blowing.

872
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,560
Do you want to join us?

873
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,720
Let's go.

874
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,520
Come on.

875
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,080
Come on.

876
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,440
Don't be afraid.

877
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,600
Be careful.

878
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,480
Look, it's over there.

879
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,360
Over there. Let's go.

880
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:10,920
Mengmeng,

881
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,880
stop the car outside later.

882
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,320
We'll take the bus together.

883
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,160
Why hasn't Mr. Xu arrived yet?

884
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,240
He rushed to America last night.

885
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,040
He'll be back this weekend.

886
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,680
Please tell him

887
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,880
to come back

888
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,400
as soon as possible.

889
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,320
It's very important.

890
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,200
Mr. Song,

891
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,960
I'm sorry.

892
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,760
I have to leave now.

893
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,000
Well,

894
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,560
the exhibition next month

895
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,600
will be announced.

896
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,880
The fire is hidden.

897
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,880
My flowers are too expensive.

898
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,240
So I have to go back and keep an eye on them.

899
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,800
Didn't you say

900
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,840
parents should treat the disease together?

901
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,240
Look, Mr. Xu isn't here.

902
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,400
When he comes back,

903
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,600
we'll come together.

904
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,120
Mengmeng is your child.

905
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,040
If you put everything

906
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,640
in front of the child,

907
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,080
I can't help it.

908
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:04,960
But life

909
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,680
is not a TV show.

910
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,840
It won't come back.

911
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,560
Time is a linear development.

912
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,200
It's impossible to stop for anyone.

913
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,480
Sweet life will come to you from now on.

914
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,640
Yes, he scientific labels

915
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,680
the fairy tales you want to hear.

916
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,640
He explains them for you.

917
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,640
Let's wait for him to show up.

918
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,560
Mengmeng, don't worry.

919
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,320
I'm fine.

920
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,320
Relax.

921
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,840
It's okay.

922
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,840
Mengmeng!

923
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,320
You're finally here!

924
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,160
Wait a minute.

925
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,920
Wait a minute.

926
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,160
You don't remember me, Mengmeng?

927
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,960
Mengmeng, listen to me.

928
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,760
Mengmeng, you don't remember me?

929
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,320
This is the girl

930
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,480
in the supermarket

931
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,280
you saw last time.

932
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,240
You saw me, Mengmeng.

933
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,000
Relax.

934
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
This is Sun Niu.

935
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,320
No.

936
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,600
Mengmeng, don't worry.

937
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,640
Don't mind these bad guys.

938
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,080
If you need anything,

939
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,880
just call me.

940
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,360
From now on,

941
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,400
we're friends.

942
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Don't be rude.

943
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,800
What are you talking about?

944
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
You're scared.

945
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,320
Stop it.

946
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:17,920
I'm not scared.

947
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,400
Let me hug you.

948
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:18,840
Stop it.

949
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,640
I'm fine.

950
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,800
It's March.

951
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,160
The flowers are in full bloom.

952
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,560
The spring water is in the window.

953
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,600
The autumn is here.

954
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,560
It's the time of the spring.

955
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,120
Uncle.

956
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,120
Uncle.

957
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,840
The ancients said

958
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,920
the spring water is in the window.

959
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,200
The spring water is in the window.

960
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,680
The spring water is in the window.

961
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
Now,

962
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,920
he's more and more

963
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,840
like you.

964
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
If you say so,

965
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,760
you should study more.

966
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,480
If I knew this poem,

967
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,160
I wouldn't have needed money.

968
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,160
You're right.

969
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,040
You should study more.

970
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,200
Look.

971
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,840
If you have a fight,

972
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,320
you can draw the attention.

973
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,840
There are flowers.

974
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,560
Don't move.

975
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,960
March in the spring.

976
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,160
The baby is born.

977
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,160
What does it mean?

978
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,480
Right wine.

979
00:37:45,480 --> 00:38:02,080
The wine can reflect the

980
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,840
art of arts

981
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,200
and focus the aqueous.

982
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,140
Give me two.

983
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:09,400
I'm !"

984
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:09,880
$%

985
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,240
Mega.

986
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,520
Why don't you put on a sweater for me?

987
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,920
It's good that you call me.

988
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,720
No problem.

989
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,680
No.

990
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,440
Tuotuo.

991
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,800
You are really a little...

992
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,360
No, Brother Li Chen.

993
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,560
The wind is so strong here.

994
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,480
The wind is so strong.

995
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,120
I feel weak.

996
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,200
When the wind blows,

997
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,760
you feel uncomfortable.

998
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,680
You don't understand me.

999
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,480
What are you doing?

1000
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,240
What do you mean?

1001
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,640
I'm a girl too.

1002
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,920
Why can't I be cold?

1003
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,280
Go.

1004
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,280
I'll help you.

1005
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,560
Let's go.

1006
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,720
Let's go.

1007
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,360
I'm leaving.

1008
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,080
Let's go.

1009
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,400
It's so disgusting.

1010
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,720
Mr. Yuan.

1011
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,320
Are you crazy?

1012
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,200
Why are you so arrogant?

1013
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,720
You brought it for everyone.

1014
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,240
Why don't you help me?

1015
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,440
You can't catch me.

1016
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,720
Okay.

1017
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,200
What are you doing?

1018
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:40,960
Don't.

1019
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,120
No.

1020
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,040
Go away.

1021
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,080
Ji Fahai.

1022
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,440
I'm a fast learner.

1023
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,240
Otherwise, you'll be in trouble today.

1024
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,520
Right?

1025
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,480
Let go.

1026
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,640
Tuotuo.

1027
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,720
You can't be so arrogant.

1028
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,960
No, Master.

1029
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,840
Look at him.

1030
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,440
He brought this basket for every girl.

1031
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,320
He didn't give it to me.

1032
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:08,920
What does he mean?

1033
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,920
You haven't paid

1034
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,000
for your father's glasses, right?

1035
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,560
Be careful.

1036
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,520
Come here.

1037
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,240
Find the money.

1038
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,360
Coming.

1039
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,040
You should

1040
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,400
leave it to the chef.

1041
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,120
Chef.

1042
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:31,720
Are you okay?

1043
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,360
I'm fine.

1044
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,640
Why are you so good?

1045
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,720
I'm quite good.

1046
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,240
Get me another pot.

1047
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,240
Okay.

1048
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,760
Tuotuo.

1049
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,520
Tuotuo.

1050
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,960
Come here.

1051
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,120
Come here.

1052
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,120
Come on.

1053
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,480
Look over there.

1054
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,320
It's a silver box.

1055
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,000
Is it beautiful?

1056
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,760
Yes.

1057
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,560
I heard it.

1058
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,560
Can you

1059
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,560
sing together in separate voices?

1060
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,240
Why do you sing so well?

1061
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,040
Who's singing?

1062
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,160
Who is, indeed?

1063
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,780
All

1064
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,600
areотоing.

1065
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,600
They're all have their own type of mentality.

1066
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,080
So,

1067
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,480
I can tell

1068
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,160
your attitude

1069
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,120
toward them

1070
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,120
They all know.

1071
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,320
Tao Tao,

1072
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,400
can you find the star of Beidou?

1073
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,520
Stop joking, sir.

1074
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,160
If I can find the star of Beidou,

1075
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,440
I won't be lost

1076
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,320
on the mountain.

1077
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,480
I won't be lost.

1078
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,360
Listen,

1079
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,200
look.

1080
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,680
The brightest star here.

1081
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,960
One, two, three, four,

1082
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,160
five, six, seven.

1083
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,120
Imagine

1084
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,560
the star of Beidou

1085
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,960
as a bell.

1086
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,160
The star of Beidou

1087
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,080
is Gu Yu

1088
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,920
when it's dark.

1089
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,480
Dark?

1090
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,080
Yes.

1091
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,080
When is that?

1092
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,080
From seven to nine in the morning.

1093
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,880
It's time for breakfast.

1094
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,680
But why Gu Yu?

1095
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,760
It's not raining.

1096
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,200
It will rain tonight.

1097
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,400
Gu Yu is rainy.

1098
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,760
chau Afun

1099
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,080
There will always be some youth

1100
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:33,880
Meeting without regret

1101
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:39,360
There will always be some people

1102
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:43,080
Like the stars in the long night

1103
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:48,040
Time is silent

1104
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,640
Memories are remembered

1105
00:43:53,320 --> 00:44:02,080
The only thing I remember is the warmth and the balance

1106
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:06,800
If there is no pain in life

1107
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,640
I will light up a city for you

1108
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:16,560
People in the light are just ordinary identities

1109
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:22,680
Light up ordinary people with ordinary bodies

1110
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,000
Burn a wall of enthusiasm

1111
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,160
Use one sentence, we only meet people in this world

1112
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,400
Not just ordinary identities

1113
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:41,520
Light up ordinary people with ordinary bodies

1114
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,840
Burn a wall of enthusiasm

1115
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:51,000
Use one sentence, we only meet people in this world

1116
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,280
Not just ordinary identities

1117
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,800
Light up ordinary people with ordinary bodies

1118
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:03,680
Burn a wall of enthusiasm

1119
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:09,280
Use one sentence, we only meet people in this world

1120
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,040
Light up ordinary people with ordinary bodies

1121
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,800
Burn a wall of enthusiasm
