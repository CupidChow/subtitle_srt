00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There's another happy thing today.

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I met a patient I haven't seen for a long time,

5
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Ms. Jiang Li.

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So I really want to invite Ms. Jiang Li

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
to give us her opening speech.

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Please give her a round of applause.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Thank you.

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
First, I want to thank

11
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Professor Ren for giving me a second chance at survival.

12
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Before this, I was diagnosed with cancer.

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Professor Ren was the one who gave me advice.

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
My illness has completely healed.

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Now, I'm in the best time in my life.

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Children, you should learn well.

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Keep such a good Chinese doctor.

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Pass on the message.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Ms. Jiang, don't say that.

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's easy to misunderstand everyone.

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's not scientific.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Why is it not scientific?

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't care if it's scientific or not.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Whoever saves my life is a good doctor.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Ms. Jiang, thank you.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Thank you.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Those sitting here may not know

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
the student who asked the question just now is called Peng Shiyan.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He is a western doctor.

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
He is the class monitor in our Chinese medicine class.

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He is right.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Chinese medicine is not scientific.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Because Chinese medicine is a subject of study.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't know if Peng has ever seen

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
a scientific philosopher called Popol.

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He wrote a book called Objective Knowledge.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Maybe other students have read it.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He mentioned the relationship between

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
three worlds and each other in this book.

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
He thinks that the political and political party is science.

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Before, there was a book called The Sun.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
At that time, it was all science.

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Science is the process of leading people

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
to get closer to the truth step by step.

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It can be measured and calculated.

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But have you ever thought, little Peng,

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
how does music paint our scientific skills?

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
How does the pain of illness soar?

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The rocket has been launched.

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How can women's hearts be colored?

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So our world has many types of

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
portraiture.

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
There are subjective and objective.

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We can't treat subjective as the only world.

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We can't treat objective as the only standard.

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
For example,

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
the sun is a part of the sun.

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It is divided into two or three parts.

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
One part is the body.

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Everyone knows the body.

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The other part is the body.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It is very fast.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
For example, data, bacteria,

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
images, and grades.

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We also have the heart.

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The health of a person is measured from the body and heart.

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Two levels of measurement.

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The body should be flexible.

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The body and heart should be stable.

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So apart from these two,

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I think there is another type called the soul.

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The spirit.

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We need to have a higher pursuit of our thoughts.

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Everyone heard what Grandma Jiang said.

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
From a deeper perspective,

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
she is in a high state of panic.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The West may not be able to cure her.

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But if there is no Chinese medicine,

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
she may die of pain during the process of death.

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Fortunately, there is Chinese medicine.

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I asked her to pray to Buddha.

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Does it work?

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I am not talking about ghosts.

84
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I just hope

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
that in the final stage of Jiang's life,

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
if she can see the world and all beings,

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and eventually see herself,

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
then she will be able to live happily.

89
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
After all, climbing and bowing are also sports.

90
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Right?

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's better than lying down.

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Because when you move, you will raise your body.

93
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Raising your body

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
will give you energy to grow stronger.

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So in the theory of Chinese medicine,

96
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
the new power is much greater than the body.

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
A person has a strong belief and willpower.

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He will be able to overcome

99
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
the pain that is hard to bear in his body.

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Let me make an analogy.

101
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I said there was a car outside.

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I gave you 10,000 yuan.

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You brought the car in.

104
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Don't joke. I'm not that capable.

105
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Give me 10 million.

106
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
10 million?

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll try.

108
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Huang Zhengyuan, 100 million.

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll beat you if you bring the car in.

110
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Even if I can't do it,

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I can't.

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Shi Yan, what if your child is under the car?

113
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I can.

114
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I can really recognize things.

115
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Mothers can.

116
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Mothers can really.

117
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Everyone can search online.

118
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Many mothers can do it.

119
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You can't do it.

120
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It can exceed your knowledge of people.

121
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Everyone knows that people have potential.

122
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
We can sacrifice our ideals

123
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and beliefs for others.

124
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We can sacrifice our lives for others.

125
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In this respect,

126
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
in the eyes of science,

127
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
it's all not a solution.

128
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So I think

129
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
X is a tree.

130
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It can be standardized.

131
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It can be copied in large numbers.

132
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But it's not loyalty.

133
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I think loyalty is

134
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
the practice of one's own self.

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's the truth.

136
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This is why I set up the teacher-student class.

137
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Set up the teacher-student class

138
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
in the form of a teacher taking his apprentice.

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
In this,

140
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I can find people who are equal to me.

141
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Only in this way

142
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
can I pass on the truth.

143
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I set up the teacher-student class for so many years.

144
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's the first time I have this service.

145
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Professor Wu,

146
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
you are different from Professor Ren.

147
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You are a real man.

148
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I don't dare.

149
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
My senior is a real master.

150
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
There are a lot of great immortals around.

151
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I can only give a little.

152
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But I can help you solve

153
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
the problem of excessive exercise

154
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and muscle sore.

155
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I have a solution.

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
To be honest,

157
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
the ingredients here are good.

158
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You'll know it in a while.

159
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Come on.

160
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Hurry up.

161
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
To be honest,

162
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm not a person who can be honest to you.

163
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm not a person who can be honest to you.

164
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You will be very happy to see me.

165
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So, you should experience it sincerely.

166
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It makes you feel different.

167
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Hello, I'm No. 030158,

168
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
an envoy.

169
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's very good to serve you.

170
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Hello.

171
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Hello, I'm No. 030128,

172
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
serving you.

173
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Come on.

174
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,880
I have a guest.

175
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,080
I'll be there soon.

176
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,000
Professor Wu, you know him?

177
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,600
He's...

178
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,360
Mr. Zheng, let me introduce you.

179
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,320
Zhao Liquan.

180
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,560
He's a senior student

181
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,560
at the University of TCM.

182
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,400
Mr. Zhao,

183
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,800
this is Mr. Zheng,

184
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,000
who set up the scholarship

185
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,600
in our school.

186
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,400
The scholarship you studied

187
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,320
is sponsored by Mr. Zheng.

188
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Thank you, Mr. Zheng.

189
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,400
We've met before.

190
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,600
Oh?

191
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,400
When the school

192
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,720
gave you the scholarship?

193
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,160
There was another time

194
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,560
when I went to your school to study.

195
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,000
Oh, right.

196
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,560
I was the one who brought the scholarship.

197
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,360
I have so many students.

198
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,680
I love to bring them.

199
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,160
Mr. Zheng, let me tell you.

200
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,680
The kids now

201
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,920
are really amazing.

202
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,720
Just take it as a small piece of advice.

203
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,880
He's been studying

204
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,400
in the department of master's studies.

205
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,080
He's different from other students.

206
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,800
He's the real

207
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
real-time experience

208
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,800
of teaching.

209
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,000
Right.

210
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So I'm here to introduce him to you

211
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,680
so that you can experience

212
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,120
the high-quality medical service.

213
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,560
That's great.

214
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,840
It's my honor

215
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,080
to have a good experience.

216
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,320
You must try it.

217
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,840
Why are you still standing there?

218
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,320
Hurry up.

219
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:36,600
Okay.

220
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,400
Put it down.

221
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,520
Sit up.

222
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,480
Yes, Mr. Zheng.

223
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,440
Come on.

224
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,480
Is the water temperature okay?

225
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,240
Is it okay?

226
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,280
It's good.

227
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,120
Do you usually use tea bags

228
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,920
or salt?

229
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,120
Tea bags.

230
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:51,880
Okay.

231
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,840
Mr. Zheng.

232
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,920
You mentioned the math and the law.

233
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,760
You mentioned standardization and non-standardization.

234
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,240
You mentioned rationality and sensibility.

235
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,600
You mentioned主观 and客观.

236
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,760
And medical science

237
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,280
is constantly improving.

238
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Our awareness of people

239
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,920
is also constantly advancing.

240
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,600
But Chinese medicine

241
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,440
is just a book.

242
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,320
The Emperor's Inner Gold,

243
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,280
The Grass and the Wood,

244
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,160
The Business and the Cold.

245
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,280
Even the latest classic

246
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,000
is almost 500 years old.

247
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,880
We've made progress to this day.

248
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,200
Can we still be the same

249
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,720
as 500 years ago?

250
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,280
Okay.

251
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,440
Let's not talk about 500 years.

252
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,120
Let's say people in the 80s

253
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,040
have been through this.

254
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,480
They'll probably starve to death.

255
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,960
They won't use their phones.

256
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,840
They can't order food or take a taxi.

257
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,240
So why do we still need to

258
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,000
use the same medicine

259
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,280
as 1,000 or 2,000 years ago?

260
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,280
Isn't it a perfect match?

261
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,840
Well, Xiao Peng.

262
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,440
You just mentioned

263
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,840
Chinese medicine

264
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,840
hasn't changed

265
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,280
for more than 2,000 years.

266
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,760
So I want to ask you.

267
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,120
Technology has made progress.

268
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,880
So have we, humans,

269
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,040
changed

270
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,080
in the past 2,000 years?

271
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,200
Of course.

272
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,800
Human life is greatly extended.

273
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,680
Our development of the brain

274
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,560
and the interpretation of genes

275
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,440
have already exceeded the level of life and death.

276
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,840
Humanity

277
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,640
has also increased

278
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,640
its control over the earth.

279
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,440
I'm against it, Master Yuan.

280
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,440
I don't think it's a progress.

281
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,440
The earth

282
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,880
is a perfect

283
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,160
ecosystem.

284
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,440
Since humans

285
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,760
are at the top of the biotech,

286
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,600
all the harm is done by humans.

287
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,480
It's uncontrollable.

288
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
So once the earth

289
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,160
is controlled by humans,

290
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,160
how can you control human desire

291
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,240
and how can you stop humans

292
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,600
from harming other species?

293
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,440
Everything has its one side and two sides.

294
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,000
You can't just admit the A side

295
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,880
but deny the B side.

296
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,120
The ancients could see

297
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,120
the planets 270 light years away

298
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,240
with their own eyes.

299
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,560
But now they don't wear glasses

300
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,520
and can't read the characters.

301
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,480
Do you think it's a progress or a decline?

302
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,120
The mobile phone has become

303
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,040
a mechanism for our life to expand.

304
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,040
If we don't

305
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,040
have our mobile phones

306
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,560
when we go out every day,

307
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,360
we can't live.

308
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,120
Technology is the art of the heart.

309
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,400
But some things,

310
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,360
whether it was 2000 years ago

311
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,840
or 2000 years later,

312
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,640
have no meaning.

313
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,360
That is

314
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,880
human emotions.

315
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,960
If parents passed away

316
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,200
2000 years ago,

317
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,600
we would cry.

318
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,480
After 2000 years,

319
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,000
it's not because

320
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,680
we have our mobile phones now

321
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,440
that parents passed away.

322
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,880
We won't be sad anymore.

323
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,480
Students,

324
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,200
when I talk to you about reason,

325
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
you talk to me about emotion.

326
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,440
When I talk to you about emotion,

327
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,320
you talk to me about law.

328
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
When I talk to you about law,

329
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
you talk to me about humanity.

330
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,280
Can we

331
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,320
communicate on the same platform?

332
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,800
Well,

333
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,440
we can't put the Chinese medicine and Western medicine

334
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,320
into the same hall.

335
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,720
Because these two studies

336
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,880
are different.

337
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,680
You can't force the Chinese medicine and Western medicine

338
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,760
into the same hall.

339
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,440
You have to ask me

340
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,920
which of my prescriptions

341
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,140
is made of

342
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
handkerchief

343
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,120
and which is

344
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,480
made of rabbit blood.

345
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,480
I can't answer you.

346
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,240
This is your way of thinking.

347
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,560
I can only tell you

348
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,960
that people are the whole,

349
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,960
and medicine is the whole.

350
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,200
They are originally

351
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,400
working together.

352
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,360
Hao Shang,

353
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:31,920
encourage him

354
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,560
and ask him about it.

355
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,240
Please.

356
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,640
I hope

357
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,080
that Professor Zheng

358
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,040
can tell us

359
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,880
that science

360
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,560
can solve all wheels of problems.

361
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,720
I 🤩

362
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,040
in a global country

363
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,760
has stunt arts

364
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,680
andcket covered

365
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,400
medical centers also.

366
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,520
It seems

367
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,520
We are all the most popular ones.

368
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,520
In fact, everyone knows that

369
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
the smell of one Yin and one Yang.

370
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
Technology has improved.

371
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,520
In fact, the progress of technology

372
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,520
is just a little bit

373
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,520
very, very small in the universe.

374
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,520
We can't enlarge it to the full.

375
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,520
Everyone knows the harm to the body.

376
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,520
Our inner core has already

377
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,520
said very, very clearly.

378
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,520
Then the outer shoes are wind, cold,

379
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,520
heat, wet, and fire.

380
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
The inner shoes are

381
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,520
joy, anger, worry, thought,

382
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,520
fear, fear, fear.

383
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
No matter how you progress,

384
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
these things

385
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
can't be changed.

386
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Mr. Ren, you are wrong again.

387
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,520
Look,

388
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,520
the ancient people didn't eat well

389
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,520
or wear warm clothes.

390
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
But now people

391
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,520
don't lack food.

392
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,520
Then why is there

393
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,520
wind, cold, wet, and fire?

394
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,520
You mentioned it very well.

395
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Did you notice that

396
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,520
young people nowadays

397
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,520
don't wear much clothes in winter.

398
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,520
They wear shorts,

399
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
blow the air conditioner,

400
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,520
drink cold drinks.

401
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,520
Compared with the ancients,

402
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,520
they are much colder.

403
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
Look, I don't understand

404
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,520
the clothes of young people nowadays.

405
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,520
In winter,

406
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
they wear shorts

407
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
and pants.

408
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
I don't understand

409
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,520
whether it's beautiful

410
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
or not.

411
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
In ancient times,

412
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,520
it was called

413
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,520
clothes without a body.

414
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,520
I think that

415
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,520
we don't know much

416
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
about modern technology

417
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
and fashion.

418
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
But I observed that

419
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,520
as long as there is a phone,

420
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,520
then our Mr. Dong's mirror chase

421
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
massage business

422
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,520
is very good.

423
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,520
If a beautiful girl

424
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
and a young man

425
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,680
wear clothes more and more

426
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
then our

427
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
unmarried,

428
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,520
unmarried,

429
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,520
this door will be open forever.

430
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,520
There is a saying in the emperor's inner capital.

431
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,520
Pain and pain are both in the heart.

432
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,520
You see that

433
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520
it's a disease on the skin.

434
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,520
In fact,

435
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,520
it makes the heart

436
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,520
to be nervous.

437
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
The body and the heart

438
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,520
can't be separated completely.

439
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,520
Some time ago,

440
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,520
I heard an expert in western medicine,

441
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,520
Professor Yang Xueqin of the Air Force General Hospital,

442
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,520
he talked about

443
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,520
many patients with silver blood disease.

444
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,520
In fact,

445
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,400
it's a

446
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,520
emotional externalization.

447
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,520
It's just

448
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,520
in line with the theory of Chinese medicine.

449
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,520
So I think

450
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,520
the relationship between Chinese and western medicine

451
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
is not a contrast.

452
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,520
It's to seek unification

453
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,520
in the difference.

454
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
Mr. Song is right.

455
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
I'll give you another example.

456
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
In my office,

457
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,520
there are two pots of tomatoes.

458
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,520
Everyone is familiar with them.

459
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
When we were not there,

460
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
they were ripe.

461
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,520
But later,

462
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,520
we saw that they were growing well

463
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
and wanted to change the environment.

464
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,520
They were in a good mood.

465
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,520
We let them go again

466
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
and let them grow.

467
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
They came back to life.

468
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
So I said

469
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,520
if we have acute disease,

470
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,520
for example, cancer,

471
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,520
I agree with the doctor.

472
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,520
If you don't,

473
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
the disease

474
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
is like

475
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,520
a heavy truck

476
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,520
on a highway

477
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,520
that doesn't have a brake.

478
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,520
It will lose control and run wild.

479
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,520
The result is that the truck is destroyed.

480
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
So we

481
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,520
gave it a shot

482
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
and let the patient

483
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
stay for a while.

484
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
Then we

485
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
gave it a little

486
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
external force

487
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,520
to let it

488
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
repair itself.

489
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,520
Remember,

490
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,520
Zhong Yixi

491
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
is not the god of disease.

492
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,520
He is the one who helps the patient

493
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,520
to walk the healthy path.

494
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
I think

495
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
it is a good thing

496
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
that you are here.

497
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,520
Professor Ren,

498
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
I feel

499
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
the meaning

500
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,520
of the worship ceremony.

501
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,520
Do you remember

502
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
the first time you saw me?

503
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,520
I was so desperate.

504
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
I felt

505
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,520
that I would die.

506
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
You gave me a recipe.

507
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,520
I persisted for a year

508
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,520
for this recipe.

509
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,520
I woke up just now.

510
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,520
Actually, you asked me

511
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
to wait for a year

512
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
to have a time

513
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
to calm down

514
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,520
from the sadness

515
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
and face a new life.

516
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
Right?

517
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,520
Thank you for your kind heart.

518
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,520
Actually,

519
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,520
I have helped

520
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,520
so many people

521
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
in our clinic.

522
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,520
I have met so many

523
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,520
people with good health.

524
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,520
Some people have good health

525
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
but they are mentally ill.

526
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,520
Some people have good health

527
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
but they are mentally ill.

528
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
As long as people live,

529
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,520
they won't be satisfied.

530
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,520
They are all

531
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
different men.

532
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,520
And,

533
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,520
there are so many

534
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,520
mothers who lost their children.

535
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
They have to

536
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,520
live a hard life.

537
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,520
In this way,

538
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
I feel very happy.

539
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Professor Ren,

540
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
thank you.

541
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,520
Thank you for your mercy.

542
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
Thank you for

543
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,520
walking with us.

544
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,520
Now,

545
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
my biggest feeling is

546
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,520
that

547
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,520
living is the most meaningful.

548
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,520
Xia is right.

549
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,520
We all have to

550
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,520
face our own difficulties.

551
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
If we can't solve

552
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
our difficulties,

553
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,520
we will get sick.

554
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,520
Either we will be sick

555
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,520
or mentally ill.

556
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520
Jianxi,

557
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,520
I know that

558
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
you used to

559
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,520
love freedom.

560
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
Now,

561
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,520
it's really hard

562
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
to tie you up.

563
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,520
But you have to promise me

564
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,520
that you won't give up.

565
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
I believe that

566
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
as long as we are together,

567
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,520
there will be no difficulties.

568
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
You are my best

569
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
daughter

570
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
no matter what.

571
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,520
You want to find

572
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,520
that 300-years-old bowl?

573
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Yes, yes, yes.

574
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,520
You are looking for me?

575
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
I just went to that mountain

576
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
and there's a big room

577
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,520
on that mountain

578
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,520
that was an old house

579
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,520
several hundred years ago.

580
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,520
Maybe

581
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,520
there will be the bowl

582
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,520
that you want.

583
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,520
I will get it for you.

584
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,520
Okay, okay, thank you.

585
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,520
Mrs. Zhang,

586
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,520
can you run?

587
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
Professor Ren said that

588
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,520
when a hole is made,

589
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
it can produce oxygen.

590
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,520
I have been working on it for so many years.

591
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,520
I don't know

592
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,520
I can raise my child.

593
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,120
I'll serve others

594
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,400
and do good deeds.

595
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,640
I'll do more contributions

596
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,360
to make my life longer.

597
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,120
Great!

598
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,000
Yanxi,

599
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,360
look.

600
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,440
The old man

601
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,000
who is sitting here today

602
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,160
and your brother and sister

603
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,480
are all

604
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,800
your uncles and aunts.

605
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,880
They all have one goal.

606
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,400
We love you.

607
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,120
So,

608
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,400
what's your reason

609
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,320
to give up your life?

610
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,920
To be a doctor,

611
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,960
I must be determined

612
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,840
and have no desires.

613
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,800
I'll give you my sincere heart.

614
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,240
I'll try to save Hanlin.

615
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,040
If there's an evil person to save him,

616
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,520
I'll ask him for help.

617
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,520
I'll protect him.

618
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,400
I'll do good deeds.

619
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,200
I'll do more contributions.

620
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,760
I'll be a doctor

621
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,160
and do good deeds.

622
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,560
I'll do more contributions.

623
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,200
I'll do more contributions.

624
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,760
I'll do more contributions.

625
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,680
I'll do more contributions.

626
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,400
Remember to do good deeds.

627
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,320
Anyone who plunders for the interest of Coalition

628
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,360
can be used only for twenty percent of his life

629
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,740
It'll be a commoner and a traitor

630
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,140
Watering of風cible China

631
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,040
even if he'll be in danger

632
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,320
Since the capitalmm

633
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,720
Give me five words

634
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,000
for this harmony.

635
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,280
I will beiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiig

636
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,440
I will beiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing

637
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,800
Your father really didn't lie to me

638
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,200
You are pure- hearted

639
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,320
Where did you find this sentence?

640
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,320
But this year,

641
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,120
I saw our new

642
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,520
city-building class.

643
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,640
I believe it.

644
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,640
I really believe it.

645
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,520
Jiang Daan is right.

646
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,160
Your father is a real god.

647
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,560
I finally see it.

648
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,800
You and your father

649
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
can't get along.

650
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,280
You two are

651
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,960
both bragging and believing.

652
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,280
When did I brag?

653
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,160
I'm telling the truth.

654
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,640
I've never

655
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,960
seen such a magical person.

656
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,360
He said it.

657
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,360
He saved all the people.

658
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,600
He realized it.

659
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,120
You don't know

660
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,160
what he didn't realize, right?

661
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,480
He doesn't want to tell you.

662
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,880
He didn't realize it.

663
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,280
What didn't he realize?

664
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,560
I'm not telling you.

665
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,040
Tell me.

666
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,960
You can't keep secrets.

667
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,960
I can keep secrets.

668
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,000
I can keep secrets

669
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,800
your father asked me to keep.

670
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,600
What secrets did my father ask you to keep?

671
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,400
Because

672
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:47,440
сд

673
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,960
I promised him.

674
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,120
I can't tell him.

675
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,800
I'm telling you

676
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,080
a secret from my father.

677
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:53,880
Then I found out

678
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,040
that you had to

679
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,600
tell me a secret from my father.

680
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,120
Do you mind?

681
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,080
My dad has a girlfriend.

682
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,680
Change your mother.

683
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,800
No.

684
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,880
Your dad is not that kind of person.

685
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,680
And you just want to lie to me.

686
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,480
You want me to tell you my name first

687
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,240
and then tell me

688
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,720
that there is nothing, right?

689
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,000
My dad's girlfriend

690
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,640
is called Xiaobai Ling.

691
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,920
Bird?

692
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,200
What's the name?

693
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
Only you can think of

694
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,560
such a bad trick.

695
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,400
Really.

696
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,080
Who told you to hang it?

697
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,560
Stand down.

698
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,600
Didn't you tell me to hang it?

699
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,840
Take it down first.

700
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,480
Take it down.

701
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,720
I can't stand this whip.

702
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,240
I have to be afraid.

703
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,360
This is what Wu Chenwen said.

704
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,200
Come on.

705
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,000
I can cure someone's disease

706
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,000
but I can't change someone else's life.

707
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,720
Granny Jiang gives you cause

708
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,600
because her mood has changed.

709
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,640
She may not treat

710
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,480
others' diseases.

711
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,000
But the next day she'll be back.

712
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,360
She will always

713
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,840
league in a circle.

714
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,880
Zhu Changming.

715
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,680
This is Zhu Changming.

716
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,840
If someone

717
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,640
wants to hats off to this talk,

718
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,720
he must rely on his beliefs

719
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,280
and yazzer-aids at past.

720
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,080
You got that?

721
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,080
I didn't accept the plaque

722
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,000
for stealing the Celestial Palace

723
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,160
and stealing other people's palaces.

724
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,840
Why did you accept it then?

725
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,880
I won't refuse

726
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,160
no matter how low my EQ is.

727
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,520
When I started my business,

728
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,880
I was given a gift.

729
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,680
How about this?

730
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,000
I'll put it behind the chair.

731
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,840
So that you won't be upset

732
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,560
and feel uneasy.

733
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,120
Just put it there.

734
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,520
I...

735
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,600
Lou Tu.

736
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,960
You still have a long way

737
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,160
to go.

738
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,480
You are destined

739
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,880
for whatever you do.

740
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,320
but Li Clausian did.

741
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,120
Master,

742
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,360
actually, I didn't believe

743
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,760
that hard work could change your fate.

744
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,940
Because every little brother

745
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,460
sending chopsticks like us

746
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,540
puts in a lot of effort.

747
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,520
But in the end,

748
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,520
I didn't see anyone

749
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,180
fly high energy tossing her ways.

750
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:57,220
But now I believe it.

751
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,420
I really believe it.

752
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,260
Because I saw Miss Zhu,

753
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,380
Grandma Jiang,

754
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:05,940
and Sister Chenyin.

755
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,860
They are all changing their fate and efforts.

756
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,220
Although it's still a bad card,

757
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,860
they didn't give up.

758
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,220
They kept going.

759
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,420
So I think,

760
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,860
I'm a successor,

761
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,100
no matter how high the starting point is.

762
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:24,820
I...

763
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,260
I think I can do it.

764
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,420
Right?

765
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,460
It smells good.

766
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:54,740
It smells good.

767
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,380
Wine is the essence of food.

768
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,180
It's all here.

769
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,020
Today we are in a double celebration.

770
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,740
We can drink more.

771
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,060
Dad,

772
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,100
you are not in a double celebration.

773
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,820
Yes.

774
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,780
My house is a blessing in disguise.

775
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,620
I'm so happy.

776
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,020
The city office is reopening.

777
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,220
I'm so happy.

778
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,980
I should drink more.

779
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:21,900
Master.

780
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,700
Linglan didn't want to sell your house.

781
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,660
If he wanted to sell it,

782
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,260
he would sell our house.

783
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,780
But he didn't tell you on purpose.

784
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,300
He made you worry.

785
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,180
Come on.

786
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,420
Master, here.

787
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,260
I'll give you a toast.

788
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,860
Thank you for your kindness to the Chinese medicine.

789
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,260
Thank you for your kindness and care.

790
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,620
I'll give you a drink.

791
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,220
No.

792
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,860
Come on.

793
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,060
You gave me a toast.

794
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,100
You kowtowed to me.

795
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,100
You helped me.

796
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,860
No.

797
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,020
I'll give you a toast.

798
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,580
To your mother.

799
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,380
She is a good sister.

800
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:00,940
Yes.

801
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,500
I'll give my mother a toast.

802
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,300
No.

803
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:03,900
No.

804
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,340
We are old.

805
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,940
We will support you in the future.

806
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,620
We should be your other half.

807
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,620
It's not easy for Linglan.

808
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,900
Give Linglan a toast.

809
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,380
Thank you for your kindness.

810
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,060
Thank you for your kindness.

811
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,620
You are with a loser.

812
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,100
Cheers.

813
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,060
Cheers.

814
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,820
Cheers.

815
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,300
Who said he would kowtow to me?

816
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:42,900
Kowtow.

817
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,660
I kowtowed to you.

818
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,260
You are my wife.

819
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,580
I love you so much that I can't forget you

820
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,620
What!

821
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,180
Hyung!

822
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,180
I'm so mad at you.

823
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,340
I'm so lucky.

824
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,260
I'm so lucky.

825
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,060
But,

826
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:20,980
Mr. Yang,

827
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,980
do you know when you were teaching on the stage,

828
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,740
I saw you

829
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,140
and I still admire you.

830
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,380
Really.

831
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,300
I'm not kidding.

832
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,140
Look,

833
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,340
now,

834
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,900
I'm so passionate

835
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,980
for the Chinese medicine

836
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,500
like you.

837
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,380
You have no regrets,

838
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,140
you have done a great job,

839
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,180
and you...

840
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,660
Well,

841
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,780
What did he say about you?

842
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,780
You're young and wise.

843
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,500
It's just that

844
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,620
you're like this.

845
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,220
You're so passionate

846
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,900
about the Chinese medicine

847
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,740
and you can

848
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,420
give up your career.

849
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,340
I think

850
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,900
not many people can do that.

851
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,780
I admire you from the bottom of my heart.

852
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,380
I'm so proud of you.

853
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,100
You won't scold me anymore, right?

854
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,100
I'll answer you after I drink.

855
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,020
You say it.

856
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,700
Cheers.

857
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,340
Dad.

858
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,340
Let's have another drink.

859
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,620
Come on.

860
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,820
I'll answer you now.

861
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,500
From now on,

862
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,700
don't always stand in front of me.

863
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,620
You

864
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,260
just stand on the stage

865
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,580
and teach me.

866
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,340
I think

867
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,020
we can maintain

868
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,300
a stable relationship.

869
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:46,820
Dad,

870
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,580
why are you scolding me

871
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,580
if he doesn't scold you anymore?

872
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,060
Of course.

873
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:51,700
Son,

874
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,060
to be honest,

875
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,220
I feel guilty

876
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,580
every time I scold you.

877
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,380
Because I think

878
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,780
you're an angel

879
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,980
sent by God.

880
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,020
But

881
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,860
every time I scold your dad,

882
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,820
I always feel that I haven't scolded enough.

883
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,260
Look.

884
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,940
What comes out of your stomach

885
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,500
is different from what comes out of your stomach.

886
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,260
Mom is right.

887
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,220
I'll give you a toast.

888
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:18,860
Come on.

889
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,460
Come on.

890
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,460
I'll call you master.

891
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,060
Come on.

892
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:23,940
Master.

893
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,140
Except for dad,

894
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,980
everyone else should drink.

895
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,020
Come on.

896
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,700
Let me drink.

897
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,940
Master, drink.

898
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:37,900
Come on.

899
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,540
I can't drink.

900
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,660
Right.

901
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,540
Drink less.

902
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,380
I can't drink.

903
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,820
Just one sip.

904
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,460
Look.

905
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,900
No alcohol.

906
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,500
Dad, vegetables.

907
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,420
Who is it?

908
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,420
I'll go and check.

909
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,180
You eat.

910
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,940
Eat.

911
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,300
Dad, rice cake.

912
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,620
Rice cake.

913
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,940
Why are you here?

914
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,380
Why so suddenly?

915
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,660
Actually, it's not sudden.

916
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,180
Meng has been absent for more than a year.

917
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,100
And

918
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,580
her recent condition is quite good.

919
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,740
We thought

920
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,060
we'd let her go back to school

921
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,300
in September.

922
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,660
She hasn't fully recovered yet.

923
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,100
It's risky for her to go back to school now.

924
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,980
We've thought about it too.

925
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,140
So we want to take her back in advance.

926
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,860
Let her adapt to the school's schedule

927
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,220
for a while.

928
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:53,780
Right.

929
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,940
You're very thoughtful.

930
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,620
But don't worry.

931
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,340
We'll take her to the hospital regularly.

932
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,500
Thank you, Dr. Ren.

933
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,180
And Dr. Song.

934
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,580
Thank you for

935
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,180
considering Meng's future.

936
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,100
But Meng's

937
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,340
high school is not finished yet.

938
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,740
She still needs to

939
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,220
learn and practice

940
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,340
to enter society by herself.

941
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,500
Yes.

942
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,260
Meng.

943
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,700
After you go back,

944
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,260
have a good meal and sleep.

945
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,620
My phone is turned on for 24 hours.

946
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,900
I'll call you later.

947
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,420
It's 24 hours.

948
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,380
Call me

949
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,420
if you need anything.

950
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,140
Okay?

951
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,340
We'll visit you later.

952
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,220
Talk to you later.

953
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:50,740
Listen to me.

954
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,980
She needs witnesses.

955
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,900
She should work hard.

956
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,900
She has to work hard to achieve her goal.

957
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,180
There's only one thing

958
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,260
I want to tell her.

959
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,020

We're leaving.

961
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,500
Didn't she take her doll?

962
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,860
Sit down, eat something.

963
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,380
No...

964
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,620
She didn't take her doll.

965
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,380
We will give it to her tomorrow.

966
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,060
Yes.

967
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,100
Please enjoy the carefully prepared food.

You...

972
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,660
You can always stop talking.

973
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,060
There's nothing better.

974
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,260
No matter what happens,

975
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,260

00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,980

977
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,860
But I'm afraid Tr行了 is not here.

978
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,580
It's been a while.

979
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,900
Oh, it's hot!

980
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:09,300
A deceased person died when they were five?

981
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,780
This is a young woman from Tenay Sí currency.

982
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,900
But I can tell the difference.

983
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:18,620
They don't look at each other in strong eyes,

984
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,900
Room 3.

985
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,020
I don't want it.

986

987
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,340

What's wrong with it?

989
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,980
My good grandson.

990
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,740
I can't use it.

991
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,620
I'm so anxious.

992
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,380
Come on.

993
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:04,860
Help me.

Serve him well.

Be considerate.

996
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,180
Grandpa, I told you

997
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,620

Look.

999
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,500
You're not eating.

1000
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,220
You're depressed.

1001
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,060
Are you sick?

1002
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,140

Time is silent

Memories are all memories

1010
