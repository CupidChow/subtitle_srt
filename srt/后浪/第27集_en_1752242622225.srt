The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,600
Why don't you let us see him?

4
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,960
Can't we let him do whatever he wants?

5
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,680
Our problem before was too much.

6
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,800
He's a sick child. You can't treat him like that.

7
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,480
That's why I don't want my child to be a sick child forever.

8
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,440
Then he can stay in our house and be fine. Why is there a problem when he comes home with you?

9
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,240
Is it right for an 18-year-old girl to be out every day?

10
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,920
Teacher Xu, let me remind you.

11
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,920
This is called a prison. You can call the police.

12
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,480
Little girl, I've already discussed it with the mother of our child.

13
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,400
If we don't get him out of the case this time,

14
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,040
we'll just pretend that we don't have a daughter.

15
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,640
You can call the police. What does it have to do with you?

16
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,440
She's your biological daughter. How can you say something like that?

17
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,040
We love her very much.

18
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,440
In order to prevent her from getting into trouble, I've dug up iron barges in my house.

19
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,720
I've collected all the thorns and thorns. What else do I need to do?

20
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,480
What do you think of her? She's a human, not an animal.

21
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,160
You think I'm willing to do this? She's my daughter.

22
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,840
You don't know what she did.

23
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,600
Then tell me what she did.

24
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,120
What did she do that you treated her like this?

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,600
This is my family matter. It has nothing to do with you two.

26
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,160
Please leave my house.

27
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,760
You're asking for a ban.

28
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,160
If you don't take Xu Meng away today, I won't leave here.

29
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Uncle Duan!

30
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,880
Come back here!

31
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,400
Uncle Duan!

32
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,880
I came to help Mengmeng with Tianzhen.

33
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,640
Where is Mengmeng now? Is she okay?

34
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,840
We're very worried about her.

35
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,760
We're worried that Teacher Xu won't let us in.

36
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,240
Gao Xu, if they don't take her away, we'll just call the police.

37
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,240
Did you hear that?

38
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,120
Uncle Duan.

39
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,160
Why did you drag me away?

40
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,720
If they call the police, we can also call the police.

41
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,680
We can't call the police.

42
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,080
This is a big problem.

43
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,160
We won't even know where Mengmeng is.

44
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,760
Let's go ask for the card.

45
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,720
It's unlikely.

46
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
Why?

47
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,440
They're violating Xu Mengmeng's will.

48
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,680
This is called kidnapping.

49
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,160
According to Article 239 of the Criminal Code,

50
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,040
there are two reasons for kidnapping.

51
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,560
First, it's a kidnapping for the purpose of looting.

52
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,680
Second, it's a kidnapping as a hostage

53
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,920
to achieve the purpose of kidnapping.

54
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,120
According to the description you two gave,

55
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,360
Mengmeng's parents are neither former nor future.

56
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,560
What about illegal detention?

57
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,760
That's even harder.

58
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,840
There are two reasons for illegal detention.

59
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,480
First, the perpetrator did commit the act of imprisoning others.

60
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,400
We can prove this.

61
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,000
Because we heard Mengmeng screaming for help and smashing things.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,960
Second, this kind of detention must be illegal.

63
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,640
It's even harder to prove it.

64
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,240
They're Mengmeng's parents.

65
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,200
The bias and the boundary between the education method

66
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,400
are hard to tell apart.

67
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,120
Moreover, there are many domestic violence and abuse children.

68
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,800
They were all unable to get in because of domestic affairs.

69
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,080
But what kind of law is this?

70
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,320
You can't hurt others because of your family.

71
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
That's not right.

72
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,040
As the saying goes,

73
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,680
it's hard to tell apart.

74
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,600
Even if you two call the police,

75
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,720
the police will only be able to help you.

76
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,520
Moreover, Mengmeng is a sick child.

77
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,640
How can you make the police believe

78
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,520
that you two treat Mengmeng better than her parents?

79
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,920
But the truth is,

80
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,800
Professor Xu loves his child with dignity.

81
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,680
He doesn't love his child at all.

82
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,800
He thinks Mengmeng is a disgrace to him.

83
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,400
They don't love Mengmeng.

84
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,560
You love him from the bottom of your heart.

85
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,400
Then you can show your heart to the police.

86
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,840
You two are the only ones who can

87
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,840
get through Xu Mengmeng's parents' work.

88
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,120
I think the preparation card makes sense.

89
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,120
Now, if we can get through one of Mengmeng's parents' exits,

90
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,920
the two of them can get out

91
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,320
if one of them opens the door.

92
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,360
Look at this.

93
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,440
Go find your dad.

94
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,920
Tell your dad to go find Xu Jie.

95
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,320
Because Xu Jie was here to help your dad.

96
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,600
Xu Jie will listen to your dad.

97
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,720
I'll go find Mengmeng's mom.

98
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,920
I think Mengmeng's mom

99
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,200
is different from her dad.

100
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,560
Her heart should be a little softer.

101
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,400
I'll tell her that

102
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
if something happens to Mengmeng,

103
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:57,600
she'll...

104
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,720
I can't go to my dad.

105
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,320
I can't communicate with my dad at all.

106
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,720
I just have to open my mouth and it's wrong.

107
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,800
Then go find your mom.

108
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,240
Do you think I'll help my mom

109
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,000
because of Mengmeng?

110
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,440
Go to your grandpa.

111
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,760
Tell your grandpa to put pressure on your dad.

112
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,080
That's it.

113
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,120
I think

114
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,920
you should go to my dad.

115
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,040
I don't think it's appropriate.

116
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,160
She's your woman.

117
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,440
You want me to go to your dad.

118
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,080
Who are you?

119
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,280
Who are you to talk about love?

120
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,160
You have to rely on me.

121
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,840
Is that okay?

122
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,560
I'm telling you.

123
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,280
You're a man.

124
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,440
You have to take responsibility.

125
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,280
I'm helping Mengmeng

126
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,640
not because I like her.

127
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,560
It's not personal.

128
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,160
Then what's the reason?

129
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,160
You don't understand.

130
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,360
Okay, I don't understand.

131
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,720
I'll find your dad.

132
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,960
Xu Meng!

133
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,480
I want to help you!

134
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Hurry up!

135
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,440
Hurry up!

136
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,240
Hurry up!

137
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,120
Go!

138
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Go!

139
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,440
What are you doing?

140
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,720
What are you doing?

141
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,960
As for

142
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,600
the old disease,

143
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,080
you have to take it in a moment.

144
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,400
You're so crazy.

145
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,760
You're not even in the bottom of the game.

146
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,520
What's your life?

147
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,400
Mengmeng!

148
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,320
Something happened to Mengmeng!

149
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,600
Did Tianzhen ask you to come?

150
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,720
Yes.

151
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,400
You always make people your gunmen.

152
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,000
I...

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,440
She wants to get Mengmeng back.

154
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,240
Why didn't she come to me?

155
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,560
No, no, no.

156
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,720
I went to Mengmeng's house with Tianzhen.

157
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,800
Mengmeng was locked up at home.

158
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,440
She was so angry.

159
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,280
I have to say,

160
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,880
I...

161
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,920
She was forced by her parents.

162
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,880
She was forced by her parents.

163
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,440
Something happened.

164
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,960
It's over.

165
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,840
How much exaggeration

166
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,920
do you think you're talking about?

167
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,600
Tell me.

168
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
I'll tell you everything.

169
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,400
I don't believe you.

170
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,200
No.

171
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,760
I lied to you.

172
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,240
I can't be the heir.

173
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,640
You'd better swear

174
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,960
that I'll never eat meat.

175
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,360
You can't joke about it.

176
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,720
But the heir can't eat meat.

177
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,520
I'd rather eat vegetarian food for the rest of my life.

178
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,280
You can't put these two things together.

179
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,360
You said...

180
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,000
Didn't you say

181
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,760
I don't want to be the heir?

182
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,120
Why do you want to be the heir?

183
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,720
This is the most important thing for me.

184
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,880
I can't joke about it.

185
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,280
Yes.

186
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,200
Sun Tao Tao.

187
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,720
Sun Tao Tao.

188
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,760
Take her away.

189
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,600
Ms. Du.

190
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,720
Mengmeng is your daughter.

191
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,680
Do you really want to see her cry?

192
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,000
Can you give her to me?

193
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,760
I'll treat her well.

194
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,920
I'll cure her.

195
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,960
You can't cure her?

196
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,280
I can.

197
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,600
She's been very good

198
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,880
to me all this time.

199
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,760
That's an illusion.

200
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,160
I'm her mother.

201
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,120
I know

202
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,800
she can disguise herself.

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,040
How can you say that

204
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,160
about your own child?

205
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,720
Did you see this painting?

206
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,080
This is Mengmeng's painting when she was two years old.

207
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,120
That was her first time playing with a pencil.

208
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,360
She was happy

209
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,280
and her saliva flowed to her chin.

210
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,760
I'll always remember

211
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,840
her smiling face

212
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,280
without teeth and eyes.

213
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,360
All the paintings in this exhibition hall

214
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,560
are drawn by Mengmeng.

215
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,000
What can you feel?

216
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,800
When did you paint this painting?

217
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,840
I didn't paint it long before I met you.

218
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,320
Her painting teacher

219
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,400
recommended her to participate

220
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,560
in the ARC FEC competition.

221
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,840
She taught me this painting.

222
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,560
After the teacher saw the painting,

223
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,440
she felt the same as we did.

224
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,400
She was so cold.

225
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,560
So,

226
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,520
she called us quickly.

227
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,200
What did she cover?

228
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,720
I also wanted to know

229
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,240
whether I could bear it

230
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,640
after I knew the truth.

231
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,640
But now,

232
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm not sure

233
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,440
if I can bear it

234
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,960
after I know the truth.

235
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,560
Professor Ren,

236
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,960
don't you believe

237
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,040
I locked her up

238
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,320
for Mengmeng's sake?

239
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,440
She is a person of hell.

240
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,280
Who is she?

241
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,840
We are social people.

242
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,080
We can't be isolated

243
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,720
and live alone.

244
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,600
Mengmeng is a young girl.

245
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,000
She is different from others.

246
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,560
If others are wrong,

247
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,080
we can destroy her.

248
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
I disagree.

249
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,480
We live in the world of others.

250
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,840
We should use their eyes

251
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,200
to create ourselves.

252
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,320
How can we be self-sufficient?

253
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,760
Self-sufficient?

254
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,080
Who am I?

255
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,400
Professor Ren,

256
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,600
I've never

257
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,920
studied your question

258
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,200
in my life.

259
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,920
What I want to know is

260
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,440
what did Mengmeng do wrong

261
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,400
to treat her like this?

262
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,040
Is it because of her

263
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,120
previous mistakes?

264
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,880
We never asked

265
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,760
our own child

266
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,040
to be perfect.

267
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,000
We have accepted

268
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,120
her past.

269
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,440
But I can't accept

270
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,320
her present

271
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,600
and her future.

272
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,760
Do you like her?

273
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,760
If you like her,

274
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,680
you can take care of her for a lifetime.

275
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,960
I'll tell you.

276
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,800
I like her.

277
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,320
But as her brother,

278
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,040
I like her.

279
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,360
If you're just worried

280
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,800
that no one will take care of her in the future,

281
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,720
I can put my promise here.

282
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,160
As a doctor,

283
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,160
I'll take care of her for a lifetime.

284
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,400
No.

285
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,720
This kind of promise is unreliable.

286
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,760
But who can promise

287
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,360
that love can keep a doctor?

288
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,560
I met Mengmeng in the supermarket for the first time.

289
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,760
Because my misjudgment

290
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,720
almost hurt her.

291
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,080
Since then,

292
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,120
I've been sure that

293
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,880
she's the first patient

294
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,640
I'll take care of.

295
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,680
I'll try my best to cure her.

296
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,800
You don't know her.

297
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,440
She's an unloved girl.

298
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,480
Don't say that.

299
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,080
In our life,

300
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,440
we may be

301
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,240
a little bit of a mess.

302
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,840
We've been through it.

303
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,440
We met a scumbag.

304
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,640
She didn't want to.

305
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,880
I don't mean it.

306
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,640
I don't mean it.

307
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,480
You think she'll be in danger

308
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,920
if you lock her up

309
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,840
and blow her up?

310
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,320
You promised me

311
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,520
you'd let her go to school.

312
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,120
Professor Ren,

313
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,120
she can't go to school.

314
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,560
Why?

315
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,960
Since she was born,

316
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,000
her mom and I

317
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,600
bought her

318
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,880
a birthday gift when she was 18.

319
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,200
Yesterday, the insurance agent called me

320
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,880
and said that Mengmeng

321
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,800
had taken the money away.

322
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,800
I thought it was wrong.

323
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,400
So I checked it further.

324
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,600
She has a bank card

325
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,960
with a bank card

326
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,080
from childhood to her last life.

327
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,040
She took all the money

328
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,480
from the bank.

329
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,320
That's why I was in a hurry

330
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,920
to take her away from your home.

331
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,360
You didn't ask her

332
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,920
why she needed so much money?

333
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,120
I did.

334
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,160
She didn't say it.

335
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,640
She must have something to do

336
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,360
with the man before.

337
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,720
Why do you think so?

338
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,240
We caught her.

339
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,120
Her mom turned on the surveillance camera.

340
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,720
She used the iron grill

341
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,360
we sent her to cook

342
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,240
to smash the camera.

343
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,640
Her mom confiscated her phone.

344
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,640
We found someone to unlock the password.

345
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,000
We found out that she was chatting

346
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,960
with her parents.

347
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,240
She was deleted.

348
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,960
Did you get the content

349
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,160
of the chat?

350
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,920
She was 18.

351
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,280
You were on the counter.

352
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,480
You didn't give us

353
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,680
the record of her chatting with her parents.

354
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,560
Have you ever thought

355
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,240
what you would feel

356
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,160
when a camera

357
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,000
is pointing at you for 24 hours?

358
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,840
Parents and children

359
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,880
must have a sense of boundaries.

360
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,960
It's not your personal property.

361
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,760
Professor Ren,

362
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,280
there's a reason

363
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,720
why we installed the camera.

364
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,360
When she was young,

365
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,240
I found out that

366
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,400
she had a very bad temper.

367
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,680
It's really hard to tell.

368
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,960
It's normal.

369
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,440
Everyone has a desire.

370
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,520
You have to admit that she's growing up.

371
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,320
It's the most natural thing.

372
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,840
What's hard to tell?

373
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,840
How can it be?

374
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,400
If you're her son, not her daughter,

375
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,600
can you accept

376
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,800
her demand?

377
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,000
Ms. Du,

378
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,720
Mengmeng didn't do anything wrong.

379
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,560
It's your shame

380
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,160
that made her feel wrong.

381
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,480
She didn't hurt anyone.

382
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,360
But Mengmeng

383
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,880
can't stay at home.

384
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,320
She likes to

385
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,640
hang out with boys all day.

386
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,920
She's done

387
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,600
such a big thing

388
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,280
without a good care.

389
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:45,920
She's not a girl

390
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,200
educated by us intellectuals.

391
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,880
Your parents can't accept

392
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,400
that your child is not like you.

393
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,160
How can you

394
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,760
be so self-righteous?

395
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,160
I rated the scores for college.

396
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,360
I rated the paper for the exam.

397
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,040
Her mother is a teacher.

398
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,480
She went to many places

399
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,760
on her way.

400
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,280
But as a parent,

401
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,040
she doesn't need to be a teacher.

402
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,480
We didn't go through

403
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,840
such a special training.

404
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,720
To be honest,

405
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,160
we don't know

406
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,760
what way to love her

407
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,280
is the right way.

408
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,640
Can we not love

409
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,080
our own daughter?

410
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,240
You may think

411
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,680
we're a little cruel to her.

412
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,880
But I really love her.

413
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,360
I really don't understand.

414
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,400
Why do you think

415
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,360
our family

416
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,160
can raise

417
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,760
such a good daughter?

418
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,800
Sometimes I feel so strange

419
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,800
when I look at her.

420
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,320
I don't think

421
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,600
she's my daughter.

422
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,280
Actually,

423
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,720
I feel the same way

424
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,120
you do.

425
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,600
I'm a doctor.

426
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,320
My lover is a family member.

427
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,080
But I think

428
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,320
my son should

429
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,920
be a good doctor

430
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,920
with the best

431
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,920
background.

432
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,440
Because he's more qualified

433
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,120
than anyone.

434
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,400
But

435
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,640
I still

436
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,600
don't feel

437
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,440
he can be a doctor.

438
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,240
But at least he has a chance.

439
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,640
Mengmeng has nothing.

440
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,240
If this time

441
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,320
he can't be a doctor,

442
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,680
his future

443
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,720
will be ruined.

444
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,280
We're getting older.

445
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,040
We can't take care of him forever.

446
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,600
If I have an accident one day,

447
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,840
he may wander the streets

448
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,680
and fight with bad guys.

449
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,360
I believe I can't

450
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,640
rest in peace.

451
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,280
He must be a doctor this time.

452
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,720
If he can't be a doctor,

453
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,560
you can lock him up

454
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,640
and kill him.

455
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,360
You graduated from a prestigious university.

456
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,000
Your work is very effective.

457
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,240
But these things

458
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,080
have no practical connection

459
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,760
with your daughter.

460
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,040
Family is not

461
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,760
who has the future and who contributes more.

462
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,440
You give so much love.

463
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,800
This is true.

464
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,560
When your daughter

465
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,920
needs love the most,

466
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,920
do you give up everything

467
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,160
your thesis,

468
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,600
your work

469
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,600
and spend your life with her?

470
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,360
Professor Ren,

471
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,720
I want to ask you a question.

472
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,040
How much time

473
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
do you give to Tianzhen?

474
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,120
I mean

475
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,960
I just want to figure out

476
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,120
how big a difference

477
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,440
I have with other fathers.

478
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,840
You don't doubt it.

479
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,320
I'm a selfish mother.

480
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,920
I really hope

481
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,520
there is a man like you

482
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,480
with a good character,

483
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,440
a good family background,

484
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,120
and a very bright son.

485
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,840
You fall in love with him

486
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,760
and save him from the abyss.

487
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,560
Professor Du,

488
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,840
you can't depend on

489
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,120
another person to save him.

490
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,360
Your idea is wrong.

491
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,040
I know it now.

492
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,800
Mengmeng's heart is actually

493
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,240
your denial of her.

494
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,440
Because she can never

495
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,200
satisfy your hopes for her.

496
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,280
She is disappointed in herself.

497
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,960
So she will use this way

498
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,040
to dislike herself.

499
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,760
Dr. Ren,

500
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,280
these years,

501
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,240
Mengmeng's father and I

502
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,520
have made a lot of money.

503
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,800
As long as you treat her well,

504
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,560
it's all yours.

505
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,320
I'm Mengmeng's mother.

506
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,360
I know her.

507
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,400
She trusts you.

508
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,560
Now you're the only one who can save her.

509
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,560
If you are with Mengmeng...

510
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,360
Professor Du,

511
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,920
money can't buy feelings.

512
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,760
I have someone I like.

513
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,640
I knew

514
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,360
a good boy like you

515
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,800
doesn't lack a lover.

516
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,440
Lack?

517
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,440
I like him.

518
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,240
He may not like me.

519
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,520
Hello?

520
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,480
Hello?

521
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,600
What?

522
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,760
What?

523
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,360
What are you doing?

524
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,400
What did you say?

525
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,120
Mengmeng!

526
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,560
Your hand is stained.

527
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,400
Mengmeng!

528
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,480
Mengmeng!

529
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,040
Don't be angry.

530
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,960
Don't be angry.

531
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:44,960
Mom.

532
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,240
She's doing fine at home.

533
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,040
Don't let her see it.

534
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,760
Although the baby is a girl,

535
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,440
she's always with me.

536
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,120
I feel so sorry for her in her hometown.

537
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,520
I want to

538
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,000
keep her for you

539
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,400
every day.

540
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,440
She's my daughter.

541
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,520
I know her.

542
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,680
Your family will hate her.

543
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,760
Do you know that?

544
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,800
I know.

545
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,840
I know I can't take her out.

546
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,120
I just put her

547
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,960
on the roof of the house.

548
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,240
She'll be fine in a few days.

549
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,920
I don't know what happened to her today.

550
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,440
She's so annoying.

551
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,640
I'm so sorry.

552
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,600
Mengmeng.

553
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,000
Mengmeng.

554
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,760
Do you remember me?

555
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,000
We met at the supermarket.

556
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,040
My name is Ren Tianzhen.

557
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,040
Hello.

558
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,200
The city is in a trance.

559
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,240
Let the story

560
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,440
be a story.

561
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,800
I'm so sorry.

562
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,160
I'm so sorry.

563
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,200
I'm so sorry.

564
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,240
I'm so sorry.

565
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,360
I'm so sorry.

566
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,320
I'm so sorry.

567
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,320
I'm so sorry.

568
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,400
I'm so sorry.

569
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,080
Here's a gift for you.

570
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,640
Dated 1 year.

571
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:40,880
Come see.

572
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,600
Come Kadong.

573
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,040
Come on.

574
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,520
Come here.

575
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,960
Fatuee Chu,

576
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,080
I have a patient.

577
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,240
She can't be alone.

578
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,520
I need to keep her company.

579
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,720
Enjoy it.

580
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,280
It's all right.

581
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:04,960
I'm sorry.

582
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,120
Mengmeng.

583
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:13,880
Mengmeng.

584
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,600
Mengmeng, look.

585
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,680
I've turned off the spiritual injury.

586
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,240
Mengmeng.

587
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,120
It's okay.

588
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,880
Don't be afraid.

589
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,080
Row a boat

590
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,960
That's useless.

591
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,960
Feels right

592
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,480
Wrong way

593
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,200
D Ability

594
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,560
Xia.

595
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,760
Right.

596
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
Xia, I want to ask you.

597
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,920
You're not going to fire me tomorrow, right?

598
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,080
Don't worry.

599
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,360
I won't.

600
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,200
Zhao,

601
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,040
you're going to meet a client tomorrow.

602
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,520
I wish you a successful business.

603
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,680
Good luck!

604
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:19,840
Thank you, Xia.

605
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,680
Thanks for your advice.

606
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,480
Good luck!

607
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,040
Bye.

608
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,320
Bye.

609
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:22,840
Bye.

610
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,640
You're home.

611
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,520
You came so early.

612
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,440
Have you been busy?

613
00:29:41,000 --> 00:30:02,920
You three were all

614
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,280
But I can't even die

615
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,640
when I think of my mom,

616
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,400
my dad and my brother.

617
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,040
Let me.

618
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,960
Don't burn your hand.

619
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,600
It's okay.

620
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,480
The most heartbroken person is still Tianzhen.

621
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,680
He hasn't come to the hospital for a day.

622
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,160
I don't know how he is.

623
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,920
Let me help you.

624
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,760
Never think deeply in your heart

625
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,720
but hoje uen

626
00:30:38,440 --> 00:31:01,240
to

627
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,120
Hello, mother.

628
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,560
When will you come back?

629
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,040
In a few days.

630
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,000
Don't worry.

631
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,760
I just want to

632
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,400
free myself.

633
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,840
Free yourself?

634
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,240
Tianzhen, you're so young.

635
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,360
You're not old enough to be free.

636
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,480
Come back soon.

637
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:20,920
Mom.

638
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,480
Mom.

639
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,800
Wait a minute.

640
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,800
Hello, son.

641
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,900
You stay here,

642
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,400
and we can work.

643
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,960
What is it?

644
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,960
You gifts I sent you.

645
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,240
You said,

646
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,120
you'd come back immediately.

647
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,400
And you would pray.

648
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,320
Drink some more.

649
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,040
Sugar glacier.

650
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,200
Sure.

651
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,000
Eat some more.

652
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,400
you have to go back to work.

653
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,520
You have to know

654
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,160
that there are many patients waiting for him.

655
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,000
What?

656
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,120
Ask someone to find him.

657
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,600
Who?

658
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,840
Where can we find him?

659
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,200
The phone is not in its place.

660
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,080
It can't be located.

661
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,360
If the phone rings,

662
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,360
we'll know where he is.

663
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,840
Really?

664
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,640
I know where he is.

665
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,200
Claire.

666
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,840
Claire!

667
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,000
Claire!

668
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,920
Oliver.

669
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,320
Oliver.

670
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,360
Zheng Tianzhen!

671
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,720
Zheng Tianzhen!

672
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,680
Zheng Tianzhen!

673
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,880
Zheng Tianzhen!

674
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,800
Zheng Tianzhen!

675
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,320
Zheng Tianzhen!

676
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,720
Zheng Tianzhen!

677
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,640
Zheng Tianzhen!

678
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,960
You scared me to death!

679
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,960
Are you saying that I'm crazy?

680
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,200
Are you really crazy?

681
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,320
Let me tell you.

682
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,440
You've had enough of this, you know?

683
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,560
If you want to die, then die.

684
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,280
Do you know how much your parents

685
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,000
care about you?

686
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,280
You came here to be a part of the family.

687
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,280
I want to save you.

688
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,000
My friends don't know.

689
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,880
You Zheng Tianzhen!

690
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,320
Let go of me!

691
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,200
Get up!

692
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,480
Get up!

693
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,480
Get up! Get up!

694
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,640
I really want to know

695
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,440
what kind of despair

696
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,360
Mengmeng fell from the top.

697
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,520
I want to know.

698
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,520
I'm not fit to be a doctor.

699
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,520
My dad is right.

700
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,720
I was born

701
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,120
as a failure.

702
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I saved the patient who I wanted to save.

703
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,280
I can't be counted.

704
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,520
If it weren't for you, I would have died.

705
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,640
I'm sorry.

706
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,760
I'm sorry.

707
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,920
I'm sorry.

708
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,040
I'm sorry.

709
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,440
It's my fault then.

710
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,560
When I raise him,

711
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,720
I'm just worried

712
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,000
he'll get hurt

713
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,000
too fast.

714
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,560
You've been going after

715
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,760
a boy for so long.

716
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,000
Are you confident that

717
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,840
you're going to be a doctor?

718
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,440
Where does he go then?

719
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:32,760
Ren Kai,

720
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,720
both you and socialism

721
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,760
I'm lucky

722
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,000
Your dad said

723
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,720
God wants to save the world

724
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,600
My dad is telling the truth

725
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,400
Some people are born lucky

726
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,680
For example, you

727
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,200
You stand by someone's side

728
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,440
and you are saved

729
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,120
So you are a suitable doctor

730
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,120
Maybe I'm not lucky

731
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,360
You are more like their child than me

732
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,320
You are wrong

733
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,560
What luck?

734
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,080
Not luck

735
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,880
It's not giving up

736
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,240
When I was at the top of the mountain

737
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,760
I saw you falling down

738
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,840
I didn't see a rope on your foot

739
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,800
In this way

740
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,600
Even if I fell down

741
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,760
you would still be dead

742
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,320
What's the right way?

743
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,720
I'm sorry

744
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,720
But I didn't

745
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,760
I just kept running

746
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,120
kept running

747
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,720
I didn't think of anything

748
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,240
I just kept running

749
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,680
If there were a watch just now

750
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,120
I think I would have run out of the world record

751
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,120
Your dad also said

752
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,280
Every mother has the super power

753
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,040
to save her child

754
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,400
So you think I'm lucky

755
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,760
Actually not

756
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,600
I didn't give up on you

757
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,280
I

758
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,000
didn't give up on you

759
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,520
Don't deny yourself

760
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,120
No one can define you

761
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,960
When we went to the fortune-teller

762
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,360
Didn't the master say

763
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,840
You are a big bowl of dust

764
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,880
That means you are saved

765
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,560
You are still on the way

766
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,920
So don't worry

767
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,160
I'm not as confident as you

768
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,200
I have confidence in you

769
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,480
Only you know

770
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,960
Who you cherish

771
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,600
Is too many

772
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,440
Then do you think

773
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,720
You have something else

774
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,960
What medicine did you use

775
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,440
Halitasi

776
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,320
What's your problem

777
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,060
Are you going to work

778
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,020
Th tribe

779
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,520
But this is

780
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,640
When does it start to hurt?

781
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,320
Tao Tao.

782
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,320
Tao Tao.

783
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,520
Where's your phone?

784
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,480
Tao Tao.

785
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,600
Wake up.

786
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,440
Tao Tao.

787
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,400
You can't sleep.

788
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,120
Tao Tao.

789
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,040
Tao Tao. Wake up.

790
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,440
Is anyone here?

791
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,160

797
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,480

798
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,080
Tao Tao. Wake up.

799
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,240
Tao Tao.

800
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,120
You have a fever.

801
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,560
Look.

802
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,480
Put it on.

803
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,400
The yellow is running away.

804
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,360
Young man.

805
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,920
You're so scared.

806
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,480
How can you scare so many yellows?

807
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,680
It's going to happen.

808
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,160
Do you understand?

809
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,560
No.

810
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,720
I have to send him to the hospital.

811
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,400
It's late.

812
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,440
Who wants to go out of the village?

813
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,040
Yes.

814
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,120
Shen She.

815
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,000
Tell Zhang Hefei to go with him.

816
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,440
How long will it take?

817
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,520
I can drive myself.

818
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,640
No. You can't.

819
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,080
I...

820
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,200
It's a long way.

821
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,400
It's dark and it's a mountain road.

822
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,720
It's too dangerous.

823
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,080
I'm not sure about the skin.

824
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,160
It might be troublesome if I get a cold.

825
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,560
I'll send you to the hospital.

826
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,400
I won't be scared.

827
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,760
The arm nonprofits are safe.

828
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,800
Gina.

829
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,200
Three hours.

00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,240
