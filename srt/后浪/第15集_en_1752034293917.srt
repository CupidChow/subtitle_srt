00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Untamed

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,600
Don't talk to me about conditions.

4
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Just like I can't talk to you about conditions when I'm doing my homework.

5
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,200
Zhao Wendao, it's not that you can die easily, but you'll die immediately.

6
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,000
Just call and apologize.

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,200
Call and apologize.

8
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,800
You're an adult now. You should be more careful.

9
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,400
You have to teach me. You have to...

10
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Zhao Wendao

11
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,400
Mom, you've really improved.

12
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,600
Really, practice hard. If you practice for two more years,

13
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,200
you'll be able to catch up with me.

14
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,200
This is the only thing that can catch up with you.

15
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,000
Hello, what happened?

16
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,200
Lin Lan,

17
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,600
I just finished my meal.

18
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,200
Don't say that it's really cold in the mountains at night.

19
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,800
My back neck feels cold. I suddenly remembered

20
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,000
that you woke up early.

21
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
You scared me to death.

22
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,600
I put that scarf in the innocent backpack.

23
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,400
Remember to ask for it. Don't catch a cold.

24
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,600
Okay, okay.

25
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,800
I really have to thank you for being so considerate and careful every day.

26
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,200
If it's not your mom, let them rest early.

27
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,800
Okay, I won't say anymore. Bye.

28
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,200
What's wrong? What happened?

29
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,400
Nothing. I just want to say hello.

30
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,600
What's the matter?

31
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Nothing.

32
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
But...

33
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,800
it's strange. You haven't met for a hundred years.

34
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,600
You never called me back when you went out.

35
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,600
Why are you laughing?

36
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,400
Men are always late. Do you still remember?

37
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,400
When you were one year old, your dad came back to support Ning Xia.

38
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,800
He said to you,

39
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,400
Call me uncle.

40
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,400
You remember this forever?

41
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,200
I remember it forever.

42
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,200
So men are like the jade emperor,

43
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,800
like the peach tree.

44
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,600
Three thousand years of blooming and three thousand years of fruit.

45
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,600
If you don't have patience and you can't pick the peach,

46
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,400
that's also your luck. Not enough.

47
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,800
Mom, mom, help me analyze.

48
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,200
Everyone says that if you go out and go back to the normal, you will always have a ghost.

49
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
But you say, if he goes back to the normal,

50
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,600
and suddenly starts to feel cold and warm,

51
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,600
will he be okay out there?

52
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,200
He's already at his age.

53
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,000
It's okay.

54
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Oh.

55
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,000
Why are you looking at me? Learn.

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,600
I'm happy for you.

57
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,600
I'm done.

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,400
Let me teach you anyway.

59
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
warning

60
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,800
Thank you.

61
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,760
Say it again

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,640
Happy New Year

63
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,560
Thank you

64
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,040
This is the first time I feel

65
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,480
The wild vegetables are delicious

66
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,080
Wild vegetables are delicious

67
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,600
But you can't eat all the vegetarian food

68
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,880
I ate three steamed buns tonight

69
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,880
I'm not full

70
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,640
I didn't eat this

71
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,960
You have a lot of vegetarian food today

72
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,640
If you eat this chicken

73
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,720
It's better

74
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,960
Slow down

75
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,720
Chicken

76
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,400
Have you ever eaten chicken?

77
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,800
I haven't eaten it, is it delicious?

78
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,120
Of course it's delicious

79
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,920
In the movie Hero

80
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,800
Hong Qigong is for

81
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,880
Huang Rong's chicken

82
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,160
He is willing to teach Guo Jing martial arts

83
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,160
Step through hard mud

84
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,520
Wrap chicken

85
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,440
Braise over fire

86
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,160
After a while, the mud becomes

87
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,560
Delicious and sweet

88
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,160
When the soil becomes

89
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,760
Half dry and half wet

90
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,980
Tissue will fall with the soil

91
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,560
You just stop talking

92
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,080
Be careful

93
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,480
I'm hungry again

94
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,880
The prejudged water is coming down

95
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,200
The mud

96
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,800
Bull tä

97
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,240
Caier

98
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,520
I haven't told you.

99
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,920
Thank you Black Başji.

100
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,360
Who's there?

101
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,520
The one in the car.

102
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,240
Yep, the one in the car.

103
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,520
Okay.

104
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,760
Sir, I was wrong.

105
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,240
I really know I was wrong.

106
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,280
But I didn't mean to.

107
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,440
I... I just...

108
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,920
I just...

109
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,560
I was just curious.

110
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,080
Purely curious.

111
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,560
The blood from the tree

112
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,600
and the chicken from the house are so delicious.

113
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,680
I wanted to taste it.

114
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,320
I wanted to taste it.

115
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,920
But I didn't see anyone.

116
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,440
I didn't see the horse.

117
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,440
I thought I'd eat it first.

118
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
After I ate it, I...

119
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,320
I was wrong.

120
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,840
Actually, I thought about it for a long time.

121
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
Why did I have such a hard bone

122
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,360
and my master and my wife?

123
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,200
Why did you make it so hard for me?

124
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,440
You ran away

125
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,480
and you invited me back.

126
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,640
Now I understand.

127
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,160
God is calling me.

128
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,520
When you think of goodness,

129
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,800
you think of Buddha.

130
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,240
When you think of evil, you think of devil.

131
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,560
In fact, people

132
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,640
are just like devil and Buddha.

133
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,560
You are just like devil and Buddha.

134
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,120
You said you...

135
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,120
I...

136
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,600
I...

137
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,160
What?

138
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,200
I jumped down.

139
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,400
Are you not bold?

140
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,280
You went to the hospital with Ms. Yang this afternoon.

141
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,720
You did a good thing.

142
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,200
You are so stubborn.

143
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,840
I've seen it.

144
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,920
I can't be too strict with you.

145
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,720
How about this?

146
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,720
Can we

147
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,200
do ten good things before doing bad things?

148
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,120
Then we have a fixed amount of money

149
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,680
for every bad thing you do.

150
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,200
As long as you can do it,

151
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,280
I'll take you out.

152
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,920
Okay?

153
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,040
Uncle, I know I was wrong.

154
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,200
What?

155
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,360
I shouldn't have stolen her chicken.

156
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,720
I was wrong in the book.

157
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,200
The chicken is delicious.

158
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,920
But it's not delicious at all.

159
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,640
You...

160
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,760
No, master.

161
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,320
It's...

162
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,440
It's really not delicious.

163
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,520
You should have taken it out.

164
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:39,680
No.

165
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,400
You are so stubborn.

166
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,520
You can't do it well.

167
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,360
It's my fault.

168
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,000
Okay, guys.

169
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,600
I'm leaving.

170
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,280
Have a good rest.

171
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,280
I'm leaving.

172
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,040
I'm leaving.

173
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,560
I'm leaving.

174
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:49,960
I'm leaving.

175
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,560
I'm leaving.

176
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,920
Let's go, Mengmeng.

177
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,480
We love each other.

178
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,800
We love each other so much.

179
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,520
We are not afraid of wind and rain.

180
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,280
We are not afraid of waves.

181
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,720
We are not alone.

182
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,840
We are not sad when we meet each other.

183
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,680
We are not afraid of rain.

184
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,680
We are not afraid of wind and rain.

185
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,680
We are not afraid of wind and rain.

186
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,680
We are not afraid of wind and rain.

187
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,680
We are not afraid of wind and rain.

188
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
We are not afraid of wind and rain.

189
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,680
We are not afraid of wind and rain.

190
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,680
We are not afraid of wind and rain.

191
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,680
We are not afraid of wind and rain.

192
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
We are not afraid of wind and rain.

193
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,680
We are not afraid of wind and rain.

194
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,680
We are not afraid of wind and rain.

195
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,680
We are not afraid of wind and rain.

196
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
We are not afraid of wind and rain.

197
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,680
We are not afraid of wind and rain.

198
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,300
Noise!

199
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,760
A sky began to fall!

200
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,160
Holding this hope and immersed in this light

201
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,360
I will turn APPLAUSE into skylight.

202
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,640
Your eyes are wide open.

203
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,840
There is radiation in your eyes.

204
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,200
When you bread your face,

205
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,040
Don't stop

206
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,840
I don't care

207
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,820
everything

208
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,680
I clap to you

209
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,440
De flowing

210
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,480
No.20

211
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,760
No.26

212
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,240
No.27

213
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,960
dropped it

214
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,860
No.26

215
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,580
Drop it

216
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,160
Drop it

217
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,860
You

218
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,500
Help me

219
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,240
help me

220
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,180
Know what?

221
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:06,800
help me

222
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,360
Help me

223
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,240
Sir,

224
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,720
is it OK this way?

225
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,000
Sure.

226
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,360
Then take these two chasms as your reward.

227
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,240
Come on.

228
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,360
Don'tweight me.

229
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,440
Be Senile.

230
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,120
Thank you.

231
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,480
You're welcome.

232
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,240
I'm going to sleep.

233
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,280
I'm going to sleep.

234
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,040
Master.

235
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,720
Let's go.

236
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,440
Let's go.

237
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,560
I want to tell you

238
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
that I give you

239
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,760
this puma.

240
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,320
Good things and bad things

241
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,160
are separated.

242
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,040
Doing bad things is a good thing.

243
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,120
Doing good things is a reward.

244
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,840
If you make progress in the future

245
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,520
you will do a great thing.

246
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,080
I...

247
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,000
I hope that you can put a coin

248
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,360
in the puma.

249
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,320
When the puma is full,

250
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,040
you will make a mistake.

251
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,080
But today,

252
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,000
your performance

253
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,120
is worth putting in the coin.

254
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,360
No, Master.

255
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,240
The puma

256
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,760
is too small.

257
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,840
If I work more,

258
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,000
it will be full.

259
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,840
If you work more,

260
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,760
you can get a coin.

261
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,120
I will set the standard

262
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,480
for getting a coin.

263
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,560
OK.

264
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,960
Today, you did a great thing.

265
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,360
I will give you two chickens.

266
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,640
Thank you.

267
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,120
You can use your life

268
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,400
to write us a textbook.

269
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,160
Master, don't do that.

270
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,760
I can't eat

271
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,360
the chicken I cut.

272
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,800
It's so delicious.

273
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,440
It's so delicious, Master.

274
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,320
But the chicken I ate last night

275
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,040
tastes completely different.

276
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,800
The textbook didn't lie to me.

277
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,840
This is the best chicken.

278
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,960
It's good.

279
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,560
It's right.

280
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,240
It's delicious.

281
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,640
Xiao Long,

282
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,800
have you ever thought

283
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,120
about eating chicken the same way?

284
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,080
Why didn't you eat the chicken yesterday?

285
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,120
Why is it so delicious today?

286
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,720
I've thought about it.

287
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,480
You've thought about it.

288
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,320
You've thought about it.

289
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,120
Master,

290
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,240
yesterday,

291
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,280
I didn't put the right seasoning.

292
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,320
It didn't taste good.

293
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,680
What else?

294
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,280
Yesterday, I was so nervous.

295
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,720
The chicken wasn't cooked.

296
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,360
You know?

297
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,320
It wasn't cooked.

298
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,800
So,

299
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,600
as long as it can be put on the table,

300
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,320
it's a complicated process

301
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,920
to enjoy the food.

302
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
It takes time.

303
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,320
Think about it.

304
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,160
This chicken has been grilled for three hours.

305
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,280
It's better than your chicken

306
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,840
that you cut the ingredients

307
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,840
and roasted it.

308
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,600
It's as delicious as a thief.

309
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,440
Master,

310
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,760
give me the chicken leg.

311
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,240
Here.

312
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,560
This is the biggest chicken leg.

313
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,760
I don't like this.

314
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,000
I like this.

315
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,800
It's chewy.

316
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,200
Master,

317
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,880
our leader is smart.

318
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,760
He knows how to warm people up.

319
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,360
Good.

320
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,080
This piece.

321
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,240
That's right.

322
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,520
Master, here.

323
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,480
Poudou,

324
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,000
you've worked hard today.

325
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,440
This piece of good meat

326
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,360
is for you.

327
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,280
Enjoy

328
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,680
your hard work.

329
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,560
Come on.

330
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,080
Eat it.

331
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,240
Eat it.

332
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
Don't eat it.

333
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,440
You're so tall.

334
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,680
I'll eat it.

335
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,480
You're taller.

336
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,520
Poudou,

337
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,920
eat the chicken.

338
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,680
Start to recite.

339
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,560
Why should I recite?

340
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,880
Poudou, you must remember that

341
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,520
reading is not

342
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,440
a cloud of clouds.

343
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,080
It's not a prayer.

344
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,520
You must read

345
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,920
with a clear mind.

346
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,240
If you can read,

347
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,560
I'll give you a gift.

348
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,640
Hundreds of them.

349
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,600
Thousands of

350
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,720
capable people.

351
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,840
They are all in this prayer.

352
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,560
If you can read,

353
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,560
you'll be wise.

354
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,040
If you can be soft,

355
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,200
you'll be strong.

356
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,440
If you can read it 100 times,

357
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,720
you'll be confident.

358
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,040
Do you understand?

359
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,600
Master,

360
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,520
don't worry.

361
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,840
I'll learn from you.

362
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,440
I'll learn from you.

363
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,840
Can you not recite this?

364
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,800
Eat it.

365
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,840
This soup is

366
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,400
fragrant and soft.

367
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,840
It's full of the fragrance of nuts.

368
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,160
It's too long.

369
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,000
Cook some more.

370
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,160
It's not too much.

371
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,080
Okay.

372
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,040
Take a bowl.

373
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Mengmeng, the soup is ready.

374
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,440
Here.

375
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,560
Your parents will take you back to be a member in the middle of the year.

376
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,840
I bought you two boxes of

377
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,680
fresh milk mooncakes.

378
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,840
Take them back and eat them together.

379
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,400
What's wrong?

380
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,600
You don't miss them?

381
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:27,840
mango

382
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,040
Wenquan,

383
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,320
are you going home

384
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,800
after the holiday period?

385
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,440
I'm not going home for now.

386
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,280
It'll be a waste of three days

387
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,360
on the road.

388
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,280
Live in such a debacle.

389
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,040
I happen to

390
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,680
have an appointment with Xing Xing

391
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,920
to restore the treatment.

392
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,120
Let me find some time to get the focus.

393
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:49,800
Okay.

394
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,000
Let me get you two boxes of

395
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,280
fresh milk mooncakes when you're back.

396
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,000
The milk is so good that I'll just buy a dozen.

397
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,160
Let me save it for the Western-style.

398
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,160
I have to eat it first.

399
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,760
I'll take a bowl.

400
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,440
Mid-autumn festival is coming.

401
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,800
How are you going to celebrate it?

402
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,720
We'll go back to our homes

403
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,760
and look for our moms.

404
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,120
That's a good idea.

405
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,840
Mom!

406
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,280
Hurry up.

407
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,080
We're waiting for you.

408
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,400
I've finished preparing the dishes.

409
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,120
It's not simple.

410
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
I'll do it myself.

411
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,840
Let me check.

412
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,280
It's your own business

413
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,840
to learn knowledge.

414
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,960
If you want to learn it,

415
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,400
you can definitely remember it.

416
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,320
If you don't want to learn it,

417
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,560
I'll test you.

418
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,680
Just turn around.

419
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,520
Hurry up.

420
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,160
That...

421
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,800
Yes, we're waiting for you.

422
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,080
Thank you.

423
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,680
Be careful.

424
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,200
Okay.

425
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,720
What were you talking about

426
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,640
so happily?

427
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,880
You're eating soup balls.

428
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,760
Eat it.

429
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,280
Tasteless is delicious.

430
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:26,560
He's spoiling our lunch scattered around

431
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,660
Don't miss any of the key points.

432
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:31,620
You remember?

433
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,340
Yeah.

434
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:39,040
Happysized auntie's day!

435
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:39,820
My birthday!

436
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,980
Smart boy!

437
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,260
Thank you!

438
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,260
Thank you!

439
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:43,600
What?

440
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,260
Ourals, carnival!

441
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,100
Moca, body?

442
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,660
I know you take a holiday.

443
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,660
Why?

444
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,100
It's not good.

445
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,060
You...

446
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,220
Where will I go

447
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,180
after you go back?

448
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,540
How will you spend

449
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,420
your New Year's Eve?

450
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,220
Go to work.

451
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,340
Go to work?

452
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,580
Can I earn

453
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,580
one or two thousand a day?

454
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,340
I must have earned three times

455
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,420
my salary

456
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,820
than usual.

457
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,060
Well...

458
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,540
If you all go back,

459
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,860
where will I go?

460
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,660
Go to my house after you go back.

461
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,260
Go to your house?

462
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,300
Yes.

463
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,780
Go to my house.

464
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,700
No.

465
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,340
Is it hot?

466
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,260
Master, it's hot.

467
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,260
Master.

468
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,020
Dad,

469
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,280
I'm going to our school today.

470
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,280
The floor is too thin.

471
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,280
It's made of Qin.

472
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,280
I'll move the car here.

473
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,280
I've arranged a classic for you every day.

474
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,280
You must stick to it even on a holiday.

475
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
It's eight o'clock every night.

476
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
I'll be waiting for you in the study.

477
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,280
Well, then,

478
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,280
what's the difference between a holiday and not a holiday?

479
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,280
A holiday is arranged by people.

480
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,280
In the eyes of God,

481
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,280
a holiday is reading books.

482
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,280
Reading books is a holiday.

483
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,280
I used to read books on holidays.

484
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,280
I used to work in the field.

485
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
Go and change your clothes.

486
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,280
I'll finish reading the diary in five minutes.

487
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
Go.

488
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,280
You'll have a holiday when you leave the community.

489
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,280
You can go wherever you want.

490
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,280
Just do what you should do.

491
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,280
Let's make an appointment and go home together.

492
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,280
What do you mean?

493
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,280
Are you going to the library?

494
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
I'm going. Don't you like studying?

495
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,280
You don't have to go.

496
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
I have to go.

497
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,280
Studying makes your dad happy.

498
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,280
Your dad is happy.

499
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
Your whole family is happy.

500
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,280
I have something else to do.

501
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,280
You can go and play by yourself.

502
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,280
You're naive.

503
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,280
You've changed.

504
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,280
You're not honest now.

505
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
You're lying.

506
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,280
You want to go out and play, right?

507
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,280
Then you listen to your dad and say you're going to the library.

508
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,280
Right?

509
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,280
Your dad said,

510
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,280
God knows the true person.

511
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,280
The true person knows the truth.

512
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,280
You're lying to your family now.

513
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,280
Why are you like this?

514
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,280
Say it.

515
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,280
Who are you going to see?

516
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,280
I'm going to see my own classmate.

517
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,280
You don't even know him.

518
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,280
Are you going?

519
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,280
I'm going.

520
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,280
Why don't I go?

521
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
I'll know if I go.

522
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
What classmate?

523
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
I can take you there.

524
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,280
But let's make a deal.

525
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,280
You can't tell anyone about this today.

526
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
Okay.

527
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,280
And.

528
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,280
Today is the last day of the class.

529
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,280
Qin Hang.

530
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,280
Get in the car.

531
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,280
Qin Hang.

532
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
Get in the car.

533
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,280
Love each other.

534
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,280
Ren Tianzhan.

535
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,280
You really want to play this?

536
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,280
It's dangerous.

537
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,280
This is dangerous.

538
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
There's more exciting and more dangerous.

539
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,280
And.

540
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,280
Let's go.

541
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,280
Take you to fly.

542
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,280
Let's feel my home.

543
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,280
I don't want to play this.

544
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,280
Don't be polite.

545
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,280
No, I don't want to play this.

546
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,280
You are so fearless.

547
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,280
You have to feel it at a high and low level.

548
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,280
I tell you.

549
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,280
I can go with you.

550
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,280
You're too polite.

551
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,280
I'm not going.

552
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,280
Okay.

553
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,280
I'll fly first.

554
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,280
Don't worry.

555
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,280
You can walk slowly on the mountain.

556
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,280
I hope I can see you get off the bus tonight.

557
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,280
Bye.

558
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,280
You really want to fly?

559
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,280
Ren Tianzhan.

560
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,280
Ren Tianzhan.

561
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,280
Where are you going to eat tonight?

562
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,280
I have to be polite.

563
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,280
such as four.

564
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,280
Celcius Trio 9th Public freedoms NPC

565
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,280
Special bottom paper

566
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,280
Corμά

567
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
The

568
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:10,280
Psych Bird

569
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,280
Rainy.

570
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,280
I thought.

571
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,280
I'm what?

572
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,840
I'm a bird.

573
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,280
I thought you would just

574
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,280
play around with this kind of small project.

575
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,280
You didn't do such an exciting project.

576
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,280
What is this?

577
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,280
I still have a lot of

578
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,280
high-difficulty challenges to complete.

579
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,280
What else?

580
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,280
Look at this.

581
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,280
Why are you keeping

582
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,280
the bank card password?

583
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,280
It's cheap.

584
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,280
Then, apart from the bank card password,

585
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,280
what else is worth your life?

586
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,280
And

587
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,280
there are also

588
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,280
things that are not easy to get.

589
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,280
Ren Tianzhen,

590
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,280
let me ask you a question.

591
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,280
Is it illegal

592
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,280
to talk to people in your house?

593
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,280
Let me ask you a question.

594
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,280
Just answer it.

595
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,280
Why do you have to

596
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,280
say things that

597
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,280
people don't understand?

598
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,280
And here,

599
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,280
look,

600
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,280
this blank space

601
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,280
is half finished.

602
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,280
What? Half finished?

603
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,280
This is my challenge list.

604
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,280
Every time I complete one,

605
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,280
I will put the

606
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,280
experience of that place on it.

607
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,280
It's kind of

608
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,280
a record and a certificate

609
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,280
of my own challenge.

610
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,280
Look.

611
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,280
Skiing,

612
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,280
jumping,

613
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
diving.

614
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,280
Okay, okay, okay.

615
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,280
Okay, okay, okay.

616
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,280
Then, what else

617
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,280
haven't you completed?

618
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,280
My next plan is

619
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,280
to complete

620
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,280
the card of the country first,

621
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,280
then jump,

622
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,280
and then try it.

623
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,280
In a sense,

624
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,280
jumping down

625
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,280
in that way

626
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,280
is probably

627
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,280
the closest and most difficult moment.

628
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,280
I really envy you.

629
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,280
A child who earns money

630
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,280
is a good kid.

631
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,280
You said such a

632
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,280
ridiculous thing

633
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,280
that makes people want to forget.

634
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,280
You envy me.

635
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,280
I envy you, too.

636
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,280
What do you envy me for?

637
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,280
My family

638
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,280
is now single.

639
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,280
I have countless eyes

640
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,280
in my family.

641
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,280
Since I was born,

642
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,280
they have been staring at me.

643
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
They are afraid that

644
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,280
I will have any accident.

645
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,280
But I really sympathize with him.

646
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,280
Now I understand him, too.

647
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
You are so arrogant.

648
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,280
Maybe you will really break your pulse.

649
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
So,

650
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,280
it's good to have parents.

651
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280
It's not so miserable

652
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,280
without parents.

653
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
My life is

654
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
our family.

655
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,280
Your life is yours.

656
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,280
It's not good.

657
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,280
Let's go.

658
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,280
Come on.

659
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,280
Let's go.

660
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
You did

661
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,280
remind me.

662
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,280
I didn't have a family before.

663
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,280
But I have a family now.

664
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
I am the heir

665
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,280
of Jiang's Zhen Sect.

666
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,280
If anything happens to me,

667
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
our Liu Sect will be over.

668
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
So my life

669
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
is precious now.

670
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,280
I want to cherish it.

671
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,280
I don't care about your sect.

672
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,280
I want to protect the sect.

673
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,280
You are kidding.

674
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,280
OK.

675
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
You must protect yourself

676
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,280
when you are the heir.

677
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,280
Be careful.

678
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,280
Don't worry.

679
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,280
Is this the way back?

680
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,280
The most important

681
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,280
journey has not started yet.

682
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,280
Still not going back?

683
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,280
I need to go back.

684
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,280
I have a piece of paper

685
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,280
that I haven't written.

686
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,280
If your dad

687
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,280
does the night test,

688
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,280
I will be doomed.

689
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,280
You have time.

690
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,280
No!

691
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,280
I want to go back.

692
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,280
I don't want to go back.

693
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,680
I'm definitely done.

694
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,840
You have time.

695
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,960
I don't have time.

696
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,160
What are you going to buy here?

697
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,120
You'll know later.

698
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,160
Second Master?

699
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,720
Mr. Ren?

700
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,080
Long time no see.

701
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,240
What good thing have you brought today?

702
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,160
Check this.

703
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,200
You have the real thing I brought,

704
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,280
and you also know the real price.

705
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,640
You canzufute my appearance.

706
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,120
Good things

707
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,400
can handmade with your sense of Machine Life.

708
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,560
And you know

709
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,320
those who represent the village

710
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,040
either must?

711
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,320
We should know the price.

712
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,240
Tell me the price.

713
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:28,920
How about this?

714
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:29,920
One price.

715
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,640
100,000.

716
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,400
100,000?

717
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,360
100,000?

718
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,760
What's that?

719
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,200
It's worth 100,000.

720
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,240
I really can't see

721
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,480
that you have such a rich thing.

722
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:44,760
Deal.

723
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,520
Okay.

724
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,520
How much is this watch?

725
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,120
Let me see.

726
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,880
This watch.

727
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,400
What are you doing?

728
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:56,920
Look.

729
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,920
What's so valuable?

730
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,640
Be honest.

731
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,200
Take it out.

732
00:36:59,200 --> 00:36:59,760
Keep your distance.

733
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,680
Men and women are not allowed to be close.

734
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,400
Take it out.

735
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,520
You lost it?

736
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,440
You lost it?

737
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,560
How can you lose it?

738
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,120
Think about it.

739
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,480
Is it left in the library?

740
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,320
Yes.

741
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,880
I'll call the chief of the museum

742
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,000
and ask him to find it.

743
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,080
Mom, it's okay.

744
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,040
It's the holiday.

745
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,200
They're going to be reunited.

746
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,440
We'll talk about it after the holiday.

747
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:26,880
Okay?

748
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,800
No.

749
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,000
It's so important.

750
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,160
I'll give it to him.

751
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,760
No, no.

752
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,440
Go to the library and find it.

753
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,640
Don't make him worried.

754
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,840
Maybe it's not in the library.

755
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,520
Anyway, you gave me this.

756
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,600
I didn't want to wear it.

757
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,080
Why should I be blamed for losing it?

758
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,040
Besides,

759
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,000
he didn't know the rope was expensive.

760
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,280
I had no choice

761
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,320
if I wanted to break the rope.

762
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,880
I didn't break it.

763
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,120
The rope broke?

764
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,600
That's right.

765
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,000
I changed it twice before.

766
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,240
It's my fault.

767
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,720
I haven't changed it for a long time.

768
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,720
Mom, how can you blame yourself?

769
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,360
You lost hundreds of thousands.

770
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,200
No.

771
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,680
Hundreds of thousands?

772
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,560
It's more valuable

773
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,360
now.

774
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,520
Directed by Wang Zhuazhen

775
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,720
Director Wang.

776
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,000
Yes, it's me.

777
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,480
I'd like to ask you a question.

778
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,240
It's so stuffy in the web shop.

779
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,200
Jeff you back.

780
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,320
No need.

781
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,000
I...

782
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,200
No.

783
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,040
I mean...

784
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,800
I mean, if I knew it...

785
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,640
If I knew it, I would have looked for it

786
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,760
in the library.

787
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,960
What a weird thing.

788
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,160
I'm sorry.

789
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,040
What are you doing?

790
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,920
I'm taking one out for Tianzhen.

791
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,440
A son has his own fortune.

792
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,800
He doesn't take it as a big deal.

793
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,880
Don't be so tired.

794
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,560
Forget it.

795
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,120
No.

796
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,320
He's a single man in our family.

797
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,400
He needs to protect him.

798
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,280
I'm not sure.

799
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,200
He's been a lucky boy

800
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,200
since he was a kid.

801
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,000
He's been given

802
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,320
nothing to drink since he was a kid.

803
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,920
He's either lost or stolen.

804
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,040
What if he keeps doing this?

805
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,600
What can we do?

806
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,120
He's been given

807
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,320
so many things since he was a kid.

808
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,720
He shouldn't have been so old.

809
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
With these things,

810
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,640
in the old days,

811
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,120
we shouldn't dump them

812
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,440
when they're in good condition.

813
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,200
I know.

814
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,100
We should ask them for the

815
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:33,040
stations and

816
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,800
meat for paper and ink for man point.

817
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,800
The more you lose, the more expensive it is.

818
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,840
Why are you here?

819
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,840
Sun Tao Tao.

820
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,800
I...

821
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,200
I'm sitting here for a while.

822
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,160
You two have a deal, right?

823
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,680
Professor Song.

824
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,080
Sorry, I'm late.

825
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,560
How much did you pay for my son's stuff?

826
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,280
100,000.

827
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,040
You know about this?

828
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,800
I'm sorry.

829
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
What do you mean?

830
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,080
You sold it?

831
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,880
We've always been

832
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,840
selling and buying.

833
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,320
Why did you sell it so soon?

834
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,960
I went drinking yesterday.

835
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,520
I gave the shop to a colleague.

836
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,040
He just...

837
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,000
I think you don't want to do business with us.

838
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,120
Do you know this is called taking over assets?

839
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,400
I'm also very slow.

840
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,560
I've been scolding him all morning.

841
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,480
I...

842
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,480
Who did you sell it to?

843
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,720
Who did you get it back?

844
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,120
The key is

845
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,480
we don't know who we sold it to.

846
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,480
It's not a song.

847
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,680
Where's the monitor?

848
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,240
It's broken.

849
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,240
It's a set-up.
