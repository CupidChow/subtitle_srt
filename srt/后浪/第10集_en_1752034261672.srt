The Long Ballad

Episode 16

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Mom,

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm having a talk with Dong Wujie

5
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
at the time of the Chinese medicine forum.

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
How about you and my dad

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
not coming here?

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We can reunite

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
when we have time next time.

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The Long Ballad

11
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Who can defeat me

12
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
in the battle of the good and the bad?

13
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Who can defeat me

14
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
in the battle of the good and the bad?

15
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Great!

16
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Very good!

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The Long Ballad

18
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Please,

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
hero,

20
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
play another song.

21
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Come on!

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Please!

23
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Great!

24
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The Long Ballad

25
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Great!

26
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The Long Ballad

27
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You can defeat me

28
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
in the battle of the good and the bad.

29
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Mom,

30
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
what's wrong?

31
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What's wrong?

32
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Nothing.

33
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The medicine is too dry.

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Dry again?

35
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No,

36
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm having a headache.

37
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Come out!

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Mom,

39
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Mom,

40
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Mom,

41
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

42
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You let him have the medicine.

43
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He proposed it.

44
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He did a good job a few days ago.

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What do you mean?

46
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He almost got into a fire today.

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Where is he?

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yan Zhen,

49
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Is Toto still sleeping?

50
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Tell him to come down.

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He is not in the room.

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Not in?

53
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Call him.

54
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No, he might be out for a walk.

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Call him.

56
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Toto,

57
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Toto,

58
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Hello,

59
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm from the property management.

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The fire department called to ask if anything happened.

61
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Nothing happened.

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We've cleaned up.

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Thank you.

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
To eliminate the safety issues,

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
we need to check it.

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Please come in.

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Toto,

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
where are you?

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Hello,

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm not the host.

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Who are you?

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Where is the host?

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I work as the security guard of the area.

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I came to the yard

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
to see the phone is in the town.

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So I picked it up.

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The host...

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I didn't see the host.

79
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
There is no one here.

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
No one?

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm calling the host.

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Can you do something?

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'll do something.

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,840
It's a man.

85
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,440
Oh no, he might have jumped into the lake.

86
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,160
The socks were finally stuck here.

87
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,520
I took the bamboo pole to dig for a long time,

88
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
but nothing was found.

89
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,680
How deep is the lake?

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,360
The lake is not deep enough.

91
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,720
It's just one meter deep.

92
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,480
But last year,

93
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,560
a man drowned here.

94
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,240
Did he drink alcohol?

95
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,120
There are several bottles of empty wine over there.

96
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,680
He must have drunk a lot.

97
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,160
You should find someone first.

98
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,080
Enzhi,

99
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,480
you know how to swim.

100
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,120
Go down to the lake.

101
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,120
I'll go over there to find someone.

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,080
Be careful, Enzhi.

103
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,200
Be careful, Enzhi.

104
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,440
Step on the pole.

105
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,200
I found it.

106
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,400
I found it, dad.

107
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,960
I found it.

108
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,200
Dad.

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,640
Dad.

110
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,880
You're like him.

111
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,640
You want to take him to the forum.

112
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,440
Do you want to put a joke

113
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,760
in front of others?

114
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,280
Are you taking him to the forum?

115
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,480
Are you asking me?

116
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,800
Don't you want to see the work group?

117
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,720
The list is all in there.

118
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,120
Your name is also in there.

119
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,840
Can I not go?

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,840
I can't go.

121
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,960
I have a lot of opportunities.

122
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,520
No.

123
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,920
You have to go.

124
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,400
Why?

125
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,040
This year's chairman of the board is your uncle.

126
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,480
He asked you to go.

127
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,200
Okay.

128
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,480
Uncle is great.

129
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,600
The most promising.

130
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,760
But I have to take Mengmeng.

131
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,160
Take her?

132
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,080
No.

133
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,240
We have already

134
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,040
reported the number to the forum.

135
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,640
We can't increase the number at will.

136
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:43,920
Mom,

137
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,520
after I leave,

138
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,960
if Mengmeng wakes up in the middle of the night,

139
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,160
you'll be in charge of her.

140
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,440
What should we do?

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,640
Or

142
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,520
should Mengmeng's mom

143
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,960
take her home?

144
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,120
I'll tell Li Quan

145
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
not to go this time.

146
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,880
We have a good relationship.

147
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,120
It's no problem to tell him.

148
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,680
When you go upstairs, look at Toto.

149
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
He just vomited.

150
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,880
Don't put things in your mouth.

151
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,160
I'll go.

152
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,760
I won't sleep tonight.

153
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,720
I'll keep an eye on them.

154
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,200
Mom,

155
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,520
we can talk about it tomorrow.

156
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,600
You've been working all night.

157
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,480
Go back to sleep.

158
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,560
What did you do tonight?

159
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,880
Nothing.

160
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,200
Look at my eyes.

161
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,400
Iâ€¦

162
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
What's going on?

163
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,480
Did you have a drink with Toto?

164
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,640
No.

165
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,240
No?

166
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,280
He's fine today.

167
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,920
It was half of your luck.

168
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,280
If anything happened to him,

169
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,280
Do you think we will go to jail?

170
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
I know you don't like him.

171
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,280
But you can't hurt him.

172
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,280
This is the basic conscience of a person.

173
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,280
Mom, I just drank with him.

174
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,280
I didn't expect him to fall into the water.

175
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,280
You are now in a good relationship with him.

176
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,280
You can already be a brother.

177
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,280
Listen to me.

178
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,280
How long can Sun Tou Tou stay in this house?

179
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Can she stay and watch her own performance?

180
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,280
But you are different.

181
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,280
You will be a good daughter-in-law.

182
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,280
If your father knows about this,

183
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,280
you will be even earlier than Sun Tou Tou.

184
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,280
If you don't adjust your mind,

185
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
you can't live with him peacefully.

186
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,280
I can't protect you for many times.

187
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,280
Mom, I know I was wrong.

188
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,280
I won't do it again.

189
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,280
You dare to do it again?

190
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,280
Why are you laughing?

191
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,280
I really won't do it again.

192
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,280
Stay away from him.

193
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Dad.

194
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,280
And that little girl.

195
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,280
Stay away from her.

196
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,280
I'm warning you very seriously.

197
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,280
Mom, what do you want to eat?

198
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
I'll go get it.

199
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
You can take care of yourself.

200
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,280
Mom.

201
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
Here.

202
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Tian Tian.

203
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
Eat some more.

204
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
I'm dying.

205
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,280
Mom.

206
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,280
I'm so sad.

207
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,280
I'm dying. I'm really dying.

208
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,280
What are you talking about?

209
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
I'm so sad.

210
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,280
It's cold and hot.

211
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,280
I'm so hungry.

212
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,280
It's like eating a bowl of noodles.

213
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,280
It seems you need to drink some soup.

214
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
No, no.

215
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,280
I'll be fine after a few days.

216
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
I'll go to sleep.

217
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
Drink the porridge.

218
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Take a sip.

219
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,280
Only porridge?

220
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Yes.

221
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,280
Just drink it?

222
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,280
Who drank with you yesterday?

223
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,280
I.

224
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
Alone.

225
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,280
I drank seven or eight bottles of beer.

226
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,280
And a bottle of Shaoxing wine.

227
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,280
Shaoxing wine?

228
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,280
No.

229
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,280
You said it.

230
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,280
Drink a cup of Yao Mingyue.

231
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
Drink it and become three people.

232
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,280
And then I just want to feel

233
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,280
how he became three people.

234
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,280
Just curious.

235
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,280
See how he became three people.

236
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,280
It's weird.

237
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
So much wine.

238
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,280
You drank alone?

239
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
It's not a matter of days

240
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,280
if the wine is good.

241
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,280
I drank mixed wine last night.

242
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,280
The beer and the yellow wine,

243
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
they are together.

244
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,280
Tao Tao.

245
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,280
You can't talk in front of your master.

246
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,280
You are a man of justice.

247
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,280
If I find you lying,

248
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,280
the punishment will be double.

249
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
I'm sorry.

250
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,280
You want me to do it?

251
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,280
One does what one should do.

252
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,280
I'm the only one.

253
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,280
It's none of others' business.

254
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Next.

255
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,280
The penalty is one month.

256
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,280
You applied to give Mengmeng medicine.

257
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,280
But you didn't fulfill your mission.

258
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
You didn't keep your promise.

259
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,280
You wasted Mengmeng medicine.

260
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,280
Mengmeng didn't drink it today.

261
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
Mengmeng, I'm sorry.

262
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,280
It was an accident last night.

263
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
I won't do this again.

264
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
I won't do this again.

265
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Look at me now.

266
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
I've been punished.

267
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,280
Forgive me, okay?

268
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,280
Mengmeng, forgive me.

269
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,280
I can't do this.

270
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,280
I'll go upstairs to lie down.

271
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,280
Put your hands out.

272
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
Left hand to the right.

273
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,280
Big sister, you are so smart.

274
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,280
What's going on?

275
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,280
You still want to be trained?

276
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,280
Night is like a gold.

277
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
Day by day.

278
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,280
Feel the pulse of your pulse.

279
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,280
What else can you feel?

280
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,280
I can't do this.

281
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,280
I can't do this.

282
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,280
What's going on?

283
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,280
Let me see.

284
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,280
I'm dying.

285
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,280
No, Chi Xun.

286
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,280
Drink this.

287
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,280
What's this?

288
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Let me see.

289
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,280
Drink the fukang drink.

290
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
Drink it while it's hot.

291
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,280
Fukuoka?

292
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,280
I can't live anymore.

293
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,280
I have to drink fukuoka now.

294
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,280
Not fukuoka.

295
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,280
Fukuoka.

296
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,280
What is this?

297
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,280
Spicy hot pot soup.

298
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,280
You can't lie to me.

299
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
It doesn't have the flavor of hot pot.

300
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,280
It's Chinese medicine.

301
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,280
It's mainly some medicine in the kitchen.

302
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,280
For example, dry ginger,

303
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
orange peel,

304
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,280
dates, and so on.

305
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,280
You were drunk yesterday.

306
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,280
Your stomach is weak.

307
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
You feel hot.

308
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,280
You jump into the water.

309
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,280
The water is cold.

310
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,280
Cold from the feet.

311
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
Hot and cold.

312
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
In the end,

313
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,280
it's your stomach that starts to fight.

314
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
That's your stomach.

315
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,280
In fact, your body

316
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,280
is automatically cooling down.

317
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,280
The theory of heat and cold

318
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,280
is very clear.

319
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,280
Those who suffer from heat and cold

320
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,280
will be affected by cold.

321
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,280
Whether you have a fever

322
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,280
or have a stomach ache,

323
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,280
as long as you don't eat your stomach,

324
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,280
most of the cold will be forced on you.

325
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,280
Let me give you an example.

326
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
Our door and window

327
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
are all closed.

328
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,280
The mosquito and flies can't fly out.

329
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
What should I do?

330
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,280
I open a window

331
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,280
and eat some medicine

332
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,280
such as heart temperature.

333
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,280
Let the body

334
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,280
automatically release the cold air.

335
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,280
The body will be fine.

336
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
This is what you said.

337
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,280
The two are in a serious relationship.

338
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Unknowingly and

339
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,280
in the midst of the unhappiness,

340
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,280
the unhappiness.

341
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
It means that food

342
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,280
is in a state of emergency.

343
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,280
If you do this, you won't get sick.

344
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
If you get sick,

345
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,280
you will have a cold.

346
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
This will make you better.

347
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
Is that what you mean?

348
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,280
Yes. Drink it while it's hot.

349
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,280
I'm sorry.

350
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
I'll go upstairs and lie down for a while.

351
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Don't eat the porridge.

352
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,280
It's good for your health.

353
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,280
You have a good son.

354
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,280
Who says a girl is inferior to a boy?

355
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
I think I'm fine.

356
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
I'll leave it to you.

357
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
Look at your son.

358
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
He's a bold and knowledgeable person.

359
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,280
He's no match for you.

360
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,280
He's never been taught properly.

361
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
He doesn't even have parents.

362
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
He's not responsible at all.

363
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,280
You want to see him go out?

364
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
He's not even a door.

365
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
If you let me know again,

366
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,280
I won't let him go.

367
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
I'm sorry.

368
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,280
It's a pity

369
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,280
that your daughter has been popular for 30 years.

370
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:17,280
If you drink to the best of your ability,

371
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
I wonder how much you can make up for it.

372
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
I'm a big village.

373
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
If I want to harm others,

374
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,280
I don't have such good wine.

375
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
I can just buy a bottle of wine

376
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,280
for three or five years.

377
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,280
I'm going to be a bad man again.

378
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
I'll see him.

379
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,280
I'll see him.

380
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,280
Where's the principal?

381
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,280
The principal is here.

382
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,280
We're having lunch break.

383
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
It's okay. I'll find Xin Zheng.

384
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,280
He's picking up medicine.

385
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,280
Okay, I'll wait for him.

386
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Okay.

387
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,280
Dad, it's here.

388
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,280
Look at this clinic.

389
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,280
It's really a good place.

390
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
Qu'er works here.

391
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,280
That's great.

392
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
President Wu.

393
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,280
Hello.

394
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,280
You're here.

395
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,280
I'm busy.

396
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
Hurry up.

397
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
I'll get you some water.

398
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
No, I'll do it myself.

399
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,280
Are you here to see a doctor or to do something?

400
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,280
We don't see the doctor.

401
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,280
We're looking for someone.

402
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
He works here.

403
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,280
Who are you looking for?

404
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,280
Mom.

405
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,280
Qu'er.

406
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
Son.

407
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,280
Why are you here?

408
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
I'm here to see you.

409
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,280
It's really good here.

410
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,280
It's great.

411
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,280
The environment is so nice.

412
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,280
President Wu, thank you

413
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,280
for introducing me to work.

414
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,280
Thank you so much.

415
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
His dad and I

416
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,280
don't have any culture

417
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,280
or ability.

418
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,280
We'll count on him

419
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,280
to help us.

420
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,280
He's a good boy.

421
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,280
Thank you.

422
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,280
Thank you for your kindness.

423
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
What are you doing?

424
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,280
You must keep this.

425
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
This is for Professor Ren.

426
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
This is yours.

427
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,280
One of you

428
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,280
helped our son

429
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
find a job.

430
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,280
The other is the leader

431
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
of our son.

432
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,280
You're all our benefactors.

433
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,280
Sit down.

434
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,280
I have a fate with my son.

435
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
I can't accept this special property.

436
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,280
No.

437
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,280
President Wu, you must keep it.

438
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,280
This is our little kindness

439
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,280
to you.

440
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
It may be a great help.

441
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,280
But to our family,

442
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,280
it's a great favor.

443
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,280
Our village head said

444
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,280
the city

445
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
has a good reputation

446
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,280
with a good household.

447
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,280
A good household?

448
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,280
Yes.

449
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,280
The hospital can help

450
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,280
Qiao to get a good household.

451
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,280
Thank you so much.

452
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,280
Well,

453
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,280
I'll take

454
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
these special properties

455
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,280
this time.

456
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,280
I can't bring them

457
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
next time.

458
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,280
Okay?

459
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,280
We've made a deal.

460
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,280
Li Quan,

461
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,280
you kids

462
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,280
are loyal to

463
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,280
the future.

464
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,280
You must do your best.

465
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Do you understand?

466
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
It's not easy to find

467
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,280
parents from Jiangzhou.

468
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,280
They're all out there.

469
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
You must do your best.

470
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,280
I'll be there.

471
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
I'll be there.

472
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
I'll be there.

473
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,280
You can go out

474
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,280
and have a walk.

475
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
Okay.

476
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,280
Go out and have a walk.

477
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,280
Thank you.

478
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,280
Don't worry.

479
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,280
I've got the kids.

480
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,280
Okay. Thank you.

481
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,280
You can tell him later.

482
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,280
Why did you tell him?

483
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,280
Why did you tell him?

484
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
What are you afraid of?

485
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,280
I'll tell him.

486
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,280
Mom,

487
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,280
you said you wouldn't come.

488
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,280
Why are you here?

489
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,280
You said Duanwu was busy.

490
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,280
We came earlier.

491
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,280
Okay.

492
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,280
Wait for me.

493
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
I'll change my clothes

494
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,280
and take you out.

495
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,280
No.

496
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,280
You don't have to accompany us.

497
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,280
We'll leave after a few words.

498
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,280
Okay.

499
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,280
Go ahead.

500
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,280
Qiao,

501
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,280
tell me the truth.

502
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,280
How much money

503
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,280
can you get every month?

504
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,280
Mom,

505
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,280
I just started working.

506
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,280
I can't make a few money

507
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,280
every month.

508
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,280
So I have no savings.

509
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,280
Yes.

510
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,280
Mom, what's wrong with you?

511
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,280
Tell me directly.

512
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,280
You said you

513
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
talked to your child.

514
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,280
Why are you going around?

515
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,280
What do you mean?

516
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,280
Just tell me directly.

517
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,280
What are you afraid of?

518
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,280
Do you have 20,000 yuan?

519
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
I'm going to

520
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,280
put some crayfish in the fish pond

521
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,280
to save money for the winter.

522
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,280
Qiao,

523
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,280
here's the thing.

524
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,280
It's cold in the spring this year.

525
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,280
Half of our fish is dead.

526
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,280
The money is floating.

527
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
Your brother

528
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,280
is going to middle school this year.

529
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,280
We have to save money for him.

530
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,280
Mom,

531
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,280
I understand.

532
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
Dad,

533
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,280
I'll save more money later.

534
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
I'll send it all to my family.

535
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,280
No, kid,

536
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,280
look at me.

537
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,280
I'm asking you for money.

538
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
I'm embarrassed to say it.

539
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,280
It's a special time.

540
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,280
Just tell me

541
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,280
how much money you have now.

542
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,280
It's not urgent.

543
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
It's not urgent.

544
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
Just pretend it.

545
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,280
Okay, okay.

546
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,280
Go to work.

547
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
We're just here to see you.

548
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
Go, go, go.

549
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
Go to work.

550
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
It's okay.

551
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,280
It's okay.

552
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,280
Don't ask for leave.

553
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,280
Do you hear me?

554
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,280
Go, go, go.

555
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,280
Go.

556
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,280
Go, go, go.

557
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,280
No.

558
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
Go.

559
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,280
Don't ask for leave.

560
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,280
You'll lose your salary.

561
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,280
What do you want?

562
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,280
Mom,

563
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,280
you're not staying here for one night?

564
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
No.

565
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,280
We have to spend money.

566
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,280
Go.

567
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,280
Go.

568
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,280
What's going on?

569
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
What's going on?

570
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
What's going on?

571
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,280
What's going on?

572
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,280
How did he get here?

573
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,280
Come back here.

574
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,280
Can't we die here?

575
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
I don't know.

576
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,280
I'm too Mmmm.

577
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,280
Can't.

578
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:26,860
Mom,

579
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,280
I don't know what lost weight,

580
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,280
and lost weight is.

581
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,780
It's not just eating.

582
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
Go.

583
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
Come back here.

584
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,280
Back to sleep.

585
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
Come on.

586
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,280
You went to work.

587
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,280
I'll feed you.

588
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:46,960
Don't worry.

589
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,280
How about this?

590
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,200
We can do it next time.

591
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:51,800
I'm sorry.

592
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,240
I'm sorry.

593
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,720
I forgot it.

594
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,120
Right?

595
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,200
It's okay.

596
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,120
How's it going?

597
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,000
Are you ready?

598
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Let's go.

599
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,800
Yi Quan, come with me.

600
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,360
What?

601
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,040
You're so generous.

602
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,160
I'm a good president.

603
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,440
I can't take you with me.

604
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,040
Come on.

605
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,640
Let's go.

606
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:17,840
Let's go.

607
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,360
Let's go.

608
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:18,800
Okay.

609
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,480
Let's go.

610
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,760
Mr. Yu.

611
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,200
Thank you.

612
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,040
Kid.

613
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,640
I'm so happy

614
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,320
to think of the time

615
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,400
when I was young.

616
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,440
Lin Lan.

617
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,040
Mr. Sheng, you're here too?

618
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,120
What's wrong?

619
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,840
Smell it.

620
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,400
It's not herb.

621
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,560
Don't mess around.

622
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,160
The world of the sky is gray.

623
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,160
The sky is gray.

624
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
The sky is gray.

625
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,160
The sky is gray.

626
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,360
Where is this?

627
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,160
This is a person's home.

628
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,080
The owner of this house

629
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,560
is an entrepreneur in the Chinese medicine industry.

630
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,000
He sponsored many

631
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,480
Chinese medicine foundation's charity.

632
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,000
He has sponsored many students.

633
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So this forum

634
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,080
is our place.

635
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,400
The most important thing is that

636
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,440
there is a big grassland behind him.

637
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,440
Duanwu is the season of love.

638
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,160
Where are you?

639
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,680
He has a grape tree.

640
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,000
Hello, Mr. Qin.

641
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,480
Uncle.

642
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,120
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

643
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,800
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

644
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,600
Hello.

645
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,040
Today's speech is up to you.

646
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,880
No problem, Mr. Zhang.

647
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,280
Where is Qian Zhen?

648
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:15,880
Brother.

649
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,240
I brought you

650
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,840
the stinky tofu and salted shrimp made by Uncle.

651
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,960
Good.

652
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,520
Good stuff.

653
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,320
I'll give it to you later.

654
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,840
Look at my sister.

655
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,440
She doesn't leave me any face.

656
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,320
The taste of the food is good.

657
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,560
You've been

658
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,800
in the city all the way.

659
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,240
But it's also good to be in the city

660
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,240
after you've been here.

661
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,840
Mr. Zhang.

662
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,760
I heard that

663
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,160
you're running a city class.

664
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,480
You're doing great things in the Ministry of Education.

665
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,360
Good.

666
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,680
You're doing great things in the Ministry of Education.

667
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,040
Mr. Zhang.

668
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,320
I was just about to report to you

669
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,920
that the city class I proposed

670
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,840
is in the process of developing

671
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,440
the results led by Professor Ren.

672
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,080
There are many difficulties

673
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,280
in this process.

674
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,840
So I have to ask Mr. Zhang

675
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,120
to support you.

676
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,800
OK.

677
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,400
Aren't you the principal?

678
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,480
I'm the principal.

679
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,560
I'm the principal.

680
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,280
Aren't you the principal?

681
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,120
Does this matter have anything to do with you?

682
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,040
You may not know it.

683
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,480
Now I've given the good reputation

684
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,520
to Professor Ren.

685
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,600
And I'll take all the responsibility.

686
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,920
Good.

687
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,960
Good.

688
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,160
Xingzi.

689
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,400
You're running

690
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,120
a city class in the university, right?

691
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,680
The University of TCM

692
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,680
is really responsible.

693
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,760
Indeed.

694
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,560
We should

695
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,440
reform the teaching system.

696
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,480
The original teaching of Chinese artists

697
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,600
is a great success.

698
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,320
Chinese culture is prosperous.

699
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,200
It's not like other cultures.

700
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,800
It's a great success.

701
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,560
I've done a lot

702
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,320
for the city class.

703
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,080
Mr. Wu.

704
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,120
Professor Ren.

705
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,080
If there's anything I need to contribute,

706
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,800
I'll do it.

707
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,040
I'm lucky to have you.

708
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,800
Without you,

709
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,720
I can't be who I am.

710
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,600
He's laughing at me.

711
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,920
The last time he was on a plane,

712
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,800
that was a scene.

713
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,000
What scene?

714
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,040
Come on.

715
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,720
Come here.

716
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,360
Hurry up.

717
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,840
Hurry up.

718
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,880
Greetings, Mr. Zhang.

719
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,320
Young Master.

720
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,480
The successor of Jiang's Sect,

721
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,480
Sun Toudou.

722
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,160
He's my junior.

723
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,440
I'm flattered.

724
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,040
I'm flattered.

725
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,640
Well.

726
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,800
When my father was alive,

727
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,680
he and Ling

728
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,160
were his grandmothers.

729
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,560
Yes.

730
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,120
My father and I

731
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,600
had a deep friendship.

732
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,840
Well.

733
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,120
I'll have a good drink

734
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,680
with my junior later.

735
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,520
That's good.

736
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,800
I can drink.

737
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,640
I'll climb you.

738
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,400
Okay.

739
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,360
Are you going to drink one bottle

740
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,160
or half a bottle?

741
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,120
Half a bottle.

742
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,920
Half a bottle.

743
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,520
Please come in.

744
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,520
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

745
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,680
Hello.

746
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,880
Here they are.

747
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,160
Hello.

748
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,280
Junior.

749
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,920
Come here.

750
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,800
Sit down.

751
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,200
What's up?

752
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,000
Here they are.

753
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,440
Come on.

754
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:39,960
Come on.

755
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,080
Tianzhen.

756
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,800
Uncle.

757
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,200
You haven't seen your father, have you?

758
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,960
No.

759
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,600
Your grandfather is testing you.

760
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,640
Uncle.

761
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,920
Can we have a good meal

762
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,120
without a test today?

763
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,400
I'm a little nervous.

764
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,880
Enjoy your meal.

765
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,720
No test.

766
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,880
No test.

767
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,560
Yes.

768
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,120
Come on.

769
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,800
Come here.

770
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,400
Uncle.

771
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,600
I have a patient here.

772
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,040
I'm worried about him.

773
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,120
I have to stay with him.

774
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,600
Enjoy your meal.

775
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,760
Where is the patient?

776
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,560
Is she his girlfriend?

777
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,520
Come on.

778
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,560
Come here.

779
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,240
Okay.

780
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,800
Secretary Qian.

781
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,760
Two chairs, please.

782
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,480
Young people like us

783
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,760
are also good at drinking.

784
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,560
Yes.

785
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,520
Master.

786
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,080
I'm not drinking today.

787
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,080
I'm an elder today.

788
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,480
Okay.

789
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,080
You can drink less

790
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,400
in this situation.

791
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,160
No.

792
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,160
No.

793
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,640
I'm going to set an example for the younger generation.

794
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,440
Sit down.

795
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:55,760
Good boy.

796
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,680
Good boy.

797
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,160
Collection of Instruction of Scholars

798
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,840
Fang Li.

799
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,360
Why are you here?

800
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,160
Why can't I be here?

801
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,800
What's the matter?

802
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,680
You don't have it?

803
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,960
Shen You!

804
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,720
What are you doing here?

805
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:39,760
Wait.

806
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,000
What are you two doing together?

807
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,240
He brought me here.

808
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,280
I didn't.

809
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,200
You're so mean.

810
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,920
Let me go with you.

811
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,160
People like me who work as an undercover

812
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,240
have to be in the old market to establish a place.

813
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,000
Take me with you.

814
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,880
You're a big man.

815
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,400
You're not easy to deal with.

816
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,160
Besides,

817
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,200
there are many ways to go.

818
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,080
I can see it.

819
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,760
You have to go up the mountain if you can't see it.

820
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,160
You must go by night.

821
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,560
If you meet a bear or a big bear,

822
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,320
it's very dangerous.

823
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
The most important thing is

824
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,960
it's a long road.

825
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,160
You have to change your way of driving.

826
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,240
Come on.

827
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,920
Thank you.

828
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,600
Let me take a break.

829
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,480
I'll drive after I vomit.

830
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,200
No.

831
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,480
You'll drive after you vomit.

832
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,920
Why?

833
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,840
I'll get dizzy.

834
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,160
You can't get dizzy when you drive.

835
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,080
Only those who drive can get dizzy.

836
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,600
I can't.

837
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,520
What? You can't?

838
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,720
I can't drive.

839
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,560
You can't drive?

840
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,120
You can't drive?

841
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,000
You told me

842
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,480
you were going to change your way of driving.

843
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,200
Who gave you the lid when you drank water?

844
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,560
Who gave you the lid when you drank water?

845
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,160
Right?

846
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
It's for you.

847
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,280
Why are you leaving?

848
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,240
Hey!

849
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,640
Wait for me!

850
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,120
Wait for me!

851
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,600
I...

852
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,520
Hey!

853
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:01,880
I...

854
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,720
Wang Shiyan.

855
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,760
Let me put it this way.

856
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,480
You were caught in the back.

857
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,960
It's not good enough

858
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,480
to throw you in the wilderness

859
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,600
and make you a corpse.

860
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,760
You should be contented.

861
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,600
Do you know that?

862
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,520
He wanted to do that.

863
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,400
But I was too Diana.

864
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,960
Tell us.

865
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,880
Look,

866
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,440
I checked everything.

867
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,520
There's not a single penny here.

868
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,600
Wipe it well before you take it home.

869
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,520
Tell us the details.

870
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:13,820
Take one

871
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,500
Mr. Lu.

872
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,880
I thought we were having a meeting,

873
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,460
how come we are here again for the love existential test.

874
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,260
Why not call in our nephew today?

875
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,900
Yesterday me and my senior,

876
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,100
Supervisor Zhang,

877
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,140
Supervisor Zhang.

878
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:34,820
We went out to talk a lot in the evenings.

879
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:34,900
We went out to talk a lot in the evenings.

880
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,380
We went out to talk a lot in the evenings.

881
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,980
He wanted to know the true skills

882
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,580
and I knew it already.

883
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,940
How would I ever be able

884
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,800
16-year-old sausages

885
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,240
then you must have a respectful heart.

886
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,960
That is to say, you must respect your teacher from the bottom of your heart.

887
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,720
I didn't say that I didn't respect your eldest nephew.

888
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,400
I thought that he was my relative. Isn't that more friendly?

889
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,360
And I also said that inheritance is like a river entering the sea.

890
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,600
The water flows to the bottom.

891
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,280
When I have a respectful heart,

892
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,680
I can absorb all of my master's skills like a ship.

893
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:33,040
He also said that there are 64

894
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,160
That's it.

895
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,000
Anyway, the teacher told me that I must respect my teacher.

896
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,600
Yes.

897
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,120
We have two improvements today.

898
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,240
One is that we can hear the good words.

899
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,840
The second is that we can ask questions.

900
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,840
That's very good.

901
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,160
Actually, we are all very active.

902
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,840
The fifth is the time of the sun.

903
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,280
The fifth is the time of the sun.

904
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,280
And the grass is also warm.

905
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:14,440
So we picked the grass to warm the sun today.

906
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,160
Why can grass warm the sun?

907
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:30,120
To be precise, grass is a kind of

908
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:52,440
To fry meat and to tone the girl nicely

909
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,440
The right way is to follow the right path.

910
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,800
The acorn can be found

911
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,360
on the ground.

912
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,120
It can be used on people.

913
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,160
It can also

914
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,520
break through obstacles

915
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,840
and find the exit.

916
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,840
I thought that

917
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,480
that

918
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:11,840
acorn

919
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,640
was a disease of heat.

920
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,760
I didn't expect that the bud was a disease.

921
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,440
Whether it's heat

922
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,920
or the bud,

923
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,320
it's good for the patient's recovery.

924
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,840
There are always benefits.

925
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,800
What are the benefits?

926
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,520
It's good for you.

927
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,800
If that's so,

928
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,960
I'll pick more acorns today.

929
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,200
I'll pick more.

930
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,720
Look at the acorn.

931
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,680
After picking it, hang it on the door.

932
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,200
Or, wash an acorn bath.

933
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,560
It's very good for the body.

934
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:44,920
It's warm.

935
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,040
Dad.

936
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:51,960
Let's go.

937
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,760
The weather is good.

938
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:07,960
The weather is good.

939
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:08,640
Okay.

940
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,360
Professor Rui.

941
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,200
Tea.

942
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,000
Professor Rui.

943
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:13,760
What's up?

944
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,760
I have a favor to ask.

945
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,400
Go ahead.

946
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,120
My daughter has a fever.

947
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,280
We've been here for two days.

948
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,920
I don't know if she has a stomachache or a cold.

949
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,440
She just had a fever this morning.

950
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,720
Now she has a fever again.

951
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,440
Please go to see her.

952
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,240
Don't worry.

953
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:30,640
Don't worry.

954
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,440
Mr. Zheng.

955
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,560
The child has a fever.

956
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,640
Don't worry.

957
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,120
Look.

958
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,720
So many doctors are here.
