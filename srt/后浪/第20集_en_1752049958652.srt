The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,600
When the two of us were resting at home,

4
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,800
we chatted and ate together.

5
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,400
I came home late at night,

6
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,200
and he waited for me at the alley.

7
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,400
It was really warm.

8
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,600
But every time I had this thought,

9
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,000
I pulled myself back.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,200
I...

11
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,600
I couldn't choose him.

12
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,800
Because of his condition,

13
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,000
if I were with him,

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,400
I'd be burdened with it for the rest of my life.

15
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,800
I'm alone.

16
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
I'm not a solo skier.

17
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,400
I'm not that tired.

18
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't plan to do anything for myself.

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,200
Why are you looking at me like that?

20
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,400
I'm not that kind of person who's vain and vain.

21
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,200
I just don't want to have too much responsibility.

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,200
I think if two people are together,

23
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,400
it's quite tiring.

24
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
It's not as good as being alone.

25
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,000
If two people are together,

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,600
it's at least more than one person can do.

27
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,400
And besides,

28
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,000
he's a nice person.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,800
He can even make medicine for you.

30
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,200
These 10 yuan express delivery can solve a problem.

31
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,000
Don't do anything that's going to last forever.

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,400
Is the happiness of life

33
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,200
also something that two people can fight for together?

34
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
I'm telling you,

35
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Zhao Li Xun is quite hardworking.

36
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,800
Really.

37
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
I think in a few years,

38
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,800
he'll surely be better.

39
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,200
Maybe he can even start a family.

40
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Right?

41
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,400
Don't be too anxious.

42
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,400
But speaking of which,

43
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,200
I think the most important thing is

44
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,400
whether you like him or not.

45
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
I think

46
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,400
love is too luxurious for me.

47
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,800
I don't have the capital.

48
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,200
Tian Jingxiao,

49
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,000
I haven't found out that you're so

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,600
interested in conditions.

51
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,200
If you're so interested in conditions,

52
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,600
you can get a job at Jingshui Hotel.

53
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,200
Why don't you look for a job in your hospital?

54
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,600
I don't want to look for a job.

55
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,000
Who can like me?

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,600
Those who can work in our hospital are all doctors.

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,400
The people selected from all over the country

58
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,200
are all in the local women's hospital.

59
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,400
They lack resources.

60
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,800
Why would people choose me as an outsider?

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,200
There's a kind of competition in this city.

62
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,600
Why can't men find a partner

63
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,200
and women find a partner?

64
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,400
We're not measuring our feelings now.

65
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,200
We're comparing our conditions.

66
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,800
We want to be better than ourselves.

67
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,600
Just let it be.

68
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Don't talk about me.

69
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,000
You haven't found one either.

70
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,400
You can't even find one.

71
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,600
How can I?

72
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
At least, there should be a foundation.

73
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
I can't even get a job in a high school.

74
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,600
I don't even have a job.

75
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
And...

76
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
I don't even have a family.

77
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,400
I don't have anything.

78
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,600
How can I find one?

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,200
You don't have anything?

80
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,600
You're already a successor.

81
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,600
I'm living like a five-star novel.

82
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,400
I'm a successor.

83
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,800
Let me tell you.

84
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Right now,

85
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,400
I don't want to think about anything else.

86
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,600
I don't have the heart.

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,400
I just want to learn this skill first.

88
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,600
And I think I'm really

89
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,200
in a sense of mission now.

90
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,000
I just want to learn it well

91
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,600
and make this style shine.

92
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
You're serious?

93
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,200
This doesn't look like you.

94
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,400
What about your original intention?

95
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,600
You're naive.

96
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,200
Didn't you learn it

97
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,800
because you saw the color?

98
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Him?

99
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,600
What's wrong?

100
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,800
He likes Mengmeng.

101
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,000
His mom thinks so too.

102
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
I think so too.

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,200
So, I just...

104
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,400
Besides,

105
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,600
you don't even like Zhao Liquan.

106
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,600
I'm like this.

107
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,200
Even if there's something,

108
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
can people in the family

109
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,400
like me?

110
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,000
We can be a match.

111
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,800
Don't do this.

112
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,600
In the past,

113
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,400
you didn't fear the sky,

114
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,000
you didn't fear the ground,

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,400
you didn't fear the ground,

116
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,200
where did you go?

117
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,600
Now you're still being

118
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
restricted by

119
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
the customs and customs.

120
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,800
I'm not afraid of the sky,

121
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
I'm not afraid of the ground.

122
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,800
I want the bags

123
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,200
in the shopping malls

124
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
as well.

125
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,400
I want the

126
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,600
2,000 or 3,000,000 yuan

127
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,800
of the house as well.

128
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,000
Can I have it?

129
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,200
So I have to

130
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,800
get the

131
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,000
cake from the sky

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,200
and give it to you.

133
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,400
You're right.

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,400
We don't even

135
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,200
have bread and crab.

136
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
We can't even think about

137
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
choosing love

138
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,400
or bread.

139
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,400
I'm sorry.

140
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
I'm sorry.

142
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
I'm sorry.

143
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,200
Tong Tong.

144
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,400
If we both

145
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,200
don't have a boyfriend

146
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
after we get old,

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,200
let's live together.

148
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,800
I'll cook,

149
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
you wash the dishes.

150
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
You can do it.

151
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
I...

152
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,200
I'll cook, you wash the dishes.

153
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay, okay, okay.

154
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,800
Can I?

155
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,000
Just be together.

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Just be together.

157
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,200
Enough.

158
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,600
Why are you so dramatic?

159
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,600
My aunt told me

160
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,400
you had a chance

161
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,600
to get married this year,

162
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,200
right?

163
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,800
I was just talking nonsense.

164
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
It's all a lie.

165
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,000
I know that.

166
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Besides the annual salary,

167
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
you have to

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,200
check the name of your hospital.

169
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What about next year?

170
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,600
Next year,

171
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,800
you'll get 10,000 or 9,000 yuan.

172
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,600
I heard that

173
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,800
after you get married,

174
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,000
many private hospitals

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
will come to rob you.

176
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What do you mean?

177
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,400
Mr. Cao.

178
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Calm down.

179
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,200
Since we chose to date,

180
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
it must be different

181
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,400
from free love.

182
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
So we don't need to

183
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
test each other.

184
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
I don't like

185
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,600
to play the game of love and beauty.

186
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,800
I believe that you are not the kind of person

187
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,600
who can't figure out

188
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,800
the truth.

189
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,400
So why don't we be more direct?

190
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,400
Okay.

191
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,000
I didn't mean anything else.

192
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't misunderstand.

193
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,600
I just think

194
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,000
you haven't bought a house yet.

195
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,800
The conditions of private hospitals

196
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
are better than public hospitals.

197
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,600
I heard that

198
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,400
it's very profitable to be a child doctor

199
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
in private hospitals.

200
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,800
May I ask

201
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,400
if you have any family members

202
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,600
who have inherited diseases?

203
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,400
No.

204
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,800
May I ask

205
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,000
if you have a house?

206
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,600
I do.

207
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,200
It's for three people in my family.

208
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,600
May I ask

209
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,000
if you accept the physical examination before marriage?

210
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
I can accept it.

211
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,800
But do you pay for it?

212
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,000
How much is your salary?

213
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,800
I must pay for it.

214
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,000
But I haven't worked for a while.

215
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
No work?

216
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,600
Then why do you support yourself?

217
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,000
Do you have a mortgage?

218
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,400
Do you have any idea

219
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,600
about your future career and family?

220
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,800
No idea.

221
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,000
How many do you want to have?

222
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I have no idea how many I want to have.

223
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,400
I didn't have a mortgage long ago.

224
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,400
I live on my previous income.

225
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,400
My previous income was stable.

226
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,800
I had 3 million a year.

227
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
3 million?

228
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
That's great.

229
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,200
I have no problem with you.

230
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,800
Why do you ask this?

231
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
To be honest,

232
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
my last marriage was a private house.

233
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,400
Now I rent a house.

234
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,600
You have a house and no mortgage.

235
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm very satisfied with you.

236
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,400
Okay.

237
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
We can continue.

238
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,400
Are you busy now?

239
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,200
Are you busy with work?

240
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,800
Not bad.

241
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,200
I'm not very busy.

242
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,600
I have a lot of time

243
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,800
to spare.

244
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,600
Please stand up.

245
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,600
Turn around.

246
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,200
Slow down.

247
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,000
Sit down.

248
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Okay, sit down.

249
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,600
I have 3 forms here.

250
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,400
Please fill them in.

251
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,600
International Standard Intelligence Test.

252
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,000
MBTI, professional personality test.

253
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,800
Caterpillar 16PF, personality test.

254
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,200
What's this?

255
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,600
I'm looking for a partner to marry me.

256
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,400
I'm looking for a father for my future child.

257
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,800
Or I want a child to be my wife.

258
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,400
Do you understand?

259
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,200
Yes, very.

260
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,800
So if we are both satisfied with each other,

261
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,200
I want to be fair.

262
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,400
I want to make it clear to you in advance.

263
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,800
What if something happens

264
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,000
after we have a child?

265
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,200
What should we do?

266
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
You won't kill the child, right?

267
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,200
I won't kill the child.

268
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,600
I'll kill you.

269
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,600
What do you like to do?

270
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,200
Cook.

271
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
Do you like watching movies?

272
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,400
Listening to songs?

273
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Going on a trip?

274
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes.

275
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I have everything you want.

276
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You can do whatever I want.

277
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Let's settle it like this today.

278
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,200
Wait.

279
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,200
You have a high level of near vision.

280
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,600
I had a near vision before.

281
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,000
I had a near vision surgery.

282
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,800
Now I have 1.5 eyes.

283
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm sorry, we don't fit.

284
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,600
You don't accept me?

285
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Wait.

286
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,000
Why don't I accept you?

287
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,200
You have a high level of near vision.

288
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
Your parents have a high level of near vision.

289
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,600
There is a high chance of

290
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,400
near vision in genetic studies.

291
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
No way.

292
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,600
Can I have a near vision?

293
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
You're lying to me.

294
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,800
What if my child

295
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,400
wants to be a pilot in the future?

296
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,600
I don't want him to stop at your side.

297
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,200
I'm sorry, Mr. Cao.

298
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,600
I'll talk to someone else later.

299
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
If you don't have anything to say,

300
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,400
please do it yourself.

301
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,600
You really think you're the one who chose me?

302
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,800
In the wedding market,

303
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,400
a high-level student

304
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
and a high-level student

305
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
are all a setback for women.

306
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
You want to find someone to be your father.

307
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,600
You have to see if people

308
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,000
like you or not.

309
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Help me clean up the trash.

310
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,800
What's wrong?

311
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,400
I'm sorry.

312
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,800
I think what you said is right.

313
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm a little secretive.

314
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,400
I really don't have any secrets.

315
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,600
I'm really not a promising person.

316
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
I shouldn't have

317
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,800
made you look for a good son-in-law.

318
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,600
I have something to do today.

319
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Let's leave it here.

320
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,400
I have a friend.

321
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,600
I have to go over there.

322
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,800
Wait a minute. There's this.

323
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,400
Thank you.

324
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,600
Come on.

325
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,400
Everyone, follow me.

326
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,600
Hurry up.

327
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,600
Hurry up.

328
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,800
Let's go.

329
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,200
Everyone, pay attention to your feet.

330
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,200
Don't run.

331
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,400
Hurry up.

332
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,800
You're wasting your energy.

333
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,400
Running is about endurance, not explosive power.

334
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,600
I'm just going to explode.

335
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,800
If I run and explode,

336
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
I'll be faster.

337
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
As long as you're happy,

338
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,600
don't scream when you're tired.

339
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,000
Let's go.

340
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,360
Master Qiu,

341
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,720
why are we here

342
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,240
in the old forest?

343
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,000
To see the treasure.

344
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,560
Treasure?

345
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,880
What treasure is there?

346
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,560
There are treasures everywhere.

347
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,640
Take a look.

348
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,080
Take a look at this tree.

349
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,680
What's wrong?

350
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,720
It's pine.

351
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,600
The pine is full of treasure.

352
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,800
I know.

353
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,240
Pine needles tea.

354
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,600
and make a drink with it, right?

355
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,600
And the acupuncture point,

356
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,000
also known as pine acupuncture point.

357
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,600
Don't underestimate it.

358
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,600
If it's a patient with a toothache,

359
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,000
it can be used to boil water and make a mouth.

360
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,000
It can also help to cure toothache.

361
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,000
Wait a minute.

362
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,600
Let me see.

363
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,000
What's this?

364
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,000
Look.

365
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,000
This is a acupuncture point.

366
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,600
Acupuncture point?

367
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,200
I see.

368
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,000
It's a pine acupuncture point, right?

369
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,000
You're so good at talking.

370
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,000
Guys,

371
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,000
come here.

372
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,400
Come here.

373
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,200
I found a baby.

374
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,600
A pine acupuncture point.

375
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,800
Come here.

376
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,000
Give it to me.

377
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,000
This is

378
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,160
a kind of fungus born on pine trees.

379
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,960
It grows on trees like this.

380
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,560
Or under the tree.

381
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,360
We call it

382
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,960
tree snake ginseng.

383
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,160
If it grows on this tree,

384
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,360
it has no poison.

385
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,760
Then the tree snake ginseng

386
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,160
has a high medicinal value.

387
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,360
For example,

388
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,160
the pine acupuncture point

389
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,560
can be used to protect the liver.

390
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,360
If you say so,

391
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,560
can we find ginseng everywhere?

392
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,520
Different owners

393
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,520
have different effects

394
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,520
on the tree snake ginseng.

395
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,320
Some

396
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,920
can't reach the level of medicine.

397
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,120
Some

398
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,920
are extremely rare.

399
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,320
For example,

400
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,320
the mulberry

401
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,120
is the tree snake ginseng

402
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,520
that grows on the mulberry tree.

403
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,520
Nature has provided us

404
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,320
with a lot of treasures

405
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,120
and ginseng.

406
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,320
So,

407
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,520
we can't say

408
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,920
we can find ginseng today.

409
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,280
Is there ginseng here?

410
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,280
Of course.

411
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,680
What are you doing?

412
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,480
I'm praying.

413
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,280
I want to say

414
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,880
I can meet ginseng later.

415
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,480
What do you want ginseng for?

416
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,080
The pig's skull

417
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,080
is always in my heart.

418
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,080
Do you want ginseng?

419
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,880
I want to say

420
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,080
if I meet it today,

421
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,680
I'll take it back to eat.

422
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,280
People can't be too greedy.

423
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,480
Ginseng is called the earth's essence.

424
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,880
For example,

425
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,880
there is a ginseng

426
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,240
that has been in the earth for years.

427
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,240
Other ginsengs won't have it.

428
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,240
It has absorbed all the earth's essence.

429
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,040
So, if we don't need it,

430
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,640
we can use it.

431
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,440
If we don't need it,

432
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,640
we must leave it to someone who can use it.

433
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,840
In this way, we can save the earth's essence.

434
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,040
Let's go.

435
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,040
Okay, let's go.

436
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:14,640
Let's go.

437
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,640
I'll drive.

438
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,240
Okay.

439
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:16,840
Come on.

440
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,840
Be careful of your feet.

441
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,840
Slow down.

442
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,640
Okay, come on.

443
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,040
Don't cry.

444
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,040
I have an idea.

445
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,040
Okay.

446
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,240
I also will try it.

447
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,240
Let's try it.

448
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:09,840
It's fine.

449
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,240
You can try it.

450
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,040
Okay.

451
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:14,840
I'll help you.

452
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,040
You go psychotic,

453
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,040
but you can try it with me.

454
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:18,540
Okay?

455
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,040
You go to work tomorrow.

456
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,280
It's fine.

457
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,360
Our teacher

458
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,840
will teach you again.

459
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,640
Alright.

460
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,440
So you can dude around.

461
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,640
Don't say that, Dad.

462
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,880
You will agree.

463
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,280
Will he agree?

464
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,160
What would I do with my girlfriend for too long?

465
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,080
I will check on him.

466
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,280
Don't do that.

467
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,340
I didn't expect that

468
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,660
a blind date like yours never succeeds.

469
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,040
How can it not succeed?

470
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,020
It's my dad who dropped in for work.

471
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,960
Not me.

472
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,140
Talking about you,

473
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,140
a lawyer,

474
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,680
you skipped the testamentary session

475
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,140
of the civil permission office,

476
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,160
and came here to have a blind date?

477
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,000
Why did you stop doing so in a rush?

478
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,880
I didn't rush on it.

479
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
You didn't even know about it in the first three years.

480
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,080
How come you suddenly figured it out?

481
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,080
Yes, I just figured it out.

482
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,080
So please don't interrupt me, okay? Thank you.

483
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,080
Let me see your conditions.

484
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,080
Education degree.

485
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,480
You're from the Ministry of Education, not the international community.

486
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,880
Intelligence and intelligence.

487
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,680
Could it be that you got a bad job?

488
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,280
It really is.

489
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,880
When you're tall, you don't have family disease.

490
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,680
You don't have good food, you don't have a healthy body.

491
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,880
You're healthy.

492
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,080
There are 500 best companies in the world that have interviews.

493
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,280
But you don't have the right.

494
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,080
You can be 10 years younger or younger.

495
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,680
If you're 10 years younger, is it enough to get a divorce?

496
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,680
I'm stuck at 22.

497
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,280
I'm quite in line with your conditions.

498
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,880
How about we both try it?

499
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,480
Think about it.

500
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
I'm the one who's worried about my parents and my grandson.

501
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,480
You're the one who wants a child.

502
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
Your 300,000 people's goal is the same.

503
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,280
I'm hungry.

504
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,880
I'll sacrifice myself.

505
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,080
You can't.

506
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,280
Why can't I?

507
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,880
I'm healthy and have no food.

508
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,880
I've done your Men's Sars-II.

509
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,080
It's definitely not enough.

510
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,280
You're not in good health.

511
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,480
First of all, your working condition is not enough.

512
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,080
You don't even have enough money.

513
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,880
If you want to meet my standards, you have to resign.

514
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,480
At least rest at home for more than three months.

515
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,680
Take care of yourself.

516
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,280
You can't do this.

517
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,880
But don't think about it here.

518
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
I'll go to the gold store and pick the gold.

519
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,480
I want to see your face.

520
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,680
My face is good.

521
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,480
Look.

522
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,480
What's up?

523
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,680
What do you want?

524
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,080
Aren't you going on a blind date with me?

525
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,680
I'll give you a chance.

526
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,280
What about your date?

527
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,080
He's not coming.

528
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,880
Let's go.

529
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,480
Let's go.

530
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,280
I'm going to see Chen Hui.

531
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,880
I can't go empty-handed.

532
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,280
Then what am I doing here?

533
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
You can be my model.

534
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,480
Aren't you a professional?

535
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,480
I'll pay for it.

536
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,080
Okay.

537
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,280
This shoe is so cute.

538
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,480
Look.

539
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,280
I remember that Chen Hui's child was just born a year ago, right?

540
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,080
Yeah.

541
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
Chen Hui's father is a very good person.

542
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,080
He's a very good person.

543
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,480
Chen Hui's child was just born a year ago, right?

544
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,280
Yeah.

545
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,480
Then you can't wear these.

546
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,480
Why?

547
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,880
These are for children over the age of one.

548
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,280
Children just turned one can't wear them.

549
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,080
You want to be a mother,

550
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,280
except for finding a father,

551
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,080
you have to learn knowledge.

552
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,280
You can't do it.

553
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,080
Wait a minute.

554
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,880
This one.

555
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,480
The child's vision is not yet developed.

556
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
It needs more listening and stimulation.

557
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,080
Even if the mother falls asleep at night,

558
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,680
the baby won't feel tired.

559
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,480
Let's go.

560
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,680
Let's go.

561
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,880
Let's go.

562
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,080
Let's go.

563
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,280
Let's go.

564
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,480
Let's go.

565
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,680
Let's go.

566
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,880
Let's go.

567
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,080
Let's go.

568
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,680
Let's go.

569
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,880
Let's go.

570
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,080
Let's go.

571
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,280
Let's go.

572
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,480
Let's go.

573
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,680
Let's go.

574
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,880
Let's go.

575
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,180
Let's go.

576
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,280
Hurry!

577
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,720
Somehow this person

578
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,480
can fix this fear,

579
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,080
they think that I'm still too 넣 in the round shape of time

580
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,980
that day to see the light.

581
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
This is the same.

582
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,000
Any additives

583
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,380
can help me remember.

584
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,480
And this one.

585
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,780
See, because I can release light with music,

586
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,580
I can listen carefully.

587
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,440
Recently, the popular type is the pillow that looks like a sleeping head.

588
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,520
It can make the baby's head look really good.

589
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,080
Grandma, the baby's bones are very soft.

590
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,360
The front three legs are straight. They don't have any crooked angles.

591
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,560
You can make the pillow look uncomfortable.

592
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,400
But...

593
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,360
Enough. Stop talking.

594
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,440
The so-called sleeping head shape is to use a towel

595
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,560
to press it down and fix it.

596
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,520
Like this. That's it.

597
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,880
Enough. Stop talking.

598
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,520
When it comes to picking gifts, you should let me be the professional doctor.

599
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,720
I... I didn't realize you were a professional doctor before.

600
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,400
But today, I feel a bit like that.

601
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,520
I also found out today that Lawyer Yang is so uncivilized.

602
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,080
That's all.

603
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,360
Let's go.

604
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,880
So expensive?

605
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,280
A gold-bending beast?

606
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,320
What do you think?

607
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,360
Since I let you experience it, you can quickly get rid of your blind date thoughts.

608
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,520
I want a gold-bending beast, too.

609
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,960
A dangerous woman.

610
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,360
Oh my god. It's so white.

611
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,560
It's smiling.

612
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,760
It's so pretty.

613
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,160
I also know that it's the old man who came to see it.

614
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,960
It likes you.

615
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,760
Little bad boy, do you know that you're a little naughty boy?

616
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,760
You were very anxious and you came out of your mother's womb.

617
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Mother worked very hard.

618
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,360
When you grow up, you must be filial to her. Do you know that?

619
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,160
What's my name?

620
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,960
We are Kong Nian Yuan.

621
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,760
Nian Hong.

622
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,160
You gave me my life and my child's life.

623
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,760
I want my child to remember and always remember you.

624
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,360
I also want you to be a godmother of my child.

625
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,760
I don't know if you're willing to do it.

626
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,160
You must agree.

627
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,560
You're so smart and so outstanding.

628
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,960
You can learn everything.

629
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,760
I can see that you can go from lawyer to Chinese medicine.

630
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,160
You're beyond the limit.

631
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,960
So I want my child to remember your blessing.

632
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,160
I'm not as good as you said.

633
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,760
I'm doing this to atone for my sins.

634
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,560
That's not your fault.

635
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,760
Professor Ren said that was an accident.

636
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,560
I couldn't accept Zhiyuan's sudden departure.

637
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,360
I thought that after I blamed you,

638
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,360
I would feel the pain in my heart.

639
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,760
Now that I have a child,

640
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,960
I can see this face.

641
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,760
I know that

642
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:55,760
God will not let people know.

643
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,560
He will take it away and give it to you.

644
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,760
I always remember that day.

645
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,760
You tied me and my son tightly with clothes.

646
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,560
But you were wearing a single dress and standing in the cold wind.

647
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,360
But I was still so cold to you.

648
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,560
You always held my heart.

649
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,960
Until you saved my son,

650
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,560
I thought you were my greatest grace.

651
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,760
Nian Hong, I'm godmother.

652
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,160
Do you know me?

653
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,360
Why is it Nian Hong?

654
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,560
Why is there a red character in a boy's name?

655
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,560
Because godmother is called Yang Xiao Hong.

656
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,160
Nian Hong.

657
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,160
Yang Xiao Hong

658
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,360
This road is not easy to walk.

659
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,960
It's much easier than before.

660
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,960
Qiu Shi, this treasure is so deep.

661
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,560
Ordinary people can't find it.

662
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,960
We don't usually come to this area.

663
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,160
It's easy to get lost.

664
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,760
Be careful, Professor Ren.

665
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,760
Why are we here today?

666
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,760
A few years ago, when Qiu Shi came,

667
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,160
he tied a red rope to a mountain ginseng to make a mark.

668
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,760
But no one could see it again.

669
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,360
But two days ago, I found that mountain ginseng again.

670
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,960
The red rope he tied on the spot was broken.

671
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,560
But I recognized it.

672
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,160
So I informed Qiu Shi.

673
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,560
When I first saw it,

674
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,360
it had five tails.

675
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,960
So many years have passed.

676
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,960
I wonder how it looks.

677
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,960
If we can see this treasure today,

678
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,960
we will be blessed.

679
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,360
Okay, let's go.

680
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,160
Be careful.

681
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,360
This treasure.

682
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,360
What's the prize for this treasure?

683
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,960
The shape of a human ginseng is very unusual.

684
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,560
Especially the mountain ginseng.

685
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,760
The ginseng leaves grow on the tip of the mountain.

686
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,760
Five small leaves are a slap.

687
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,160
It grows to five leaves.

688
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,560
It's probably 10 years old.

689
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,560
But the specific ginseng is determined by the body and the body.

690
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,360
Legend has it that there are fewer thousand-year ginsengs.

691
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,160
It's said that in the 1990s, at a Hong Kong auction,

692
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:02,760
half a thousand-year ginseng was sold for 200 million yuan.

693
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,160
If you say that,

694
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,760
will the person who found it be rich?

695
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
Wait!

696
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,560
Wait!

697
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
Wait!

698
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,760
Professor Ren and Qiu Chi should be in front.

699
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,760
Be careful.

700
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,960
Follow them.

701
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,760
Okay.

702
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,960
Be careful.

703
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,760
Follow them.

704
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,360
Professor Ren and Qiu Chi.

705
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,960
Look, we found it.

706
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,560
Where?

707
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,960
Is it him?

708
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,760
Let's go.

709
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,760
Be careful.

710
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,760
Let's go.

711
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,160
This is the thousand-year old ginseng.

712
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,960
A thousand-year old ginseng.

713
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,360
It's the ginseng I tied.

714
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,160
That's right.

715
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,160
It's the wild ginseng from the 2000s.

716
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,760
No.

717
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,360
This is an opportunity that I can't wait to see.

718
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,960
This is also the first time I've met it.

719
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,760
Qiu Chi, can we dig it this time?

720
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,360
Or should we do a ceremony?

721
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,960
If we don't dig it, what if it runs away?

722
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,160
Let me tell you first.

723
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,560
This ginseng is a plant that has grown for many years.

724
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,560
In winter, it will rot as winter cotton.

725
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,760
We call it fake death.

726
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,160
When it's not suitable for its growth,

727
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,360
it will rot all year round.

728
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,960
So,

729
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,560
it's a miracle that we can meet a wild ginseng

730
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,560
that has been around for almost a century.

731
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,960
No. We're waiting for you.

732
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
Hurry up and dig it.

733
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,160
We must first remember the ginseng.

734
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,560
It's a wild ginseng.

735
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,160
It's me.

736
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,360
Hurry up.

737
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,560
Qiu Chi!

738
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,560
Professor, we can't dig this ginseng.

739
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,760
Let's go back to the original path.

740
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
Back to the original path.

741
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,960
Okay, let's go.

742
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,960
No, no.

743
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,160
Why are we going back?

744
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,760
This has to happen, Master.

745
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,560
We really can't dig this ginseng.

746
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,360
No.

747
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,160
Let me tell you.

748
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,360
This ginseng should have a protective rope.

749
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,360
Let's practice it together.

750
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,160
See?

751
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,560
The sky is clouded.

752
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,760
It means we can't dig it.

753
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,760
Qiu Chi,

754
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,160
last time, it was like this.

755
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,960
We almost hit each other.

756
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,160
We almost kicked each other.

757
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,160
This time, we can give up.

758
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,760
Let's go.

759
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,360
We can't dig it.

760
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,160
No.

761
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,560
This is a trap.

762
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Right?

763
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,560
We can't dig it.

764
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:00,960
Let's go.

765
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,560
It's okay.

766
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
Let's go.

767
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,960
We must be careful with the big brother.

768
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,160
If it rains,

769
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,360
it will collapse.

770
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,160
Let's go.

771
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,360
Let's go.

772
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,360
It's worth 4 million.

773
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,360
Hurry up.

774
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,360
It's worth 4 million.

775
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,360
We can't let him go.

776
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:12,960
Let's go.

777
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
Come on.

778
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,360
Let's just leave this here.

779
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,760
It's worth more than life.

780
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,560
Let's go.

781
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,560
What's there to be afraid of?

782
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,360
Let's go.

783
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,360
Slow down.

784
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:25,960
Let's go.

785
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,960
Slow down.

786
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,560
Let's go.

787
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,960
Stop.

788
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,360
Stop.

789
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,760
Stop.

790
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,360
Stop.

791
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,760
Stop.

792
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,560
Quick.

793
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,760
Stop.

794
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,560
Get up.

795
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,160
Anymore.

796
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,960
Get up.

797
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,160
No.

798
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,760
Hurry up.

799
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,560
Stop.

800
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,960
Quickly.

801
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,760
Tom.

802
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
I am sorry.

803
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,560
I told you.

804
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,360
Run.

805
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,960
Quickly.

806
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,560
Yang Xiaohong

807
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,200
Yang Xiaohong

808
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,080
Ray Bing

809
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,640
You haven't fought yet, have you?

810
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,640
Why do you hide your Chinese name?

811
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,960
Look at your name

812
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,440
Simple and bright

813
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,800
I'm afraid that everyone

814
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,120
Are all the same reaction

815
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,640
Annoying

816
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,040
You will be a good mother

817
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,680
I don't know yet

818
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,840
Who is the child's father

819
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,960
No matter who the child's father is

820
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,640
You will be a good mother

821
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,840
It wasn't you

822
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,120
Mother

823
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,520
Do you recognize me

824
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,240
Me

825
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,040
Mum bonsai

826
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,920
Mengmeng

827
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,440
Come back

828
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,560
Come back

829
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,360
Do you know

830
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,200
We saw a few million people today

831
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,080
Let me see

832
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,480
Teacher Song said that this is to cool down the cold. You guys drink some.

833
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,280
This is also a bowl?

834
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,280
Yes, this is also a bowl.

835
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,680
Everyone drink some ginger soup.

836
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,080
Okay.

837
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,280
This is worth millions.

838
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,480
What is the taste of the soup?

839
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,280
So long?

840
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,280
Yes.

841
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,080
Drink some water.

842
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:43,880
Thank you.

843
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,880
Why are you here?

844
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,880
The medicine is falling.

845
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,680
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

846
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,480
I can't hold it anymore.

847
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,880
Now it's already at the point of death.

848
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,680
Teacher Song, do you still remember the last time I went abroad

849
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,480
to talk about the medicine?

850
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,680
I remember.

851
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,680
Didn't you talk about it?

852
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,280
Yes.

853
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,880
At first, I also thought that

854
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,080
if we bring this black technology to China,

855
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,280
then I would be the new medicine

856
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,680
with a skylight.

857
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,480
Who would have thought that they were so stingy?

858
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,480
It's not like that.

859
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,080
That was all a lie.

860
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,680
We were all fooled.

861
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,280
I should have received the first batch of medicine

862
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,480
after the New Year.

863
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,880
But I never got any news.

864
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,480
I called the customs.

865
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,080
They said that the information provided by the logistics

866
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,280
was all fake.

867
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,280
It was all virtual.

868
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,680
But a year ago, I already

869
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,680
sent the whole headquarter to him.

870
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,080
Director Wu, didn't you see the medicine

871
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
when you went there?

872
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,480
I saw it.

873
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,680
I saw it.

874
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,080
The one who provided me the medicine

875
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,680
was my good brother for many years.

876
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,280
He was the one who sent the medicine.

877
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,880
The profit of the first year

878
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,280
was 300% of the total.

879
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,080
He took me to the pharmaceutical factory,

880
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,480
and saw the production line.

881
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,080
There were also many other countries

882
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,280
who were also like me.

883
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,080
I believed him.

884
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,880
But I didn't know

885
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,480
that the profit of the first year

886
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,880
wasn't from selling medicine.

887
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,480
It was from the so-called group

888
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,280
that they were giving it to.

889
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,480
This is a lie from the Pang family.

890
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,480
The Pang family is the one who sent the medicine.

891
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,080
What?

892
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,480
No.

893
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,080
No, Director Liu,

894
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,480
did you owe them a lot?

895
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,280
Why should I owe them money?

896
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,280
I paid all of it to him.

897
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,280
No, you owe them money.

898
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,080
But what does it have to do with our Headquarter?

899
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,680
What's the use of asking us?

900
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,080
Boss Liu, you are trying to

901
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,680
close down Zhongyi Headquarters, right?

902
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,080
What?

903
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,880
I can't pay back the loan,

904
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,080
so I can only close down this place.

905
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,200
Professor, you really need to help me.

906
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,800
If I still have the land,

907
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,440
I will continue to be the center.

908
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,240
We can continue to discuss the project of President Wu.

909
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,960
You can continue to be the city's class.

910
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,040
If the land is sold,

911
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,840
it's hard to say whether we can be the center.

912
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,480
We are now a rope.

913
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,080
Professor,

914
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,200
think of a way.

915
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,560
You are such a big hole.

916
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,600
What can I do? I have no way.

917
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,640
You have a way. You definitely have a way.

918
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,800
I came all the way here just to come to your house.

919
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,560
When I was looking for you, I heard from the god that you came here to find a baby.

920
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,120
I heard from Toto that you found a hundred-year-old wild ginseng.

921
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,800
Right?

922
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,120
Why are you eavesdropping?

923
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,280
I'm sorry, Toto. I apologize.

924
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,760
The situation is urgent.

925
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,480
Professor, do you remember the last time we ate with the investors?

926
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,200
There was a big boss who really admires you.

927
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,000
Others were collecting some snow crops and good wine.

928
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,200
He collected ginseng.

929
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,280
If we give him this wild ginseng,

930
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,760
things will change.

931
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,240
We can't dig this wild ginseng.

932
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,840
Moreover, this wild ginseng is from the autumn.

933
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,120
It's not mine.

934
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,720
There are rules in the mountains.

935
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,160
Whoever sends the rope, this wild ginseng will be yours.

936
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,760
My big boss is burning his eyebrows.

937
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,200
Whoever digs it, it's not digging.

938
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,040
Digging this wild ginseng is also for the sake of the Chinese medicine industry.

939
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,440
Anyone can understand, right?

940
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,440
Director Liu, the road conditions in the mountains are very, very bad.

941
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,160
If we go back now, I don't think we can find it.

942
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,400
Plus, the weather in the mountains is very bad today.

943
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,680
It's too dangerous.

944
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,800
I'll pay to find the best ginseng farmer.

945
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,800
You can't force me to do this.

946
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,280
Life is fated. You must be fated.

947
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,480
Boss Liu, if you really want wild ginseng,

948
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,240
I have a friend.

949
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,640
He has a 40-year-old wild ginseng.

950
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,840
I can talk to him.

951
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,440
Boss, 40 years and 100 years are not enough.

952
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,880
Is that a big deal?

953
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,400
The weather is bad today.

954
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,520
You should stay in the mountains for a night.

955
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,920
Let's eat first.

956
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,520
Let's eat.

957
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,440
Let's eat.

958
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,920
Let's eat.

959
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,920
The contract clearly says that the road is in the shape of a fluorescent rope.

960
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,640
How can we say that it's hard to find it?

961
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,080
Fiery rope?

962
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,680
Yes.

963
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,520
What are you thinking about?

964
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,720
Still thinking about the park?

965
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,600
You said that if the park is really closed,

966
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,280
we can't move the work to the city.

967
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,640
I finally came back.

968
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,840
Do I have to deliver the express again?

969
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,080
If you dig into the wild ginseng,

970
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,200
all the difficulties will be solved.

971
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,520
Boss Liu, do you have a hobby of listening to the wall?

972
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,440
I know that I can find a way to dig the wild ginseng.

973
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,000
You don't have to.

974
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,440
What number do you have?

975
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,160
I don't have one.

976
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,600
I can't tell you even if I know.

977
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,920
Because Qiu told me that the wild ginseng is blessed by God.

978
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,040
You can't dig it, do you know?

979
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,640
What's so good about you, Tao Tao?

980
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,000
Are you stupid?

981
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,840
Once the work is done,

982
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,280
no one will dare to say anything.

983
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,440
There must be a place for the natural.

984
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
You're not sure.

985
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,040
Besides,

986
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,560
if we don't dig the wild ginseng,

987
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,520
if others find it,

988
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,560
they can also dig it.

989
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,720
Not everyone is like your master.

990
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,000
Not everyone is like your master.

991
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,920
You're loyal and honest.

992
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,480
Young people are different from before.

993
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,000
We dig the wild ginseng,

994
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,320
can we use it in the right place?

995
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,320
If you meet someone who is ungrateful

996
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,680
and doesn't trust you,

997
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,120
you shouldn't think about the result.

998
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,720
I don't know. I forgot.

999
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,680
Boss Liu,

1000
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,120
if we really dig the wild ginseng,

1001
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,960
can you guarantee that we can keep the Central Plain?

1002
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,120
Mr. Ruan.

1003
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,600
I can't guarantee that we can keep the Central Plain.

1004
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,960
But I can guarantee that

1005
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,400
we can give the wild ginseng

1006
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,440
to the person who can help me

1007
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,120
to pay the deposit.

1008
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,160
As long as you don't suppress the land of my Central Plain,

1009
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,440
I will give you 100% of the land.

1010
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,640
Okay.

1011
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,880
It's a deal.

1012
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,360
It's a deal.

1013
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,240
It's a deal.

1014
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,520
Who is going to make a deal with you?

1015
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,360
I promised you.

1016
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,760
It's a deal.

1017
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,160
Get out.

1018
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,360
We'll wait for you.

1019
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,240
Are you crazy?

1020
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,520
Are you crazy?

1021
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,760
Can you defy your dad?

1022
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,160
Don't you know the consequences?

1023
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,000
I'm different from my dad.

1024
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,440
I listen to the will of the gods and respect the people.

1025
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,440
You

1026
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,640
and many of my classmates

1027
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,680
can't have a teacher-student class.

1028
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,640
You must listen to my dad.

1029
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,560
I can refuse.

1030
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,000
No.

1031
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,160
No.

1032
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,280
I tell you.

1033
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,560
This is called cheating.

1034
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,400
Even if we find the wild ginseng,

1035
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,840
even if we dig it back,

1036
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,720
even if the teacher-student class

1037
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,880
is kept,

1038
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,440
I tell you.

1039
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,520
You know that

1040
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,680
you'll be kicked out of the school.

1041
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,320
Not us.

1042
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,240
It's me.

1043
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,400
I'm a grandpa, not a teacher-student class.

1044
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,360
Besides,

1045
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,560
even if my dad wants to kick me out,

1046
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,880
my mom won't agree,

1047
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,320
right?

1048
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,600
I'll go.

1049
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,720
I'll go.

1050
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,880
Don't go.

1051
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,280
If you dare, you'll kick me out.

1052
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,440
Can you dig ginseng?

1053
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,720
There are many ways to dig ginseng.

1054
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,840
You need to dig ginseng with the ground.

1055
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,240
You can't use iron.

1056
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,640
You can't cut the ginseng.

1057
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,280
You don't understand.

1058
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,360
I must take you to the school.
