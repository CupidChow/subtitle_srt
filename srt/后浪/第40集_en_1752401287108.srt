The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The standard of life

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
is to be happy and happy.

5
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
When you receive a good news,

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
there must be a sad world waiting for you.

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So many sad things.

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's a good news to have someone in your heart.

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You don't suspect that

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Toto is my daughter.

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But Toto may be

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
the daughter-in-law of our family.

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Look at your expression.

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's not a bad thing.

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Your son has a wife.

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's a good news.

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's a good news.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This...

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Is this a good news?

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
How do you know?

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Can't you just have one more sister?

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't want a sister.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You took my future away.

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I have nothing left.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
As a mother,

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
you don't even know your son?

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
As a wife, I don't even know my husband.

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Alright.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Just wait for blessings.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
In this life,

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
nothing is yours in the end.

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Your son is not yours.

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Your son is his wife.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
should leave it to me.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Don't worry about them anymore.

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Why are you so happy?

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You should be happy.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I think

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the heir of our family

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
may be Toto in the future.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Your son

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
can find someone like Toto

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and he can fix it well.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Toto can hide things.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's right.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Alright.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't care.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I can't do anything.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You're so happy.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What else?

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What else?

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Be good to yourself.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let the children

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
do their own thing.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Toto

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
is a good kid.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Only our family

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
can take him.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You're my wife.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I can't take him,

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
but I can let him go.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Nonsense.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You're not going to tell Toto?

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Just watch these two children

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
being tortured?

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You should tell him

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
that you can do good things.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You can get gifts.

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You can get along with each other.

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Thank you, husband.

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You're so wise.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Toto.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

100

I'm sorry.

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let's go.

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Let's go.

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Go to the shabu shabu for dinner.

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Come on.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Let's go.

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000

Let's go.

Let's go.

I'm sorry.

198
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm sorry.

202
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm sorry.

207
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm sorry.

209
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm sorry.

210
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm sorry.

211
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm sorry.

213
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm sorry.

215
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm sorry.

217
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm sorry.

221
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm sorry.

222
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm sorry.

224
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm sorry.

225
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm sorry.

229
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm sorry.

230
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm so sorry.

231
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Sorry, I was wrong again.

232
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Sorry, I was wrong again.

233
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm sorry.

234
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Sorry.

235
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm so sorry.

236
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I was wrong again.

237
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Here, take two.

238
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Take two.

239
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Salut.

240
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Here, here, look.

241
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What's wrong with you?

242
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,360
It's okay, dear.

243
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,840
Wu, you must do your best.

244
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,600
I'll be waiting for you.

245
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,660
The golden

246
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,760
The golden

247
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,760
The golden

248
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,760
The golden

249
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,760
The golden

250
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,760
The golden

251
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
The golden

252
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
The golden

253
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,760
The golden

254
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,760
The golden

255
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,760
The golden

256
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
The golden

257
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
The golden

258
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,240
The golden

259
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
The golden

260
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,240
The golden

261
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,800
One Pie

262
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Seven year-old

263
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,920
Dream

264
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,240
I'll send you exactly one pie.

265
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,520
It's home.

266
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,060
It's home.

267
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,880
Here, help me grab the knife.

268
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,120
Great!

269
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,960
Great!

270
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,360
Great!

271
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,960
I got a pulse attack.

272
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,760
That's it.

273
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,920
You're in charge of this.

274
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,120
Chun Zhang!

275
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,480
What are you doing?

276
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,440
What are you doing?

277
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,520
I'm so happy!

278
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,120
Move, Tao Tao!

279
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,880
Move!

280
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,720
I'm so happy!

281
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
Stop it!

282
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,320
I'm so happy!

283
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,040
I'm so happy!

284
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,480
I'm so happy!

285
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,160
Look!

286
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,440
I'm so happy!

287
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,520
I'm so happy!

288
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,400
A girl singing across the universe

289
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,800
So amazing!

290
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,520
Join the party now!

291
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,880
These girls are great!

292
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,640
Come here!

293
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
Xiaohong.

294
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
Xiaohong.

295
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,640
My dear Hong.

296
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,640
I, Peng Shiyuan,

297
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,640
am a good graduate of the back-up camp.

298
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,640
Can you consider

299
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,640
being my child's mother?

300
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Stop. Stop. Stop.

301
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
Stop. Stop. Stop.

302
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
This is a very serious matter.

303
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Marrying you is the most serious thing

304
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,640
in my life.

305
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,640
You are the lover I chose to be.

306
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
We fought together.

307
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
I can't accept it.

308
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
I don't have you in my life.

309
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,640
I can't imagine

310
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,640
I will be the mother of my child.

311
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
Not you.

312
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
I thought that

313
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,640
in order to have a child in the future,

314
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,640
I could have a child together.

315
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,640
I feel very warm.

316
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
So,

317
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,640
Ms. Yang Xiaohong,

318
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,640
can you consider

319
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
marrying me?

320
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,640
Marry him. Marry him. Marry him.

321
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,640
Marry him. Marry him. Marry him.

322
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,640
Marry him. Marry him. Marry him.

323
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,640
I thought about it very seriously.

324
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,640
That's why I stopped.

325
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
I'm not saying I won't marry you.

326
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
But

327
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,640
we have to sign a contract before marriage.

328
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
For example,

329
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
should we get the marriage certificate first

330
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
or get the child first?

331
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
We have to make it clear.

332
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,640
If I can't have a child,

333
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
will you leave me?

334
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
Yes. It's fair.

335
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
If I can't have a child,

336
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
you can leave me.

337
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
I want you.

338
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
It's a surprise if I have a child.

339
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
I can't. I need a child.

340
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,640
So, we have to make it clear.

341
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,640
If the man can't have a child,

342
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,640
can I go to the shop

343
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,640
and choose a gold coin?

344
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,640
Will you be the father of the child?

345
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
Of course. It's fair.

346
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,640
If the woman can't have a child,

347
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,640
you can also choose a ball

348
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
in the basket.

349
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
Do you agree?

350
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
I agree. I'm willing.

351
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
I'm sure I'm willing.

352
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,640
If we both can't have a child,

353
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,640
will you adopt one?

354
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
We have to make it clear

355
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,640
in the contract.

356
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
Hong,

357
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
how many contracts do you have?

358
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
Tell me.

359
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
I'll go back

360
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,640
and write it down

361
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
and make it clear with you.

362
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,640
Do you still want this ring?

363
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Ring?

364
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,640
Of course I want this ring.

365
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
Right?

366
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,640
Why do you make me laugh for the first time?

367
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,640
Wait a minute.

368
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,640
What if

369
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,640
our conditions are not consistent?

370
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
Then I won't return this ring.

371
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
I'll write it down in advance.

372
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
I heard you.

373
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,640
I heard you.

374
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,640
It's pretty.

375
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
It's pretty.

376
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,640
Look.

377
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
You can't return it.

378
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,640
It's pretty.

379
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,640
Liu Zifeng,

380
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,640
are you sick?

381
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,640
What's wrong with you?

382
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,640
Liu Zifeng,

383
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,640
are you sick?

384
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
I'm not sick.

385
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,640
I'm not sick.

386
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,640
My head.

387
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,640
Who wants to give you a head?

388
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,640
No.

389
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,640
I came to Dongzhu Lake.

390
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,640
Now,

391
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,640
I have a chance.

392
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,640
You say.

393
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,640
Look at you.

394
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,640
You are a legitimate successor.

395
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,640
I,

396
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,640
a little successful fan.

397
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,640
How big are we?

398
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
Who is so big?

399
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
Liu Zihong,

400
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,640
I don't want to mess with you.

401
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,640
We work together.

402
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,640
This future

403
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,640
and the future

404
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640
must be

405
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
unbelievable.

406
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,640
You are really sick.

407
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
No.

408
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
I, Liu Zihong,

409
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
am twenty years old this year.

410
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
I'm eighteen years old.

411
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,640
I'm a junior in the national street dance team.

412
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,640
You are my first love.

413
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,640
I will be nice to you.

414
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Her family lost

415
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
at her time.

416
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,640
Wait.

417
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,640
Get up.

418
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,640
Get up.

419
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
Liu Zifeng,

420
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,640
you dare to

421
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,640
step on my son's feet in front of me.

422
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,640
You want to be beaten, right?

423
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,640
Really?

424
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,640
You are really a liar.

425
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,640
No.

426
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
You.

427
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
You.

428
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
No, they.

429
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,640
Aren't you a family?

430
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,640
Of course we are a family.

431
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,640
Hao is my daughter-in-law.

432
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,640
That's our daughter.

433
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,640
Professor Ren is right.

434
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
Don't you change your mind?

435
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,640
When did you know?

436
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
Actually, that brat

437
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
came to me and told me

438
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,640
that your conscience didn't hurt.

439
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,640
At that time.

440
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,640
I'll beat you.

441
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
I'll beat you.

442
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
I can't accept it.

443
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,640
What are you doing?

444
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,640
Kiss.

445
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,640
Kiss.

446
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,640
Kiss.

447
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,640
Kiss.

448
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,640
Madam, madam, good news

449
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,040
Put on your mask

450
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,640
Good news

451
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,840
I tell you

452
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,040
Stop it

453
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,440
I have said

454
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,240
Toto must be my child

455
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,840
High

456
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,440
Really high

457
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,040
Our family is so happy to talk

458
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,040
Really good

459
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,840
You remember

460
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,840
The first time we were here

461
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,840
The thing

462
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,840
Then I don't remember

463
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,040
Good news

464
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,840
Who can be with me

465
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,840
I am here

466
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,840
I am here

467
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,840
I am here

468
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,840
I am here

469
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,840
I am here

470
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,840
I am here

471
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840
I am here

472
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,040
My wind

473
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,040
Who is not in the wind

474
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,640
Who can be with the master

475
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,040
Good

476
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,040
Very good

477
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,840
I guess you did it that time

478
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,240
I was drunk on purpose

479
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,840
You just want to drive me away, right?

480
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,040
I grew up so big

481
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,640
Really never seen

482
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,440
So so

483
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,440
Shameless

484
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,040
No

485
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,040
It's innocent

486
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,640
I didn't hate you at that time

487
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,040
I am jealous of you

488
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,040
Jealous that you can live so freely

489
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,240
But

490
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,240
Fortunately, I didn't miss you

491
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,740
Then that's good

492
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Actually, we were created

493
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,040
Miracle, you know

494
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,240
What magic

495
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,040
You haven't heard person say

496
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,040
Friendship is loyal brother and sister

497
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,640
We broke this barrier

498
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,720
I won't give up.

499
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,320
What's this?

500
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,760
Open it.

501
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,800
Where did you get it?

502
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,120
The information on the Internet

503
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,000
is out there.

504
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,000
We ingrated with Mengmeng

505
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,160
paid out to her father.

506
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,160
That money

507
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,080
was sent specifically

508
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,800
by me

509
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,360
with God's will.

510
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,880
Is it related to

511
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:01,600
the Garou

512
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,680
's case?

513
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:03,920
No.

514
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,040
Are you not afraid?

515
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
I gave it to you.

516
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,720
But don't wait for it.

517
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,240
Don't worry.

518
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,040
You and him won't be hurt.

519
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,720
I'm sorry.

520
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,520
I'm sorry.

521
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,320
I'm sorry.

522
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,120
I'm sorry.

523
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,120
I'm sorry.

524
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
I'm sorry.

525
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
I'm sorry.

526
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
I'm sorry.

527
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,120
I'm sorry.

528
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,120
I'm sorry.

529
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,120
I'm sorry.

530
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
I'm sorry.

531
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
I'm sorry.

532
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
I'm sorry.

533
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
I'm sorry.

534
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,120
I'm sorry.

535
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,120
I'm sorry.

536
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
I'm sorry.

537
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
I'm sorry.

538
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
I'm sorry.

539
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
I'm sorry.

540
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,120
I'm sorry.

541
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
I'm sorry.

542
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,120
I'm sorry.

543
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,120
I'm sorry.

544
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
I'm sorry.

545
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
I'm sorry.

546
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,120
I'm sorry.

547
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,120
I'm sorry.

548
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,520
I want to believe that

549
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
love comes in hard times.

550
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,920
I hold hope

551
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,720
and get into the light.

552
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,120
I hope that

553
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,920
all the hope will be gone.

554
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,720
Your eyes

555
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,520
are shining

556
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,320
with power.

557
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
I'll take the night away

558
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,320
and light up the night.

559
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
I'll take the night away

560
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,320
and light up the night.

561
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,320
My warm hands will open

562
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,320
and the endless light will be silent.

563
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,920
I hope that

564
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,120
time will come

565
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,120
to pursue the faith in my heart.

566
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,120
Even if

567
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,120
there are difficulties,

568
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,120
I want to believe that

569
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,120
love comes in hard times.

570
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
I hold hope

571
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
and get into the light.

572
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,320
I hope that

573
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
all the hope will be gone.

574
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,320
Your eyes

575
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,320
are shining

576
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,320
with power.

577
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
I'll take the night away

578
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,320
and light up the night.

579
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
I'll take the night away

580
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
and light up the night.

581
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,520
My warm hands will open

582
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,520
and the endless light will be silent.

583
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,520
I hope that

584
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,520
time will come

585
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,520
to pursue the faith in my heart.

586
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
Even if

587
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,520
there are difficulties,

588
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,720
I want to believe that

589
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
love comes in hard times.

590
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,720
I want to believe that

591
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,720
love comes in hard times.

592
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
I want to believe that

593
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,720
love comes in hard times.

594
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
I want to believe that

595
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,720
love comes in hard times.

596
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,720
I want to believe that

597
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,720
love comes in hard times.

598
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
I want to believe that

599
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,720
love comes in hard times.

600
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
I want to believe that

601
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,720
love comes in hard times.

602
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
I want to believe that

603
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,720
love comes in hard times.

604
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,720
I want to believe that

605
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,720
love comes in hard times.

606
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
I want to believe that

607
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,720
love comes in hard times.

608
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
I want to believe that

609
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,720
love comes in hard times.

610
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,720
I want to believe that

611
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
love comes in hard times.

612
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,720
I want to believe that

613
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,920
love comes in hard times.

614
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,920
I want to believe

615
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,920
that love comes in hard times.

616
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,520
I want to believe

617
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
that love comes.

618
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,920
One two three

619
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,420
Beat the light

620
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,720
One two

621
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,920
Three four

622
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,720
Hey little baby

623
00:29:50,720 --> 00:30:15,780
There areons all spirited up, but not all of them got to the ball for the last time.

624
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,780
Who's going to play?

625
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,140
Is it fun?

626
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,500
It was surprised for a moment,

627
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,500
everyone had shocked.

628
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,860
Everyone started to mechanical ASMR.

629
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,580
Master,

630
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,140
I feel勢利不足.

631
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,620
I'm sorry.

632
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,260
Tao Tao.

633
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,220
You've completed the test of city-building

634
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,700
and the test of assistant.

635
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,340
Next,

636
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,940
I hope you can complete

637
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,220
the test of professionalism.

638
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:33,900
Don't worry.

639
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,340
I'll do better than the mission.

640
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,940
Not only the mission,

641
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,660
but also the order from the country.

642
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:43,900
Understand?

643
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,380
In the future,

644
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,060
the land

645
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,060
will be yours.

646
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:52,900
Think about it.

647
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,380
Today is the first night ceremony

648
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,500
of the city-building team.

649
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,300
It's also the ceremony of the Qingming Festival.

650
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,820
So the host

651
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,140
must be you.

652
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,380
I'm afraid of embarrassing people.

653
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,220
I'm afraid of embarrassing you.

654
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,540
How about this?

655
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,140
Let Tianzhen do it.

656
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,900
He's been a big-headed since he was a kid.

657
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,620
He's more familiar than me.

658
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,420
Is that okay?

659
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:22,900
No.

660
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,980
Aren't you

661
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,660
the one who's not afraid of the sky or the ground?

662
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,260
You dare to fight against the sky and the ground.

663
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,620
Unlike you,

664
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,140
you're not Sun Tao Tao.

665
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,740
I didn't

666
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,100
study or know much before.

667
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,740
Stop talking about this.

668
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,020
Are you afraid of being heard?

669
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,340
Tell me first.

670
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,460
Tell me first.

671
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,140
What books have you read?

672
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,220
Recently, you asked me to read

673
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,500
the books of the history of the country,

674
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,340
Confucius, Shi Jia and Mengzi.

675
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,180
I've read them all.

676
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,100
I'm impressed.

677
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,620
Tell me.

678
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,860
When Confucius died in Yanhui,

679
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,580
he was sad and depressed.

680
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,900
Because he thought his lineage was broken.

681
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,060
But he didn't see Mengzi.

682
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,540
But Mengzi

683
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,260
wanted to pass on his thoughts.

684
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,060
So I was thinking,

685
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,180
is blood

686
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,860
really that important

687
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,980
to the Chinese?

688
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,540
But now I understand.

689
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,100
Because I saw you.

690
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,180
Because I saw you.

691
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,460
I don't think it's important.

692
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,540
I'm not your biological child.

693
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,220
But the thought you put into me

694
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,500
is far more than your own child.

695
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,060
So for me,

696
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,100
blood is not important.

697
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,660
It doesn't matter

698
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,380
who your biological parents are.

699
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,060
Parents are still important.

700
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,460
You think Chinese culture

701
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,420
is so beautiful.

702
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,900
That's why it's so beautiful.

703
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,060
There are people after it.

704
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,740
In fact,

705
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,260
it's not blood.

706
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:23,860
It's culture.

707
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,060
It's not learning.

708
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,220
It's the way.

709
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,860
In fact, the real inheritance should be

710
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:34,300
that the thought is a spiritual continuation.

711
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,380
You learn it slowly.

712
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:38,820
OK.

713
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,060
It seems you didn't lose much.

714
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,700
Thank you, master.

715
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,500
Actually, I want to thank you.

716
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,980
My master

717
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,660
arranged a work

718
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,020
for me to bring out

719
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,020
a monkey.

720
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,660
You don't know, right?

721
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,380
So you see, at this age,

722
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,420
I have to re-examine

723
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,780
the benevolent and loving people.

724
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,860
I promised my master

725
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,660
to bring you out.

726
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,580
So I'm very grateful to you

727
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,660
for giving me this opportunity

728
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,220
to re-invite me to the Tao of Discipline.

729
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,780
I used to be a branch.

730
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,260
Now I can finally

731
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,380
be a branch and a monkey.

732
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,580
holes

733
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,460
It's hard to bring me out, right?

734
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,420
It's not hard.

735
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,220
It's not hard at all!

736
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,860
Give me some energy.

737
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,020
No, I don't need it.

738
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,300
I'm sorry.

739
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,380
By the way, Master,

740
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,180
I'm a heir.

741
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,260
My name is Sun Tou Tou.

742
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,100
Isn't it serious?

743
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:40,980
How?

744
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,940
I want to ask you

745
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,260
to give me a big name.

746
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,380
I've thought about it for a long time.

747
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,500
It's to get me

748
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,940
a name that makes people happy.

749
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,500
Read books,

750
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,740
have culture.

751
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,380
Such a name.

752
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,540
Let me think about it.

753
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,940
Let me think about it.

754
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,660
Sun,

755
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,660
have culture.

756
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,420
I think in Chinese literature,

757
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,740
the most successful person

758
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,740
should be Sun Wukong.

759
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,580
Look, he has no parents.

760
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,180
He was born out of stone.

761
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,580
But eventually,

762
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,220
he went through a lot of hardship

763
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,380
and slowly became a criminal.

764
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,180
A person

765
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,780
needs to be of the highest rank.

766
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,940
Even if he's a tough man,

767
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,620
he won't be confused.

768
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,660
So you should

769
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:40,140
be only one person.

770
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,580
You see,

771
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:43,860
don't just act on your own course.

772
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,860
Not at all.

773
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,620
anto it.

774
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:54,700
Well,

775
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,220
Glorious Blossom is not from refining flowers

776
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,660

I can't open it.

Yes only uses one.

861
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,860

Get back together.

00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,860
Go, go, go.

867
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,860
It turns on towards the side.

868
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,860
Like this.

869
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,860
Now, I need its target position.

Shock.

Now!

877
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,860

00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,860
Turn.

879
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,280

00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:03,500
The city is in a trance

887
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:09,500
Making the story seem very interesting

888
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:14,500
The us in the sunset

889
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,500
This youth

890
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:26,500
Is slowly becoming complete

891
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:31,500
Missing you is happening

892
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,500
There are always people

893
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,500
Who are worth your crossing the mountains and rivers

894
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,500
We will run towards the stars and the years together

895
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,500
I am sure

896
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,500
You are that person

897

I admit

898
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,500
It's not that pure heart is so heavy

899
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,500
I am already trapped in your eyes

900
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,500
The feelings are deep

901
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,500
The fate that we just had

902
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,500
Is waiting for us

903

00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:21,500
We will run towards the stars and the years together

906
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,500
I am sure

907
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,500
You are that person
