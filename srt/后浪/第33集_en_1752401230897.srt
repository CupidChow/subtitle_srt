00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,200
My mother-in-law is out there now.

4
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,000
She took the ginger-tongue medicine and her blood pressure is still over 200.

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Say, do you have the courage to go out and tell her

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,600
that she doesn't have it anymore? That's...

7
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,000
That's two lives.

8
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,800
There're still poor people in the countryside.

9
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,280
It's better to go back.

10
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,600
However, I heard from friends and family members that

11
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't have to leave here if I can't make my distanced business a success.

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,600
What does that mean?

13
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,440
Don't worry.

14
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
If you can't do well,

15
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,200
I won't blame you.

16
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,920
How likely am I to wake up?

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,800
Let's put it this way.

18
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,520
Even if you wake up,

19
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,880
you're different from before.

20
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,760
Xingyi.

21
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,560
Xingyi.

22
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
What's going on?

23
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,160
Our company has a project.

24
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,360
I went to sign a contract with Mr. Wu.

25
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,960
But when I entered,

26
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,000
I found him on the ground.

27
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,720
How long has he been on the ground?

28
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,040
I don't know.

29
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,240
I found him on the ground

30
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,360
and rushed to call 120.

31
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,400
But I don't know.

32
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,280
What?

33
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,580
I got bought,

34
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,380
whatrons

35
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,000
take?

36
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,800
What Claus is that?

37
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,320
Who is it?

38
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,120
Who?

39
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:45,760
Who is it?

40
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,920
I don't know.

41
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,760
Yeah, I know.

42
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,600
Who's that?

43
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,360
I know it.

44
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,200
In that case,

45
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,680
I...

46
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,160
I'll ask him.

47
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,200
Sure.

48
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,520
Please come with us.

49
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:58,760
Come.

50
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,680
Of course not.

51
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,160
The lawyer

52
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,360
didn't call the insurance company

53
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,560
because of you.

54
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,960
He has been here for three days.

55
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,360
The lawyer is his friend.

56
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,560
He can always borrow money.

57
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,560
But he

58
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,960
doesn't have any money.

59
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,760
Enough.

60
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,960
What's the use of raising a son?

61
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,760
You're so talkative.

62
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
Don't talk nonsense.

63
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,360
You don't understand. He has money.

64
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,360
He lives in a big city

65
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,960
in a single house.

66
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,360
He doesn't give us money.

67
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,560
He has been here and there for days.

68
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,960
He didn't get any money back.

69
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,760
Enough.

70
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,960
Stop talking.

71
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,560
Can you blame your son for what happened?

72
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,360
Who do you think I can rely on?

73
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Who else can I rely on?

74
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,960
Stop talking.

75
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,960
He's so angry.

76
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,760
300,000 yuan.

77
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,760
Look.

78
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
I said he has money.

79
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,160
You don't believe me?

80
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,960
Qian.

81
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:52,960
You...

82
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,160
Where did you get so much money?

83
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,960
I borrowed it.

84
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,760
You borrowed it?

85
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,560
But

86
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
how can you pay back

87
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
so much money?

88
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,960
My company will send a large sum of money

89
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,360
to pay back at the end of the year.

90
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
What company?

91
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,360
Aren't you working in a medical school?

92
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
You still care about this?

93
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,560
This money can save our family.

94
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,160
No.

95
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,160
You're so anxious.

96
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,760
You...

97
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,360
Look at this kid.

98
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,160
He's still hiding his business even though he has money.

99
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,960
You only know money.

100
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Give me the card.

101
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,360
Give it to me.

102
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,160
We're so poor.

103
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,760
You can't break our son.

104
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,560
Give me the card.

105
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,960
You don't know our family is so big.

106
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Who can we rely on?

107
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,560
What?

108
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,360
Let's go back to the village head.

109
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,560
We rent the land.

110
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,360
We'll take the fish pond out.

111
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,360
Are you crazy?

112
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,960
I dug the fish pond

113
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,160
with my own hands.

114
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,160
The fish pond

115
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,360
caused my illness.

116
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,160
The fish pond is my life.

117
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,360
We can't take advantage of it.

118
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,160
Give me the card.

119
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,560
Don't move.

120
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,560
I have to buy a house

121
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,360
and get a wife with it.

122
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,960
Let go.

123
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,560
Give it to me.

124
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,560
Qian.

125
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,560
Qian.

126
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,160
Let go.

127
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,960
Qian,

128
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
are you ok?

129
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,760
Not possible.

130
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,760
Aren't you all making trouble?

131
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,960
The surgery was successful but why can't he wake up?

132
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,160
I told you the possible risk before the surgery.

133
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,760
Now, the situation is much better.

134
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,560
Okay, okay. I know it already.

135
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,760
But now, your hospital doctor already said it can't be done.

136
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,360
Why can't you let me try other methods?

137
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,160
How can it not work?

138
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,800
The surgery has just finished.

139
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,600
It's a critical time.

140
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,800
You should wait for a while.

141
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,720
Don't panic.

142
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,640
It's not the time

143
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,000
to be in a panic.

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,040
Stop it.

145
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,280
Calm down.

146
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,560
It's not a panic.

147
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,400
Yes.

148
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,000
We just want to go in

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,720
and see if there are other ways.

150
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,320
I'll take care of it.

151
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,760
Okay?

152
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,760
You're a doctor.

153
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,240
I'm a doctor, too.

154
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,400
Let me in.

155
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,840
Let you in.

156
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,040
You're so beautiful.

157
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,400
You must give her acupuncture after you go in.

158
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,040
Her blood pressure is unstable now.

159
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,440
You should let her rest for a while.

160
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,600
Don't stimulate her for the time being.

161
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,160
I'm afraid you can't do it well.

162
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,880
It's troublesome.

163
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,160
What if your son's bleeding?

164
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,920
Isn't she in trouble now?

165
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,040
Chen Xi.

166
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,520
I've done what I can.

167
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,640
Leave it to you.

168
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,760
You decide.

169
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,320
Yes.

170
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,600
Be rational.

171
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,000
I admit that

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,840
you're a good doctor.

173
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,560
But now,

174
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,760
no matter you're a doctor or not,

175
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,760
it won't work.

176
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,520
You go and have a look.

177
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,480
Go.

178
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,400
Go back.

179
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,240
Wang Lin.

180
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,040
Today is ICU.

181
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,440
You must pay for it.

182
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,480
You must pay for it.

183
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,560
Now you're dead.

184
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,800
You must go to the hospital.

185
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,920
Li.

186
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,880
The knife is already open.

187
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,720
It's good.

188
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,160
It's not good.

189
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,240
I admit it.

190
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,160
You can't.

191
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,280
Your husband is the president of the University of TCM.

192
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,440
He can't just live.

193
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,040
He must recover well

194
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,320
and teach everyone.

195
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,240
Yes.

196
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
That's what I mean.

197
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,520
You're right.

198
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,640
I'm not a good doctor.

199
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
I'm a good doctor.

200
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
I'm a good doctor.

201
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,640
I'm a good doctor.

202
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
I'm a good doctor.

203
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,080
Don't worry.

204
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,560
It's a life-and-death situation.

205
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,720
He must see it for himself.

206
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,720
We don't want

207
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,440
Shan Dao to lie on the bed

208
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,720
for the rest of his life.

209
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,320
Yes.

210
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,600
You're really a good doctor.

211
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,760
You're a good student.

212
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,480
You're a good teacher.

213
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,640
No matter what,

214
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,880
I must let my master

215
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,800
go in and have a look today.

216
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,280
Kid.

217
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,080
It's not that I don't believe in TCM.

218
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,200
He just started the journey.

219
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,640
His blood vessels are weak.

220
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,720
You can wait until he's out of danger

221
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,360
before you can do it.

222
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:35,840
No.

223
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,120
I don't believe in TCM.

224
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,600
I'm afraid he'll break his second heart.

225
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,120
You must be careful.

226
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,960
The sooner you use the needle,

227
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,840
the faster the incontinence will recover.

228
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,000
The risk is also great.

229
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,160
That's his life.

230
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,600
I agree.

231
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,720
Sheng Xin.

232
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,600
Mom.

233
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Shan Dao is your husband.

234
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,240
He's also my son.

235
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,200
I know you care about me.

236
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,440
So no matter what,

237
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,640
you must use the needle.

238
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,560
But now,

239
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,720
I have to think for you.

240
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,200
I can't let you

241
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,640
clean up this mess for the rest of your life.

242
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,520
No, mom.

243
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,960
I'm here.

244
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,680
Leave it to him.

245
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,160
Mom.

246
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,760
Mom.

247
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,720
Don't worry.

248
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,320
I'll leave it to you.

249
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,800
I'll take the responsibility.

250
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,760
Thank you.

251
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm going.

252
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,720
Thank you.

253
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,320
Old man.

254
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:36,840
Old man.

255
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
Are you sure?

256
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,200
Yes.

257
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
I'm sure.

258
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,160
Kid.

259
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,600
You think the same as me.

260
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,280
Yes.

261
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,160
First, you have to believe.

262
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,560
Then you'll see.

263
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,720
Wait.

264
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,360
Change your clothes.

265
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,040
I know where it is.

266
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,360
Mr. Shen.

267
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,200
Let me go.

268
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,720
Don't go in.

269
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,320
The room is too small.

270
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,400
Wait outside.

271
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,440
But Mr. Wu is my mentor.

272
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,080
If I don't go in,

273
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,280
I'll be in a hurry.

274
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,560
You're too kind.

275
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,480
You should stay outside

276
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,760
with your wife.

277
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,320
Mr. Shen.

278
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,600
Let Toto stay outside.

279
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,720
I'll follow you.

280
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,560
After I go in,

281
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,280
I won't talk

282
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,840
and I won't be rude.

283
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,360
Okay?

284
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,360
You can't.

285
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Why can't I?

286
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,080
Old man.

287
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,480
Old man.

288
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,640
Li Quan is a good student.

289
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,920
He should go in.

290
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,880
Don't take away

291
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,960
his filial piety.

292
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,880
Old man.

293
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,160
Let him in.

294
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,520
I heard about him.

295
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,320
Old Wu mentioned him in front of me.

296
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,160
He's quite considerate

297
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,120
to his student.

298
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,080
Thank you, director.

299
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,680
Let's go.

300
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,120
Toto, look at the spot I'm going to blow.

301
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,680
I'll blow it next time.

302
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,320
Toto.

303
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,160
Don't blow it.

304
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,160
The blood pressure will go up.

305
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,360
It's too dangerous.

306
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,760
What's going on?

307
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,600
Where's Xiao Zhao?

308
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,520
Why hasn't she come?

309
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,280
She took a half day off this morning.

310
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,600
She went to see her teacher at the hospital.

311
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,680
Okay, I got it.

312
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,760
You guys can continue.

313
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,760
What's going on?

314
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,920
What's going on?

315
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,920
What's going on?

316
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,800
What's going on?

317
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,880
What's going on?

318
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
What's going on?

319
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,680
What's going on?

320
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,480
What's going on?

321
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,400
What's going on?

322
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
What's going on?

323
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,960
She came in three times this morning.

324
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,280
It must be about President Wu.

325
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,000
You know

326
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,840
that we have a good relationship with him.

327
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,000
We were hoping

328
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,120
to get into the list of financial services

329
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,960
of the Central Medical University.

330
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
Now that it's done,

331
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,560
President Wu is out of the hospital.

332
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,920
I don't know how to drink it next.

333
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,920
Xiao Zhao.

334
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,960
Why are you so late?

335
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,800
Come on.

336
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
I have something to ask you.

337
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,920
Where have you been?

338
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,320
I'm so worried.

339
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,000
Come on.

340
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,320
See? I was right.

341
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,760
What's this? It's delicious.

342
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,760
Give me one more.

343
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,080
Xiao Zhao.

344
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,480
Come on. Tell me.

345
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,280
How is it?

346
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,040
What do you mean?

347
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,200
Mr. Wu's surgery was successful.

348
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,920
But he's in a coma.

349
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,840
I think he won't wake up for a while.

350
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,200
I'm not asking you about him.

351
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,360
I'm asking about the contract.

352
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,240
I didn't see the contract.

353
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
You didn't?

354
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
What about the card?

355
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,120
I gave you the card. You know it.

356
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,640
The card is gone.

357
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,560
Everything is gone.

358
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,200
I've been busy for half a year.

359
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,640
I've been busy for half a year.

360
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,040
I'm not.

361
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,280
Don't you think so?

362
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,880
Look at you.

363
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,400
No.

364
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,880
You could just ask me for one more chance.

365
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,760
You should speak up.

366
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,720
When I went in,

367
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,680
I saw Mr. Wu lying on the floor.

368
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,960
He's unconscious.

369
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,400
How can I ask him?

370
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,360
Zhao,

371
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,360
how about this?

372
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,560
Go to the bank and check

373
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,600
if the money in the card has been moved.

374
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,080
If it hasn't,

375
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,680
you should get a lawyer

376
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,520
to lock the money

377
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,840
and get the money back

378
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,840
after you get the money back.

379
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,880
I know Mr. Wu well.

380
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,440
We'll get the money back

381
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,760
when we have a chance.

382
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,200
Go ahead.

383
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,160
Let me know if you have any news.

384
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,520
Hurry up.

385
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:06,760
Okay.

386
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,160
Go.

387
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,360
Yanxi,

388
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,600
do you have feelings for anyone

389
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,800
except for your feet?

390
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,920
You're here.

391
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,760
I had a feeling before.

392
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,280
But I didn't feel it anymore.

393
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,000
The medicine is not hot.

394
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,080
Come on, drink it.

395
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,640
Come on.

396
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,480
Get up.

397
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,200
Let me do it.

398
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,040
Let me do it.

399
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,560
Okay.

400
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,760
Yanxi.

401
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,640
I don't want to drink it.

402
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,080
Come on, drink it.

403
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,920
I said I don't want to drink it.

404
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,920
Mom, do you think this medicine is useful?

405
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:10,800
I can't stand up

406
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,560
if I keep drinking it.

407
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,720
I drank the medicine,

408
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,840
made the prescription,

409
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,640
and used the needle.

410
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,480
I also used the massage.

411
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,680
I just didn't feel anything.

412
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
Yanxi,

413
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,120
this medicine is

414
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,320
written by Professor Ren.

415
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,160
He secretly drank the medicine that was caught by Tianzhen.

416
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,520
Yang Xiaohong made it.

417
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,240
Don't think it's just a small bowl of water.

418
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,360
It's the hope of everyone.

419
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,520
Come on, drink it.

420
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,320
I don't want to drink it.

421
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,240
We still have to go through this process.

422
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,000
We have to go through this process.

423
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,240
It's good.

424
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,720
It's not good to admit it.

425
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,480
Right?

426
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,400
Come on, drink it.

427
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,080
Come on.

428
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
I know

429
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,800
you have a heart to go.

430
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,160
You don't want to drag your mom down

431
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
and be greedy all your life,

432
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,480
right?

433
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,640
You don't want to

434
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,560
go, right?

435
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,640
But you can't go.

436
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,200
Do you know that?

437
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,160
Once you go,

438
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,760
you'll punish us

439
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,160
who love you.

440
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,480
I used to complain a lot.

441
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,440
God is so unfair to me.

442
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,320
Why can other people's children

443
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,800
work, date,

444
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,040
get married, and have children?

445
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,440
My daughter has to be in bed all her life.

446
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,320
I have to take care of her.

447
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,720
But now,

448
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,560
I don't complain at all.

449
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,800
I'm grateful.

450
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,000
It means

451
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,040
our fate is too deep.

452
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,520
So God has let you

453
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,760
stay by my side

454
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,280
and stay with me every day.

455
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,800
Which mother has

456
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,040
this kind of luck?

457
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,360
Right, Jianxi.

458
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,240
Don't worry.

459
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,720
Your accident was caused by Chengying.

460
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,200
You can't let your mom go through it alone.

461
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,640
I've made a deal with Chengying.

462
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,360
In the rest of your life,

463
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,760
as long as we're here,

464
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,440
we'll take care of you together.

465
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,720
And me.

466
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,560
I can take care of you, too.

467
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,120
Your mom is so nice.

468
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,200
aconcerned by her mom.

469
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,240
Don't worry.

470
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,440
Jianxi.

471
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,360
You have to be confident.

472
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,520
Before,

473
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,080
you thought that you may some gestures

474
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,880
had improved after a while.

475
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,080
You must be not hallucinating.

476
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,880
It's only slowly recovering.

477
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,640
If you believe window widgets,

478
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,200
your 후est journals are rising.

479
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,160
I will cherish it.

480
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:03,920
I hope

481
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,160
I can take care of it.

482
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,920
Wu Yu,

483
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,640
you're a real man.

484
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,520
Don't worry.

485
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,960
We'll be with you

486
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,360
to create miracles together.

487
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,520
Yes, we'll create miracles.

488
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,400
Yes, miracles.

489
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,480
Drink the medicine.

490
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,600
Drink.

491
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,680
Quan,

492
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,520
why didn't you go home early today?

493
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,440
Don't you have any day off?

494
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,600
Yes, I'm not free.

495
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,360
Mom, what's with the money?

496
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,520
I'm not getting anything.

497
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,800
Does Yutang's situation

498
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,560
are you okay?

499
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,240
I wanted to say, Quan,

500
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,600
is really good.

501
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,800
Today,

502
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,600
he brought the man

503
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,800
who fell into the pond in the daytime

504
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,200
to our house.

505
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,200
That attitude.

506
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,200
A 180-degree turn.

507
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,600
He is willing to reconcile

508
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,200
and take some losses

509
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,400
from our fish pond.

510
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,400
How can he be so capable?

511
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,000
He also told us

512
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,200
to rest assured

513
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,600
that the other two

514
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,200
would be withdrawn soon.

515
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,400
That's good.

516
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,400
Is that enough?

517
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,800
Yes.

518
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,800
It's not enough.

519
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,000
We still have some left.

520
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,000
Your dad said

521
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,800
he would give you the rest of the money.

522
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,600
No need, mom.

523
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,400
Take the money

524
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,000
and fix my dad's house.

525
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,400
Ask someone

526
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,200
to clean up the fish pond.

527
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,600
Don't let my dad do it himself.

528
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,000
Quan,

529
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,400
this money is not cheap.

530
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,560
It's not cheap.

531
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,360
Give your dad the rest.

532
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,560
Save some for yourself.

533
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,560
Understand?

534
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,960
It's okay, mom.

535
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,360
I can still earn money.

536
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,760
Let my dad study hard.

537
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,160
I'll hang up now.

538
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:23,200
Debo Marine

539
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,120
What's up?

540
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,960
Here's the thing, Director.

541
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,080
I want to know

542
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,600
what's going on with my teacher.

543
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,640
Isn't it that her life and her head

544
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,760
have been stabbing her?

545
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,800
Is it a fake?

546
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,760
At present,

547
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,640
the effect is not too obvious.

548
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,400
Although all the indicators

549
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,560
have stabilized,

550
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,000
she hasn't woken up.

551
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,320
It's been ten days.

552
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
You know that.

553
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,480
The longer she's in a coma,

554
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,640
the less likely she'll wake up.

555
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,440
Do you think

556
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,280
my teacher will wake up again?

557
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,200
Xiaozhou,

558
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,920
let's just go to the HR.

559
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,240
Director,

560
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,920
you should give me

561
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,080
an accurate judgment.

562
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:13,960
So I can know

563
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,600
how to tell my teacher.

564
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,360
Let me put it this way.

565
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,960
The damage

566
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,560
is usually permanent.

567
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,320
Even if she wakes up one day,

568
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,520
she can't be

569
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,880
the old Wu Shan Dao.

570
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,960
I got it.

571
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,120
Go and have a look.

572
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,760
Thank you.

573
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,320
Mrs. Wu,

574
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,560
this is a thousand

575
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,120
thousand-patterned box

576
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,640
of the same-age

577
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,000
of our friends from our school.

578
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,720
It contains

579
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,240
our wish for our teacher.

580
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,600
I hope Mr. Wu

581
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,800
can wake up soon.

582
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:58,920
Give it to me.

583
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,040
I'll get it for you.

584
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,320
Mrs. Wu,

585
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,160
look at this.

586
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,720
This is

587
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,320
our photo with Mr. Wu.

588
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,800
We made it into a video

589
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,320
and put it in

590
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,600
Mr. Wu's favorite song.

591
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,520
When the time comes,

592
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,960
you can put it on his bed.

593
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,320
Then he'll get the confidence

594
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,080
to look forward to his return to school.

595
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,400
Okay.

596
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,600
Thank you.

597
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,920
You're so thoughtful.

598
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,280
Mr. Wu knows

599
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,040
that you

600
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,320
care about him so much.

601
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,040
He'll definitely come back to school.

602
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,280
Wu Shan Dao,

603
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,840
pay the bill downstairs.

604
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:33,960
I'll be right there.

605
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,800
Give me the money.

606
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,080
Thank you, Tao Tao.

607
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,360
Wait.

608
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,040
When did you make this?

609
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,160
I just made it recently.

610
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,320
You made it recently

611
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,440
and you made it so well.

612
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,960
You even hired a lot of people.

613
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,640
Senior.

614
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,400
Why are you here?

615
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,160
My classmates are kind to me.

616
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
I brought it for my teacher.

617
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm about to leave.

618
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,880
I'm going to class soon.

619
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:57,960
By the way,

620
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,920
I have a question for you.

621
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,120
When we went there that day,

622
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,320
Mr. Wu was fine.

623
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,800
How did he fall down?

624
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,880
I have class.

625
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,800
Wait.

626
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,760
You two went to see Senior together?

627
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:12,960
Yes.

628
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,600
I went in with Senior that day.

629
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,040
But I went in to transfer the documents.

630
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,200
I left after transferring the documents.

631
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,480
So,

632
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,000
I didn't see

633
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,200
how Mr. Wu fell down.

634
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,400
You can't talk nonsense if you didn't see it.

635
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,640
He didn't fall down directly.

636
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,440
It might be caused by the rupture of the blood vessels.

637
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,120
Do you understand?

638
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,400
It's a question of the chicken or the egg.

639
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,760
Okay.

640
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,800
I'm going to class.

641
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,320
Tao Tao.

642
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,320
The teacher said that she adjusted the plan today.

643
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,400
Tell me about it.

644
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,680
Tao Tao.

645
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,600
Tao Tao.

646
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,280
Here.

647
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,920
Sun Tao Tao.

648
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,120
You two are so fierce.

649
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,760
You came to my place.

650
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,400
I don't need to eat breakfast.

651
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,880
You are so angry.

652
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,040
Where is he?

653
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,160
He didn't come.

654
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,360
He can't come in downstairs.

655
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,200
Let's have breakfast.

656
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,400
Why are you here so early today?

657
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,080
Yes.

658
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,480
I'm worried about Mr. Wu's illness.

659
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,840
So I came early.

660
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,160
You don't have to be sad about Mr. Wu.

661
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,440
I heard from Tao Tao that

662
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,280
life is full of experience and confidence.

663
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,920
Mr. Wu will wake up.

664
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,640
Can you tell me

665
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,000
what else he said?

666
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,480
Tao Tao.

667
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,400
signed your contract withcede.

668
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,800
So I can give them more time.

669
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,880
Sun Tao Tao commit suicide by pressure.

670
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,680
If you insist on a promise,

671
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,680
I will give you the encounter.

672
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,880
That's what you want, right?

673
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
Do you agree?

674
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,760
Okay, I listen to you.

675
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,880
Sure, I'm 엄마

676
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,960
You live in my home.

677
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,120
Where do you come from?

678
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,520
It's cold.

679
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,360
ut pros and cons

680
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,680
Of course.

681
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,080
By second,

682
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,080
there is an upset heart,

683
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,280
right?

684
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,480
That is the mouth right there.

685
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,680
Very good.

686
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,400
You see,

687
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,360
This is so關心.

688
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,640
I vodka impossible.

689
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,920
Oguri,

690
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,440
I washed my hands in a toilet!

691
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,400
꿀水

692
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,760
Sister, she's responding.

693
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,240
That's too much!

694
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,320
I'll arrange someone to give her some medicine.

695
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,600
Don't bother.

696
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,720
Let's go out first.

697
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,600
Why are you standing there?

698
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,040
It's over?

699
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,520
When did it happen?

700
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,360
Just two days ago.

701
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,560
What a bad luck!

702
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,200
I'll make it up to you.

703
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,320
Yeah.

704
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,000
She's lying there.

705
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,040
How did she lose the money?

706
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,280
She can't tell anyone about this.

707
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,520
Maybe her mother.

708
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,720
Think about it.

709
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:33,920
Now,

710
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,560
Mr. Wu is living in the S.U.

711
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,160
It costs more than 10,000 a day.

712
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,120
When their family needs money,

713
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,720
if her mother knows the password,

714
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,720
she'll take the money.

715
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,040
So, if your mother knows the password,

716
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,560
she'll take the money?

717
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,480
I've changed the card to six zeros.

718
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,880
It's convenient for them to get the money.

719
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,280
I've told Mr. Wu.

720
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,000
I guess he's told his mother, too.

721
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,600
No way.

722
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,040
He can tell his wife about this?

723
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,880
My goodness.

724
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,320
How can he do that?

725
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,920
Xiao Zhao,

726
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,000
here's the thing.

727
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,800
When you went to the bank to get your certificate,

728
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,960
you said you lost your card.

729
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,200
Then you checked the records

730
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,920
and found someone took the money.

731
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,120
You asked the bank to check the records

732
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,680
and see who took it.

733
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,680
I don't believe it.

734
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,200
We can get the money back.

735
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,680
It's not appropriate.

736
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,240
If Wu Xiu Yang wakes up one day,

737
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,560
we'll lose our business.

738
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,280
You said he can't wake up.

739
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,520
You said he can wake up.

740
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,240
No.

741
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,280
Which one is more likely?

742
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,200
Manager,

743
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,640
I think so.

744
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,000
Mr. Wu is going through

745
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,520
a life-and-death situation.

746
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,440
As for our friendship,

747
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,760
you can take it as a good deed.

748
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,200
Do you have to investigate it?

749
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,200
No.

750
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,720
I can't just throw away 300,000 yuan.

751
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,080
You'd better check the records.

752
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,680
I'll die to know it.

753
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,680
I'll see if it's his wife.

754
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,360
Okay.

755
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,520
I'll do it now.

756
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,480
But you have to think it over.

757
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,120
Mr. Wu is still the headmaster.

758
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,640
If he wakes up one day

759
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,680
and knows you're behind this,

760
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,480
you'll have a good future.

761
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,160
Let me think about it.

762
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,120
You can leave now.

763
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,400
Let me think about it.

764
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,480
Okay.

765
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,280
Please help me understand it.

766
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:54,600
Got it.

767
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,520
Thank you.

768
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,240
All right.

769
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,320
Go.

770
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,160
Did you come in my will?

771
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,200
Yes.

772
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,800
But...

773
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,720
What?

774
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,600
Just say it.

775
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
You said

776
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,000
you wouldn't say anything that's not based on the truth.

777
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,320
I was just guessing.

778
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:31,880
So,

779
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,320
you don't need me to say it.

780
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,040
I told you

781
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,080
what the eyes of the Chinese are.

782
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,320
The eyes of the Chinese.

783
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,000
The most important thing for a Chinese is the gut.

784
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,280
What is the gut?

785
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,080
The gut is the information given to you by a high-level space.

786
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,400
Just tell me what you feel.

787
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,520
As for the result,

788
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,400
we can discuss it slowly.

789
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,320
Is it right?

790
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,480
I think it has nothing to do with the truth.

791
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,480
It has something to do with people.

792
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,120
Or,

793
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,080
Uncle Shi

794
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,000
has something to tell Zhao Lixuan.

795
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,600
Or,

796
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,880
Uncle Shi is like this now.

797
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,000
It has something to do with Zhao Lixuan.

798
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,920
But I was just guessing.

799
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,880
There's no evidence.

800
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,400
So, Zhao Lixuan went up

801
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,640
to Uncle Shi's blood pressure.

802
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,160
You mean

803
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,360
Zhao Lixuan went up to Uncle Shi's blood pressure

804
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,680
and then went up to Uncle Shi's blood pressure?

805
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:47,920
Yes.

806
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,280
From tomorrow on,

807
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,440
we'll talk to people.

808
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,160
No one is allowed to go there.

809
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,000
You're the only one who can go there.

810
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,360
I've told the nurses and nurses.

811
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,320
Zhao Lixuan is not allowed to go to the ward alone.

812
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,520
Can the nurses listen to you?

813
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,920
You don't have to worry about it.

814
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:11,880
Dad,

815
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,400
I'll go to see Uncle Shi tomorrow.

816
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,800
Grandpa asked me to bring him something.

817
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,760
Don't go there tomorrow.

818
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,000
If you go,

819
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,480
Lixuan is not allowed to go.

820
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,360
He's not happy.

821
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,400
He's very concerned about this.

822
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,120
Give the things to Toto.

823
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,280
Let him take them.

824
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,360
Dad,

825
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,680
Toto is really closer to you than your son.

826
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,480
You let him go, but you don't let me go.

827
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,480
You don't trust me.

828
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,800
Because you're his son.

829
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,600
Toto is his uncle.

830
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,880
Such an important thing

831
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,360
should be done by the elders.

832
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,440
Of course it should be done by the elders.

833
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,200
Toto told you that?

834
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,600
You can't listen to his words.

835
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,360
What if he doesn't like Zhao Lixuan?

836
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,120
No.

837
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,560
Toto is not that narrow-minded.

838
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,320
But,

839
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,040
you did

840
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,840
handle this properly.

841
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,880
If someone must go to the ICU

842
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,000
to give Shandao acupuncture,

843
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,520
it must be Lixuan, not Toto.

844
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,920
I trust Toto.

845
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,960
I can't trust anyone else.

846
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,400
Okay.

847
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:45,920
I'll go.

848
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,560
I'll replace Toto.

849
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,240
Okay?

850
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,520
Don't go.

851
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,440
You don't trust me?

852
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,920
I don't trust you.

853
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,520
Toto is smart

854
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,120
and clever.

855
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,920
The most important thing is that he trusts me.

856
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,520
That's the most important thing.

857
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,280
If you go,

858
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,960
you'll be a university professor

859
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,960
and a successor of the 14th generation.

860
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,280
If you don't listen to me,

861
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,760
I won't dare to divorce you.

862
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,840
Right?

863
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,280
Don't go.

864
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,600
Write it down.

865
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,360
Take it.

866
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,860
Okay.

867
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,460
Take a look.

868
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:40,800
Let's switch.

869
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:53,520
Aren't you tired?

870
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,720
Make sure that you sleep.

871
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,520
Did you say?

872
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,760
I slept well.

873
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,320
Ready?

874
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,160
Boss.

875
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,280
You've worked hard.

876
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,160
How do you know my legs are sore?

877
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,800
For example,

878
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,480
standing for a day

879
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,720
makes my legs really sore.

880
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,240
I'm trying to please

881
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,680
the sisters of S.U.

882
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,560
Otherwise, they won't let me in.

883
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,840
I've paid all my salary

884
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,200
for buying snacks for them.

885
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,040
I've put them in.

886
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,560
Not a penny.

887
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,120
I've seen it.

888
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,720
You've been out of the field

889
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,880
and cleaned the toilet today.

890
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,200
That's because the caretaker is not here.

891
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,720
Since they were busy,

892
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,400
I helped them.

893
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,160
I'll treat them as my sweethearts.

894
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,000
I'll treat you, too.

895
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,560
Today, I'm your full-time waitress.

896
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,120
You can enjoy

897
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,520
all my services.

898
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,520
How about that?

899
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,760
I'll enjoy it.

900
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,440
Thank you.

901
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,600
Okay?

902
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,720
Thank you many times.

903
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:14,920
Thank you.

904
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,680
Three days weren't enough to wash my feet.

905
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,520
Three days.

906
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,320
Three days' absence is really bad.

907
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,040
These are for you.

908
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,640
What are you doing?

909
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,440
Zhai Zhai Zhai, you're so interesting.

910
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,080
You just touched my feet, right?

911
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,000
Zhai Zhai Zhai, do you want to be clean?

912
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,760
You touched my feet and touched my hands.

913
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,680
What are you doing?

914
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,720
The same old, the same old.

915
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:54,960
How is it?

916
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,600
You're so naughty.

917
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,720
Go away.

918
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,800
Okay, okay.

919
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,320
I'll get you some water.

920
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,480
It doesn't stink.

921
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,280
Why did you pour that water?

922
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,080
Mom.

923
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,880
It's a little slow when I take it off.

924
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,680
Come on, come on.

925
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,040
Everyone, the inventory is empty.

926
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,120
This one is so thick.

927
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:34,840
Whose is this?

928
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,360
I don't know.

929
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,120
Mine, mine.

930
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,920
Mine is gray.

931
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,400
Come on.

932
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,400
I ordered a thicker one.

933
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,640
It's one jin of cotton.

934
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,400
Let me see if it's right.

935
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
Yes, it's mine.

936
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,080
Here you are.

937
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,560
You don't wear cotton pants like this.

938
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,600
Aren't you carrying a quilt of cotton?

939
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,880
You don't understand.

940
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,080
I'm preparing for pregnancy.

941
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,120
The basic temperature rises.

942
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,600
The chance of being pregnant increases.

943
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,320
Xiao Hong, you don't even have a boyfriend.

944
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,000
Why do you prepare for pregnancy every day?

945
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,080
My mother said

946
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,360
it's not someone who has to prepare for pregnancy.

947
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,200
You have to be prepared all the time.

948
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,000
I'll try it.

949
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,800
Xiao Hong.

950
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,440
You look like a moth.

951
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,880
You're getting more and more like a moth.

952
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,200
Do I look like the little yellow in the village?

953
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:24,800
Yes.

954
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,760
You look more like a moth.

955
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,160
So beautiful.

956
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,040
Oh, you look like

957
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,120
a archaeologicaltenant.

958
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,920
I will show you

959
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,720
what is suitable for pregnancy all the days.

960
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,680
Don't you go.

961
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,840
No, boss Hir differ.

962
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,560
No.

963
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,200
Today, Wuhan Sh Creations

964
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,840
has no account.

965
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,600
No.

966
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,760
After tomorrow, you can check the cash account.

967
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,840
Wait.

968
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,160
No, see.

969
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:52,280
She looks like someone

970
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,320
who got Dragon Planet Visa right away.

971
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,160
Look at her.

972
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,480
But her dance was great!

973
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,480
You're not worried about him.

974
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,480
Why do you two fight when you meet?

975
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,480
If you're really bored,

976
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,480
go to the pharmacy and help.

977
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,480
Besides,

978
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,480
you've been running around here for three days.

979
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,480
I guess the hospital will fire you soon.

980
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,480
Then you can raise me.

981
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,480
Why are you here again?

982
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,480
You've been here recently.

983
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,480
The patient who was pretending to be in class before

984
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,480
is still here.

985
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,480
What's wrong with you?

986
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,480
Are you off duty?

987
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,480
What do you mean?

988
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,480
Xiao Hong.

989
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,480
There will always be some youth

990
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,480
Meeting doesn't matter

991
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,480
There will always be some people

992
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,480
Like the stars in the long night

993
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,480
Time is silent

994
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,480
Memories are all over the years

995
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,480
The food and drinks in memories

996
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,480
Are all warm and equal

997
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,480
If there is no pain in life

998
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,480
I will light a city for you

999
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,480
People in the light

1000
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,480
Are just ordinary identities

1001
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,480
Use ordinary body

To light ordinary people

1003
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,480
The soul of the people

1004
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,480
Burn a wall of enthusiasm

1005
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,480
Use a sentence

1006
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,480
We only want this world

1007
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,480
There is still heat in the dream
