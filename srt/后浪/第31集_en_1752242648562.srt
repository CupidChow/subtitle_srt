00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Untamed

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,900
For others, for society,

4
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,100
when your faith moves,

5
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,000
you can gather all your strength and make it come true.

6
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,000
That's why there's a saying,

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,400
to be a man of great ambition.

8
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,000
If a person thinks about

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,400
the benefits from this person,

10
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,800
the benefits from that person,

11
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
he's not sincere.

12
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,000
That's why he can't do good things.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If he can,

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,800
he'll pay double the price.

15
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,400
Uncle,

16
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,000
I have a friend.

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,800
He used to have this kind of

18
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,400
non-pure, selfish faith.

19
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,600
And then, it happened to be true. What should we do?

20
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,400
Then you should do good things,

21
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,800
do good things, and pay back slowly.

22
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
The premise is,

23
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,400
you can't make a big mistake.

24
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,400
How do you know it's me?

25
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,000
It's not me.

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Let's eat.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,600
Your friend?

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm done.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,600
I always have this kind of thought.

30
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,800
And this time, Meng Meng asked me for help.

31
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,400
I even missed it.

32
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,800
If I keep on being like this,

33
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,600
can I not be a doctor?

34
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,200
You can.

35
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
I can?

36
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,400
It's just that the medical skills aren't good enough.

37
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,600
That's not good either.

38
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,000
You know, the doctors who are good

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,600
aren't just a few.

40
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,200
They're many people who are grateful to them.

41
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,600
The more grateful they are, the more they fear them.

42
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Just like that...

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,600
the original leg,

44
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,400
it gets longer and longer.

45
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,800
The more you turn, the bigger it gets.

46
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,200
The more people you look after.

47
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,800
It's not like your little one with a short leg.

48
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,000
Let's take our time. It'll get better.

49
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,200
There's no taste in my mouth.

50
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,800
This is good.

51
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,800
It'll be good if I get a piece of cake.

52
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,800
It's been so long since we've had a happy family.

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,400
Why is there no one celebrating a birthday?

54
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,800
It seems like there is one person who hasn't celebrated a birthday yet.

55
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
It's Toto.

56
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,600
Toto.

57
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
I want to eat a chestnut cake.

58
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,400
It's not a fake one.

59
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,800
He should be the one to choose.

60
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,400
Don't tell him yet.

61
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,000
Give him a surprise.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,600
He grew up in a welfare home.

63
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
He doesn't even know when his birthday is.

64
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
How will he celebrate it?

65
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,400
That's even more important.

66
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,000
This is a philosophical topic.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,400
People should know

68
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,200
where they come from and where they go.

69
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,200
It can be a past event or a new event.

70
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,400
Okay.

71
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,800
It's a happy decision.

72
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,000
You'll be making rice wine in a few days.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,800
You can also order the cake.

74
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,800
A chestnut cake with thick cream.

75
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,000
Grandpa, you're going to kill me.

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,600
If I really order that one,

77
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
my mom and grandma will beat me up

78
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,800
and beat me on the ground repeatedly.

79
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,600
I raised you, little thing.

80
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,400
I didn't just want you to beat me up for me.

81
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,600
Okay, grandpa.

82
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,400
The cream is thick.

83
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh, right, Master.

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,400
That...

85
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,000
Did you watch Mengmeng's video?

86
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
What do you think?

87
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,600
It's all in the past.

88
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,800
Let Mengmeng rest in peace.

89
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,400
I think... I think

90
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
no matter what, I should still

91
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,600
watch her parents.

92
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,800
I think they're blaming their child.

93
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Mengmeng might be a patient.

94
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,400
Say, little girl,

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,400
in the end,

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,400
you just carried her and left.

97
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,800
We didn't care about her.

98
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,200
I just feel that in my heart,

99
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,000
it's really...

100
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,000
That's Mengmeng's last letter.

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,400
It was written to you.

102
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,600
It's her letter to you.

103
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,200
I want...

104
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,400
not to tell her parents.

105
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,400
If her parents knew that her

106
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,000
father-in-law was sick,

107
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,800
they would regret it for the rest of their lives.

108
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,800
So we won't do such a thing.

109
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,600
In the end,

110
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,000
we still hope that the living

111
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
can live a better life.

112
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,000
I really want to live a better life.

113
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,600
Drinking some rainwater will bring you out of GPU blockage.

114
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,400
The first thing that ever came to my mind

115
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:38,960
is that Mo Feiool

116
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,940
wouldn't respect my mother-in-law in her heart.

117
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,600
I want to feel that on an emotional level,

118
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,400
and just want to take it from her.

119
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,320
I take full responsibility

120
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,120
for the thing that happened between us.

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,400
What?

122
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,920
I entirety had a sad failed.

123
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,280
He seems serious about the criminal justice.

124
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,480
My father said

125
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,640
if one quickly forces things to change,

126
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,120
he'll make mistakes.

127
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,160
You'd pay for it.

128
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,480
What else did my father say?

129
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,080
You've taught me this already in movies.

130
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,000
The story of aelinoh,

131
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,660
caseете about cold divers and farmers.

132
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,960
It's Babel's story.

133
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,040
That's only part of it.

134
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,120
In fact, I come here

135
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,720
And the other reason is...

136
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,320
What?

137
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,640
Because I want to touch you.

138
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,040
Such a bold and arrogant idea.

139
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,640
How could you have it?

140
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,760
You even got it.

141
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,000
That's to say,

142
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,680
how could I know it would come true?

143
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,120
And how could your dad

144
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,480
pass it on to me?

145
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,360
How could I know he's so good?

146
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,080
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,360
So you got my dad's true story.

148
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,040
You've hurt me all my life.

149
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,120
You must compensate me.

150
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,000
I will.

151
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,200
How?

152
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,960
Let me.

153
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,760
How is it?

154
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,520
What's wrong with you?

155
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,200
What?

156
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,000
Break up.

157
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,760
That's impossible.

158
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,320
You've never found a successful

159
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,480
way to get it back.

160
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,680
But I must get it back.

161
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:35,880
I...

162
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,080
I want to make a wish

163
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,320
which is very precious.

164
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
And I want to use it on my Chinese clothes.

165
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,440
I finally got it back.

166
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,920
But it's not worth it at all.

167
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,360
Please understand me.

168
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,480
I mean it.

169
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,160
I feel so bad.

170
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,880
I'm struggling too.

171
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,520
Yeah.

172
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,680
There's nothing we can do.

173
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,720
From now on,

174
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,600
we'll just pretend that

175
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,120
nothing happened, okay?

176
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,520
Sun Xiao Tao.

177
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,800
Who do you think I am?

178
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,280
You've never learned

179
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
my dad's personality.

180
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,320
You're just like him.

181
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
I never understood

182
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,560
why my mom

183
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,800
always got mad at my dad.

184
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,920
Now I understand.

185
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,720
As long as there's a conflict

186
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
between Chinese and English,

187
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,520
my mom must be

188
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,680
sacrificed.

189
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,200
Your dad said it.

190
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,040
He's willing to...

191
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,680
No.

192
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,280
You can't do that.

193
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,240
You like the first moment,

194
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
but you'll fall in love with the next moment.

195
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,320
I'm willing to.

196
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,320
But I have to.

197
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,040
What about Confucius?

198
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
People do everything

199
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,360
as long as they don't break the law.

200
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,040
Ask yourself.

201
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,720
Do you want to break the law or get me?

202
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,320
I don't know.

203
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,520
I know.

204
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,640
It's easy.

205
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,720
Your heart

206
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,440
is on your Chinese clothes.

207
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,840
I'll think about

208
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,480
our relationship.

209
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,640
Let me think about it.

210
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,200
Who?

211
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,720
What does this mean?

212
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,360
Ravel.

213
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,440
It is so wrong.

214
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,800
Whatever.

215
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,600
I'm not ?]

216
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,800
You're still mine.

217
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,720
What about your future?

218
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,280
I'll keep it.

219
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,080
What if there's something else

220
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,280
that's important to me?

221
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,520
I can't joke about that.

222
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,720
It's something important to you,

223
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,880
not someone else.

224
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,240
Why are you so worried?

225
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,480
You should

226
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,440
be a good doctor.

227
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,600
Me too.

228
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,520
Give me one.

229
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,640
Yeah.

230
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,920
Kiss me.

231
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,520
Bingo.

232
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,840
Come and sit down, иéchи bugs

233
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,120
I am well Journalist

234
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,720
Come and sit down

235
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,640
Xiao Zeng

236
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,200
It's been three

237
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,480
months since you came to us

238
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,060
I have to .

239
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,840
How do you feel

240
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,320
I was quitezosy at first

241
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,800
Now I'm perfectly able to get it

242
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
I'm glad

243
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,040
that I can do it.

244
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,080
Let's see.

245
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,760
You're a talented student.

246
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,400
You're really good at learning.

247
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,400
Mr. Wu,

248
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,080
you've really

249
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,360
helped us a lot.

250
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

251
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,360
Mr. Wu,

252
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,680
I'm here to ask you

253
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,040
for a favor.

254
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,520
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

255
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,720
Me?

256
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,320
Mr. Wu, what can I do for you?

257
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,400
Sit down.

258
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,200
You can do it.

259
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,480
Relax.

260
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,120
I'm not asking you to do anything.

261
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,480
Recently,

262
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,320
we've got a batch of new drugs

263
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,760
for the flu.

264
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,360
You know about this, right?

265
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,800
Yes.

266
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,800
This is the first drug I've done.

267
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,200
I won't talk about the basic things.

268
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,640
Here's the thing.

269
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,720
We hope that

270
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,320
we can

271
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,880
push this drug this year.

272
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,040
It's best

273
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,280
to enter the list of

274
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,160
three hospitals in the city.

275
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,760
Each hospital

276
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,760
has to be registered

277
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,040
according to the procedures.

278
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,200
We'll be

279
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,600
the first to enter the list.

280
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,760
So I mean

281
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,320
to ask Mr. Wu for a favor

282
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,480
and see if we can

283
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,440
get the price

284
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,560
of other hospitals.

285
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,200
Look.

286
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,360
You're Mr. Wu's disciple.

287
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,040
He recommended you to us.

288
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,720
You can

289
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,680
talk to him about this.

290
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,040
Mr. Wu,

291
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,520
Mr. Wu and I

292
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,640
don't have much friendship.

293
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,920
I can't talk to him about this.

294
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,720
Come on.

295
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,400
Good mouth.

296
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,160
Good mouth.

297
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,560
This is our vote.

298
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,680
And this.

299
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,120
You can bring this to Mr. Wu.

300
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,960
What does this mean?

301
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,520
This is

302
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,400
a card in your name.

303
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,640
The password

304
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,480
is your ID number and your last six digits.

305
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,880
You can send it to him.

306
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,520
He can just send it to me.

307
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,360
The amount

308
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,000
is not the final amount.

309
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,760
As long as Mr. Wu is willing,

310
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
he can open a card.

311
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,680
You can tell me.

312
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,600
The card in my name?

313
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,600
Yes.

314
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,120
Zhao,

315
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,720
relax.

316
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,440
You're just

317
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,680
bringing us a message.

318
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,360
If he's willing,

319
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
we'll be happy.

320
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,240
If he's not,

321
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,480
you can return the card to me.

322
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,760
It has nothing to do with you.

323
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,240
But

324
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,800
if you succeed,

325
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,160
I'll give you

326
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,240
one point of the hospital's money.

327
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,960
How much is it?

328
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,760
I don't need to

329
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,840
calculate it for you.

330
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,360
Mr. Wu,

331
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,520
there are so many

332
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,880
skilled doctors in our clinic.

333
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,760
Why do you choose

334
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,720
Toto, the ungraduate student?

335
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
Don't say that.

336
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,880
I think Toto is good.

337
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,840
Besides,

338
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,520
the clinic is doing business.

339
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,840
I can't take the clinic's money.

340
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,960
Yes.

341
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,920
Young Master,

342
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,560
please forgive me.

343
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,080
You're just getting started.

344
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,680
But you still

345
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,520
lack the softness.

346
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,280
Don't worry, Uncle.

347
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,240
I'll give you a massage today.

348
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,880
I'll do my best.

349
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,920
I won't give you so much effort.

350
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,320
If you think I did a good job today,

351
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,320
don't forget to

352
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,040
praise me at Mr. Dong's place.

353
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,320
I thought I wanted to get a job.

354
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,520
What?

355
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,640
You're not making money

356
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,960
from your master's treatment?

357
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,280
I'm not making money.

358
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm saving money.

359
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,000
You know about saving money.

360
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,320
Do you know

361
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,440
where this theory comes from?

362
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,160
No.

363
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,720
Anyway, Master told me.

364
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,240
You're so reasonable.

365
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,440
This theory

366
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,840
was dug up from my place.

367
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,040
Why is he like this?

368
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,800
He learned it from you

369
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,040
and used it on me.

370
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,240
Who told us to be brothers?

371
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
That's true.

372
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,440
Uncle Chi,

373
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,440
you're still

374
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,960
a man of your word.

375
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,240
You're amazing.

376
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,120
Don't flatter me.

377
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,600
I know how long my legs are.

378
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,160
Let's get down to business.

379
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,240
Which one do you like more,

380
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,400
the needlework or the technique?

381
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,200
Well,

382
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,360
it's hard for me to say.

383
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,520
I think each one has its own fun

384
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,920
and its own good.

385
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,520
Actually, I like

386
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,800
all of them.

387
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,200
Like Mr. Dong.

388
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,080
He can make the patient

389
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,040
recover before he gets sick.

390
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,800
Isn't it amazing?

391
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
That's true.

392
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,040
Is it okay to do this today?

393
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,560
Yes.

394
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,640
Mr. Dong,

395
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,360
this gentleman wants to see you.

396
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,160
Dr. Sun,

397
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,040
thank you.

398
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,560
It's okay.

399
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,640
Why are you here?

400
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,880
I went to the clinic.

401
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,880
They said you were here.

402
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,600
So I came here.

403
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,040
You went to see Tianzhen today.

404
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,720
He wanted to see you.

405
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,440
I was busy.

406
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,800
No, Dr. Sun, listen to me.

407
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,320
I haven't slept well

408
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,240
for several days.

409
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,480
I just want to hear you say something.

410
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,440
You can relieve stress.

411
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,360
I don't need

412
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,520
this kind of treatment.

413
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,600
I want to hear you say something, too.

414
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,840
I'm busy.

415
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Listen to me.

416
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,080
I'm not afraid of anyone.

417
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,920
Is that okay?

418
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,840
They don't want to listen to you.

419
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,560
You...

420
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,280
It's okay.

421
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:42,920
Tongtong,

422
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,760
you guys talk.

423
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,840
I'll go take a nap.

424
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,920
Leave me alone.

425
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,000
Okay.

426
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,280
Sleep for a while.

427
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,080
It's okay.

428
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,960
What's wrong with you?

429
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,720
I have a bad feeling.

430
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,360
Yi Heng is being treated now.

431
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,440
I'll do what I should do

432
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,840
according to their rules.

433
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,640
I...

434
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,760
Your problem...

435
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,240
Your problem?

436
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,800
That's all?

437
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,600
That's all.

438
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,480
Then you'll eventually

439
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,180
be ripped by those

440
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,960
old people later.

441
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,280
They don't know me.

442
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,240
I just ripped

443
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,960
that star.

444
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,600
Your fate can't be like this.

445
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,360
I...

446
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,560
He Sequence doesn't know

447
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,720
that you are a scammer either.

448
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,520
You are not such a man.

449
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,120
Excellent.

450
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,560
I can't make money.

451
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,240
No, I'm not lying.

452
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,920
I wanted to give the ordinary

453
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,160
a good return through my investment.

454
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,040
How could I be wrong?

455
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,560
You don't know anything, and you just invest.

456
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
You're so selfish.

457
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,840
It's easy to make money.

458
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,080
You're so self-satisfied.

459
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,320
What can I do?

460
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,160
Listen.

461
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,520
It's already like this.

462
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,400
You're already

463
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,600
a low-class stockholder.

464
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,960
Just

465
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,920
take it easy and have a good sleep.

466
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,920
No, there's one more thing.

467
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,560
I'm a little worried now.

468
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,000
What's worrying you?

469
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,920
I still have a lot of money abroad.

470
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,560
Listen to me.

471
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,680
When I was doing business well,

472
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,680
I was so worried that I would run away.

473
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,520
I thought

474
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,520
at least I ran away.

475
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,240
At least I have a livelihood.

476
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,960
I just can't understand

477
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,560
what to do with this.

478
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,960
I can say nothing.

479
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,760
But you know,

480
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,400
when I close my eyes at night,

481
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,280
I can't help but see

482
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,320
the old man and old woman

483
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,240
at the door of my company

484
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,080
looking at me.

485
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,920
I'm really sad.

486
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,400
I can't bear it.

487
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,440
You said that I was sick

488
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,440
because I was guilty.

489
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,120
I thought you were right.

490
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,440
You were right.

491
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,480
If I really leave like this,

492
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,560
will this disease follow me forever?

493
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,920
Lu Dan Dan.

494
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,800
My master told me

495
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,840
this.

496
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
He said that people have a debt.

497
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,360
It's not in the bank,

498
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,720
but in the sky.

499
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,440
You think you're hiding this debt.

500
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,800
You think people don't know

501
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,840
and ghosts don't feel it.

502
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,520
Actually, this debt

503
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,680
has been on you for a long time.

504
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,120
You can't run away.

505
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,840
You know,

506
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,320
the word, guilt,

507
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,880
is a ghost beside a tree, right?

508
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,080
There's a ghost in your heart.

509
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,560
The person who has a ghost in his heart

510
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,920
can win with his face.

511
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,920
His body can win, too.

512
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,520
He can get sick and get sick.

513
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,720
If you

514
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,160
leave the country

515
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,080
because of this money

516
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,360
and don't return the money

517
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,800
to the people,

518
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,920
you won't be able to come back

519
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,800
for the rest of your life.

520
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,680
Then you'll die in another country.

521
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,440
Your parents will be in a difficult situation.

522
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,760
That's it for your life.

523
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Are you willing to pay

524
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,240
for this debt?

525
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,800
You can estimate it in your heart.

526
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,480
This is a bad person.

527
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,320
You really want me to

528
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,160
get rid of this family, right?

529
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,560
I don't want to.

530
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,960
Do you know the sound of the paper?

531
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,560
The sound of the paper.

532
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,200
What?

533
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,040
It's when you smile.

534
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,760
There are three lines here.

535
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,040
You have this line.

536
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,000
I have it, too.

537
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,880
You can smile.

538
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,720
Go back and look at the mirror.

539
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,480
There are three lines here.

540
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,000
The sound of the paper

541
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,360
is the line that the ancestors

542
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,120
inherited from their ancestors.

543
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,960
That's how the descendants have it.

544
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,560
Once they have it,

545
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,080
their lives will be peaceful

546
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,240
and smooth.

547
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,000
You're like that.

548
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,440
The reason for the paper

549
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,840
is that the ancestors inherited it.

550
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,560
What if the ancestors

551
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,080
don't remember to do something bad?

552
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,520
What will the descendants

553
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,520
have on their faces?

554
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,480
What?

555
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,680
It will be scarier.

556
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,640
What about the ashes?

557
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,600
Nothing.

558
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,040
I was just trying to scare you.

559
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,640
But

560
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,120
it will be cursed by the ten thousand people.

561
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,080
The ten thousand people will be cursed.

562
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,920
It will be worse than

563
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,880
the ashes.

564
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,480
Don't scare me, Dr. Sun.

565
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,680
What do you mean by the paper?

566
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,040
What do you mean by the ancestral inheritance?

567
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,320
It's a modern society.

568
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,760
We don't believe in superstition.

569
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,400
I...

570
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,160
It's not superstition.

571
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,760
It's a positive thing.

572
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,600
The most clear

573
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,840
ancestral inheritance

574
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,680
is the descendants of Confucius.

575
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,720
He's a scholar, a scholar of the art.

576
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,480
So, until today,

577
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,960
people still worship him.

578
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,160
In the past, when Chinese people

579
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,320
named their children,

580
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,760
they always used the names of trees.

581
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,720
For example, pine,

582
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,840
white, and blue.

583
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,760
But after the Qing Dynasty,

584
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,160
people never dared to use the word

585
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,720
pine in the name of children.

586
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,960
But you should know that

587
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,400
the tree

588
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,680
was as precious as the South Tree.

589
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,160
So, do you really think

590
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,920
everything you do

591
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,080
will be spent

592
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,640
in time so easily?

593
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,240
You two, wake up my mom.

594
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,120
I... I'm determined now.

595
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,400
You're determined?

596
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,360
I'm determined.

597
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,360
You're really determined?

598
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,240
Yes.

599
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,720
Then, Yang Xiang,

600
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,040
take the money out now

601
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,200
and return it to the people.

602
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,440
They're at ease, you're at ease.

603
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,120
They're at ease,

604
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,680
and you can sleep.

605
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,200
I fell asleep.

606
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,960
Yes.

607
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,000
I'm really happy to see you today.

608
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,320
I'm so happy to hear your words.

609
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,560
I'll go now.

610
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,760
Go.

611
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,320
Go.

612
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,520
Go.

613
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,800
He's so kind.

614
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,480
He's really kind.

615
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,160
Why are you lying there?

616
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,120
Uncle.

617
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,960
You're here.

618
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,640
I really forgot you.

619
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,840
You can't forget me

620
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,040
if you're still alive.

621
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,160
I really forgot you.

622
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,760
I really forgot you.

623
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,880
Don't say that.

624
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,160
Tuo Tuo, you said

625
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,360
very well today.

626
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,560
Uncle also accepted your invitation.

627
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,440
You're really something

628
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,720
to be admired.

629
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,840
Really?

630
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,240
Of course.

631
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,680
Okay, I got it.

632
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,960
Very good.

633
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,720
You're getting more and more familiar.

634
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,520
Remember to praise me in front of Mr. Dong.

635
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,560
Don't worry.

636
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,000
I'll take care of it.

637
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,800
Okay.

638
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,800
Lu Hao.

639
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,120
You're here to do the magic again?

640
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,200
Why didn't you ask Mr. Dong?

641
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,320
I didn't ask him.

642
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,520
Mr. Dong

643
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,000
will keep it for you.

644
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,720
You two are like gods to gods.

645
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,160
I'll go to Sun Tuo Tuo.

646
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,760
He didn't pass the exam.

647
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,920
Listen.

648
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,760
Magic is

649
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,920
very useful.

650
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,320
It's very mysterious.

651
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,120
It only needs a word.

652
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,240
Tuo Tuo.

653
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,680
It's more suitable for me.

654
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,400
I've been doing this for a while.

655
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,040
I think Tuo Tuo is the best.

656
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,080
Don't say that.

657
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,000
He's talented.

658
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,360
He's talented.

659
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,040
Shan Tong.

660
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,560
I've been thinking

661
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,720
about your blood relationship.

662
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,120
When you first came here,

663
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,840
Sun Tuo Tuo was just a girl.

664
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,600
Now, you see,

665
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,680
she's a bit like a traditional person.

666
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,960
She's like a girl.

667
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,760
When you brought her here,

668
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,920
I was just

669
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,800
a bit out of my way.

670
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,880
You've accepted her, haven't you?

671
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,680
Yes.

672
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,560
I've been

673
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:14,720
cultivating the

674
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,920
sword of the disciple.

675
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,840
I've been cultivating it for a while.

676
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,440
But I didn't get two words.

677
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,960
What two words?

678
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,120
Wu Wei.

679
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,440
I'll do whatever

680
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,720
you ask me to do.

681
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:30,920
Don't say that.

682
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,200
I didn't expect that.

683
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,800
I was yelling

684
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,080
and turning a monkey into a person.

685
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,240
A good disciple like you

686
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,720
is gone.

687
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,120
Remember.

688
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,440
Which one of the children

689
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,680
can be Wu Wei?

690
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,040
Look at his head.

691
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,320
If he can be Wu Wei,

692
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,920
he'll be fine.

693
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,080
I can hand him over.

694
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,760
It's big.

695
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,920
Such a big grass.

696
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,440
It's been years.

697
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,320
What's this?

698
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,360
It's a branch.

699
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,440
There's a path.

700
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,640
Let me see.

701
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,040
Master.

702
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,920
Master.

703
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,040
Master.

704
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,280
Professor Ren.

705
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,080
Mrs. Zhu.

706
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,560
Mrs. Zhu.

707
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,280
Mrs. Zhu.

708
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:28,920
Mr. Wu.

709
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,040
Hello, Mr. Wu.

710
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:30,760
Hello.

711
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,840
Look.

712
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,040
These are all

713
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,800
Zhu's wishes.

714
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,360
He's got so many treasures.

715
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,880
He doesn't need them now.

716
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,560
I've brought them all here.

717
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,920
Look at this box.

718
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,240
It's a 70-year-old wild ginseng.

719
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,560
The body is intact.

720
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,960
Those two boxes.

721
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,480
He said it's a 60-year-old old orange peel.

722
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,720
I heard gold is expensive.

723
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,600
And this.

724
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,760
I heard it's a high-end

725
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,800
and high-end incense.

726
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,880
It's been locked in the safe.

727
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,000
I've brought

728
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,440
this grass here.

729
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,640
Keep it.

730
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,760
It's a good price.

731
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,800
I don't know

732
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,800
how to use these.

733
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,560
Mr. Zhu said

734
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,400
Professor Ren can use them

735
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,680
on the person

736
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,960
who really needs them.

737
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,040
Keep them.

738
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,880
Keep them.

739
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,400
I'll keep them.

740
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,600
Thank you.

741
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,680
Thank you.

742
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,360
Tao.

743
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,760
Record everything

744
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,360
carefully.

745
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,480
Send it to the clinic.

746
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,280
Okay.

747
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,520
Professor Ren.

748
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,120
And this.

749
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,080
This is the money

750
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,000
Mr. Zhu donated to the city office.

751
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,480
When he woke up,

752
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,760
he told me

753
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,040
that Professor Ren

754
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,400
can educate

755
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,440
all the children like Tao.

756
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,280
He's a good teacher.

757
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,600
He also said

758
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,520
he'd entrust our family

759
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,520
to the clinic.

760
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,040
How can I

761
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,640
not give him some money?

762
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,120
Well.

763
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,040
Mr. Zhu.

764
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,400
Is that a compliment

765
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,840
or a scolding?

766
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,080
Why do I hear people praising you?

767
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,880
Mrs. Zhu.

768
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,120
I understand

769
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,280
what you mean.

770
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,320
Thank you.

771
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,560
Thank you.

772
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,480
Liu Haoli.

773
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,760
What?

774
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,120
You're not working today?

775
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,480
Mr. Wu.

776
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,720
I'm here to work today.

777
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,640
What's up?

778
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,680
I heard from Mr. Tu

779
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,640
that you're applying for a full-time job.

780
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,440
But I have a message.

781
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,440
I hope you won't be

782
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,280
a representative of a full-time job.

783
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,280
You need to spare some time

784
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,960
to study.

785
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,360
I believe you.

786
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,840
I also hope you

787
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,720
can become a great actor in the future.

788
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,640
The real Ni Teng

789
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,120
can't meet Kunpeng's dream.

790
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,800
Yes.

791
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,040
Mr. Wu.

792
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,400
We've just

793
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,720
bought some medicines.

794
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,280
I hope we can get them to the hospital.

795
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,200
Aren't they going to bid?

796
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,760
I'm not sure.

797
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,520
I hope you can have a look.

798
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,000
Not bad.

799
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,120
Did Mr. Tu ask you to come?

800
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,360
Do you know what you're doing?

801
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,920
A scholar

802
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,800
can't be together

803
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,360
or be with the mainstream.

804
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,720
That's it.

805
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,720
I'll pretend you didn't come.

806
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,880
Mr. Wu, don't worry.

807
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,240
This card is under my name.

808
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,120
It has nothing to do with you.

809
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,720
You just need to be responsible for it.

810
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,240
We're just...

811
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,360
come toеш

812
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,200
the

813
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,640
Old Chong Reeve.

814
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,960
My only wish

815
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,800
is

816
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,200
to appear in the Army Dre YouTube

817
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,320
and gain back some experience.

818
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,640
Yes.

819
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,360
My intent

820
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,200
You should do it.

821
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,280
You should know what you're doing.

822
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,440
But, President,

823
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,280
I know you've been

824
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,320
so nice to me.

825
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,240
I won't hurt you.

826
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,280
We've tried

827
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,000
these medicines

828
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,800
countless times.

829
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,320
The quality is absolutely fine.

830
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,360
Li Quan.

831
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,520
I introduced you to be

832
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,520
a medical representative

833
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,960
to make you a good doctor.

834
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,160
But?

835
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,960
I've been there recently.

836
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,240
You're not there.

837
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,960
You're not there either.

838
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,640
I just want to ask you.

839
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,920
Do you still want to be a doctor?

840
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,640
Yes.

841
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,080
But I don't have

842
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,520
the identity of a thief

843
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,320
or a naive family.

844
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,360
I'm not a doctor.

845
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,440
I have a family

846
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,720
waiting for me to pick up.

847
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,040
I have a dream,

848
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,920
but I don't have

849
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,280
the money to realize it.

850
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,920
I know you must be

851
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,440
very disappointed with me.

852
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,040
I'm the same.

853
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,600
I'm also disappointed with myself.

854
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,320
But, President Wu,

855
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,760
a poor kid like us

856
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,360
wants to live

857
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,160
in this society...

858
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,440
Don't be so honest.

859
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,440
You're just making excuses.

860
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,880
You're just being lazy.

861
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,560
In this world,

862
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,200
many people

863
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,280
have come from poverty.

864
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,040
Take me for example.

865
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,880
My family was

866
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,560
almost the same as yours.

867
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,760
Some people even fought.

868
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,400
His family was even poorer.

869
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,680
But now?

870
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,920
We're not a generation of heaven's friends,

871
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,080
but we're kind of

872
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,600
a middle-class family.

873
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,280
One must have a pursuit.

874
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,520
You must be honest.

875
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,780
You can't be a

876
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,320
Today, I'll leave it at that.

877
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,760
You can go back and think about it.

878
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,160
Take this away.

879
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,960
Tell the old man

880
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,280
not to do this with me.

881
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,640
Otherwise,

882
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,680
I'll go to President Zheng.

883
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,960
Since the moves

884
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,200
are making him uncomfortable,

885
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,560
I don't now

886
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,720
what he really wants.

887
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,000
Have you made one?

888
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,520
Maybe you should beania when you are this old.

889
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,200
Maybe you shouldn't?

890
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,600
Let's just leave it like that.

891
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,040
In other words,

892
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,240
I'm not afraid.

893
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,560
Love can't be eaten as food.

894
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,040
I'm already facing

895
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,400
the difficulties of this city.

896
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,520
I don't want my child

897
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,800
to lose

898
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,400
from the moment he was born.

899
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
The End

900
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,880
You just want to

901
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,880
bring us a picture.

902
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,560
What if he's willing?

903
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,840
It's a great joy.

904
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,320
What if he's not?

905
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,600
If you return the card to me,

906
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,880
it's really nothing to do with you.

907
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,160
But

908
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,760
if you succeed in this,

909
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,160
I'll give you

910
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,200
one point of the hospital's sales.

911
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,880
How much is one point?

912
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,720
I don't need to

913
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,760
calculate for you.

914
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,360
The End

915
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:24,880
Hello, Mom.

916
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,160
Da Da Da.

917
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,040
Where is he?

918
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,680
He's out.

919
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,360
Why is he out?

920
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,400
He has a job.

921
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,820
The End

922
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,380
Let's go.

923
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,120
Let's go.

924
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,200
Happy birthday to you.

925
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
Happy birthday to you,

926
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,040
Happy birthday.

927
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,840
Happy birthday to you.

928
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:11,640
The End

929
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,160
Whose birthday today?

930
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,480
I have sung it for a long time,

931
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,560
but I still don't know.

932
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,840
Your birthday?

933
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,800
Me?

934
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,840
Mom, dad, have a seat.

935
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,280
Qiao,

936
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,800
why are you living alone?

937
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,760
I was going to live with a girl.

938
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,600
It's not convenient, so I moved out.

939
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,240
Is it the girl you like?

940
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,320
No, mom. I don't like any girl.

941
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,640
You said you'd go back during the New Year.

942
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,840
Stop talking about useless things.

943
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,120
Let's talk about the fish soup.

944
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,440
Fish soup?

945
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,240
What's wrong with the fish soup?

946
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,600
Qiao,

947
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,040
you're really out of your mind.

948
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,440
Our fish soup

949
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,240
has been in the fish for three months.

950
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,080
We've been raising fish for three or five years.

951
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,160
I've never seen anything like this.

952
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,800
Three cars in a row?

953
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,760
Yes.

954
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,000
We saved the car,

955
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,240
but it ruined our fish soup.

956
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,920
The oil leaked out.

957
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,320
The oil was all over the surface.

958
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,360
The fish's stomach was turned white.

959
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,760
It was scary when the first car hit the road.

960
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,520
It was too late.

961
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,000
Your brother was quick.

962
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,600
He jumped off the car

963
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,320
and smashed the car.

964
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,880
He even dragged the car out.

965
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,120
Otherwise,

966
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,640
the car and the man...

967
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,080
Is my brother okay?

968
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,400
What could happen to your brother?

969
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,720
We can't raise fish with the pond.

970
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,600
We need to rest for a few years

971
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,320
and clean up the remaining oil.

972
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,680
Otherwise, the fish we raise

973
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,360
will smell like oil.

974
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,560
The fish soup is ruined.

975
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,040
Are they on a long leave?

976
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,960
We have to ask them to compensate us.

977
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,920
Are you okay, Village Head?

978
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,600
I'm fine.

979
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,160
I was invited.

980
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,640
Why?

981
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,280
They invited us first

982
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,520
and told us

983
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,320
that our fish soup

984
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,160
didn't have a warning sign at night.

985
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,720
They couldn't see anything.

986
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,680
No.

987
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,840
I asked about your birthday.

988
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,680
It's not today.

989
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,920
You got it wrong.

990
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,120
I said it was your birthday.

991
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,440
It's your birthday.

992
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,920
Master,

993
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,240
have you been talking about it for a long time?

994
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,280
You're always talking about it.

995
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,360
You're always talking about it.

996
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,040
Well,

997
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,960
it's not long

998
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,000
since Toto came to our house.

999
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,480
He hasn't celebrated his birthday.

1000
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,840
We should celebrate his birthday for him.

1001
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,280
We should feel a sense of ritual.

1002
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,520
At least,

1003
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,840
we should know who we are,

1004
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,720
where we come from

1005
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,720
and where we go.

1006
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,200
Right?

1007
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,840
I don't need to know

1008
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,280
where I come from.

1009
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,120
Because

1010
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,120
I don't know

1011
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,840
how long I've been born.

1012
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,760
But now,

1013
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,960
I know clearly

1014
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,120
where I'm going.

1015
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,720
Where are you going?

1016
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,200
I'm going to work hard

1017
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,600
to be a heir.

1018
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,280
Xia Zhuo.

1019
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,000
His Majesty

1020
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,360
嗯,

1021
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,000
I'm going to work hard to beg him.

1022
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,420
Yan yumeng,

1023
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,840
I'm calling you.

1024
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,840
Just a casual visit.

1025
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,640
Ye Taifu,

1026
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,080
I didn't want to go.

1027
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,160
Some business matters.

1028
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,240
You know?

1029
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,960
I made a mistake with Yan yumeng.

1030
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,560
Get out of here.

1031
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,480
I said I was going to work hard

1032
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,360
The laundry is here.

1033
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,040
Ye perceives that

1034
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,520
your tart pencil has ersten aid.

1035
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,400
I asked him to collect it

1036
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,040
after getting off work and showed it to him.

1037
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,520
The stars in the long night

1038
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,560
Time is silent

1039
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,960
Memories are all memories

1040
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:31,520
Every minute and every second of memory

1041
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,320
Is warm and equal

1042
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,320
If there is no pain in the end of life

1043
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,320
I will light up your life

1044
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,760
The people in the light

1045
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,120
Are just ordinary identities

1046
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,880
With ordinary bodies

1047
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,960
Light up the ordinary souls of people

1048
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,560
Burn the passion of the battle

1049
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,320
Use one sentence, we

1050
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,160
Only in this world

1051
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,560
The people in the light

1052
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,920
Are just ordinary identities

1053
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,680
With ordinary bodies

1054
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,040
Light up the ordinary souls of people

1055
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,200
Burn the passion of the battle

1056
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,440
Use one sentence, we

1057
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,600
Only in this world

1058
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,440
The people in the light

1059
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,640
Are just ordinary identities

1060
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,560
With ordinary bodies

1061
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,600
Light up the ordinary souls of people

1062
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,520
Burn the passion of the battle

1063
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,200
Use one sentence, we

1064
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,600
Only in this world

1065
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,760
The people in the light

1066
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,080
Are just ordinary identities

1067
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,080
With ordinary bodies
