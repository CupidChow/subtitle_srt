00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Untamed

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,520
Tianzhen, go and call her family.

4
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,400
Tell them to bring her child and send her off.

5
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Professor Ren.

6
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,200
It's no use to hold me.

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,800
No.

8
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,280
No.

9
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,520
This is the first time I've seen a dead cat.

10
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,000
She looked too beautiful with hooked arm.

11
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,080
You must be so kind to your dad.

12
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,000
What are you looking at?

13
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,640
You scared me.

14
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,760
I was freaked out.

15
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,280
She's quitezenie.

16
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,880
Behind the Ref Texas Hospital,

17
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,560
she has a fight.

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,640
Xu Tian is a good kid,

19
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,840
but he's still a good kid.

20
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,000
You...

21
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,200
Chen Yinmei is dead

22
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,520
and you lie to her?

23
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,760
Today you had a great performance.

24
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,920
Your OED role

25
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,160
when you came in

26
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,320
made me smile and said

27
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,120
that Chen Yinmei is still alive.

28
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,960
Am I not

29
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,880
I have to help you play this play.

30
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,920
Right?

31
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,520
My master was right.

32
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,440
The stone can turn into a monkey.

33
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,120
But...

34
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,960
What stone can turn into a monkey?

35
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,480
Come on.

36
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,760
Rock sugar.

37
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,560
Let's enjoy this.

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,760
Ye Xiaosu,

39
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,800
next time they're right in the right place,

40
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,080
let's eat it and sleep together.

41
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,880
Dad, laugh.

42
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,920
That time,

43
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,800
I will cheer up our mother for you only by your side.

44
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,880
Great.

45
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,480
Let's go.

46
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,240
Okay.

47
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,760
Professor Ren, if I get caught and jailed,

48
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,560
could I ask you to do my medical examination?

49
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,880
In my life, I didn't choose Jansi.

50
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,080
She's your daughter.

51
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,640
Okay.

52
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,560
Then I'll go apologize to them.

53
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,080
I'll kneel down and kowtow to them.

54
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,520
I'll give them all my money.

55
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,120
As long as they can let me go,

56
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,200
let me take care of my Jansi.

57
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,120
Why would you let them let you go?

58
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,640
Didn't Cheng Ying hit your daughter?

59
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,080
Isn't she dead?

60
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,800
What else can I do?

61
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,760
If you give them all your money, what will you use to save your daughter?

62
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,320
As long as she's alive,

63
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,440
I can sell my house and my body.

64
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,640
There's always a way.

65
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,640
Okay.

66
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,760
Okay, okay, okay.

67
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:12,320
Professor Ren, you're so kind and kindhearted.

68
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,840
Can you take in our daughter?

69
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,200
I can do anything.

70
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,120
I used to be an accountant. I can be a receptionist.

71
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,600
I can also clean and do cleaning work.

72
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,040
As long as you can take in our mother and daughter,

73
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,400
I can do anything.

74
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,040
You're going to jail soon.

75
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,800
How are you going to work here?

76
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,520
Do you have any relatives at home?

77
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,000
Call them quickly.

78
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,080
What if the police take you away?

79
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,080
How am I going to deal with your daughter?

80
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,680
You should make a decision quickly.

81
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,280
What do you think I should do?

82
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,280
I'm going to jail.

83
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,280
I'm going to be a police officer.

84
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,680
I'm going to jail.

85
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,480
If I die,

86
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,680
I won't even have someone to entrust my daughter to.

87
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,680
No.

88
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,080
Cheng Ying is still alive.

89
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,280
Get up.

90
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,280
She's still alive.

91
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
She's still alive.

92
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,680
I just went to see her. She's still alive.

93
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,480
She's still a little sick.

94
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,080
She's still alive.

95
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
She's still alive.

96
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,480
She's still alive.

97
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,680
As long as I'm here, it's up to me if she's still alive or not.

98
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,880
Professor Chen,

99
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,280
I beg you.

100
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,680
I beg you to consider my daughter's sake.

101
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
You must save her.

102
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,880
Okay. Okay. Get up. Get up.

103
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
Come. Come. Come.

104
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,080
Be careful.

105
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,080
Come.

106
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,880
Be careful. Be careful.

107
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,080
Do you still hate me?

108
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,880
From sadness to happiness,

109
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,080
do you have any feelings?

110
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,080
I'm asking you.

111
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,880
When you were in love with someone and left,

112
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,280
did you ever think of going with him?

113
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
When a person dies,

114
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
there's nothing left.

115
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
Your hatred and grudges

116
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,280
have no origin.

117
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,280
You said you wanted to leave.

118
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,680
What about Jian Xi?

119
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,080
Okay.

120
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,680
Today, the worst thing in your life

121
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,080
has passed.

122
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,080
Anger is a secret in your heart.

123
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,680
As long as you get angry,

124
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,080
you are your own effort.

125
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,680
In fact, you're forgiving others

126
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,680
just to return to your original self.

127
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,080
You don't have anything.

128
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,480
You still have Jian Xi.

129
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,280
Right?

130
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,680
Right?

131
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,280
Have you found your child?

132
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,480
You've been putting your main energy

133
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,680
in the lawsuit,

134
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,480
money, and curse.

135
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,480
What about Jian Xi?

136
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,080
I'll go find her.

137
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,480
I must save Jian Xi.

138
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,880
So, you must put all your energy

139
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,080
in the most important thing.

140
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,480
When you got angry,

141
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,480
you forgot about Jian Xi.

142
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,280
If you didn't have the power to help you,

143
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,280
what would happen

144
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,880
if the wheel fell?

145
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,080
You're forgiving others

146
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,880
just to return to your original self.

147
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,480
The most important thing is to let go.

148
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,680
You must be hungry.

149
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,080
Jian Xi hasn't eaten yet.

150
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Right.

151
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,480
Jian Xi hasn't eaten yet.

152
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,280
She is not dead yet.

153
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,760
Every child has to be resurrected.

154
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,680
Explain everything to Jian Xi.

155
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,480
No need to explain.

156
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,780
Don't 😊

157
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,880
Do not stand on her side.

158
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,680
I'll tell him.

159
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,880
Let her go first.

160
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,480
Boss.

161
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,000
Do you want to go somewhere?

162
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,000
Of course.

163
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,000
I've got some important thing.

164
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:39,720
Again,

165
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,200
let's be fast to the elevator for a while

166
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,040
and then go out again.

167
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,080
No problem.

168
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,640
Boss?

169
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Excuse me a moment.

170
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,380
כΒόρανη공φή

171
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,400
I'm Jae Oops.

172
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,600
Hello.

173
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,560
Jun Da.

174
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,720
Yes,

175
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,800
I have something to you for a favor.

176
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,400
Thank you for today.

177
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,720
It's nothing.

178
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,080
I found a job.

179
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,440
Can you

180
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,640
tell them

181
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,360
I work in the clinic?

182
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:19,020
I have a

183
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,240
I tell them I have.

184
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,120
You want me to lie?

185
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,960
I tell you,

186
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,520
I never lie.

187
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,720
I can't lie for you.

188
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,560
You know,

189
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,680
there are ten lies

190
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,360
behind a lie.

191
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,040
If you want something,

192
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,880
you must fight for it.

193
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,160
You can't use your power.

194
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,680
Understand?

195
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,000
I see.

196
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,320
Sorry that I'm late.

197
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,120
I don't recognize your dress.

198
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,600
What…

199
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,520
What dress?

200
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,200
I don't like mayonnaise.

201
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
The roasted duck is the best.

202
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,160
I forgot that you're vegetarian.

203
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,120
The roasted chives and pork

204
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,480
are also delicious.

205
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,920
Don't order for me.

206
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
I've been waiting for you

207
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,280
mainly to refuse you in person.

208
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,920
The relationship between us

209
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,840
has ended.

210
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,120
Okay, that's it.

211
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,800
What are you doing?

212
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,080
Give me back my bag.

213
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,600
You...

214
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,360
You can keep the bag

215
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,240
in my place first.

216
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,240
After the class is over,

217
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
I'll give it back to you.

218
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,160
Madam.

219
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,600
Give me ten skewers of...

220
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,840
Roasted pork and pork waist.

221
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,800
And one more skewer of

222
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,120
roasted mushrooms and chives.

223
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,280
Okay?

224
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,040
Okay.

225
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,080
Didn't I tell you

226
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,360
not to order for me?

227
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,640
I don't eat junk food.

228
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,000
Order for me.

229
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,040
It's delicious.

230
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,560
It's a pity that you didn't eat it.

231
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,320
I told you in advance

232
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,640
that I would come here

233
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,440
today

234
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,440
mainly to consider

235
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,640
coming closer to your hospital.

236
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,240
But it won't be the next time.

237
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,440
Yes.

238
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,560
But in my limited

239
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,440
life and economic background,

240
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
I can still open a restaurant

241
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,280
at this time.

242
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,680
It's not a bar.

243
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,360
It's a barbecue stall.

244
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:52,960
Bar?

245
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,680
It's too noisy.

246
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,880
It's not suitable for class-rehearsal.

247
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,920
Can't you

248
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,080
change the time?

249
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,200
I'll come back

250
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,200
to rehearse at night.

251
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,200
I'll come back to rehearse at night.

252
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,160
I'll come back to rehearse at night.

253
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,200
I'll come back to rehearse at night.

254
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,240
I'll come back to rehearse at night.

255
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:03,840
Then I can go to the clinic

256
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,280
on my day off.

257
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,120
Let me start.

258
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,680
You eat

259
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,960
such a heavy oil

260
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,120
and salt food at midnight.

261
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,880
Is your lifestyle

262
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,360
so unhealthy?

263
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,640
You and you

264
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,920
are both healthy.

265
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,400
You are a doctor.

266
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm a Chinese.

267
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,280
But you are in the Chinese medicine class

268
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,520
with me.

269
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,400
The Chinese medicine is focused on health.

270
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,480
Health is before treatment.

271
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,480
According to your Chinese theory,

272
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,000
at this point,

273
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,280
you should put your phone in the living room,

274
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,760
lie on the bed and be a director.

275
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,640
If you want to help me

276
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,640
make up for my bad habits,

277
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,680
I can only

278
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,720
repay you

279
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,880
by this way.

280
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,440
What about this one?

281
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,560
We focus on

282
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,280
the relationship between the heart and the soul.

283
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,600
The human history says

284
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,760
that if we

285
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,720
do our best to keep our health,

286
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,440
we can only

287
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,360
achieve 10% of our health.

288
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,240
The remaining 40% of our health

289
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,320
comes from

290
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,920
the spiritual level.

291
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,280
The health of the soul

292
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,880
is the most important thing.

293
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,840
Look.

294
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,880
Am I right?

295
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,800
The Chinese medicine and the Western medicine

296
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,160
are finally agreed.

297
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,680
It doesn't matter what the medicine is.

298
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
If I die,

299
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,760
I'll die without a surname.

300
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,400
It's not the surname you're talking about.

301
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,800
It's the surname of the mood,

302
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,360
the surname of the spirit,

303
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
the surname of the heart,

304
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,200
and the surname of the energy level

305
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,920
and the surname of the life.

306
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,480
The inner spirit says

307
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,320
that the body is like a god

308
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,000
and a healthy body.

309
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,440
It's not only the body of the body,

310
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,600
but also the body of the heart,

311
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,320
which is sweet and weak

312
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,160
and has a spiritual inner hand.

313
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,200
What I'm talking about

314
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,560
is the surname.

315
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,320
The teacher said it last time.

316
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,720
Language is the external language of thought.

317
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,960
No, it's the extension.

318
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,040
What do you think

319
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,080
of all these thoughts?

320
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,920
I'm just teaching you.

321
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,560
It seems that you don't want to learn it.

322
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,440
Let's end it.

323
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,640
You're angry.

324
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,400
Aren't you a lawyer?

325
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,840
Aren't you a Chinese doctor?

326
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,160
Emotions are only beneficial to people

327
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,160
when they are harmful.

328
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:21,960
You can't treat people with personal emotions

329
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,320
when you're in a lawsuit.

330
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,920
What Chinese doctors pay attention to

331
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,880
is the joy, anger, sadness, and happiness

332
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,440
to keep the loyalty.

333
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,200
How is it?

334
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,160
I'm good at it, right?

335
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm not angry.

336
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,640
I just want to go back

337
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,880
to sleep and get a beauty sleep.

338
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,760
Okay, okay, okay.

339
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,720
I'm sorry.

340
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,200
I'm sincerely sorry.

341
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,800
You're a good teacher and a good student.

342
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,240
It's not easy for me to come to you.

343
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,200
I'm sorry.

344
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,960
I'm not a good student.

345
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,560
Otherwise,

346
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,640
I wouldn't come to study Chinese medicine.

347
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,520
Why?

348
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,600
I've learned a lot of things before.

349
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,600
Every class is excellent.

350
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,760
But I still don't understand

351
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,240
the meaning of life.

352
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,080
I used to work hard to become excellent

353
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,240
to make my mom happy.

354
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,400
I worked hard to make money

355
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,600
to make my mom happy.

356
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,360
But when my mom left,

357
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,200
I suddenly realized

358
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,440
that working hard to make money and being excellent

359
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,960
is meaningless.

360
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,480
Pi Yi.

361
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,200
So,

362
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,640
my goal

363
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,240
is to get a good matter

364
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,720
as my aim to work hard.

365
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,360
I want to prove my status

366
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,400
to you.

367
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,840
The course is a mess.

368
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,480
If you Brilliant whereas I Linked

369
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,960
We will enter the main course,

370
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,200
so tomorrow.

371
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,760
Don't try to comfort me.

372
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,440
When I'm in trouble,

373
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,600
my audience is all emotional.

374
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,520
I can't.

375
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
You're painting me.

376
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,400
I'm not that capable.

377
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,600
You're so stubborn.

378
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,600
You're eating such a trashy meal

379
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,680
in the middle of the night.

380
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,080
I'm lucky.

381
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,160
I'm open-minded.

382
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,480
I can afford to put down.

383
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,360
This is the root of health.

384
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,400
Open-minded.

385
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,840
You're picking thorns in our Chinese medicine class.

386
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,520
You even fight with the patients' families.

387
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,200
How do you know everything?

388
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
How do you know

389
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,560
that I'm the undercover?

390
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,640
It's not a secret.

391
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,480
The teacher knew it the first day you came.

392
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,400
You looked at your phone in class.

393
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,840
You were always busy.

394
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,400
To be honest,

395
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,400
the teacher asked me to come

396
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,760
to tutor you today.

397
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,200
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here

398
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,440
with you.

399
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,920
The teacher knew it?

400
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,840
Of course.

401
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,640
Then why did she ask you to tutor me?

402
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,600
The teacher

403
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,280
put her and the class

404
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,120
in the microscope

405
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,000
to show you.

406
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,280
The doctor saw the illness of life.

407
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,360
The Chinese doctor saw the illness of people.

408
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,520
You can pick thorns in the class.

409
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,120
But the teacher

410
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,600
wants to cure you.

411
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,160
Madam.

412
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,800
Bring me a bottle of yogurt.

413
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,840
Okay.

414
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,840
I want the sugar free one.

415
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,280
Okay.

416
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Why are you here?

417
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,320
Are you following me?

418
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,120
You...

419
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,200
Do you know how to play this?

420
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,920
I know a lot.

421
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,080
Wait.

422
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,440
It's cool.

423
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,840
I want to learn it.

424
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,680
You want to learn how to skate?

425
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,440
Yes.

426
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,200
You want to learn it?

427
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,880
Yes.

428
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,320
I don't want to teach you.

429
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,640
If you don't teach me,

430
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,560
I'll go back and tell your parents.

431
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,400
I'll tell your grandparents.

432
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,520
I'll tell them that you're playing

433
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,840
this kind of dangerous project.

434
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,800
It's dangerous.

435
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,200
It's fatal.

436
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,400
I'll go back and tell them.

437
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
You want to learn it?

438
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
You want to tell the teacher?

439
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,360
Go ahead.

440
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,520
You can tell me after you finish it.

441
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,920
It's okay.

442
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,840
I'm a parent.

443
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,160
No one cares about me.

444
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,800
But some people are different.

445
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,520
You're the treasure of their heart.

446
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,160
If your grandparents know it,

447
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,240
they'll scold you.

448
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,480
They'll say you're a bad mouth.

449
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,800
They'll say you're a man.

450
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,640
Stop.

451
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,640
Stop.

452
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,160
I'll teach you.

453
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,400
But you have to swear.

454
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,560
You know everything.

455
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,760
You can't tell anyone else.

456
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,520
I swear.

457
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,120
I won't tell anyone else.

458
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,520
If you play this,

459
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,800
you'll never have enough food.

460
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,600
Good enough.

461
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,360
I promise.

462
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,520
When did you teach me?

463
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,320
I made it with the medicine.

464
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,280
What medicine?

465
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,720
Bye.

466
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,480
Teach me.

467
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,680
You're welcome.

468
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,960
Hello.

469
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,840
Hello.

470
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,520
Madam.

471
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,360
I want a delivery.

472
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,680
312, Xiaoming.

473
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,920
312, Xiaoming.

474
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,000
312, Xiaoming.

475
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,240
Thank you, aunt.

476
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,040
You're welcome.

477
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,800
Hello, aunt.

478
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,560
Hello.

479
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,440
What's wrong?

480
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,000
Well,

481
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,320
power outage again.

482
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,400
What's going on?

483
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,280
What's going on?

484
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,400
Why is it power outage again?

485
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,680
Power outage again.

486
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,520
Why is it power outage again?

487
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,640
Sorry.

488
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
Open the door.

489
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,200
Go away.

490
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,000
Open the door.

491
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,080
Power outage again.

492
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,160
Coming.

493
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,400
Coming.

494
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,160
You're using a scarf again.

495
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,960
A scarf.

496
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,560
You can't use it.

497
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,120
You're making dumplings.

498
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,040
Sorry, aunt.

499
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,040
I'm hungry.

500
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,080
I won't do it again.

501
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,920
I'll never do it again.

502
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,560
Okay?

503
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,800
I've told you many times.

504
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,720
Try it.

505
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,200
Who are you?

506
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,760
Why are you here?

507
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,040
Aunt.

508
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,280
You're here.

509
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
Where do you live?

510
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,560
I found a cheap

511
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
place.

512
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,640
I can live in it for about 30 days.

513
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,720
Can you take a shower?

514
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,920
Why would I?

515
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,560
I can live in a good place.

516
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,320
You'd better not talk to me.

517
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
I'll find you a place.

518
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,960
See?

519
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,600
You'll move this bed

520
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,400
into the warehouse when you sleep at night.

521
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,840
It's not appropriate.

522
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,640
What's wrong with it?

523
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,080
I'll take care of it.

524
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,960
Besides, you're so stubborn.

525
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,680
If I were you,

526
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,680
I'd be a doctor in this hospital.

527
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,440
I'd solve the problem of survival first.

528
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,880
We're different.

529
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,560
I've been in this hospital

530
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,000
for ten years

531
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,760
like those nurses.

532
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,000
I've got my own clinic.

533
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,760
Can anyone take care of me?

534
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,200
You know

535
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,840
our industry

536
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,840
is only worth it

537
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,760
after we grow up.

538
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,640
You're different.

539
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,320
If you're born with the antidote,

540
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,480
if you grow up in a famous family,

541
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,560
which teacher you worship

542
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,080
is the top in the industry.

543
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,960
As for me,

544
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,280
I can only say

545
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,160
which teacher has a crush on me.

546
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,720
I'll learn from him.

547
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,360
After five years,

548
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,320
maybe I'll be able to do it alone.

549
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,080
You tell me.

550
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,760
If I can't

551
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,640
take care of my family,

552
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,800
what should I do?

553
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,040
So, this free chance

554
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,440
to learn from my teacher

555
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,400
is for someone like me.

556
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,120
This is the key to the clinic.

557
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,200
Just remember

558
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,760
to move the bed

559
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
before you go to work.

560
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,680
Okay.

561
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,320
You don't thank me?

562
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,360
Thank you.

563
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,000
You're welcome.

564
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,080
Why did you give me money again?

565
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,800
I was in a clinic with my grandpa

566
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,760
and earned some money.

567
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,360
Of course I should share the good things with my friends.

568
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,720
Your grandpa is in a clinic and he still gives you money?

569
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,480
Yes.

570
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,800
It's all mine.

571
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,200
We've discussed it.

572
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,440
As long as I'm willing to follow him,

573
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,360
he'll give me a raise.

574
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,320
I'll take my leave then.

575
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
You're welcome.

576
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,280
Mr. Ren.

577
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,560
What are you two doing here?

578
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,120
We're cleaning.

579
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,640
You're cleaning

580
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,880
and not taking anything?

581
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,320
I'll go now.

582
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,480
Mr. Hu.

583
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,240
Mr. Hu.

584
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,880
Young man.

585
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,720
How is it?

586
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,240
Did you receive the invitation?

587
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,640
I received it yesterday.

588
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,880
This year,

589
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,120
Mr. Zhang is the chairman of the reputation.

590
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,320
You're the senior.

591
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,800
You're the main guest.

592
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,920
I still want to give Huang Weijia

593
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,320
a chance to be the successor.

594
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,880
Give the successor a chance.

595
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,080
Who are you going to bring with you?

596
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,320
I want Tianzhen,

597
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,760
Li Quan

598
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,120
and Sun Tou.

599
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,600
He's the one

600
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,880
I like.

601
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,680
Who are you talking about?

602
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,480
Sun Tou is the successor of Jiang's Zhen Sect.

603
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,520
He's in that position.

604
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,560
He has to go no matter what.

605
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,640
I'm afraid

606
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,240
he'll embarrass Zhong Zhen.

607
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,040
This is Zhong Zhen's first time.

608
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,400
He's the one

609
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,600
who will judge you

610
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,480
and Zhong Zhen.

611
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,200
It's his business.

612
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,960
It's his business

613
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,920
to be the successor.

614
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,400
It's my business

615
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,800
to bring him or not.

616
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,240
Everyone has their own responsibility.

617
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,240
It's simple.

618
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,960
You're not involved in the case.

619
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,440
I'm the principal

620
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,760
to take part in this case.

621
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:16,960
You should

622
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,680
put my school

623
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,720
and those stupid people

624
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,480
in the same place.

625
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,960
They'll think we're loyal.

626
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,760
Don't forget.

627
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,960
I'm in this position for you.

628
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,560
You should consider my embarrassment.

629
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,240
That's your business.

630
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,040
Well...

631
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,240
It's everyone's business.

632
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,480
Everyone's business?

633
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,280
Yes.

634
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,600
How depressing.

635
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,600
You're so annoying.

636
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,720
Mengmeng,

637
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,360
This marmer

638
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,000
will bring각 bad fuls

639
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,760
to theko.

640
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,400
Look.

641
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,480
Good?

642
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,840
Wu Jun's

643
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,200
This one...

644
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,560
He needs tournament.

645
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,720
You're so funny.

646
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,280
Well,

647
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,520
will Jian Xi

648
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,720
have a check-up the day after tomorrow?

649
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,360
Why are you here today?

650
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,160
We're not only here today.

651
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,920
We'll come every day.

652
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,280
What do you mean?

653
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:27,880
Wait.

654
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,920
I mean, Miss,

655
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,000
there are some things

656
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,640
you need to think about.

657
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,000
Don't be nervous.

658
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,640
I'm not here to fight.

659
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,080
I'm here to help.

660
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,240
I told the professor that

661
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,840
I used to be an accountant.

662
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,960
From today on,

663
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,800
I'll be a doctor in our clinic.

664
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,320
I'm officially working here.

665
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,680
Really?

666
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
I've never heard of it.

667
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,080
You'll be there every day.

668
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,320
Then...

669
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,720
Then you won't look for me?

670
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,680
I will.

671
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,200
I've asked someone to ask.

672
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,960
I'll leave as soon as I get news.

673
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,920
In the meantime,

674
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,040
my Jian Xi...

675
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,920
It's okay.

676
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,920
Mengmeng.

677
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,760
Mengmeng.

678
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,800
Mengmeng.

679
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,320
It's okay. Go.

680
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,480
Come here.

681
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,640
Mengmeng.

682
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,920
Mengmeng, come here.

683
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,960
I'm not here to fight.

684
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,080
Look.

685
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,720
I scared you that day.

686
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,680
No.

687
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,320
No.

688
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,080
Yes.

689
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,480
I'm not here to fight.

690
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,080
It's okay.

691
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,840
Don't be afraid.

692
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,800
Zhu Xia, you're here.

693
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,640
Dr. Sun.

694
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,960
Don't be afraid.

695
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,000
Let me tell you.

696
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,600
Get up.

697
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,120
Yes.

698
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,040
This is...

699
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,200
This is not good.

700
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:37,920
Take this.

701
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,760
Let me see.

702
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,360
Yes.

703
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,560
Mengmeng likes to draw.

704
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,600
It's not good.

705
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,000
I'll leave this to you.

706
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,280
I'll do it.

707
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,360
Don't worry.

708
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,400
Meiqi.

709
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,680
Dr. Song.

710
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,040
You've improved a lot.

711
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,000
What's this?

712
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,520
You're not good at it.

713
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,080
You're really good.

714
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,600
Look at Mengmeng.

715
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,760
She's drawing so well.

716
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,940
Dr. Song

717
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,980
It's by reverse.

718
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,340
We see some death.

719
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,060
Am I cute?

720
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:46,760
No.

721
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,080
Medical Education

722
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,000
in medicine.

723
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,280
So this is the difference between

724
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,240
Chinese medicine and Western medicine.

725
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,640
So I think

726
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,120
Western medicine's future development

727
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,400
should be

728
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,680
to the best of its ability.

729
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,200
So what about Chinese medicine?

730
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,400
Chinese medicine should be

731
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,840
to the best of its ability.

732
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,480
Today we are going to talk about

733
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,960
in modern society,

734
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,400
what is the biggest loss?

735
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,880
What is it?

736
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,680
It's the loss of people.

737
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,880
Du Wei,

738
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,480
do you know who is the

739
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,080
top in our Chinese medicine industry?

740
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:46,880
Who?

741
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,680
Ren Xinzheng.

742
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,680
Professor Neng?

743
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,480
He's quite famous.

744
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,280
What?

745
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,280
He's in your company?

746
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,280
We've been friends for years.

747
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,280
He's teaching in our school now.

748
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,880
He's the head of the research

749
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,480
and he's the treasure of our area.

750
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
Teaching in the class?

751
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,080
We're going to build

752
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,480
a top-class

753
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,680
Chinese medicine talent training center here.

754
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,560
The projects of the city's

755
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,080
state-of-the-art research and development

756
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,880
are not in the direction of investment.

757
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,880
Moreover,

758
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,080
the school is the way to expand

759
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,480
in the last century.

760
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,880
It's hard to say.

761
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,880
How long do you think

762
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,080
we can do this?

763
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,280
It's hard to say.

764
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,680
We're just thinking.

765
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,280
We're just thinking.

766
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,680
We can learn for free.

767
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,280
We've invited

768
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,080
a lot of top-class people to teach us.

769
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,680
Once the news spreads,

770
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,680
if you want to work in the Chinese medicine industry,

771
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,280
you can come to me.

772
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,880
It's not like you're in the Chinese medicine circle.

773
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,280
We can say it with our eyes.

774
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,480
I'm the business school of Chinese medicine.

775
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,480
The school has learned hundreds of thousands of moves.

776
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,880
It's free here.

777
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,280
Can you compete with me?

778
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,080
People have emotions.

779
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,680
They have hatred.

780
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:08,880
It's annoying.

781
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:09,880
What should we do?

782
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,880
Take a look.

783
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,480
Is it okay to take the medicine?

784
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,080
Obviously not.

785
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,680
What should we do?

786
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,280
The Chinese medicine is good.

787
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,680
The happiness is in the stomach.

788
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,480
But,

789
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,480
we're not the Bodhisattvas in the temple.

790
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,680
If you have a grudge,

791
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,280
you must say it.

792
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,480
The following sentence is

793
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,680
called

794
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,880
the end of the end.

795
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,280
We've known

796
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,880
that our emotions are out of the middle.

797
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,880
We've hurt our body.

798
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,680
What should we do?

799
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,880
We can still

800
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,680
adjust it.

801
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,480
Let's talk about

802
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,080
how to adjust

803
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,880
our bad emotions.

804
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,680
Chinese culture

805
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,680
is a time-traveling skill.

806
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,120
The Taoist

807
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,840
is a good thing.

808
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,080
If the culture

809
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,240
has no effect of painting,

810
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,240
how can it be related to culture?

811
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,640
What should we paint?

812
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,240
What?

813
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,840
What are we painting?

814
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,840
We're painting the negative emotions.

815
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,440
If a person

816
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,640
has negative emotions,

817
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,840
you must use action to paint it.

818
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,840
Escaping and delaying

819
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,640
will cause great harm to the body.

820
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,640
I think your thinking pattern

821
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,440
is a little problematic.

822
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,040
I agree with Mr. Liu.

823
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,880
You must

824
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,400
stay in the first place.

825
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,200
Then you can make Internet home.

826
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,000
The money is from the people around you.

827
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,800
The medicine and medicine transactions,

828
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,600
online bookings,

829
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,200
and the mutual recommendation of Zhong Xixi.

830
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,000
These are all projects for making money.

831
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,800
The biggest advantage of this school

832
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,000
is the 17, 27, 37

833
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,600
of Huangpu Military School.

834
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,600
That's right.

835
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,400
This idea is good.

836
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,600
If you organize it and pull it out,

837
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,360
it's a complete plan.

838
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,360
This is the most valuable thing in the Chinese medicine world.

839
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:25,560
Yes.

840
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,960
It's a day in your place.

841
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,560
Your original area will be full of play.

842
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,360
That's right.

843
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,760
Another important thing is

844
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,160
not to talk about the profit model.

845
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,960
If we talk about the profit model,

846
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,360
it's not a small project.

847
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,960
Don't talk about the vision.

848
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,760
Talk about the ideal.

849
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,960
Like Musk.

850
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,360
Talk about the fire of the people.

851
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,760
The world is not going to be built.

852
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,760
The passion of the big and old.

853
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,920
If you talk about the ideal,

854
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,320
you are not suitable.

855
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,320
Think about it.

856
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,520
In the past,

857
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,120
people would definitely think

858
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,520
that your corporate culture

859
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,120
is not about the ideal,

860
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,520
but money.

861
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,720
Professor Ren is right.

862
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,920
If he talks about the ideal,

863
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,920
the whole world will believe him.

864
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,120
Well,

865
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,120
we have a four-a-month meeting next month.

866
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,720
You invite Professor Ren here

867
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,720
to tell everyone

868
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,320
the vision of Chinese medicine development.

869
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,880
Let's talk about the rest.

870
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,680
I think it's

871
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,280
very suitable.

872
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,680
It's settled.

873
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,080
Let's go.

874
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,880
Hello, Professor Ren.

875
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,280
Today is the day you have a re-診.

876
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,640
I have finished my class.

877
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,840
Why haven't you arrived yet?

878
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,640
Actually, I have been there.

879
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,840
At the door of my classroom,

880
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,040
I heard the emotional class you taught.

881
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,240
I feel so happy.

882
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,400
My mood seems to be

883
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,240
all cleared up.

884
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,640
I feel my disease is all cured.

885
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,440
Congratulations.

886
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,840
Thank you, Professor Ren.

887
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,040
I'm here!

888
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,640
Where's the skateboard?

889
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,240
Where's the skateboard?

890
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,840
You don't have any illness.

891
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,460
Why are you here?

892
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,240
Are you here to have food?

893
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,520
Today

894
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,920
I came back.

895
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,440
Why is parties and dances

896
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,240
always drunk?

897
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,440
Ca matar?

898
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,240
No...

899
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,720
I'll teach you first.

900
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,560
I mean, you guys,

901
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,280
why do you like

902
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,560
this kind of things?

903
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,000
You're so happy to be called your master, right?

904
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,080
Are you childish?

905
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,200
You have to be famous in the world.

906
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,520
Since I promised to teach you,

907
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,000
I must be serious.

908
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,840
Otherwise, one day, you...

909
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,880
If I'm embarrassed

910
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,640
and make trouble outside,

911
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,080
I'll kick you out, okay?

912
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,800
It's a deal.

913
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,280
It's a deal.

914
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,520
Okay.

915
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,240
So numb.

916
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,600
What?

917
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,200
There's a trick to drink wine.

918
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,000
Look.

919
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,760
This is the good wine

920
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,320
my grandpa has been collecting for years.

921
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,000
It's absolutely good.

922
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:39,800
How is it?

923
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,560
Is it interesting?

924
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,360
It's strong.

925
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,880
It must be.

926
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,800
Don't be greedy.

927
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,560
Please.

928
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,000
Brother,

929
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,440
Brother,

930
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,960
we can't just drink here.

931
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,440
Although you're not sensible,

932
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,480
it's not appropriate.

933
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,920
Can you be more careful?

934
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,360
My time is very expensive.

935
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,120
You've been waiting for these lines.

936
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,760
I can't focus on it.

937
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,520
Pass it onto me.

938
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,040
Okay.

939
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,920
Why are you still so determined

940
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,760
of this uniform?

941
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,720
As for me,

942
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,800
it's done by Taobao,

943
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,360
the exclusive spit box for commentaries.

944
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,480
From head to toe.

945
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,780
One set costs 55 CCPR,

946
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,720
the dayoking collection series.

947
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,640
By the way,

948
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,200
if we count the cash dollars

949
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:36,960
for the tots in one attempt,

950
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,480
it's 80中共R.

951
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,320
Really?

952
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,560
You're also shopping for Tao'sy Openure?

953
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,640
I'm not going.

954
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,640
By the way, let me tell you.

955
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,600
During the break,

956
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,480
we have to stop

957
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,560
our regular classes.

958
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,680
Why?

959
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,080
Are you going on a trip?

960
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,920
I'm going to join the Chinese-Japanese forum.

961
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:55,640
But...

962
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,440
I don't think you're in the forum.

963
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,960
Besides, they won't ask

964
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,920
a half-wit, half-baked, half-baked person

965
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,920
to join.

966
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,040
This time,

967
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,280
I'm invited by the organizer.

968
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,280
Why?

969
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,560
Why are you asking me?

970
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,200
The organizer is an old friend

971
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,400
of mine who has been

972
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,280
a customer for many years.

973
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,160
I'm going to

974
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,360
bother the customers

975
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,160
and join the forum.

976
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,960
I think you're going to

977
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,320
support the forum.

978
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,280
Take me with you.

979
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,480
Those who work as undercover like me

980
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,520
have to be in the old school

981
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,760
to be able to see the bottom.

982
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,320
Take me with you.

983
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,200
You're an adult.

984
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:29,960
You're not easy to deal with

985
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:30,920
except for one person.

986
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,680
Besides,

987
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,680
there are many ways to go.

988
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,280
I've seen the schedule.

989
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,080
You have to go up the hill

990
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,000
before dawn.

991
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,280
You must go on the night road.

992
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,760
What if you meet a bear

993
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,760
or a fight?

994
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,760
The most important thing is

995
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,040
it's a long road.

996
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,680
You have to change your driving style.

997
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,600
As a bato manufacturer,

998
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:17,880
there are rules that

999
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,440
the idea of building a car

1000
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,640
may be misrepresented

1001
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,880
in the day light,

1002
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,880
I'm sorry.

1003
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,880
I'm sorry.

1004
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,880
I'm sorry.

1005
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,880
I'm sorry.

1006
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,880
I'm sorry.

1007
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,880
I'm sorry.

1008
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
I'm sorry.

1009
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,880
I'm sorry.

1010
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,880
I'm sorry.

1011
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,880
I'm sorry.

1012
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,880
I'm sorry.

1013
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,880
I'm sorry.

1014
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,880
I'm sorry.

1015
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,880
I'm sorry.

1016
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,880
I'm sorry.

1017
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,880
I'm sorry.

1018
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,880
I'm sorry.

1019
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,880
I'm sorry.

1020
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,880
I'm sorry.

1021
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,880
I'm sorry.

1022
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,880
I'm sorry.

1023
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,880
I'm sorry.

1024
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,880
I'm sorry.

1025
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,880
I'm sorry.

1026
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,880
I'm sorry.

1027
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,880
I'm sorry.

1028
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,880
I'm sorry.

1029
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,880
I'm sorry.

1030
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,880
I'm sorry.

1031
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,880
I'll light up your life.

1032
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,880
The people in the light are just ordinary identities.

1033
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,880
Light up the ordinary people's souls with ordinary bodies.

1034
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,340
Burn the passion of the

1035
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,880
one-shot gun.

1036
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,880
Use one sentence,

1037
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,880
we are only in this world.

1038
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,880
The people in the light are just ordinary identities.

1039
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,880
Light up the ordinary people's souls with ordinary bodies.

1040
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,880
Burn the passion of the

1041
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,880
one-shot gun.

1042
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,880
Use one sentence,

1043
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,880
we are only in this world.

1044
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,880
The people in the light are just ordinary identities.

1045
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:57,880
Light up the ordinary people's souls with ordinary bodies.

1046
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,880
Burn the passion of the

1047
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,880
one-shot gun.

1048
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,880
Use one sentence,

1049
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:06,880
we are only in this world.
