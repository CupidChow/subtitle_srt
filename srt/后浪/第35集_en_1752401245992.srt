00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Wait for me.

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Marry me.

6
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I miss who lives in the dream.

7
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Maybe it's the first time I've been so attached to you.

8
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The stars in the sky, the stars in the sky,

9
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
look at the beautiful stars.

10
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
At that time, it was not so beautiful.

11
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You guys planted either grass or medicine.

12
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Do you remember I gave you a bouquet of flowers?

13
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You were staring at it.

14
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I let you smell it.

15
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You look a little disliked.

16
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I did it on purpose.

17
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What are you doing? It's late.

19
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Come here.

20
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Why are you suddenly here today?

21
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Sit down.

22
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What are you looking at?

23
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's warm.

24
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What does it mean?

25
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's not for girls to be at home.

26
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's for you to be at home.

27
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm not at home.

28
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm at home.

29
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm at home.

30
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm at home.

31
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm at home.

32
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm at home.

33
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm at home.

34
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm at home.

35
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm at home.

36
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm at home.

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You can't not clean your house every day.

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You have to wash your feet no matter how busy you are.

39
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You think I'm a bad cook?

40
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
How dare you?

41
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I can't even love.

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The mountain won't save me.

43
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll go to save the mountain.

44
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Can you do it?

45
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
They even hugged a shoe.

46
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's about hygiene.

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You won't be so motherly in the future, will you?

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Tao Tao.

49
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Actually, when I celebrated your birthday that day,

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I haven't said anything yet.

51
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No.

52
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You are not lonely.

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I will make up for it slowly for you,

54
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
family,

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and lover.

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I brought you some clothes to change.

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Remember to wipe and change in the room of Xue Qing Qing.

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll get the dirty clothes tomorrow.

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You just dislike me.

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Tao Tao.

61
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We girls

62
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
should live a more delicate life.

63
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
A more delicate life.

64
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What if we have a daughter in the future?

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What if we miss you?

66
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Then I'll keep you, dad.

67
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay.

68
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
you really don't go home to live?

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
There are live broadcasts in the hospital.

71
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I can't go home.

72
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I can't go home.

73
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I can't go home.

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You are a nurse in the city.

75
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You should live a more stable life when you go home.

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You should be more energetic the next day.

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I have to take this position.

78
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If master doesn't let me go home, I won't go home.

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Master can't let you stay here for 24 hours.

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
People always have to eat and sleep.

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You listen to master and listen to your husband.

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Why are you here again?

83
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Then we change positions in the city.

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
No.

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I don't believe others.

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Do you believe me?

87
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll change with you.

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't believe it.

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You are good with Zhao Li Quan.

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
If he wants to go in, you can't pull it off.

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You still don't believe Li Quan

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
no matter what he does.

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't believe it before I figure out the truth.

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But don't worry.

95
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I've made a deal with Rubeika.

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
He will come to me three days.

97
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You don't believe me even you believe Rubeika?

98
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Rubeika is such a person.

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Either he doesn't agree.

100
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Or he will do good if he agrees.

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He is a bad person.

102
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Even the flies will fly to you.

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Go.

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You will be jealous of your dad later.

105
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You will be jealous of Rubeika later.

106
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You said you were a vinegar jar or a vinegar jar in your previous life.

107
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You still don't believe me?

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You look like a bottle of water.

109
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You are trying to be strong, aren't you?

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'll give you some.

111
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No.

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,400
The

113
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I tell you,

114
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
you didn't learn the calligraphy well.

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You didn't even find the point of the acupoint.

116
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Move up a little.

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Here?

118
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Move up.

119
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes.

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yes.

121
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Tao Tao.

122
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I have a very important thing to ask you.

123
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What?

124
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What's wrong with Liu Zihong?

125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You know about me and him?

126
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Tao Tao.

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I like you.

128
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I don't like you.

129
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
No.

130
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I really like you.

131
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I really don't like you.

132
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Liu Zihong.

133
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I tell you.

134
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You haven't got married yet.

135
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The house is ruined.

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm not a boyfriend.

137
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Look at me.

138
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
No.

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm not a boyfriend.

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I...

141
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
If I were in love, I would never hide it.

142
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Fans are audience, not God.

143
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I made the choice.

144
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I will bear the consequences.

145
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You've grown up.

146
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Then...

147
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You promised me.

148
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Who promised you?

149
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I tell you.

150
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll treat you as my brother.

151
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Actually, I don't have a brother.

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We're not familiar at all.

153
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't talk about this to me.

154
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I don't care. I just like you.

155
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I just like you.

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I just like you.

157
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I...

158
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You're lying, Liu Zihong.

159
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I told him today that you're my girlfriend.

160
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You're so shameless.

161
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Why are you like this?

162
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm shameless.

163
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Give it to me.

164
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm shameless.

165
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Are you stupid?

166
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
What's wrong with him?

167
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Is he a fool?

168
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
No.

169
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Then why do you two

170
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
come to you when he's free?

171
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Why do you let him vote for you?

172
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
No.

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I asked him to tie me up.

174
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He didn't allow me to come.

175
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
He just came to see me.

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But I told him.

177
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I made it clear.

178
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He won't come to see me again.

179
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What did you say?

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I said,

181
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
you're the only one in my heart.

182
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I can't stand anyone else.

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But you're so careless.

184
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Does he know you don't take a shower for three days?

185
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Does he like you?

186
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I...

187
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What does it have to do with

188
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
me not taking a shower for three days?

189
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
He doesn't take a shower for seven days.

190
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
How do you know?

191
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I smelled it.

192
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I took a bite.

193
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Come on.

194
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
No.

195
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Smell it.

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Come on.

197
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Feel it.

198
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
There's more.

199
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Hurry up.

200
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm not afraid at all.

201
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
How is it, dear?

202
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Is Professor Wu okay?

203
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Is he okay?

204
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Everything is normal.

205
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The signs he's made now

206
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
are all developing well.

207
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So you don't have to worry too much.

208
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Mrs. Wu.

209
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Mrs. Wu.

210
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Mrs. Wu.

211
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Okay.

212
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Tao Tao.

213
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Is Shan Tao awake?

214
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
How is he?

215
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Not yet.

216
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Has Mr. Wu woken up today?

217
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
He's still very weak now.

218
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
He needs enough sleep.

219
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Don't worry.

220
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Tao Tao.

221
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
According to what you said,

222
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
no one has ever seen Mr. Wu

223
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
wake up except you.

224
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Right?

225
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Are you lying to me?

226
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
No.

227
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Tao Tao has been taking care of him.

228
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Why would he lie to us?

229
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Maybe he's showing off his skills.

230
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
No.

231
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The doctor said yesterday

232
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
that Shan Tao will be fine

233
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and he will get better soon.

234
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yes.

235
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The patient who just recovered

236
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
is like this.

237
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I've met patients like him before.

238
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yes.

239
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Mr. Wu is seriously injured.

240
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
He needs to rest.

241
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But I've checked his muscle

242
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and his eyes.

243
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But he didn't recover

244
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
from any other cases.

245
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Tao Tao said

246
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Professor Wu can talk.

247
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Enough.

248
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Don't talk nonsense.

249
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
How about this?

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Let's have a shift tonight.

251
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's too tiring

252
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
to let someone

253
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
take care of him alone.

254
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's easy to have hallucinations.

255
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'll switch shifts with you tonight.

256
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't agree.

257
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Tao Tao, your uncle is awake.

258
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
He's awake.

259
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
He's awake.

260
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
We can't let so many people in.

261
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's too crowded.

262
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
This is a serious room.

263
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
We have a shift.

264
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
We have to check the students.

265
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
We know your mood.

266
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
We know your mood.

267
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Just add some people in.

268
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Others can't go in.

269
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm telling you.

270
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
We are adding people in.

271
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
We are adding people in.

272
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Wu Shandao.

273
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Wu Shandao.

274
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Look.

275
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
He's regained consciousness.

276
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Wu Shandao.

277
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Do you know who I am?

278
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You are

279
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
a friend of mine.

280
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yes.

281
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm not only your friend,

282
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
but also your doctor.

283
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
How do you feel now?

284
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Are you okay?

285
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Come on.

286
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Shake hands.

287
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It seems that

288
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
you still have a long way to recover.

289
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I think

290
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
you can go to

291
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
the general hospital now

292
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and recover after a while.

293
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Thank you.

294
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Thank you.

295
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Thank you, Director Li.

296
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Don't be too excited.

297
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Let him have a good rest.

298
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Come on.

299
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Let's go.

300
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
He's awake.

301
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
He's awake.

302
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He's in pain.

303
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's okay.

304
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Don't cry.

305
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's okay.

306
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's okay.

307
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You've worked hard.

308
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's okay.

309
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Miss.

310
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Director Li.

311
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Come on.

312
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Come on.

313
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You're here, too.

314
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Director Li.

315
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Are you Toto?

316
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yes.

317
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You're so filial.

318
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Your uncle

319
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
has woken up.

320
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Your hard work is not in vain.

321
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Now,

322
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
your consciousness

323
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
hasn't fully recovered.

324
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You don't know him very well.

325
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But it's already

326
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
a good start.

327
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Don't cry.

328
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Congratulations.

329
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Thank you.

330
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Sir.

331
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
No wonder people say you're a spy.

332
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I think

333
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
you're a big shot.

334
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
No matter what happens,

335
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
as long as you want,

336
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
you can pull people

337
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
back from the ghost gate.

338
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Toto, you heard

339
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
what Director Li said, right?

340
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He's joking with me.

341
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Director Li.

342
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Look, it's been a long time.

343
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's all your

344
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Western-style colleagues taking care of you.

345
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
We dare not be greedy.

346
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm telling the truth.

347
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Why do we need to be loyal?

348
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
After the surgery,

349
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
we don't have much to do.

350
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
We have to rely on

351
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
you as a good student.

352
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You're so well-educated.

353
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
No wonder you like him so much.

354
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Thank you, Dr. Li.

355
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Can I take my master

356
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
to see him now?

357
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yes.

358
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Let's go.

359
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Wait a minute.

360
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I just told the nurse

361
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
to transfer Headmaster Wu

362
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
to the special care ward.

363
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The bridge is better than the ICU.

364
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You can go there.

365
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Okay.

366
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Thank you.

367
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Wu.

368
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Shan Dao.

369
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Wu.

370
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Shan Dao.

371
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Wake up.

372
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Open your eyes and look.

373
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Look who's here to see you.

374
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Come on.

375
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
This way.

376
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
This is Mom.

377
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Shan Dao.

378
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Old man.

379
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The county government is here to see you.

380
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Look.

381
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
This is your mother.

382
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Shan Dao.

383
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Old man.

384
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The county government is here to see you.

385
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Look.

386
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And this.

387
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
This is Sun Tou Tou.

388
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
She has been taking care of you

389
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
all this time.

390
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
She's so good.

391
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Li Quan.

392
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Come on.

393
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Shan Dao.

394
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You're Li Quan, right?

395
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Come and see.

396
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Ms. Wu.

397
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You recognize me, right?

398
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Don't be excited.

399
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Li Quan is so good.

400
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
She comes to see you every day.

401
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Be good.

402
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Don't be excited.

403
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Hello.

404
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Hello.

405
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm Tou Tou's boyfriend.

406
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm looking for Tou Tou.

407
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Tou Tou's boyfriend?

408
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yes.

409
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Here's the thing.

410
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I brought her something.

411
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And you can't send her to the hospital.

412
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Let her come down and get it.

413
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Okay.

414
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Thank you.

415
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You're welcome.

416
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Tou Tou's boyfriend is so good to her.

417
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yes.

418
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I said she must have saved the world in the past life.

419
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
She even said to me that

420
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
it's nothing.

421
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Just normal.

422
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Then tell her.

423
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'll heat the rice.

424
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Okay.

425
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Tou Tou.

426
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Your Ye Ban Ban is waiting for you downstairs.

427
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
No.

428
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Didn't she just leave?

429
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Why is she here again?

430
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Go.

431
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
She must have brought you something again.

432
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Okay. I got it.

433
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Thank you.

434
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Okay.

435
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Ye Ban Ban

436
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Ye Ban Ban

437
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Ye Ban Ban

438
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Madam.

439
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Coming.

440
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Ye Ban Ban

441
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Ye Ban Ban

442
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Ye Ban Ban

443
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Ye Ban Ban

444
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Ye Ban Ban

445
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Ye Ban Ban

446
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Ye Ban Ban

447
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Ye Ban Ban

448
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Ye Ban Ban

449
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Ye Ban Ban

450
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Ye Ban Ban

451
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Ye Ban Ban

452
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Ye Ban Ban

453
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Ye Ban Ban

454
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Ye Ban Ban

455
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Ye Ban Ban

456
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Ye Ban Ban

457
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Mr. Wang.

458
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What's up?

459
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You want to come back again?

460
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
How long have you been in the hospital?

461
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm not used to it.

462
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Okay.

463
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Go in.

464
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Wait.

465
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Excuse me.

466
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I'm here.

467
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Hello, Tianzhen.

468
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Are you in the hospital?

469
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
No.

470
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Okay. I got it.

471
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Hello.

472
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Hello.

473
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Hello.

474
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Hello.

475
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Hello.

476
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Hello.

477
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Hello.

478
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Hello.

479
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Hello.

480
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Hello.

481
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Hello.

482
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Hello.

483
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Hello.

484
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Hello.

485
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Hello.

486
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Hello.

487
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Hello.

488
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Hello.

489
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Hello.

490
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Hello.

491
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Hello.

492
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Hello.

493
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Hello.

494
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Hello.

495
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Hello.

496
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Hello.

497
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Hello.

498
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Hello.

499
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Hello.

500
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Hello.

501
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Hello.

502
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Hello.

503
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Hello.

504
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Hello.

505
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Hello.

506
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Hello.

507
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Hello.

508
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Hello.

509
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Hello.

510
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Hello.

511
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Hello.

512
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Hello.

513
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Hello.

514
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Hello.

515
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Hello.

516
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Hello.

517
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Hello.

518
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Hello.

519
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Hello.

520
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Why are you in the hospital?

521
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
No one wants to see me.

522
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
No one wants to see you.

523
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Anyhow,

524
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
it's not my fault.

525
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm making a mistake.

526
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm not upset.

527
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm not upset.

528
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I don't know what to do.

529
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,280
Didn't you say we can't separate?

530
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,360
What's wrong with you?

531
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,240
What's wrong with me?

532
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,800
What are you talking about?

533
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,880
I don't understand.

534
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,920
What's wrong with you?

535
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,920
I'll check the surveillance footage later.

536
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,240
Everything is going well.

537
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,040
Now,

538
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,280
you go out with me.

539
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,080
You can check it.

540
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,720
You can only see

541
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,800
the picture of you and those nurses

542
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,080
playing with each other.

543
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,320
Check it.

544
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,680
Boss, what's wrong?

545
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,800
The nurse just

546
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,120
called the police for the checkup.

547
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,000
What's going on?

548
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,520
Everything is normal.

549
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,600
The person you're looking for

550
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,840
is already trapped in your eyes.

551
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,080
I feel so sad.

552
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,360
The fate that we just had just met.

553
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,360
What I mean by

554
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:49,880
the circle is that

555
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,640
Professor Wu must be in trouble.

556
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,760
That's great.

557
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,520
No.

558
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:53,880
Tao Tao.

559
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,440
Brother.

560
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,320
Go away.

561
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,120
How is Miss Wu?

562
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,880
Can you recognize her?

563
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,400
You can talk to her, right?

564
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:02,840
I heard that

565
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,920
the key was in the

566
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,720
patient's stomach.

567
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,360
The blood in the brain is like a flood.

568
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,600
It will flood the brain

569
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,040
and make it blurry.

570
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,400
After many people wake up,

571
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,280
they either lose their memory

572
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
or become speechless.

573
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,760
So, how is

574
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,480
Professor Wu?

575
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,080
No.

576
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,400
Did you make an appointment?

577
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,960
So many people are here today.

578
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,320
And you know that

579
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,040
there are not many people

580
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,200
in the special room.

581
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,960
Li Quan asked us to come here.

582
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,320
He said that he came to see Professor Wu yesterday

583
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,760
and he was much better.

584
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,000
So, we came here

585
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,200
to visit him.

586
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,840
Yes.

587
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,120
Li Quan asked us to come here.

588
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,960
Well,

589
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,920
there are too many people here.

590
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,200
I suggest you go back first.

591
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,000
We will make an appointment

592
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,080
one by one.

593
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,920
When the appointment is done,

594
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,000
you can come to the hospital.

595
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,400
Come on.

596
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,200
Stop it.

597
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,880
Tao Tao.

598
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,720
Tao Tao, how is it?

599
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,360
What's going on?

600
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,640
Why are there so many people here?

601
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,440
You are...

602
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,080
We are here to see Professor Wu.

603
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,280
Thank you.

604
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,240
I thank you on behalf of President Wu.

605
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,680
Tao Tao.

606
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,520
They are going to go in

607
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,600
and see him for a few minutes.

608
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,680
I think he should be fine.

609
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,280
Why did you call everyone here?

610
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,040
What for?

611
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,120
Professor Wu is awake.

612
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,720
As his student,

613
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,080
shouldn't we come and see him?

614
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:12,840
Yes.

615
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,640
Everyone can see him.

616
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:16,960
You can't.

617
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,920
Do you have any manners?

618
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,200
Mrs. Shen is still here.

619
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,480
Can you talk to her?

620
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,760
What's wrong?

621
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,640
Is there a misunderstanding between you two?

622
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,320
Mr. Shen.

623
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,360
I don't let him in

624
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,960
for the sake of Uncle.

625
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,120
You believe me, right?

626
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,040
What do you mean?

627
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,200
Mrs. Shen.

628
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,600
You don't know.

629
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,720
Tao Tao can't tolerate me.

630
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,960
Everyone knows

631
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,160
Tao Tao is the boss here.

632
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,080
I have pleaded with him several times

633
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,840
to go to his class

634
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,760
to see Professor Wu.

635
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,200
He didn't agree.

636
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,120
I think I should take his prestige.

637
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,560
Why?

638
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,440
But you should know

639
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,840
Li Quan is not that kind of person.

640
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,000
He is the one who should be rewarded.

641
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,680
Zhao Yi Quan.

642
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,200
Master asked me to guard this door today.

643
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,720
I have to guard it.

644
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,960
You can say whatever you like.

645
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,560
But you can't come in.

646
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,600
Tao Tao.

647
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,120
Everyone likes to see the teacher.

648
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,560
How about this?

649
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,520
We line up one by one, okay?

650
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,160
Yes.

651
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,600
We line up one by one.

652
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,120
Okay.

653
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,920
We line up one by one.

654
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,360
Be quiet.

655
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,120
And

656
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,000
Mr. Shen and Mr. Peng go in first.

657
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,680
After Mr. Shen and Mr. Peng come out,

658
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,800
we will hand in the invitation, okay?

659
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,000
Okay.

660
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,840
Let's go.

661
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,400
Mrs. Shen.

662
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,320
Let Li Quan have a look.

663
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:31,960
Well.

664
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,520
He is very anxious.

665
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,280
He went to pick me up in the morning.

666
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,160
He told me a lot.

667
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,400
Li Quan is not anxious.

668
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,160
He came here last night.

669
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,720
He almost killed Uncle Shen.

670
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,760
What do you mean?

671
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,520
What do I mean?

672
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,720
You know it clearly.

673
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,920
Tao Tao.

674
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,240
It's serious.

675
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,400
How can he say that

676
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,920
he killed Uncle Shen?

677
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,280
What's going on?

678
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,280
Tao Tao, I told you.

679
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,000
It's all your fault.

680
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,880
I don't want to fight with you.

681
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,120
Just let me in and have a look.

682
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,720
Okay?

683
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,360
If anything happens,

684
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,240
it's on me.

685
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,000
I...

686
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,640
I'm in your care now, right?

687
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,320
Can I come in?

688
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,080
Zhao Li Quan.

689
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,040
Can you stop acting pitiful?

690
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,200
You act like I'm bullying you.

691
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,840
Okay.

692
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,920
You want to go in, right?

693
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,800
Okay.

694
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,840
Then as Mr. Shen

695
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,720
and his team,

696
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,640
explain to me.

697
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,640
Why did you come here

698
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,480
in the middle of the night?

699
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,960
Why did you come here

700
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,160
when you saw the monitor?

701
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,520
Okay, I'll explain.

702
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,000
I'll explain to you.

703
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,200
I came here last night

704
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,920
to see Mr. Wu.

705
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,160
Just one look.

706
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,400
Tao Tao, don't.

707
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,840
Tao Tao.

708
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,400
You always oppose me.

709
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,000
Don't think I don't know what I want.

710
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,640
You're just afraid that I'll expose you.

711
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,960
But I'm telling you, Sun Tao Tao.

712
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,520
I'm not that kind of person.

713
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,720
Even if I know your secret,

714
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,320
I won't expose you.

715
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,480
What secret?

716
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,880
What secret do I have that I'm afraid you'll expose me?

717
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,640
Zhao Li Quan.

718
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,360
I'm honest.

719
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,200
I'm not afraid of you.

720
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,360
I represent my master,

721
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,640
I represent the Chinese and English schools.

722
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,360
I have to keep this door.

723
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,280
But you.

724
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,120
Although I don't know what you want to do,

725
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,320
I can't get away with this.

726
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,360
But I'm not in a hurry.

727
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,440
Don't worry.

728
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,960
When I wake up,

729
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,240
everything will be clear.

730
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,560
Let's go.

731
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,040
What are you?

732
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,800
You represent your master, you represent the Chinese and English schools.

733
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,680
Why do you pretend to be a successor?

734
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,560
I don't expose you.

735
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,720
You're showing me my face.

736
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,080
Showing me my face.

737
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,880
Don't you understand?

738
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,000
You're fake.

739
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,680
You're a fake.

740
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,320
Your parents don't know where you are.

741
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,160
You're not a successor of Jiang Shizhen.

742
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,760
You're just a wild child.

743
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,080
Wild species.

744
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,880
Zhou Lichun.

745
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,720
What are you talking about?

746
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,000
You don't deserve to stand here.

747
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:01,660
Small Mediterritorial

748
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,760
You're just a cyborg.

749
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,240
You�re faking this.

750
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,760
I,眾美 愛 旦,

751
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,640
was the founder of Jiang Shizhen.

752
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,800
My mother died

753
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,400
from manera infatigue.

754
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,880
I was the GrandWAY.

755
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,240
My master told me about this.

756
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,640
Zhou Lichun,

757
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,760
where did you find all these materials?

758
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,160
Come on.

759
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,120
Sincere doctor!

760
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,360
Let me tell you.

761
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,920
Mr. Wu gave this to me,

762
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,240
with his own hands.

763
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,440
He also told me

764
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,120
the identity of the liar.

765
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,480
Listen,

766
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,480
maybe your father was part of this too.

767
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,840
Now do you know

768
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,840
why Toto

769
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,840
won't let me go to help Mr. Wu?

770
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,360
Because he's scared that Mr. Wu would be alright.

771
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,800
and he revealed his secret.

772
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,000
I'll kill you!

773
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,760
Don't!

774
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,520
Don't move!

775
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,440
Don't move!

776
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,040
Don't!

777
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,560
Don't!

778
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,560
Don't move!

779
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,040
I'll kill you!

780
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,040
Listen,

781
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,960
I saw you

782
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,560
with Uncle An last night!

783
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,560
Because I saw him,

784
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,240
he went to destroy the things.

785
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,560
He was a fraud!

786
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,800
He was a fraud!

787
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,080
If I told you

788
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,320
a lie,

789
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,600
you'd be beaten to death.

790
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,320
I didn't lie!

791
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:23,760
Don't move!

792
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,400
You're not a fraud.

793
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,360
You're just a child.

794
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,680
You don't deserve to be here.

795
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,520
You do!

796
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,560
Sun Tuo is indeed

797
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,240
not a descendant of Jiang's Sect.

798
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,720
But no one is more qualified

799
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,480
than him to stand here.

800
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,240
Because she's my daughter.

801
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,680
Say it again.

802
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,360
That's my daughter.

803
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,380
Miss Ren,

804
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,720
let's Prawn hp

805
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,120
before you speak again!

806
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,800
Keep your voice down!

807
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,360
You're my daughter now.

808
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:42,780
Are you saying that you'll sensing a

809
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,860
something actually

810
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,340
somehow

811
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,720
they will think

812
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,900
It's not

813
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,900
I'm not that kind of person.

814
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,900
But if this is true,

815
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,900
at that child's age,

816
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,900
he's younger than Tianzhen.

817
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,900
That's a marriage.

818
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,900
Impossible.

819
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,900
What should we do about this?

820
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,900
If Shan Dao is fine,

821
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,900
he can explain and beat Yuan Chang.

822
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,900
But look at him now.

823
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,900
Do you want to

824
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,900
tell Master and Master's Mother

825
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,900
about this?

826
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,900
Don't talk too much.

827
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,900
I'm not talking too much.

828
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,900
It's a big deal.

829
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,900
If it's true,

830
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,900
we can't hide it.

831
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,900
We have to know it sooner or later.

832
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,900
It's important who tells him.

833
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,900
Lan and I have been friends for so many years.

834
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,900
I know him.

835
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,900
He definitely won't tell Master.

836
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,900
But if this is true,

837
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,900
it may affect their family.

838
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,900
Sister Yilan's personality

839
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,900
must be that she has done everything

840
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,900
and told Master.

841
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,900
If that's true,

842
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,900
everything will be too late

843
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,900
and it will be a deadlock.

844
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,900
Shen Xing,

845
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,900
we haven't figured out

846
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,900
our family's situation.

847
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,900
You have to take care of

848
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,900
other people's family affairs.

849
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,900
I feel really bad

850
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,900
that Shan Dao is lying on the bed

851
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,900
like this.

852
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,900
But he's a good person.

853
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,900
But he's a good person.

854
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,900
He still has hope.

855
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,900
I'm just thinking

856
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,900
if I meet

857
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,900
something like this,

858
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,900
I don't know what I'll do.

859
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,900
It's not a deadlock.

860
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,900
You have to go through it one by one.

861
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,900
Mother,

862
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,900
I think you have to help

863
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,900
when you can.

864
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,900
Master Song

865
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,900
is a man with a bright future.

866
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,900
Now is the critical moment.

867
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,900
We need him

868
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,900
to take the big picture.

869
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,900
How about

870
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,900
I go and tell him?

871
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,900
Then I'll go to the bathroom.

872
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,900
Go.

873
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,900
What's the matter?

874
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,900
I'm not going to the bathroom.

875
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,900
I'm going to the bathroom.

876
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,900
Shan Dao,

877
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,900
it would be great if you woke up.

878
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,900
You can solve

879
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,900
everything.

880
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,900
Good girl, you have to listen to the story.

881
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,900
Look, we're all

882
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,900
standing here

883
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,900
and playing the wind.

884
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,900
Come on,

885
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,900
go home with your parents.

886
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,900
Come on.

887
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,900
Look,

888
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,900
she doesn't listen to me.

889
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,900
Tell me, will you persuade her?

890
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,900
I don't.

891
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,900
I'm a woman too.

892
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,900
I know women's hearts.

893
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,900
If the heart is hurt,

894
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,900
it will never come back.

895
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,900
Ji, don't make trouble.

896
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,900
This family is not enough.

897
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,900
You can't be a man.

898
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,900
Say something good.

899
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,900
Don't say something sad.

900
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,900
By the way,

901
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,900
isn't it

902
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,900
time to talk about

903
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,900
the winter solstice?

904
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,900
The winter solstice

905
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,900
health soup hasn't been cooked yet.

906
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,900
It's time.

907
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,900
You're still talking about soup.

908
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,900
In life,

909
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,900
no matter how many obstacles there are,

910
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,900
every obstacle

911
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,900
has to be overcome step by step.

912
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,900
This has nothing to do

913
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,900
with the mood.

914
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,900
For example, Si Maqian,

915
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,900
even if he is punished,

916
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,900
he still has to

917
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,900
go through the winter solstice

918
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,900
and the winter solstice.

919
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,900
Otherwise,

920
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,900
how can he have a chance?

921
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,900
What's wrong with drinking less soup?

922
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,900
What's wrong with having one more child?

923
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,900
It's okay.

924
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,900
Just a little bit of fun.

925
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,900
Go back.

926
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,900
Go to the open room with Xing Zheng.

927
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,900
I'll stay here with my daughter.

928
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,900
Good girl, be good.

929
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,900
Master.

930
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,900
You should do

931
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,900
what you should do.

932
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,900
It's late.

933
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,900
Has the winter solstice been opened this year?

934
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,900
I'll open it right away.

935
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,900
Master.

936
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,900
I believe you.

937
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,900
I'll give you the position.

938
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,900
I'll give you my daughter.

939
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,900
I've never doubted myself.

940
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,900
It will be the same in the future.

941
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,900
This is the end.

942
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,900
Thank you, master.

943
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,900
I'll go back.

944
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,900
I'll go back.

945
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,900
I'll go back.

946
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,900
Mom, you should go back too.

947
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,900
I won't go back.

948
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,900
You're like this.

949
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,900
You're like this.

950
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,900
You're like this.

951
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,900
Mom.

952
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,900
I just don't understand

953
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,900
why she treated me like this.

954
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,900
Actually,

955
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,900
I'm not angry.

956
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,900
I just feel

957
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,900
very disappointed.

958
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,900
You know, when I...

959
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,900
When I went to see her,

960
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,900
she took her eyes off me.

961
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,900
I felt

962
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,900
our hearts

963
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,900
were so far away.

964
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,900
I...

965
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,900
There will be some youth

966
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,900
that has nothing to do with hatred

967
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,900
There will be some people

968
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,900
like the stars in the long night

969
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,900
Time is silent

970
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,900
and the memories are remembered

971
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,900
Every moment, every minute

972
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,900
is warm and equal

973
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,900
Life is short and if there is no pain

974
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,900
I'll light up a city for you

975
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,900
The people in the light

976
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,900
are just ordinary people

977
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,900
With ordinary body

978
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,900
illuminate ordinary people

979
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,900
The soul of the pain

980
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,900
The people in the light

981
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,900
are just ordinary people

982
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,900
With ordinary body

983
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,900
illuminate ordinary people

984
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,900
The people in the light

985
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,900
are just ordinary people

986
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,900
The soul of the pain

987
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,900
The people in the light

988
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,900
are just ordinary people

989
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:27,900
The people in the light

990
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,900
are just ordinary people

991
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,900
With ordinary body

992
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,900
illuminate ordinary people

993
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,900
The soul of the pain

994
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,900
is ignited by the passion

995
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,900
We use one sentence

996
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,900
to cure the coldness of this world

997
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,900
The people in the light

998
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,900
are just ordinary people

999
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,900
The soul of the pain

1000
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,900
is ignited by the passion

1001
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,900
We use one sentence

1002
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,900
to cure the coldness of this world

1003
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,900
The soul of the pain

1004
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,900
is ignited by the passion

1005
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,900
We use one sentence

1006
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,900
to cure the coldness of this world
