The Long Ballad

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Episode 18

5
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,800
You don't want to do our business anymore, right?

6
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,200
Do you know that this is called taking over assets?

7
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm also very lazy.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,600
I've been nagging her all morning.

9
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,800
Who did you sell it to? Find it back.

10
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,600
The key now is that you don't know who you sold it to.

11
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:48,780
You're not a

12
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,980
I'm not.

13
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,780
You're the one who's weird.

14
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,780
This matter really has nothing to do with me, right?

15
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,980
I even...

16
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,780
Old Ma, let your friend go ask around.

17
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,380
You have to get it back.

18
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,180
Your heart is also dark enough. Just give me ¥100,000.

19
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,780
You're really...

20
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,780
I don't want to talk about you.

21
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,780
I don't want to talk about you.

22
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,780
I don't want to talk about you.

23
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,780
You really are a good person. I don't want to talk about you.

24
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,380
Then what's the whole thing you made for me?

25
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,780
What?

26
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,980
What matter?

27
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,780
The whole thing.

28
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,180
You really can't get rid of it easily.

29
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,980
Teacher Zhang,

30
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,980
that card of my son,

31
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,780
this time, it really got lost.

32
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,580
It really got lost this time?

33
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,780
Then what about the previous few times?

34
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,780
I... I don't know.

35
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,980
Came home and got it back.

36
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,380
But what about now,

37
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,580
I'm the one who's been after it.

38
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,480
I also want to because of these things.

39
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,180
I'm getting married.

40
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,180
This spouse of yours, where's your whereabouts?

41
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,980
Where did you go yesterday?

42
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,180
I have no idea.

43
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,880
You can tell me if I'm right.

44
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,180
BR nimmt

45
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:51,820
y

46
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,180
Act innocent

47
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,820
You are already Twenty-seven, eight years old

48
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,860
When can you live like a person

49
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,780
How important is the card for you

50
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,420
It's a family of generations

51
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,780
console you

52
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,300
Karin

53
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,740
You can't say nothing

54
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,020
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,300
Where did you go yesterday?

56
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,820
Tell me the truth.

57
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,980
Xing Chen,

58
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,820
a child shouldn't be too anxious.

59
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,860
You should give him some time to grow up.

60
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,220
Everyone has different

61
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,100
points of view.

62
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,260
A young man like you

63
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,220
has little sense of justice.

64
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,820
I'd rather be naive

65
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,780
and sit in the cold chair for ten years

66
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,620
before he can be fully mature.

67
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,620
Master,

68
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,300
can I ask you for a favor?

69
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,140
I'm his son.

70
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,260
Don't you think so?

71
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,580
I don't want him to be fully mature.

72
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,140
I'm afraid he won't be mature.

73
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,900
I only have one son.

74
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,780
I hope you and your parents

75
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,420
can be honest

76
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,260
and be honest with each other.

77
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,580
Your father is right.

78
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,500
Be honest.

79
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,860
Admit your mistake.

80
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,100
Don't be so careless in the future.

81
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,660
Mom,

82
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,940
it's not about being careless.

83
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,180
You're a son.

84
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,380
You don't even know your son's age.

85
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,020
I'm 25 years old.

86
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,340
I'm not 28.

87
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,420
And if you don't care about me,

88
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,020
you can scold me.

89
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,060
In your dream of being a great man,

90
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,540
which part of me

91
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,980
is the heir of the Yuren family?

92
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,100
What's up?

93
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,540
I took his card.

94
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,620
What's he doing with your card?

95
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,460
I sold it in the pawnshop.

96
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,460
I need money to bring it.

97
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,780
What for?

98
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,620
I used to send the courier

99
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,420
and I played cards with them.

100
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,380
Later on,

101
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,500
I owed my father a lot.

102
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
I owe you a lot of money.

103
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,700
I saw that brand

104
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,260
and thought it was very valuable.

105
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,900
So I took it.

106
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,740
Master, I committed a crime again.

107
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,500
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,620
Why don't you punish me?

109
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,700
I'll figure out a way

110
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,500
to redeem that brand.

111
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,940
You're so reckless.

112
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,660
Get out of here!

113
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,580
Xiao Feng,

114
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,180
youint counselors are so cautious.

115
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,500
You're such a follower.

116
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,220
But my student

117
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,340
hasn't done their homework.

118
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,020
I feel I have missed my class

119
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,180
so much.

120
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,140
You're cheap.

121
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,140
But if you go something new,

122
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,620
they won't avoid you.

123
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,940
I didn't go.

124
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,620
It's not like what you've achieved.

125
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,620
I'll give it to him.

126
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,620
He definitely won't want it.

127
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,100
What are you doing?

128
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,300
Sit down if you're tired.

129
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,100
I'll help you lie down.

130
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,620
No.

131
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,860
I'm not tired.

132
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,660
I saw you lying down on one side.

133
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,420
Is that okay?

134
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,540
I can do it.

135
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,460
You think you're a fairy?

136
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,980
If you keep squatting like this,

137
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,060
you can't stand it.

138
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:46,660
Don't try it.

139
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,140
Can I try it?

140
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,940
Don't try it.

141
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,500
Don't try it.

142
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,420
I'll do it with you.

143
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,340
Are you stupid?

144
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,540
If your father sees this,

145
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,740
he'll know I'm a gift for you.

146
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,300
I just made a mistake.

147
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,060
How can you be so stupid?

148
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,180
You think my father doesn't know?

149
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,100
Just treat it as me practicing martial arts.

150
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,540
I can't let you practice alone.

151
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,020
I'll practice well

152
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,420
and improve my martial arts.

153
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,860
Something's going on.

154
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,380
Be careful.

155
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,940
No place to hide.

156
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,420
Members are in danger.

157
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,500
What's going on?

158
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,220
Grandpa's soup is really sufficient.

159
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,180
Grandma is getting ituated.

160
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,720
I didn't even write when I went Param PowerPoint for such a long time.

161
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,100
It's a little bit荒풀 now.

162
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,420
I'm afraid

163
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,940
I shall错睡 soon.

164
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,780
Tian Can will be careers too.

165
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,300
I don't want to

166
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,700
Let's get out of here

167
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,860
What did you say

168
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,140
Change time

169
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,300
Continue with the drama

170
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,220
What are you probably doing

171
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,940
My civilian dress

172
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,260
How do you promise me

173
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,500
let go

174
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,020
it is OK

175
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,100
You usually eat less.

176
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,100
What if I can't bear it?

177
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,580
It has nothing to do with

178
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,980
eating less.

179
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,660
You can drag the dog

180
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,740
into the house.

181
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,180
Mr. Ren.

182
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,260
Don't be angry.

183
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,020
Look.

184
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,420
The kids are

185
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,660
apologizing to you in another way.

186
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,780
You know where your son's brand is,

187
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,300
right?

188
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,740
You and your son

189
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,700
have a good understanding,

190
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,340
right?

191
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,100
He used to go out and travel every year.

192
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,820
Since you told him

193
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,180
to be self-reliant

194
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,180
and not spend money from his parents,

195
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,020
he has been

196
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,220
being selfish since then.

197
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,380
It's my fault.

198
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,980
I didn't mean that.

199
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,980
But your son didn't say anything wrong.

200
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,900
You can't even tell

201
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,860
how old he is.

202
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,340
You know what to do.

203
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,260
Listen.

204
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,700
Good kids are praised.

205
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,220
My mom is wrong.

206
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,940
She spends money like water.

207
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,860
She doesn't know

208
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,260
how hard it is for her parents to make money.

209
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,420
She didn't do anything bad.

210
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,580
She just went on a trip.

211
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,580
She read a lot of books and traveled a lot.

212
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,420
What's the point of going on a trip?

213
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,860
I can tell

214
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,260
that the old kids in the family

215
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,500
are very nice to her.

216
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,420
You should

217
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,740
tell the old kids

218
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,140
in person.

219
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,060
Anyway,

220
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,740
I'm not telling the truth.

221
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,060
Mr. Ren, you should

222
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,660
consider yourself.

223
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,220
You always say

224
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,540
you can't do what you want.

225
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,540
Your son

226
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,100
just went on a trip.

227
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,220
Right?

228
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,460
You scolded him

229
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,820
when he went on a trip.

230
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,780
He's a busy boy.

231
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,300
He doesn't know what he's doing.

232
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,860
You can't let him

233
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,860
go to work

234
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,220
as you did when he was young.

235
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,260
Besides, our family

236
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,220
has no land, right?

237
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,380
Your son is a man of dignity.

238
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,700
You know that.

239
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,180
You always scold him.

240
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,580
He dares to tell you the truth.

241
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,220
So I was wrong.

242
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,620
No.

243
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,380
I was wrong.

244
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,260
I was wrong.

245
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,540
How could you be wrong?

246
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,180
I think

247
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,780
I should be the one to blame.

248
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,820
Mr. Ren.

249
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,700
Mr. Ren.

250
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,020
You drank my tea.

251
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,340
Don't be angry.

252
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,740
I'll go and change the kids.

253
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,060
Hurry and give me the door.

254
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,140
I can get you some water.

255
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,020
Tuotuo.

256
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,740
leaned up.

257
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,660
Sweetie.

258
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,200
Yes my son

259
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,220
Mom

260
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,900
No

261
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,720
Don't think too much

262
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,540
Just Vehicle

263
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,520
Trust yourself

264
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,980
Professor

265
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,800
Yes

266
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,000
Your plan

267
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,580
Paul

268
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,960
Written on it

269
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't want it, okay?

270
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,440
I don't want the yellow one, either.

271
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,640
Okay?

272
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,840
Don't paint the pattern, okay?

273
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,120
Why did you take it for me?

274
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,880
I envy you.

275
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,080
I don't envy you

276
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,960
for getting the wind,

277
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,080
the rain, and the rain.

278
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,760
Look.

279
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,640
In this house,

280
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,640
I always fight for you.

281
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,320
If I don't have you,

282
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,200
I won't be able to

283
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
get the wind.

284
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,840
These old people

285
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,400
are so boring every day.

286
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,200
They are so annoying.

287
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,560
They are so annoying.

288
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,160
You made a little mistake.

289
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,640
Your dad is so amazing.

290
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,240
I made a big mistake.

291
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,120
Your dad can forgive me.

292
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
Do you know why?

293
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,680
Because you are an elder.

294
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,120
Because your dad loves you.

295
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,960
Your dad loves you.

296
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,960
He has hope for you.

297
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,120
I'm a good person.

298
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,560
He doesn't care about me.

299
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,760
He is just taking responsibility for me.

300
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,160
What does it have to do with you

301
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,120
being a thorn in my side?

302
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,520
Sun.

303
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,400
I don't have a father or a mother.

304
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,800
No one has hope for me.

305
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,280
But you are different.

306
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
You are the hope of your family.

307
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,240
And

308
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,640
I don't want to let my master down.

309
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,120
So you have to do it well.

310
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,000
Do you know that?

311
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,160
I have faith in you.

312
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,320
Do you understand?

313
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,320
What should I do?

314
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,480
Actually,

315
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,040
you did the right thing.

316
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
I did what you like to do.

317
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,120
I can make money.

318
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,280
What else can I do to help you?

319
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,440
But your dad is not in charge.

320
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,320
Actually,

321
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,880
both of you are good.

322
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,440
Yes.

323
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,800
Hello.

324
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,400
Mr. Ding,

325
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,600
Meng is missing.

326
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,160
Where are you?

327
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,320
Meng.

328
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,840
What happened?

329
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,640
Why can't we find him?

330
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,040
Meng and I had a fight.

331
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,000
A fight?

332
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,320
I invited my family to have a reunion dinner

333
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,600
this afternoon.

334
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
But the guest came.

335
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,200
Meng was in her room.

336
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,080
She refused to come out.

337
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,440
She didn't even say hello.

338
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,360
I went in and said a few words to her.

339
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,640
You...

340
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,160
Meng.

341
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,880
You should know that

342
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,160
Meng won't face

343
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,400
a stranger

344
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,720
or a stranger

345
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
in this situation.

346
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,720
They are all relatives.

347
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,760
She grew up with him.

348
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,640
She's not a stranger.

349
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,200
I've been looking for him

350
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,640
for a long time.

351
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,560
In order to spend a holiday with him,

352
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,520
I spent many hours with him.

353
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,520
I thought

354
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,920
it would be more fun

355
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,440
and make him happier.

356
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,360
Who knows?

357
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,880
You think so?

358
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,680
You don't know what Mengmeng wants.

359
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,120
We are human.

360
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,560
We are not random wooden dolls.

361
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,440
You don't want to put us

362
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,280
in any position.

363
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,960
We are willing to stay in any position.

364
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,760
Tianzhen.

365
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,200
I'm sorry.

366
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,920
The child is not sensible.

367
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,080
It's okay.

368
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,000
It's better to find someone to be important.

369
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,280
Okay.

370
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,560
Excuse me.

371
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,320
Have you seen this girl?

372
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,560
No.

373
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,360
Okay, thank you.

374
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:25,920
Zhang Shu,

375
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,600
did Mengmeng go to your place?

376
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,600
Aunt Yang,

377
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,120
did Mengmeng go to your place?

378
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,520
She's been here for a while.

379
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,400
I didn't see her.

380
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,160
Help me find her.

381
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,000
Okay.

382
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,520
Okay.

383
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:54,960
Hello?

384
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:13,880
Hello?

385
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,000
Did you find Mengmeng?

386
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,080
No.

387
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,960
I've searched everywhere I can.

388
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,880
If I can't find her, call the police.

389
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,200
Don't panic.

390
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,480
Mengmeng had a fight.

391
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,280
After the fight,

392
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,120
she must have gone to

393
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,400
a place she feels safe.

394
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,400
Where does she feel safe?

395
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,600
I know where she is.

396
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,200
Tangедa's Children's Use Center

397
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,760
Do you find him?

398
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,160
Has Chen Zhen not come back yet?

399
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,000
No.

400
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,880
How is it?

401
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,360
Why did you come back by yourself?

402
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,120
You didn't find him?

403
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:38,960
Did you find him?

404
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,680
Stop it.

405
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,640
Wang Mom.

406
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,000
Come out.

407
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,880
It's okay.

408
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,760
It's okay.

409
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,880
I remember.

410
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,400
The first day, he hid there.

411
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,000
Let's go.

412
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,480
I'll call his parents.

413
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,640
I'm sorry.

414
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,320
I'm sorry.

415
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,160
I'm sorry.

416
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,040
I'm sorry.

417
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm sorry.

418
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,760
I'm sorry.

419
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,600
I'm sorry.

420
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,440
I'm sorry.

421
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,240
It's okay.

422
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,840
It's okay.

423
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,480
It's okay, Mom.

424
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,080
After you call,

425
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,560
we'll have a family meeting.

426
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,440
Tou Tou.

427
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,520
Take Meng Meng to her room.

428
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,560
Don't come out.

429
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,120
I'm not going to the family meeting.

430
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,200
Mom.

431
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,320
Meng Meng and Tou Tou

432
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,400
are also our family members.

433
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,920
Let's have a meeting together.

434
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,960
No.

435
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,160
The family meeting I mentioned

436
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,440
is not related to the family.

437
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,560
Ling Lan.

438
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,000
I know what you're thinking.

439
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,360
What should we do?

440
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,360
Xing Zheng.

441
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,080
Tomorrow,

442
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,760
you send Xu Meng away.

443
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,080
We can't have

444
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,160
so many girls in our family.

445
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,480
Why?

446
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,400
He has his parents.

447
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,040
But he's adopted in our family.

448
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,960
This is strange.

449
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,040
What if

450
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,880
something happens to him?

451
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,480
What should we do?

452
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,240
It's okay today.

453
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,400
He ran out of his own house.

454
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,520
What if

455
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,560
he runs away from our house one day?

456
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,000
How can we tell our parents?

457
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,160
He lived in his own house

458
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,800
and ran away the first day.

459
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,480
If you send him back now,

460
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,120
you'll push him into the fire.

461
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,760
He won't run away from our house.

462
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,680
Everyone has their own fate.

463
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,880
He has to face

464
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,200
his family relationship

465
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,480
on his own.

466
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,960
We can't participate.

467
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,800
I disagree.

468
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,960
Meng Meng is my patient.

469
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,720
I have to be responsible for her.

470
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,080
I don't mean you can't be responsible for her.

471
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,800
But Meng Meng's disease

472
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,600
can't be cured

473
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,280
by staying in our house.

474
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,840
She has her own house.

475
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,960
I'll rent a room.

476
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,280
I'll take Meng Meng out.

477
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
How dare you!

478
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,440
You're out of line.

479
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,920
Meng Meng

480
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,280
is in a very unstable state.

481
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,920
She's not mature enough.

482
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,240
She needs a guardian

483
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,720
to keep her company.

484
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,760
Are you her guardian?

485
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,000
Can you afford to take the responsibility?

486
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,320
I'm not discussing with you today.

487
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,400
I'm telling you my decision.

488
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,200
I'll tell you my decision, too.

489
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,000
If you drive her away,

490
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,400
I'll go with her.

491
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,840
Go with her?

492
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,800
Why don't you pas土?

493
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,160
Get up.

494
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,540
Miss Cheng.

495
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,500
You play very well.

496
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,060
It's hard

497
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,060
to keep your hands warm as a person.

498
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,440
I won't hurt you.

499
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,160
Mengmeng, I...

500
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,920
You're hiding under the stairs,

501
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,800
and you're moving around.

502
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,000
Are you afraid?

503
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,400
Don't be afraid.

504
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,720
I'm here.

505
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,360
I'll protect you.

506
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,400
Mengmeng.

507
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,160
I'm here.

508
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,480
I...

509
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,640
I...

510
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,320
I...

511
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:02,920
I...

512
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,520
Well...

513
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:16,680
Ship.

514
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,640
Do you mean

515
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,160
I'm not afraid.

516
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,800
Sit here.

517
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,880
Don't be afraid.

518
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,240
I'll be here watching you.

519
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,720
I'll be here with you.

520
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,280
Draw.

521
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,640
Draw.

522
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:15,680
马琴

523
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,120
You raised a son

524
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Why are you angry?

525
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,160
Did I owe you two in the past life?

526
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,240
You tortured me so much in this life.

527
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm not obedient.

528
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,800
Why do you involve me again?

529
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,800
Look at me.

530
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,480
I scold my son every day.

531
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,720
I can tell today that

532
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,160
he can be a great man.

533
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,720
You're happy

534
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,400
to see him fight with me, right?

535
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,560
He's blind.

536
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,240
He's blind.

537
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,840
I don't believe it.

538
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,680
I've been following him for more than 20 years.

539
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,160
I'm fighting with him this time.

540
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,480
How dare he not recognize me as his mother?

541
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,640
I don't interfere with the mother-in-law's business.

542
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,160
I'm not.

543
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,320
But I remind you.

544
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,200
I won't talk about

545
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,880
the fight between mother and son.

546
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,280
It's boring to raise a son.

547
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,440
Look.

548
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,280
Don't talk.

549
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,160
I'm not talking about you.

550
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,520
I'm talking about you.

551
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,320
I'm talking about you.

552
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,320
I'm talking about you.

553
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,320
I'm talking about you.

554
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,320
I'm talking about you.

555
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,320
I'm talking about you.

556
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,320
I'm talking about you.

557
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,320
I'm talking about you.

558
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,320
I'm talking about you.

559
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,320
I'm talking about you.

560
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,320
I'm talking about you.

561
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,320
I'm talking about you.

562
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,320
I'm talking about you.

563
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,320
I'm talking about you.

564
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,320
I'm talking about you.

565
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,320
I'm talking about you.

566
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,320
I'm talking about you.

567
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,320
I'm talking about you.

568
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,320
I'm talking about you.

569
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,320
I'm talking about you.

570
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,320
I'm talking about you.

571
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,320
I'm talking about you.

572
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,320
I'm talking about you.

573
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,320
I'm talking about you.

574
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,320
I'm talking about you.

575
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,320
I'm talking about you.

576
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,320
I'm talking about you.

577
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,320
Change your footwear.

578
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,320
Old man.

579
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,320
The cup you bought today

580
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,720
hasn't been disinfected yet, has it?

581
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,720
Mr. Song said he would give it to you today.

582
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,600
I don't need it, Mr. Song.

583
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,760
Don't touch it.

584
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,200
What are you thinking about?

585
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,720
How's your foot?

586
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,400
Much better.

587
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,320
Do you need me to check it again?

588
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,920
No need.

589
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,880
Tianzhen has given me the medicine.

590
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
Look.

591
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,120
You fell down in the valley this time.

592
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,440
No one helped you.

593
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,000
What do you think of this?

594
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
I'm fine.

595
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,840
No one would potentially help me do it.

596
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,080
You're really an idiot.

597
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,000
I'm even better than you.

598
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,880
But someoneoch is here.

599
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,160
Would you help me간

600
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,120
to gather everyone to help me?

601
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,280
What should I do?

602
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,640
Help me with what?

603
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,480
Nunoten.

604
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,440
Old 41.

605
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,480
Old 41.

606
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,200
Old 91.

607
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,960
JeEt DuRand.

608
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,960
and you want to take responsibility for him.

609
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,320
If you fall into the ditch,

610
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,880
only Sun Toto will help you.

611
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,760
Other students

612
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,560
dare not touch you.

613
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,440
Sun Toto may think you're a fool,

614
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,320
but he's a friend of the broad-ranging world.

615
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,560
What do you think of this phenomenon?

616
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,000
I think

617
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,320
if a person has never read books

618
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,680
and has no professional skills,

619
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,840
he must have only

620
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,240
established himself in society

621
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,720
by working with people.

622
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,680
In fact, our legal circle is the same.

623
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,320
Some people are just friends,

624
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,640
but some

625
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,480
have very strong business skills.

626
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,400
I'm a technical talent.

627
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,440
Some people are good at

628
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,160
the art of

629
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,520
painting.

630
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,600
Toto may not have much knowledge,

631
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,520
but he likes to do it.

632
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,600
Maybe he will

633
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,400
have more experience than you.

634
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,240
Look at the first sentence

635
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,720
in the Bible.

636
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,880
When you worship Buddha,

637
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,000
you should be a good person.

638
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,360
He's not a good person.

639
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,720
He's a good person.

640
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,800
So don't look down on the lowly.

641
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,880
He may be in front of you.

642
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,520
So you'd rather take him as your disciple

643
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,040
than take me as your disciple.

644
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,400
So you want to

645
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,280
hug his thigh

646
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,080
and follow him to the heaven

647
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,120
after he gets it.

648
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,600
Is that possible?

649
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,040
Confucius said,

650
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,760
Follow the way you want,

651
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,960
Life may give advice and do good things.

652
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,680
But you shall learn from the wisdom.

653
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,640
If you study much and keep a good mind,

654
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,640
you'll be wise.

655
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,680
Tell me the truth.

656
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,520
Toto can teach

657
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:18,960
people who Bike in Kids

658
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,680
spent more time to learn

659
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,120
than you.

660
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,920
Sir,

661
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,280
I've a question.

662
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,880
Do you think Sun Si Miao

663
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,760
I'm 140 years old.

664
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,480
Can you believe it?

665
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,320
You're a student.

666
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,800
That's the purpose of being a student.

667
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,360
You came to study

668
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,160
for your education, right?

669
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,880
We're 40 years old on average.

670
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,040
I'm not

671
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,880
even 10 years old now.

672
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,920
We're too far away.

673
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,240
So you don't dare to date or get married?

674
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,920
I don't dare to have a child.

675
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,440
I'm afraid

676
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,080
if I'm gone,

677
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,560
I'll leave him alone

678
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,880
and feel lonely.

679
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,840
Do you think you're lonely?

680
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,720
You know,

681
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,160
裝蒜

682
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,760
has been in my mind

683
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,680
all the time before.

684
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:43,640
That's why

685
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,920
I make it fun to judge

686
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,640
the generality and the junto.

687
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,440
Recently,

688
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,400
I still come to understand

689
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,560
the longevity.

690
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,580
You mean it's not

691
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,000
We can live a healthy life

692
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,320
if we don't live to 100 years old.

693
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,360
Look.

694
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,800
Zhang Zhongjing is not

695
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,840
a long-lived animal.

696
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,400
Not much.

697
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,280
But I think

698
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,640
he's a long-lived animal.

699
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,840
A person's long-lived animal

700
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,720
depends on his actual

701
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,000
survival time.

702
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,440
The real long-lived animal

703
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,040
is his thoughts

704
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,320
and his character.

705
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,360
Some people miss him

706
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,600
and some people don't.

707
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,480
It means he's not dead.

708
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,800
Xiaoyang, I think

709
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,400
you're not lonely.

710
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,680
Your family is watching you.

711
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,080
If they see you

712
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,960
so helplessly,

713
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,360
they'll be worried.

714
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,400
If I were your mother

715
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,280
and saw you

716
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,720
struggling with life,

717
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,240
I'd be worried.

718
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,760
I have something for you.

719
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,440
A bookmark.

720
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,000
Why is it full?

721
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,920
It's full.

722
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
It's full and then full.

723
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,080
The process of accumulation

724
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,120
is a very hopeful

725
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,640
and exciting process.

726
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,760
But on the other hand,

727
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,560
if it's full,

728
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,240
it can never escape

729
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,920
the result of being crushed.

730
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,120
Life is like this.

731
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,000
You only care about accumulation.

732
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,080
You don't go to the bookmark.

733
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,440
You don't go to the application.

734
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,000
You'll be crushed.

735
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,280
There's a way out.

736
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,000
One sound, one sound.

737
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,080
That's the way.

738
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,200
So I give you this.

739
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,880
It's also a homework for you.

740
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,000
This bookmark

741
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,520
is all your way.

742
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,480
This bookmark

743
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,720
is my flagellum.

744
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,840
I'll tell it off to your father he1

745
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,680
and you as the official.

746
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,400
You need to know

747
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,200
how to use it.

748
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,960
If one day

749
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,360
you can help others

750
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,880
and I send you

751
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,360
a bit of cash,

752
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,480
and when the bookmark is empty,

753
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,920
you'll be my apprentice.

754
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,520
Okay, let's wait forrock這個

755
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:58,780
Okay, let's wait forrock這個

756
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,360
Aunt Song Aunt Song

757
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,960
Are you get better?

758
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,720
More better

759
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,440
Your medicine is quite good

760
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,240
Right

761
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:17,880
Great

762
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,600
We need to take the medicine

763
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,360
we made last time

764
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,600
for some more time

765
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,520
Zhu Xia

766
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,680
are you still trying to find the14

767
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,680
Find it.

768
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,960
Right now, we have a lot of information,

769
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,480
but nothing reliable.

770
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,880
I'm thinking that we will be going to the countryside to get a checkup soon.

771
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:42,360
In those remote mountains,

772
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:47,080
there are more likely to be a hundred years old.

773
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,480
I'll pay attention to it then.

774
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
Okay. Thank you, Dr. Song.

775
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,880
You're welcome.

776
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,280
Thank you, sun.

777
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,480
This is right.

778
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,280
Hello.

779
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,080
I want to rent a two-bedroom apartment.

780
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:15,080
It's best if the elevator room is close to the subway.

781
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,480
The budget...

782
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,680
The budget is around ¥6,000. The sooner, the better.

783
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,680
Right. After work, we can check the time after work.

784
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,680
Okay. Thank you.

785
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,280
You really want to take Mengmeng out?

786
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,080
My mom and I are in a relationship.

787
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,680
No.

788
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,280
Because of Mengmeng and your mom,

789
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,080
Mengmeng doesn't know where she is anymore.

790
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,880
You still have a big family to inherit.

791
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,880
You don't care about these old people anymore?

792
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,480
No. You still don't understand my mom.

793
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,280
My mom won't turn against me.

794
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,680
After a while, this problem will be resolved.

795
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,880
You're not in love with Mengmeng, are you?

796
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,080
What nonsense are you talking about?

797
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,880
Did you know this is the first time I've entered the zhuyang band?

798
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,480
It's a pity.

799
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,680
If it's the girl you want to marry,

800
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,680
it thinks she does have you.

801
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,080
When you get married to her,

802
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,080
I'll go with you to Furthermore X.

803
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,480
Let事不成刀算法

804
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,480
I'll fly away as the wind takes me away.

805
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,880
Okay?

806
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,080
I don't know about this.

807
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,080
If I didn't...

808
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,080
What action do you have against Mengmeng?

809
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,680
Don't do anything I didn't want to do.

810
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,680
Let the story seem very elegant

811
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,680
We in the sunset

812
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,680
This youth

813
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:10,680
The more it is, the more it becomes complete

814
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:16,680
Missing you

815
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:22,680
There are always people who are worth crossing the mountains and rivers to complete

816
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:27,680
You run towards the years and the stars

817
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,680
I am sure that you are that person

818
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,680
I admit that the pure heart is not so heavy

819
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:44,680
I am already trapped in your eyes

820
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:54,680
The fate of the dream just now is waiting for me

821
00:43:54,680 --> 00:44:01,680
There are always people who are worth crossing the mountains and rivers to complete

822
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,680
You run towards the years and the stars

823
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:11,680
I am sure that you are that person

824
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:18,680
I admit that the pure heart is not so heavy

825
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,680
I am already trapped in your eyes

826
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:32,680
The fate of the dream just now is waiting for me

827
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,680
The fate of the dream just now is waiting for me
