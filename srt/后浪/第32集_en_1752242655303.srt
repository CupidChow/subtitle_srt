00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,560
Well,

4
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,400
Toto

5
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,480
has been to our house

6
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,440
not long ago.

7
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,920
He hasn't celebrated his birthday.

8
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:48,840
We should

9
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,200
celebrate his birthday for him.

10
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,720
We should have a sense of ceremony.

11
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,880
At least,

12
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,120
we should know who I am,

13
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,000
where I come from

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and where I go.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,480
Right?

16
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,120
I don't need to know

17
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,400
where I come from.

18
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,240
Because

19
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,360
I really don't know

20
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,880
how long I've been born.

21
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,880
But now,

22
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,240
I know clearly

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,200
where I'm going.

24
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,800
Where are you going?

25
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,280
I'm going to work hard

26
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,360
to be a heir.

27
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,960
You're not

28
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,880
so simple.

29
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,200
A heir is so beautiful.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,560
You know,

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,240
many people

32
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,960
are so obsessed with

33
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,120
the heir.

34
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,800
President Wu,

35
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,320
you're so talented

36
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,800
and generous.

37
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,400
Isn't he more suitable

38
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,600
to be the heir

39
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,400
than you?

40
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,480
Master,

41
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,440
you're flattering me.

42
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,800
No matter how hard I try,

43
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm still a self-disciplined person.

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,360
I'm not like you.

45
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,480
You're a righteous person.

46
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,040
Look,

47
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,760
I've been working hard for half a lifetime.

48
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,640
When I look up,

49
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,080
I find

50
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,680
Toto

51
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
is on my shoulder.

52
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,120
Uncle,

53
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,160
after you said that,

54
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,160
I think you're

55
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
a little bit careless.

56
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,160
Toto,

57
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,960
you just said

58
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,440
your ultimate goal is

59
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,440
to be a heir.

60
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,760
But you have to figure out

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,480
why you

62
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,280
are the heir.

63
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,560
That's because

64
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,760
your grandma,

65
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,360
your great-grandma

66
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,040
have been

67
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,680
blessed by you for so many years.

68
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,040
Although you don't know

69
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,960
when you were born,

70
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,760
you don't know

71
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,480
where you're from,

72
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,480
it doesn't matter.

73
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,320
Your blood is here.

74
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,280
We're here.

75
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,360
The world is big.

76
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,200
We're all here.

77
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,680
Right, light the candles.

78
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,200
Come on.

79
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,200
This is my first time

80
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,000
celebrating my birthday.

81
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,240
I'm a little nervous.

82
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,320
Don't be nervous.

83
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,880
What day is it today?

84
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,280
I want to remember it.

85
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,000
You don't have to.

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,360
We'll help you.

87
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,160
In the future,

88
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,800
you'll have

89
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,640
your lover and children.

90
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,000
You'll make up for

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,160
all the regrets in the past.

92
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,000
You still have a long way to go.

93
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,360
Come on, make a wish.

94
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,200
Come on.

95
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,640
Done.

96
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,120
So fast?

97
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,960
What did you wish for?

98
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,160
To be a heir.

99
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,360
Nothing else?

100
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,520
You don't want to wish

101
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,600
a man to be happy

102
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,840
and never leave his side.

103
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,080
Life is not just

104
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,360
a matter of being a heir.

105
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,040
I've made a wish.

106
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,440
Okay.

107
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,760
Light the candles.

108
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,560
Let's light them together.

109
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,040
You light them.

110
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,040
Why did he accuse us first?

111
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,400
The first owner said

112
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,760
our fish pond was built at the crossroad.

113
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,400
There was no sign of a road.

114
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,040
It's a hidden danger.

115
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,480
It's our fault.

116
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,720
The third owner also said

117
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,240
we shouldn't have dug

118
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,880
the fish pond at the crossroad.

119
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,280
There was no protective barrier.

120
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,640
We couldn't see it at night.

121
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,680
The driver accidentally

122
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,080
fell into the pond.

123
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
He said the fish pond

124
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,320
was very unreasonable.

125
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,160
What about the second owner?

126
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,800
He was so angry

127
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
that he blamed us.

128
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,680
Don't mention the second owner.

129
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,320
The insurance company

130
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,400
said the owner and I

131
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,000
had a deal

132
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,960
to cheat the treasure.

133
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,360
He was so angry

134
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,320
that he pissed me off.

135
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,120
He was bullying us.

136
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,600
He was talking nonsense.

137
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,480
Yes.

138
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,480
Do you think

139
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,640
our income

140
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,280
is enough to cheat the treasure?

141
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,480
What did the court say?

142
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,640
The judge said

143
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,280
the responsibility of the incident

144
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,680
and the cooperation of the firm

145
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,520
were settled.

146
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,320
The fish pond

147
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:01,880
and the environmental protection

148
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
were all here.

149
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,640
We didn't understand

150
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
what the judge said.

151
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,480
Your brother

152
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
told us

153
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,680
but he didn't understand either.

154
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,880
Anyway,

155
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,440
he did a lot of things

156
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
and he kept spending money.

157
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,480
He said we should wait.

158
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,480
Yes.

159
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,920
They can wait.

160
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,240
But how can we wait?

161
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,840
Mom.

162
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,320
What can we eat

163
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,640
in this year?

164
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,120
No.

165
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,080
Besides,

166
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,000
your brother will go to high school

167
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,760
next year.

168
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,920
Don't worry, mom.

169
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,720
What did the village head say?

170
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,960
He blamed us.

171
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,200
He said there was a flood in the village.

172
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,640
We destroyed the water first.

173
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,440
There must be something

174
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,840
going on in the village.

175
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,600
He was lying.

176
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,200
He had been eating white food

177
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,560
for so many years.

178
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,840
He was so angry.

179
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,960
He was so angry.

180
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,520
It's not you.

181
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,320
If you

182
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,920
had been with his niece,

183
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,640
he wouldn't have...

184
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,080
Enough.

185
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,920
Don't mention it.

186
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
It's none of my business.

187
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,120
How about this?

188
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,200
I have a friend who is a law student.

189
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,120
He's quite good.

190
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,120
I'll consult him.

191
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,960
You can stay here

192
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,120
and talk to him tomorrow.

193
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,640
Okay?

194
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,680
It's a small place.

195
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,480
I'll take the underground.

196
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,560
It's convenient.

197
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,080
Uncle.

198
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,720
Thank you

199
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,160
for

200
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,720
taking care of this event for me.

201
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,160
Youál

202
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,760
appeared on my shift

203
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,120
until now, didn't you?

204
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:10,960
Brother.

205
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,240
Thank you

206
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,280
for having

207
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,720
a birthday party loud and clear.

208
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,720
No, no, A'Kong.

209
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,720
This is your body.

210
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
You can't eat too many cakes.

211
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,720
As long as you can eat, I'll eat it for you.

212
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Mom, I'm kind to you, right?

213
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,720
It's almost the same.

214
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
Eat more. Don't let him see you.

215
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
He wants to see you and me together.

216
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Eat more.

217
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
Is it okay to you?

218
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
Is it okay?

219
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
Are you feeling better, A'Kong?

220
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
Are you feeling better, A'Kong?

221
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
What are you laughing at?

222
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
A'Kong.

223
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
A'Kong, come here.

224
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
It's good to have you two together.

225
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
It's really good.

226
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,720
Today, we're really in sync.

227
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,720
It's really good.

228
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,720
Eat more.

229
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
Eat more.

230
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
Eat more.

231
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
Eat more.

232
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
Eat more.

233
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
Eat more.

234
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
Eat more.

235
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
A'Kong.

236
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,720
You're going to have a daughter-in-law soon.

237
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
No.

238
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
What?

239
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
What?

240
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,720
A'Kong just left.

241
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,720
What do you think?

242
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,720
Is Tianzhen and Tou Tou okay?

243
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
Impossible.

244
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,720
Tianzhen told me before that

245
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,720
she has a lover.

246
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,720
But she didn't confess.

247
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,720
The lover she said

248
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,720
can't be Tou Tou.

249
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
That's impossible.

250
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,720
Tou Tou is not a girl.

251
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
That's different.

252
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
You're not the one who's going to have a daughter-in-law.

253
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
How did you see it?

254
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,720
I saw it with my eyes.

255
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,720
Didn't you see

256
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,720
Tianzhen talking to Tou Tou?

257
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,720
I'm willing to have a lover.

258
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,720
Life is not just about

259
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
inheritance.

260
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
I saw it with my eyes.

261
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,720
The eyes at that time?

262
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,720
What's strange is that

263
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,720
usually,

264
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,720
if Tou Tou heard this kind of thing,

265
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,720
she would have shouted.

266
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
I won't get married.

267
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,720
But today,

268
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
she didn't say anything.

269
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,720
You women

270
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,720
are thinking nonsense.

271
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,720
I'll leave it here.

272
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,720
How is it?

273
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
Tou Tou,

274
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
if you get along with Tianzhen,

275
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
do you think

276
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,720
she doesn't deserve our Tianzhen?

277
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
She deserves it.

278
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,720
Tianzhen deserves Tou Tou.

279
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Look at Tou Tou.

280
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
She's so determined.

281
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
Our Tianzhen

282
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,720
grew up in the secret room.

283
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,720
As a mother,

284
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,720
Ling Lan is too strong.

285
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,720
Tianzhen has been weak since she was a child.

286
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,720
If she were with Tou Tou,

287
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,720
it would be great

288
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
if they could support each other.

289
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,720
Besides,

290
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Tou Tou entered the society earlier

291
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,720
and has more experience.

292
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
When it comes to things,

293
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
she is more open-minded.

294
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
If they can really become a couple,

295
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,720
it's our good fortune.

296
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
How can you be like this?

297
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,720
Everyone is better than their own grandson.

298
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
In my eyes,

299
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
my grandson is good in every way.

300
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Tou Tou is a man of the village.

301
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,720
She deserves my grandson.

302
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
Listen,

303
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,720
you have to pretend you don't know.

304
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
Do you know?

305
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,720
Why?

306
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
You don't want to

307
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,720
spoil your grandson sooner.

308
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Do you know?

309
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
I know.

310
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
Who asked?

311
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
I said I don't know.

312
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
Yes.

313
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
Chief Steward,

314
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
it's time to go in.

315
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Go in?

316
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
Yes.

317
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
Go in.

318
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
This is a good time.

319
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,720
I'll go back to my room.

320
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
Go in.

321
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
Go in.

322
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,720
Go in.

323
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
Go in.

324
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Go in.

325
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Go in.

326
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Go in.

327
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
Go in.

328
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
Go in.

329
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
Go in.

330
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,720
Go in.

331
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
Go in.

332
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
Go in.

333
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Go in.

334
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Go in.

335
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Go in.

336
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,240
What?

337
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,480
What are you laughing at?

338
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,140
And you

339
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,440
Look, what's so fun about this

340
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,160
I won't tell. Ok?

341
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:19,980
No

342
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,960
All right, tell me what you know

343
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,460
No, I don't know

344
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,460
I'm so jealous of you.

345
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,460
You're so young.

346
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,460
What did you see that made you so happy?

347
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,460
I don't know.

348
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,460
Don't ask me.

349
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,460
I don't know.

350
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,460
Fine.

351
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,460
You don't know then.

352
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,460
Mom,

353
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,460
please help me ask for leave for the clinic.

354
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,460
I'm going to the work hours today.

355
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,460
You can ask me.

356
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,460
Where's Tong Tong?

357
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,460
She's not up yet?

358
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,460
She's in the study with her dad.

359
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,460
I'm going to the study with her.

360
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,460
I'll go with her.

361
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,460
I'll go with her.

362
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,460
I'll go with her.

363
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,460
I'll go with her.

364
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,460
You're having a face-to-face meeting early in the morning?

365
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,460
I'm not eating.

366
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,460
I'm leaving.

367
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,460
Grandpa,

368
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,460
you should enjoy yourself.

369
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,460
Thank you, Dr. Sun.

370
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,460
I've been thinking about what you said today for a long time.

371
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,460
But you asked me to transfer the money overseas

372
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,460
and hand it over.

373
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,460
It's just for Wu Kui.

374
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,460
I can't do it.

375
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,460
You're just doing it for this?

376
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,460
You won't die from the tea or the coal?

377
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,460
Brother Ren is destined.

378
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,460
He has already made a choice.

379
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,460
Let him go.

380
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,460
I just feel bad.

381
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,460
Why are you sad?

382
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,460
Did I say something wrong?

383
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,460
Yes.

384
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,460
Yes, but it's the same reason.

385
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,460
You say it to Chenyin,

386
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,460
to Zhu Xia,

387
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,460
to Grandma Jiang.

388
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,460
They all accepted it and changed their minds.

389
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,460
I say the same reason to Lu Dada.

390
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,460
He just doesn't listen.

391
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,460
What does it mean?

392
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,460
It means what?

393
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,460
It means that you're the one who's being reasonable.

394
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,460
I don't feel bad.

395
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,460
I also told Zhu Changming.

396
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,460
He didn't accept it.

397
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,460
If everyone in this world is rewarded,

398
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,460
if everyone is rewarded,

399
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,460
then there's only one thing.

400
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,460
Without Yin,

401
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,460
there's no Ren Shijian.

402
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,460
I still think that

403
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,460
you're more powerful than me.

404
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,460
So,

405
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,460
I can't do it.

406
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,460
How old are you?

407
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,460
How old am I?

408
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,460
When I was being bullied,

409
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,460
you didn't see it.

410
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,460
Really.

411
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,460
I've been through a lot of hardships.

412
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,460
I've been through a lot of hardships.

413
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,460
I've just seen the end of the world.

414
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,460
At your age,

415
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,460
you can do whatever you want.

416
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,460
You can do whatever you want.

417
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,460
I'm not your master.

418
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,460
You're my master.

419
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,460
So,

420
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,460
you must do the right thing.

421
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,460
You must hold back.

422
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,460
Don't be displeased.

423
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,460
Don't be sad.

424
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,460
You will be me now.

425
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,460
No, master.

426
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,460
Lu Dadan

427
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,460
just ran away like this.

428
00:17:52,460 --> 00:18:07,080
He's a

429
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,460
So, you must believe in the law

430
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,460
and believe in the heavens.

431
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,460
According to what you said,

432
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,460
there's no other way

433
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,460
in the world

434
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,460
to get rid of the evil.

435
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,460
I think in China,

436
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,460
freedom,

437
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,460
what is freedom?

438
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,460
Freedom is not the highest level of

439
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,460
freedom.

440
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,460
It's freedom.

441
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,460
What is freedom?

442
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,460
Confucius has made it very clear.

443
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,460
What you want from the heart

444
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,460
is not a word.

445
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,460
A word is a word.

446
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,460
You want a person

447
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,460
to be in prison for twenty years.

448
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,460
He is free in his heart.

449
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,460
Impossible.

450
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,460
Twenty years.

451
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,460
Hide and hide.

452
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,460
Sleep together for twenty years.

453
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,460
It's better than being in prison

454
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,460
and die in a rebel.

455
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,460
If there is such a person,

456
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,460
he has a family,

457
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,460
has children,

458
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,460
and his own world

459
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,460
is doing very well,

460
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,460
getting higher and higher,

461
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,460
then he is not afraid at all.

462
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,460
How can he be free

463
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,460
in his heart?

464
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,460
So Lu Dadai

465
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,460
is used to

466
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,460
playing the field and drinking.

467
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,460
He is afraid of prison.

468
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,460
Such a small place.

469
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,460
He won't stay long.

470
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,460
He will automatically surrender.

471
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,460
Right?

472
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,460
Yes.

473
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,460
That's about it.

474
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,460
Lv Beikang,

475
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,460
do you have any idea?

476
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,460
No.

477
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,460
You don't seem to be

478
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,460
as good as the rumors.

479
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,460
Rumors say you will win

480
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,460
if you get into a lawsuit.

481
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,460
Why do we always

482
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,460
ask you for no reason?

483
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,460
I can win the lawsuit

484
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,460
because I only accept

485
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,460
the case I can win.

486
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,460
But I can't win this case.

487
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,460
And Li Quan's family

488
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,460
needs to win this case

489
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,460
immediately.

490
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,460
Even the gods can't do it now.

491
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,460
This case has been delayed

492
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,460
for ten years.

493
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,460
The fish pond can't be used.

494
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,460
The land he has to pay

495
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,460
is also paid.

496
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,460
It's all over.

497
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,460
So I doubt.

498
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,460
What do you doubt?

499
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,460
What do you doubt?

500
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,460
I doubt someone will miss

501
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,460
your fish pond.

502
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,460
There must be a medicine

503
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,460
for the abnormal things.

504
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,460
This fish pond

505
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,460
has been in your family for 20 years.

506
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,460
Nothing happened

507
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,460
to you.

508
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,460
Suddenly, in two months,

509
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,460
three cars were dropped into it.

510
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,460
Is it a coincidence?

511
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,460
So you can

512
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,460
have two options now.

513
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,460
First,

514
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,460
you can ask

515
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,460
a better lawyer to investigate

516
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,460
and find out

517
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,460
the common main line

518
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,460
behind these three cars

519
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,460
and prove

520
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,460
they came for

521
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,460
your fish pond.

522
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,460
But this

523
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,460
will cost a lot of money.

524
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,460
And this money

525
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,460
can't be returned.

526
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,460
So let's not

527
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,460
hide it.

528
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,460
Of course,

529
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,460
there is also a possibility

530
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,460
that my judgment is wrong.

531
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,460
This is just a coincidence.

532
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,460
Then your money

533
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,460
will be more expensive.

534
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,460
Then tell me

535
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,460
another way.

536
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,460
Your family is in disaster.

537
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,460
Return the fish pond to the village.

538
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,460
Tell the village head

539
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,460
to return the fish pond to you.

540
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,460
I won't do this business.

541
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,460
I guess

542
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,460
the village head

543
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,460
will help you to settle it soon.

544
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,460
Then don't you think

545
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,460
these two ways

546
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,460
are all paid by our family?

547
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,460
Who let your family

548
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,460
be worried about it?

549
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,460
No one wanted

550
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,460
that rotten swamp.

551
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,460
Li Xuanjie dug the ground

552
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,460
and dug out a body of disease.

553
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,460
It's just been cleaned for two years.

554
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,460
Why?

555
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,460
Why?

556
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,460
Just because

557
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,460
they are sure that

558
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,460
your family has no money

559
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,460
and can only give in.

560
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,460
What if I have money?

561
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,460
I mean, if...

562
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,460
If I can find out

563
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,460
that someone is behind this,

564
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,460
can our family

565
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,460
get the money?

566
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,460
No.

567
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,460
Why?

568
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,460
Why?

569
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,460
Because for them,

570
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,460
the biggest loss

571
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,460
is that they can't get

572
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,460
the car money

573
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,460
from the insurance company.

574
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,460
But if you want

575
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,460
to take the money

576
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,460
from them

577
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,460
and pay your family,

578
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,460
it's impossible.

579
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,460
So basically,

580
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,460
the financial and physical costs

581
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,460
you spent

582
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,460
are all gone.

583
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,460
It's so unfair.

584
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,460
How can it be

585
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,460
absolutely fair in this world?

586
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,460
Qiao Ran, what do you think?

587
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,460
Tell me.

588
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,460
What do you think?

589
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,460
Rebecca,

590
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,460
do you have any better

591
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,460
lawyers to recommend?

592
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,460
Are you really going to

593
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,460
put an end to this?

594
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,460
Your parents

595
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,460
are not in that village

596
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,460
and will continue to live.

597
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,460
Are you poor?

598
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,460
Do I still have a life?

599
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,460
Okay.

600
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,460
Qiao Ran, I still have

601
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,460
two or three hundred thousand.

602
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,460
I'll transfer you later.

603
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,460
You are not

604
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,460
a third-rate person.

605
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,460
Xiao Wo, are you waiting for someone?

606
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,460
Rebecca told me

607
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,460
about you.

608
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,460
What do you want to do?

609
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,460
What do you mean?

610
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,460
Do you want to investigate

611
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,460
those cheaters

612
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,460
and see if they are

613
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,460
actually good people

614
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,460
or do you want to

615
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,460
dig out all the

616
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,460
interests

617
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,460
in your village

618
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,460
and fight for them?

619
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,460
Lawyer,

620
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,460
please give me a way out.

621
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,460
You are involved

622
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,460
in many things.

623
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,460
The simplest

624
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,460
is this.

625
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,460
Three hundred thousand.

626
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,460
Three hundred thousand.

627
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,460
Lawyer, can you be a little cheaper?

628
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,460
What?

629
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,460
Three hundred thousand is too expensive for me.

630
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,460
Is it expensive?

631
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,460
It's expensive.

632
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,460
We are a team.

633
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,460
We are a team.

634
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,460
It makes sense.

635
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,460
Xiao Zhao, you are finally back.

636
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,460
The manager was looking for you.

637
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,460
Go now.

638
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,460
You should be careful.

639
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,460
I think the manager

640
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,460
doesn't look good in the picture.

641
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,460
He doesn't look very happy.

642
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,460
Thank you.

643
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,460
Where did you go?

644
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,460
I went to the hospital.

645
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,460
You lied.

646
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,460
Director Li just

647
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,460
called me.

648
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,460
I asked him

649
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,460
and he didn't see you at all.

650
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,460
I told him

651
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,460
I saw you.

652
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,460
Yes.

653
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,460
I was going to go to him.

654
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,460
But something happened.

655
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,460
I forgot it.

656
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,460
I came back

657
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,460
to get the information.

658
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,460
I'll go now.

659
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,460
Let me ask you.

660
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,460
What did you do

661
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,460
in the last thing

662
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,460
I told you to do?

663
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,460
Zhao Li Quan,

664
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,460
you don't want to work here, do you?

665
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,460
I don't even know

666
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,460
what you are doing

667
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,460
at work every day.

668
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,460
You don't work

669
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,460
as you should.

670
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,460
You don't work as you should.

671
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,460
You have

672
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,460
the mountains behind you.

673
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,460
You have the mines behind you.

674
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,460
You always bragged

675
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,460
about your relationship

676
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,460
with Director Wu.

677
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,460
It's just a card.

678
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,460
Is it that hard to send it out?

679
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,460
I'll send the card.

680
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,460
You'll send it?

681
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,460
Why didn't you

682
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,460
tell me earlier?

683
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,460
What did Director Wu say?

684
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,460
Director Wu said

685
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,460
it would take some time

686
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,460
to do this.

687
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,460
He just called me

688
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,460
and asked me to go to him.

689
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,460
It's this thing.

690
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,460
Wang Jue has been sent to the city hospital.

691
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,460
How about this?

692
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,460
Don't go to the city hospital.

693
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,460
I'll call Director Li.

694
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,460
Go to Director Wu's place

695
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,460
and try to get the card

696
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,460
and get the gold.

697
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,460
Not today.

698
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,460
I have an appointment with Director Wu

699
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,460
and he said he would go to see him

700
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,460
early tomorrow morning.

701
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,460
Okay.

702
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,460
Then, tomorrow morning.

703
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,460
Don't let me down.

704
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,460
I have faith in you.

705
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,460
I'll go now.

706
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,460
Go.

707
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,460
Go.

708
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,460
What's wrong?

709
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,460
Stop turning.

710
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,460
I'm dizzy.

711
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,460
Wait a little longer.

712
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,460
My son will be back soon.

713
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,460
He's been out for so long.

714
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,460
Why hasn't he come back yet?

715
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,460
Isn't he busy?

716
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,460
You're back, Dad.

717
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,460
Qiao, you're back.

718
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,460
Mom.

719
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,460
I've heated the dishes twice.

720
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,460
I cooked what you like.

721
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,460
Change your clothes and eat.

722
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,460
Here.

723
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,460
Come.

724
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,460
Come.

725
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,460
Mom, thank you.

726
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,460
Dad,

727
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,460
I asked my friend today.

728
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,460
He said he would recommend us

729
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,460
to reconcile soon.

730
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,460
Don't worry.

731
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,460
He said he could find

732
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,460
a good lawyer.

733
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,460
That's great.

734
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,460
Then,

735
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,460
we'll get the compensation soon.

736
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,460
How can you reconcile?

737
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,460
Do we compensate him

738
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,460
or do we compensate him?

739
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,460
Is it good?

740
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,460
Eat more.

741
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,460
Eat first.

742
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,460
Don't just eat, kid.

743
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,460
Don't drink until the end.

744
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,460
We compensate him.

745
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,460
And

746
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,460
our fish pond

747
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,460
can't be fed for three years.

748
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,460
Who will compensate?

749
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,460
Stop talking.

750
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,460
My son has been tired all day.

751
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,460
Eat first.

752
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,460
What to eat?

753
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,460
He didn't say he could eat.

754
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,460
Eat fish.

755
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,460
You're back.

756
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,460
How is it?

757
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,460
Not happy?

758
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,460
Didn't you see Xiaobai?

759
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,460
No.

760
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,460
He didn't go?

761
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,460
He did.

762
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,460
Why didn't you see him?

763
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,460
I saw him.

764
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,460
You didn't see him

765
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,460
for a while.

766
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,460
Did you see him?

767
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,460
I think you want to fight, right?

768
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,460
Why do I want to fight?

769
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,460
You come back every day.

770
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,460
I always say hello to you.

771
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,460
Why can't I ask you today?

772
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,460
You asked if you saw Xiaobai.

773
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,460
I said no.

774
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,460
You...

775
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,460
The answer is yes.

776
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,460
The answer is the same as the one after me.

777
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,460
What left and right?

778
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,460
No, no, no.

779
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,460
Wait a minute.

780
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,460
Don't take me to the ditch.

781
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,460
I just asked you

782
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,460
if you didn't see Xiaobai.

783
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,460
Shouldn't you answer

784
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,460
I said I saw him?

785
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,460
How can you say you didn't see him?

786
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,460
Who is wrong?

787
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,460
And you come back

788
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,460
and you're embarrassed.

789
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,460
What do you mean?

790
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,460
Stop.

791
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,460
Let's not talk about it.

792
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,460
I'm sorry.

793
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,460
You just

794
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,460
you just shut up.

795
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,460
I didn't offend you.

796
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,460
I didn't make you angry.

797
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,460
Is it because

798
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,460
I'm so rude to you?

799
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,460
Otherwise,

800
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,460
time is really a knife.

801
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,460
Back then,

802
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,460
it was a white-clad boy.

803
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,460
It's the same in the middle of the year.

804
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,460
Don't you boys have a headache?

805
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,460
You said you showed me

806
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,460
what you can do.

807
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,460
You have the ability

808
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,460
to show Xiaobai your face.

809
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,460
What?

810
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,460
Because everyone likes you?

811
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,460
Who likes me if you don't?

812
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,460
Young Master,

813
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,460
I'll arrange a blind date for you tomorrow.

814
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,460
You're so petty.

815
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,460
What's the noise?

816
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,460
Xinzheng

817
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,460
went to see his ex-girlfriend.

818
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,460
At this age,

819
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,460
it's really

820
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,460
that he's still so young.

821
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,460
Xinzheng is not that kind of person.

822
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,460
If he wants to make trouble,

823
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,460
when he was young,

824
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,460
all the patients

825
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,460
were loyal to him.

826
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,460
He was so kind to him.

827
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,460
He was loyal to him.

828
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,460
It depends on whether

829
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,460
Xinzheng is loyal or not.

830
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,460
You women

831
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,460
have your own enemies in your heart.

832
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,460
I wasn't an enemy at that time.

833
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,460
Don't make a fuss.

834
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,460
Life is so long.

835
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,460
It depends on who is the last winner.

836
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,460
From top to bottom,

837
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,460
I'm yours now.

838
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,460
So vulgar.

839
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,460
Speaking of which,

840
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,460
I'm the one who's taking care of your illness.

841
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,460
Thank you, Madam.

842
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,460
People

843
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,460
are hard to deal with.

844
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,460
But everyone has to deal with it.

845
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,460
Nana

846
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,460
It's your turn.

847
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,460
The child is born.

848
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,460
He's completely

849
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,460
out of the womb.

850
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,460
He can't see

851
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,460
the way he's being

852
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,460
a demon king.

853
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,460
I chose this child

854
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,460
to see if you can really do it.

855
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,460
It's a good choice.

856
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,460
I'll bring him to you

857
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,460
next time.

858
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,460
He'll be surprised.

859
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,460
And

860
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,460
you can rest assured.

861
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,460
I entrusted him to you

862
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,460
back then.

863
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,460
It's a clear and honest decision.

864
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,460
Yes.

865
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,460
I understand your wish.

866
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,460
My senior

867
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,460
is also a kind person.

868
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,460
He treats you

869
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:30,460
like a brother.

870
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,460
And you

871
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,460
have the ability

872
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,460
to be a successor.

873
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,460
A man's heart is right.

874
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,460
A heart is right.

875
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,460
I believe

876
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,460
when I see him.

877
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,460
With his guidance,

878
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,460
you'll definitely be on the right track.

879
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,460
You're right.

880
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,460
I have one more thing

881
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,460
to discuss with you.

882
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,460
It's about

883
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,460
the information about

884
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,460
Toto's real identity.

885
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,460
I don't think

886
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,460
it's necessary to keep it.

887
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,460
I'll destroy

888
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,460
the one I have.

889
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,460
Okay?

890
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,460
I'll give it to you.

891
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,460
I don't have

892
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,460
anything to do

893
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,460
with his past.

894
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,460
You're a man of

895
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,460
reason.

896
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,460
You're more clear than I thought.

897
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,460
I was afraid

898
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,460
he couldn't be of any help.

899
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,460
So I thought

900
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,460
these information

901
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,460
were my ways out.

902
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,460
Now I think

903
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,460
I'm not a good person.

904
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,460
I don't care

905
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,460
who his parents are.

906
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,460
He has the right

907
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,460
to take this class.

908
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,460
He's the successor

909
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,460
of Jiang's faction.

910
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,460
Mr. He.

911
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,460
Okay.

912
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,460
My parents

913
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,460
want to

914
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,460
have a fight with me.

915
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,460
I told them

916
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,460
I found a job.

917
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,460
You told them

918
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,460
I worked at a clinic

919
00:35:49,460 --> 00:36:02,640
and I had a

920
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,640
job.

921
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,640
I can't lie to you.

922
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,640
This young man

923
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,640
is the successor

924
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,640
of Jiang's faction.

925
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,640
Sun Tou Tou.

926
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,640
He's my junior.

927
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,640
Don't worry.

928
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,640
I'll take care

929
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,640
of everything.

930
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,640
Okay. Bye.

931
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,640
Senior.

932
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,640
Are you here for Mr. Wu?

933
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,640
Why don't you go in?

934
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,640
Come in.

935
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,640
Mr. Wu.

936
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,640
I've prepared

937
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,640
the materials for the meeting.

938
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,640
Do you have anything else?

939
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,640
Okay.

940
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,640
Okay.

941
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,640
Copy this material.

942
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,640
One for each person.

943
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,640
We'll use it for the meeting.

944
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,640
Okay.

945
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,640
Okay.

946
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,640
What's up?

947
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,640
Is it mine?

948
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,640
You're so dumb.

949
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,640
What are you asking?

950
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,640
Sun Tou Tou

951
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,640
is not the successor

952
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,640
of Jiang's faction.

953
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,640
Is that right?

954
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,800
Does it have anything to do with you?

955
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,160
Yes.

956
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,160
I thought

957
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,760
I didn't have a inheritance.

958
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,320
I wasn't born

959
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,480
in a good family.

960
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,560
I couldn't reach

961
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,840
a high position like you.

962
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,240
But what about Sun?

963
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,120
He's nothing.

964
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,960
How can he be

965
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,040
a heir?

966
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,360
What about me?

967
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,200
I studied hard.

968
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,720
I got into college.

969
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,000
I got into a graduate school.

970
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,400
I can't even enter

971
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,440
the city gate.

972
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,440
If you can

973
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,000
choose someone

974
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,720
to be the heir,

975
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,440
why can't he be me?

976
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,520
God wants you

977
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,560
to fight for the throne

978
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,240
and to be the king

979
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,440
to bully us.

980
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,240
Right?

981
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,760
Li Xuan.

982
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,920
I helped you a lot.

983
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,920
But you can't

984
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,320
let me do those

985
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,360
illegal things

986
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,320
for you.

987
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,120
What illegal things

988
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,320
can I let you do?

989
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,600
I just want you

990
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,440
to help us

991
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,440
with the medical treasure.

992
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,280
You won't help us

993
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,240
with such a small amount of money.

994
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,920
You can change Sun Toto's life

995
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,440
with your hands.

996
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,400
Why are you willing to help him

997
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,240
and not me?

998
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,480
Zhang Li Quan.

999
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,520
I'm warning you.

1000
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:54,920
I don't have

1001
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,920
any place to be sorry to you.

1002
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,920
I want you to help me.

1003
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,400
I don't need to explain

1004
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,160
what I want to do.

1005
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,120
I respect you so much.

1006
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,920
Why do you lie to me?

1007
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,360
I respect you so much.

1008
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,160
Thank you.

1009
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,120
You are

1010
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,320
high and kind in my heart.

1011
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,600
It's like a flash of light.

1012
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,200
I want to be you.

1013
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,120
But you...

1014
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,160
What did you

1015
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,360
do to him?

1016
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,400
Why are you willing to help Sun Toto?

1017
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,840
Who is he?

1018
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,240
Li Xuan.

1019
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,600
It's not what you think.

1020
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,160
You are too emotional today.

1021
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,600
We are not suitable

1022
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,640
to discuss this issue.

1023
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,840
Calm down.

1024
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,560
We'll talk later.

1025
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,680
I'm late.

1026
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,760
You go.

1027
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,640
Let me see what Sun Toto

1028
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,840
is to you.

1029
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,680
He is so crazy.

1030
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,720
What are you doing?

1031
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,520
You come.

1032
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,880
Don't be afraid.

1033
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,520
Interrogation

1034
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,320
Present at conference

1035
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,840
Here she comes!

1036
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,160
Here she comes!

1037
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,360
What's going on?

1038
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,480
Chief.

1039
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:19,920
Chief.

1040
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Chief, what's going on?

1041
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,000
According to the common practice,

1042
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,960
I'm leaving for work,

1043
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,160
so have a nice day.

1044
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,200
Next morning.

1045
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,160
The condition is not good right now.

1046
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,040
Judging from the video,

1047
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,440
the blood Essenes has the early morning energy level.

1048
00:40:41,440 --> 00:41:00,600
She suddenly fell into her brain

1049
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,600
and gave birth to an alien,

1050
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,760
he's still alive.

1051
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,520
Your family has a chance.

1052
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,640
Listen to me.

1053
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,200
I've been friends with Wu for many years.

1054
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,600
I can't bear to part with him.

1055
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,280
But you have to be rational.

1056
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,560
Let him go now.

1057
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,680
He won't suffer much.

1058
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,200
Your family will feel bad.

1059
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,440
But time is a cure.

1060
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,320
We're all doctors.

1061
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,800
Don't say anything more.

1062
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,400
Thank you, Li.

1063
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,960
I understand

1064
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,720
what you said.

1065
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,440
But

1066
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,720
I can't give up on Wu.

1067
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,800
My mother-in-law is out there now.

1068
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,840
She took the opium.

1069
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,600
Her blood pressure is still over 200.

1070
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,480
Tell me.

1071
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,200
Do you have the courage to tell her

1072
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,200
that she's not in the hospital?

1073
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,080
That's...

1074
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,720
That's the only way.

1075
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,320
Don't worry.

1076
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,680
I won't blame you

1077
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,600
if I don't do well.

1078
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,960
The worst result is...

1079
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,920
I'm just a plant.

1080
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,000
I accept it.

1081
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,480
I don't think so.

1082
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,320
But I still want you

1083
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,720
to help me.

1084
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,920
You mean...

1085
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,000
You're not useful if you break in.

1086
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,720
Don't worry now.

1087
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,480
I'll let you in.

1088
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,760
Dochu…

1089
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,640
You're good.

1090
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,920
When we get pregnant,

1091
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,320
you will have to bear with it.

1092
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,120
But do you still vegetable

1093
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,320
when I bring you food?

1094
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,680
The stars are so heavy

1095
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,920
I'm already trapped in your eyes

1096
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,040
The song of love

1097
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,360
The fate of the dream

1098
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:14,600
is so deep

1099
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,800
There are always people

1100
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,080
who know you are through the mountains and rivers

1101
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:25,320
We share the years and the stars

1102
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,480
I'm sure

1103
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,680
You are that person

1104
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,840
I admit

1105
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:38,120
The stars are so heavy

1106
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:42,360
I'm already trapped in your eyes

1107
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,560
The song of love

1108
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:53,240
The fate of the dream

1109
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:59,440
it is deep
