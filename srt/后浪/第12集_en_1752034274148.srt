00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Food is my reward for you.

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay, I'll drink this pot.

5
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I won't have to share it with you.

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll pour more.

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You just said food is good for you.

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's drink.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Don't drink.

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Eat some vegetables.

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Don't let the pig's ear get wet.

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Drink with me.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What are you doing?

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Say it.

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Just a little bit.

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
A little bit.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Pour a little bit.

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Just a little bit.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Pour a little bit.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
A little bit.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay, okay.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Cheers.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You don't understand, do you?

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Cheers.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Cheers.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Cheers.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Why did you drink so much?

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Why did you drink so much?

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll get you some soup.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Cheers.

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Here, drink this.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What's the price for yourself?

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Don't you have any skills?

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm a good teacher.

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm a talented teacher.

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I need to learn from my teacher first.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Then I'll learn from him.

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The teacher is a good teacher.

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But he's demanding a higher price for his teacher.

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Look at me.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I've put my life on the line

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
to meet my teacher's expectations.

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Why didn't I see you being so sad about Tianzhen?

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Because I know Tianzhen's last home is here.

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He can't run away.

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He'll run away if he takes a step carefully.

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I think you know that I can't run away.

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's why I'm here.

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Madam, that's not fair.

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's not fair.

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Am I wrong?

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You're so considerate to others.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What about your family?

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's what most people do.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
They always leave the best side to others.

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
They always leave the worst side to their family.

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Don't think I'm drinking to teach him a lesson.

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm doing this for your son.

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Why didn't you let him treat the patients?

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You're waiting for me here?

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm not sure what's going on with Ma Guoping.

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Your son is not ready.

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If you don't let him treat the patients,

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
when will he be ready?

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You're here.

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
His uncle is here.

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And he's already talking about that.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
He just wants to see Tianzhen's family.

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's good for your husband to see it.

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What if your son really goes there

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and hurts his son?

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He's hurt his head.

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Everyone can accept it.

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll be the one to help.

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
If your son goes,

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll help.

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Where will you put your family's dignity?

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I won't let your son go.

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm doing this to protect him.

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's a matter of life and death.

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Listen.

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'll leave it at that.

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Although Toto is a wild deer,

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
he has this muscle.

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He has this muscle.

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He's a person who goes on this road.

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He's not a person

88
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
who's out of shape in class.

89
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He has a sharp mind.

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He's a person who listens to everything.

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He can remember everything I tell him.

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And he's not only a official,

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
but also a doctor.

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He can observe

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
that President Zheng's daughter has a miscarriage.

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What if your son goes?

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He'll have a fever.

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
He can cure it.

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He'll never think of

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
frying an egg yolk

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and telling me about it.

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Can you imagine?

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You'll never imagine.

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Don't look at people like that.

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Doctors, doctors,

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
they're all there.

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
None of them is better than Toto.

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're so generous.

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You want to vomit again?

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll go.

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Li Quan is on leave again?

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yes.

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He's been on leave twice this month.

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And he's been on leave once this weekend.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Tianzhen.

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Do you know Li Quan is on leave?

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I know.

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Where did he go?

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He went to work.

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Work?

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What does that mean?

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You're awake too.

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Dr. Su.

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Someone left something in the warehouse.

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Come and have a look.

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Call Mrs. Zhao.

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Let her pack up.

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
How can she leave it here?

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's not a hotel.

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The key is supposed to be in the pocket.

131
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Where does she live?

132
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't care.

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Hongjun.

134
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Is there something wrong

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
with Li Quan's family?

136
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I let her live in the dormitory.

137
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But the dormitory is too small.

138
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I let her stay in the hospital.

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I guess she's working

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
because she needs a place to stay.

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
She should find a job

142
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
with fixed income.

143
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
She can come back to study

144
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
after she's done.

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Why don't you give her

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
a job with a salary?

147
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Let her be a pharmacist in the hospital.

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
She'll be in charge of catching drugs.

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That way, she'll have some income

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
while studying.

151
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Isn't that perfect?

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Zhao Li Quan is going to be a doctor.

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
She can't take the chance to work.

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Ask her.

155
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
She can either study

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
or work.

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You're being so different.

158
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Why can Peng Shiyan

159
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
study and work at the same time?

160
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What about Zhao Li Quan?

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Peng Shiyan will not

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
be a doctor.

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
She's Zhao Li Quan's criminal.

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
She has to rely on medical skills

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
to live a peaceful life.

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Do you understand?

167
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I think

168
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
it's not impossible

169
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
to give her a naive advice.

170
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Li Quan can

171
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
help us

172
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
to help her with the drug catching.

173
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
She's familiar with drugs

174
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and she won't leave her profession.

175
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
When we're in the hospital,

176
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
she'll catch drugs.

177
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
When we're in class,

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
she'll go to class with us.

179
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
She'll work in her own place.

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We'll help her

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
with the help of the teacher.

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What do you think?

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I think she's got

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
the right sense of direction.

185
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Otherwise,

186
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
you should think about it.

187
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Why do you call me your nephew again?

188
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Then,

189
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
you should give your elders some respect.

190
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I know you all care about her.

191
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But the most important thing is

192
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Zhao Li Quan

193
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
must understand

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
what she wants.

195
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
She wants everything.

196
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'll leave you here.

197
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Call her.

198
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
She can't stay here.

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Did your father

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
agree to it?

201
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's embarrassing.

202
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Pian Zhen.

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You've been using this place

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
for going home.

205
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Stop your work.

206
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
As a resident student

207
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
in a public hospital,

208
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
you shouldn't just sit here

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and not do anything for a living.

210
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Let me find you a work place.

211
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Come with me.

212
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Pian Zhen.

213
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Thank you.

214
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,720
Thank you.

215
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,920
You've been helping me.

216
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,240
I feel sorry for you.

217
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,680
But it's okay.

218
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,480
I'm fine here.

219
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,360
What are you saying?

220
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
You can't even go to class on weekends.

221
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,840
My dad is already upset

222
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,920
about your leave.

223
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,240
Besides, you work at night.

224
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,960
How can you be on time for class the next day?

225
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,800
If you have any problems at home,

226
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,560
you can tell me.

227
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,360
I can help you.

228
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,720
Tiantian.

229
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,520
I know you're doing this for my own good.

230
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,640
But it's not like

231
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,080
you always come to my back door

232
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,520
and borrow my money.

233
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,520
I can accept it without any pressure.

234
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,640
I'm a man, too.

235
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,400
I want to be proud.

236
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,920
No, you said

237
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,520
you wanted to find a good teacher

238
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,800
in the class.

239
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,960
How can you follow the teacher

240
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,800
with such a heartless attitude?

241
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,960
I want to follow the teacher.

242
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,120
I want to study hard.

243
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,480
But I have to solve the problem of my temperature first.

244
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,520
You've seen it.

245
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,440
I've been working outside.

246
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,720
I'm different from when I was in school.

247
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,640
I was full at that time.

248
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,680
I was hungry.

249
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,520
I'm different now.

250
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,840
I have to make money and support my family.

251
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,480
Forget it. Let's not talk about this.

252
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,480
You won't understand it.

253
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,320
Your starting point

254
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,760
is the end of my struggle.

255
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,720
What starting point?

256
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,320
Wait.

257
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,760
What?

258
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,240
You're talking about me?

259
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,840
It's far away.

260
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,080
It's far away.

261
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,800
Is it that complicated?

262
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,560
Do you want to find

263
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,400
a good teacher

264
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,640
who can go to school and make money?

265
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,280
Now you have such a good thing.

266
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,680
You can meet your school needs.

267
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,640
You don't waste your money.

268
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,400
You can do whatever you want.

269
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,480
Why are you here?

270
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,600
Why are you here?

271
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,640
You're here to help your friend.

272
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,640
You've arranged a good thing for him.

273
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,440
You should tell him

274
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,480
this thing.

275
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,280
Tell him it's good or bad.

276
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,000
Tell him to choose, right?

277
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,960
He's the one who chooses.

278
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
He's not you.

279
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,600
Why are you

280
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,080
like his father?

281
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,120
You're also...

282
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,080
He said half of it. You interrupted him.

283
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
He said half of it. You interrupted him.

284
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,560
He said half of it. You interrupted him.

285
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,200
I'm so tired of hearing it.

286
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,120
You wait until he's finished

287
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,320
and then you can tell him.

288
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,200
Okay?

289
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
Focus!

290
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,120
Stop it!

291
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,400
You're a medical worker in my clinic?

292
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,400
You're still in class.

293
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,880
My father has agreed.

294
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,520
Thank you.

295
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,880
Thank you.

296
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,760
It's okay.

297
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,240
It's okay.

298
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,920
It's over, right?

299
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,000
It's simple.

300
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,280
If I'm not here,

301
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,000
you two

302
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,120
can't come down here

303
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,840
without arguing for three hours.

304
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,040
Chen Er.

305
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,480
You can't live in the clinic.

306
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,400
It's okay.

307
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,040
I'll pay the salary here.

308
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,880
I can't pay you

309
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,680
if I find a cheaper place.

310
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,600
Okay.

311
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,800
Silly girl.

312
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,840
Spend a day in the farm mandatory on the assumption.

313
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,500
After you

314
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,640
and the owner will quit the job right away...

315
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,960
I shake my hand

316
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,040
Mickey'sachment park...

317
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,300
I shake my hand

318
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,360
Like a hideout

319
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,820
as sharp as pepper

320
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,520
I shake my hand

321
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,680
Now that I know

322
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,980
how your father made the club

323
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,020
I

324
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,400
will show myself

325
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,840
I swipe back slowly

326
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,560
into the dark

327
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,040
just like this

328
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,400
then lightly

329
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
engrave at one end

330
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,560
and hurl at another

331
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,880
like an arrow

332
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,760
I must always

333
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,880
get an accurate point

334
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,180
to draw my line

335
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,120
Have both the eyes

336
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,360
and the head

337
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,520
ドM

338
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,320
a straight line

339
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:26,880
3, 3duction

340
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,120
The behave seems that

341
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
he was playing a trick

342
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,320
that involved

343
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,120
another tropic

344
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,320
I hope

345
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,440
Mr. personalities

346
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,600
are looking for

347
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,600
another golden face

348
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
Just don't

349
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,120
be alert

350
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,520
is this for?

351
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,160
Why I'm all alone here?

352
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,160
That's all my deployed Where should I go?

353
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,440
Come on

354
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,360
I'll lead you Monta

355
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,720
Why are you here?

356
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,120
I

357
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,960
Hello?

358
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,600
Sun Nong,

359
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,040
are you reliable?

360
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,120
Why did you

361
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,240
leave a man in my house?

362
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,840
Xing Xing,

363
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,000
you called me so late.

364
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,320
Did you have dinner?

365
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,440
Did you work overtime again?

366
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,400
You work so hard every day.

367
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,680
I feel so bad.

368
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
Don't interrupt me.

369
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,120
Tell me.

370
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,560
Why did you leave a man in my house?

371
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,000
Xing Xing, listen to me.

372
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,960
That little Xuan Xuan

373
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,280
is so pitiful.

374
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,120
You know what?

375
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
She has no money to eat

376
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,080
or to live in a place.

377
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,080
I thought my bed was empty.

378
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,240
So I let her live in it.

379
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,680
Can you take her in

380
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,840
as a pity?

381
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
But I promise you

382
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,360
she is a good person.

383
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,400
She will definitely

384
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,520
stay with you.

385
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,280
I don't know

386
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,000
if she is a good person.

387
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,440
But she is a man.

388
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,440
It's good that she is a man.

389
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,640
I thought

390
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,080
you were in danger alone.

391
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,560
I'm relieved

392
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,120
to have a man.

393
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,000
Xing Xing,

394
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,800
don't think that she will massage you.

395
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,160
You don't need to go to the shop

396
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,200
to find her.

397
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,160
You can stay at home

398
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,000
and enjoy the beauty.

399
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,720
Right?

400
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,640
It's convenient.

401
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,720
It's a good thing.

402
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,400
I'll kill you.

403
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,120
Wait for me to get your luggage.

404
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,800
Okay, come on.

405
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,040
Slow down.

406
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,400
Last

407
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,200
is another color of nature,

408
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,960
I mean,

409
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,720
I think Zhenggu must have

410
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,920
used his bone to make the sound, right?

411
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,280
No.

412
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,400
Mr. Dong is not a bad guy.

413
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,280
The sound of his bone is not quiet.

414
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,680
No, I'm not talking about his bone.

415
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,480
His bone.

416
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,640
His bone is like...

417
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,520
What's the difference between bone and bone?

418
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,120
Bone is like bone.

419
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,840
Bone makes the sound.

420
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,120
It's the same thing.

421
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,640
Of course it's the same thing.

422
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,440
The difference is

423
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,960
Zhenggu is a liar.

424
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,680
Zhengji is a evil monk.

425
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,800
Massage or something

426
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,960
can relax your body.

427
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,440
It's already good.

428
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,920
Don't use the

429
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,720
the right one

430
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,120
or the right one.

431
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,920
It's easy to harm the people.

432
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
So I think

433
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,320
Chinese medicine is good for health.

434
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,840
Western medicine is good for treatment.

435
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,080
It's good to have a good personality.

436
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,480
Don't tell me that

437
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,160
Mr. Dong is a real fairy.

438
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,480
He won't accept it.

439
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,560
If he does, he can make you change your bone.

440
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,480
I've known him for so many years.

441
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,520
I've seen so many people who sit in a wheelchair.

442
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,200
In the end, they all walked out by themselves.

443
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,480
Listen, everyone.

444
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,640
If you put your bone back to its original position by hand,

445
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,080
you can achieve the effect of Western medicine surgery.

446
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,080
Is this a human word?

447
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,440
Even if it's Western medicine, you can't guarantee that

448
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,400
the stall will stand and walk out immediately.

449
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,560
Zhengji.

450
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,240
You can't say it.

451
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,160
Do it.

452
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,240
You deserve to be beaten.

453
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,440
Shi Yan, don't believe it.

454
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
There's an old lady in Shuangqiao in Beijing named Luo Youming.

455
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,080
She can use her hands to restore the bones.

456
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,520
Mr. Zhou has also opened a hospital for her.

457
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,600
She can

458
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,600
take the broken bones and broken bones

459
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,040
back by herself.

460
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,320
Mr. Dong

461
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,360
is as good as the old lady in Shuangqiao in Beijing.

462
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,840
It's said that he's better than my nephew.

463
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,040
You're right.

464
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,360
He's a great man.

465
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,080
This way.

466
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,680
This is Mr. Zhou's car.

467
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,040
He's here.

468
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,480
My God.

469
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,960
I've been waiting for you.

470
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,880
Mr. Zhou,

471
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,600
didn't you ask Li Baiyi to go to the clinic?

472
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,000
I haven't slept well these two days.

473
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,920
I'm so nervous that I can't wait for Li Baiyi.

474
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,000
God, show me.

475
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,800
Show me.

476
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,800
Right.

477
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,600
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

478
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,680
I'm so nervous.

479
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,520
Let me see.

480
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,920
Right.

481
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,320
I just got a batch of

482
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,000
very good plants.

483
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,960
One catty is more than a thousand.

484
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,160
500,000 yuan.

485
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,560
If I eat this,

486
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,280
I can eat my

487
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,920
60-year-old wild ginseng.

488
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,760
How about it?

489
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,520
How about this?

490
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,160
You tell us together.

491
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,640
How much have you eaten recently?

492
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,320
You think it's a very good thing.

493
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,480
I've eaten a lot.

494
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,080
I've eaten fake fish, ginseng,

495
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,200
stone pot, sea cucumber, and so on.

496
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,880
After eating,

497
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,480
I feel better.

498
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,280
Or I feel uncomfortable.

499
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,040
Anyway,

500
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,840
I think only eating these expensive things

501
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,440
will make my life better.

502
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,920
Why don't you eat the money I earn?

503
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,960
You don't have any money to make money?

504
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,720
I'm doing charity.

505
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,280
Give our teacher some money.

506
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,680
God, here's the thing.

507
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,640
I can't donate my life.

508
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,480
When I die,

509
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,160
I'll donate all my money to you.

510
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,440
Donating my life

511
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,160
is like donating my liver.

512
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,400
It's uncomfortable.

513
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,840
Zhu Wan, you should know

514
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,320
that the medicine

515
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
is for your ginseng.

516
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,320
Not all ginseng can be eaten.

517
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,200
In your situation,

518
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,760
no ginseng can be eaten.

519
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,320
Then I have to eat some tea.

520
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,360
You give me some tea.

521
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,120
You...

522
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Let me tell you.

523
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,560
Carrots, cabbage, and treasure are safe.

524
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,000
The most practical and cheap

525
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,560
is the best for you.

526
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,160
You just eat and eat.

527
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,800
Eat and sleep on time.

528
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,760
I can't sleep.

529
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,800
If I do,

530
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,720
why should I come to him?

531
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,520
What do you think?

532
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,320
Do you owe others money recently?

533
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,640
No.

534
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,720
You owe others money.

535
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,840
I'm afraid you can't get the medicine back.

536
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,400
I can't eat this.

537
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
No, no, no.

538
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,320
Master, you have to take care of me.

539
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,440
I have to think about it.

540
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,120
You can't leave me alone, right?

541
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,120
What should I do?

542
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,120
Open the medicine for me.

543
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,400
Did you

544
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,720
do something

545
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,280
to rotate your spine?

546
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,480
What do you mean?

547
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,640
He played golf.

548
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,920
Did you play it a few days ago?

549
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
I played it twice a week.

550
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,120
I didn't play it last week

551
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,240
because I couldn't sleep.

552
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,240
I didn't go this week.

553
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,120
Do you know

554
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,840
when you play golf,

555
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,360
you twist your body

556
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,360
and rotate your spine.

557
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,400
This action

558
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,080
causes your chest to be wrong

559
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,280
and affects your heart and lungs.

560
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,360
So you can't sleep.

561
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,760
I'll fix it for you later.

562
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,240
You can sleep tonight.

563
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,560
Open the medicine for me.

564
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,280
Mr. Dong said he could cure you.

565
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,960
He will definitely cure you.

566
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
I can do it.

567
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
You can do it?

568
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,440
Students,

569
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,680
I invited my respected

570
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,720
Mr. Dong Hui Ci

571
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,540
to our

572
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,520
squeeze-in health class.

573
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,200
He ran into a patient

574
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,560
at the door just now.

575
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,840
He's being treated now.

576
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,000
So I'll open the class

577
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,120
for you first.

578
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,840
Mr. Dong is here.

579
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,640
Welcome.

580
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,440
Mr. Dong,

581
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,720
how is the patient?

582
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,840
He's asleep.

583
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,800
Professor Song is watching.

584
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,040
Students,

585
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,520
today's class

586
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,920
can be described in two words.

587
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,280
Fresh and lively.

588
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,680
He told us the truth.

589
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,880
The technique can not only cure the disease,

590
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,640
but also cure the serious one.

591
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,120
The patient just said

592
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,720
he couldn't sleep.

593
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,840
Mr. Dong treated him.

594
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,680
Now he's

595
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,280
sleeping in peace.

596
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,080
Okay.

597
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,200
I'll teach you

598
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,520
how to treat him.

599
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,760
Mr. Dong,

600
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,520
I'll go check on him.

601
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,480
Okay, go ahead.

602
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,320
Okay.

603
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,080
I often think

604
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,320
Chinese medicine is a mystery.

605
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,360
But the main purpose of Chinese medicine

606
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,240
is to help people.

607
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,320
You probably think

608
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,680
I invited Professor Ren

609
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,920
to help me

610
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,000
to reveal

611
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,080
the secret of my Liu Sect.

612
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,000
No.

613
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Actually,

614
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,480
using our technique

615
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,560
can cure many diseases.

616
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,880
Mr. Dong, you not only know how to play drums,

617
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,160
but also read lip-reading.

618
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,280
Hello, everyone.

619
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,920
In our daily life,

620
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,720
we often meet

621
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,600
a flower,

622
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,360
a doll,

623
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,400
or a person who wears pants,

624
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,800
or a person who wakes up

625
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,400
and suddenly finds that

626
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,920
he can't move.

627
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,520
It's the so-called

628
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,160
devil.

629
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,160
There are often patients

630
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,920
who have a stomachache

631
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,000
and feel short in the chest

632
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,640
and dizzy in the head.

633
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,280
Or their legs and feet hurt

634
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,720
and they can't get up.

635
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,920
As the saying goes,

636
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,840
a hundred days of pain and pain.

637
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,080
Some people

638
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,840
lie down for a while

639
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,120
and seem to be well.

640
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,720
But in fact,

641
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,440
they have a cold.

642
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,360
Since mobile phones and computers

643
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,960
became an indispensable part of our lives,

644
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,720
and even became

645
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,200
a organ that we extended,

646
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,000
I can be sure that

647
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,640
the spine disease

648
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,600
will be a very common

649
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,440
physical injury

650
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,640
in our future life.

651
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,960
But this disease

652
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,320
is easy to cure in our country.

653
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,040
As long as you give us enough time,

654
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,720
I can give you

655
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,880
a healthy spine

656
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,280
like the appearance setting.

657
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,920
Mr. Song,

658
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,200
please sit down.

659
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,440
Thank you.

660
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,000
But

661
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,480
you can't sit on a chair

662
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,760
with a wheel under its feet.

663
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,640
This chair

664
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,000
has a spine problem.

665
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,800
Especially the waist problem.

666
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,640
This is one of the main reasons.

667
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,600
Chinese people are very interesting in writing.

668
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,400
I want to say

669
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,240
do this.

670
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,680
Zhenzhen,

671
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,320
can you come up and write this

672
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,880
on the paper?

673
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,400
Okay.

674
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,000
Look.

675
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,200
The character is

676
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,560
two people on the earth.

677
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,360
Why are they two people?

678
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,960
Because they want to be balanced.

679
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,360
Why is it earth?

680
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,040
Because they want to be solid and stable.

681
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,720
Like this chair with a wheel under its feet.

682
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,720
When we sit on it,

683
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,280
in order to prevent it from moving,

684
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,760
we will use the power of the waist.

685
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,560
But when we sit on it,

686
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,440
we want to move from this place

687
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,520
to that place.

688
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,160
We need to have a stronger waist power.

689
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,680
But if we don't have a strong

690
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,120
waist core power,

691
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,440
what will we use?

692
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,120
We use this part.

693
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,120
It's the part we usually call

694
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,520
the waist rotation.

695
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,720
This will easily cause

696
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,120
a muscle error.

697
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,480
So today,

698
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,800
for my old waist,

699
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,520
I think I should

700
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,120
stand on the chair.

701
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,640
Is there anyone

702
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,440
who is not comfortable with your waist today?

703
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,560
So many people.

704
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,120
This...

705
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,040
I...

706
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,120
This chair...

707
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,840
Your chair has been moved.

708
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,640
Okay.

709
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,840
I'm so sorry.

710
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,000
That's fine.

711
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,680
Let's go.

712
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:24,720
Yes.

713
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,120
Let's go.

714
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,600
Let's go.

715
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,120
Let's go.

716
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,200
Here?

717
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,440
This is it.

718
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,440
Okay.

719
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,280
Tell me,

720
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,040
here...

721
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,280
Why haven't you

722
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,560
to renovate it.

723
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,520
Renovate it?

724
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,120
Yes.

725
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,400
I've brought the contract.

726
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,680
Please have a look.

727
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,120
How about this?

728
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,440
Wait a moment.

729
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,800
I'll call Mr. Liu.

730
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Okay, sure.

731
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,280
Let's go and have a look.

732
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,600
Wait a moment.

733
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,280
Wait a moment.

734
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,720
Let's take a break.

735
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,120
Take a break, guys.

736
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,600
Liu.

737
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,240
Did you make a different

738
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,600
classroom for him?

739
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,080
Right.

740
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,280
I was just about to tell you about it.

741
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:20,880
Well,

742
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,440
I want to renovate the classroom

743
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,760
and rent it out.

744
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,960
It's different from what we talked about before.

745
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,160
Professor,

746
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,880
you have to understand my painstaking feelings.

747
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,600
Right?

748
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,280
I lent you the place

749
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,960
because I wanted us

750
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,200
to cooperate well

751
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,560
and win together.

752
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,280
But

753
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,280
you're not interested in

754
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,360
my project

755
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,320
or my participation.

756
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,320
I'm the only one

757
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,440
who has limited ability

758
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,120
and money.

759
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:46,840
Right?

760
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,840
Besides,

761
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,240
I'm the only child

762
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,680
and the employees of the company

763
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,640
depend on me to make a living.

764
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,760
I have to be responsible for them.

765
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,520
Now, the situation is difficult.

766
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,240
I can only make some money.

767
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,080
You know that I'm

768
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,040
very kind to you.

769
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,720
But, brother,

770
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,640
you may not like me talking.

771
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,640
Can kindness be used as a meal?

772
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:09,840
So,

773
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,200
I can only

774
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,200
renovate the house and rent it out.

775
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,800
I can rent the dormitory.

776
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,000
I have to rent it out, too.

777
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,440
Understand?

778
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,360
Okay.

779
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,080
Well,

780
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,680
well,

781
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,000
you three

782
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,240
wait outside.

783
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,440
I'll deal with something first.

784
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,440
Okay.

785
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,280
Thank you.

786
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:44,760
Dad.

787
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,520
Mr. Dong, here's the thing.

788
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,280
Our painting class

789
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,880
will stop for a few days.

790
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,520
Well,

791
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,120
our poetry class

792
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,680
will stop for a few days.

793
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,200
I'll let you know

794
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,480
when the class starts.

795
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,320
Okay.

796
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,320
Let's go.

797
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,520
Okay, get in the car.

798
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,800
Mr. Dong just said

799
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,200
not to sit on the chair.

800
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,080
Wait a minute.

801
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,240
What's going on?

802
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,560
Why did you suddenly take a vacation?

803
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,680
I guess it's okay.

804
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,600
Don't worry.

805
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,600
My dad will handle it.

806
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,240
Brother,

807
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,280
come here.

808
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,000
Hurry up.

809
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,120
Keep your voice down.

810
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,240
What?

811
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,400
Today is the seventh day of the semester.

812
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,240
The old town is holding a painting class.

813
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,480
We were going to have a class.

814
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,560
But the weather is cold.

815
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,600
The old town thinks

816
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,880
it's not suitable for class today.

817
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,960
Why don't we go out

818
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,880
and have a walk?

819
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,280
Why are you so good at this?

820
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,320
Don't talk nonsense.

821
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,800
I heard that

822
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,400
we can rent the Hanfu.

823
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,440
We'll wear Hanfu

824
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,960
and take a few photos.

825
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,720
We'll keep it in mind.

826
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,840
We can't come back if we do.

827
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,320
Right?

828
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:57,880
Dong.

829
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,960
Don't talk nonsense.

830
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,720
No.

831
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:01,920
Mengmeng.

832
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:02,800
Mengmeng.

833
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,520
Everyone said they were going to the seven-day lantern show.

834
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,560
Do you want to go?

835
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,840
If we go,

836
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,680
we'll have to ask the personnel to come.

837
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,120
Why?

838
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,880
The personnel asked us to take a vacation.

839
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,400
Right.

840
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,920
We don't know where to go next time.

841
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,440
Right.

842
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,920
We'll drink and get drunk.

843
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,560
Right.

844
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,680
Let's go.

845
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,400
It's interesting.

846
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,760
There are many games

847
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,880
and all kinds of delicious food you like.

848
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,920
I'll go with you.

849
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,080
Do you want to go?

850
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,600
Okay.

851
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,000
Why are you standing there?

852
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,440
Go pack up.

853
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,280
Go.

854
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,320
Rebecca.

855
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,840
Let's go to the seven-day lantern show together.

856
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,840
I'm not interested.

857
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,000
I don't recommend you to go.

858
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,920
Although it's a holiday,

859
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,360
there are still some people who are going to the seven-day lantern show.

860
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,400
Aren't you afraid that someone will break in at night?

861
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,200
Someone has to work overtime.

862
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:00,920
What?

863
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,680
Are you going to fight with each other?

864
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,080
I advise you to go with us

865
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,360
in case you cause physical harm to yourself.

866
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,320
I'm not afraid.

867
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,840
I'm bad.

868
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,120
I know what you think.

869
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,000
Okay.

870
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,120
Are you going to play?

871
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,240
Let's go.

872
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,640
At seven o'clock later,

873
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,280
I'll send a message to the group chat.

874
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:39,920
Okay?

875
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,640
Seven o'clock.

876
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,600
Seven o'clock.

877
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,640
Don't be afraid.

878
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,720
How cute you are.

879
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,440
It's hot.

880
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,120
It's hot.

881
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,880
Take a look.

882
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,600
Take a look.

883
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,400
It's hot.

884
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,200
Take a look.

885
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,080
Take a look.

886
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,080
You want to buy this?

887
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,800
I'll buy it for you.

888
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:07,800
Boss.

889
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,280
How much is it?

890
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:09,800
Twenty yuan.

891
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,440
Boss, I'll do it.

892
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,160
Boss.

893
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,880
Thank you, boss.

894
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,680
Have a try.

895
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,800
Give me another one.

896
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,480
Come back.

897
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,960
This is the most respectful thing.

898
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,200
It's done.

899
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,240
Let's sit down.

900
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Come on, boss.

901
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,080
Come on.

902
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,720
Get on.

903
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,400
Give it to me.

904
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,120
What are you doing?

905
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,200
Can you do it?

906
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,640
Got it.

907
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,480
You're good.

908
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,800
Do you know what a bulldozer is?

909
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,480
Mengmeng.

910
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,000
I'm not good at this.

911
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,760
But I'm good at catching dolls.

912
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,360
If you want to catch dolls in the future,

913
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,600
I can catch any of them for you.

914
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,760
Maybe.

915
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,080
Let's have a try.

916
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,800
Maybe?

917
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,200
Bye.

918
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:22,800
Enough.

919
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,480
You want to play this?

920
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:24,880
I want to play it.

921
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,720
I'm good at it.

922
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:25,880
Come on.

923
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,960
It's not heavy.

924
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,320
I'm telling you.

925
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,240
I can do it in one go.

926
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,480
It's a waste of money.

927
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:29,840
No way.

928
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,600
Look.

929
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,680
I'll show you one more time.

930
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,080
Brother.

931
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,600
It's really hard to do this.

932
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,120
You have so many three-parts.

933
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,240
I just need a classroom.

934
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,160
It's so hard.

935
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,160
It's not hard.

936
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,560
It's hard for me to

937
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,680
help others.

938
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,200
I'll give you what you want.

939
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,080
Others will take it.

940
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,760
If I don't give it,

941
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,080
it's a death sentence.

942
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,640
We're brothers.

943
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,080
If I don't give it,

944
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,200
I'll be killed.

945
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,280
Didn't you and Mr. Zhang

946
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,480
make a deal?

947
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,040
If there's a problem with the teacher-student class,

948
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,440
your school can help solve it.

949
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
Now the teacher-student class

950
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,520
has a problem.

951
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,760
How can you solve it?

952
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,720
I...

953
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,240
I'll give a lecture twice.

954
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,840
Three times.

955
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,440
But you're asking me for a classroom.

956
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,920
It's been used for years.

957
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,440
You can't pay the rent.

958
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,000
How can I explain it to the public?

959
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,240
How about this?

960
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,920
For your teacher-student class,

961
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,720
I don't want anything.

962
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,640
I'll resign

963
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,440
and give you the class.

964
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,840
You can be the class teacher

965
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,280
for the teacher-student class.

966
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,760
You can go to the garden

967
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,680
with your face on it.

968
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,680
What do you think?

969
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,560
Don't talk to me.

970
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,160
Alright.

971
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,160
I'll figure it out.

972
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,960
Your yaw

973
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,240
is the best yaw in this hanging.

974
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,960
I'm done.

975
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,200
No.

976
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:26,720
No.

977
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,320
Is it good or bad?

978
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,240
I don't understand.

979
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:29,640
Yes.

980
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,240
What's the specific one?

981
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,040
Good or bad?

982
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,960
The instrument is completed.

983
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,200
How late will it be?

984
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,640
According to the algorithm

985
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,040
of the current age,

986
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,240
the instrument is the best yaw

987
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,640
for the current age.

988
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,480
Over 60 years old?

989
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,600
That's good.

990
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,760
The old Chinese yaw

991
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,160
is the best yaw.

992
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,120
No.

993
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,040
My parents

994
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,200
are young and famous.

995
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,000
But I'm 60 years old.

996
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,280
Do you think it's appropriate?

997
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,360
I think it's appropriate.

998
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:03,880
Why?

999
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,640
I think it's good to be famous.

1000
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,840
If you were like me,

1001
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,400
I would be like this in my life.

1002
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,080
I'm like this now.

1003
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,280
I'm still like this when I'm 80 years old.

1004
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,720
So you're

1005
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,880
comforting me.

1006
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,160
Forget it.

1007
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,720
Let's keep going.

1008
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,920
Thank you.

1009
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,560
Let's go and have a look.

1010
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,960
There's still good food.

1011
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,480
Let's go, Meng.

1012
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,200
Let's go, Meng.

1013
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:26,680
Go.

1014
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,280
Excuse me.

1015
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,800
Let me ask you again.

1016
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,520
Are you a human or a robot?

1017
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,200
Sir,

1018
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,920
what else do you want to ask?

1019
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,440
No need.

1020
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:46,880
Thank you.

1021
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,640
Thank you.

1022
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,920
These two people

1023
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,320
are like a big seven-point city

1024
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,680
and a little city.

1025
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,800
What should I do now?

1026
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
I just feel

1027
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,120
very sorry for you, Mr. Dong.

1028
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,160
You've always been

1029
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,120
a bodyguard.

1030
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,680
Now,

1031
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,320
people are here,

1032
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,120
but there's no venue.

1033
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,720
I'm sorry.

1034
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,280
From that day,

1035
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,400
I should have thought about

1036
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,480
drinking the wine of the dead.

1037
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,880
Actually,

1038
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,360
they don't have to

1039
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,200
help us for free.

1040
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,840
A businessman

1041
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,960
is a man of great power and great will.

1042
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,400
A piece of the cake.

1043
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,480
There are many good businessmen

1044
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,520
who are loyal to the people.

1045
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,400
Sir,

1046
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,280
you always tell me

1047
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,720
that when the mind is moved,

1048
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,160
everything is perfect.

1049
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,760
My mind

1050
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,160
has been moved for a long time.

1051
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,320
Why didn't anyone

1052
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,360
send me a classroom?

1053
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,680
When the mind is moved,

1054
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,360
everything is perfect.

1055
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,360
That's called Buddhism.

1056
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,440
You're so far from it.

1057
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,400
Yes.

1058
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,360
We call it

1059
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,560
knowledge, action, and unity.

1060
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,880
From the fact that you know it,

1061
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,160
it's right.

1062
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,680
When you finish it,

1063
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,240
it's all about your cultivation.

1064
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,760
God has given you

1065
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,440
the level of cultivation.

1066
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,080
It's called the level of shame.

1067
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,760
You're right.

1068
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,520
To be honest,

1069
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,080
I used to think that

1070
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,160
it's not that hard.

1071
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
But now...

1072
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,480
Think about it.

1073
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,960
You've come all the way up.

1074
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,520
You have talent,

1075
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,240
academic achievements,

1076
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,400
and

1077
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,040
the old masters

1078
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,560
are supporting you.

1079
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,000
Of course, you've done well.

1080
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,880
Now,

1081
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,640
you're old.

1082
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,960
I'm afraid you can't support me anymore.

1083
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,080
I'm afraid you'll

1084
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,360
have to support me in the future.

1085
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,120
Dad,

1086
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,640
why do you say that?

1087
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,160
The most important thing now

1088
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,880
is how to solve the problem.

1089
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,880
Yes.

1090
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,360
Yes.

1091
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,280
Ms. Dong,

1092
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,560
I'm really sorry.

1093
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,800
I invited you here

1094
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,560
to the classroom where the class is.

1095
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,000
There's no teacher.

1096
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It's okay.

1097
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,640
This person

1098
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,120
has made up his mind to go the right path.

1099
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,640
The hard work

1100
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,840
must be much more than going the wrong path.

1101
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,800
God will ask you repeatedly,

1102
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,920
are you really

1103
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,760
going to do this?

1104
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,160
Every time I ask you,

1105
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,200
you don't change your mind.

1106
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,080
Then you can finally do what you want.

1107
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,160
In my opinion,

1108
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,480
what's the problem

1109
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,720
you're facing?

1110
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,480
You're still a school-based person.

1111
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,480
You're famous for your outstanding education.

1112
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,960
We're going to be a heritage.

1113
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,880
It's really hard.

1114
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,680
Taoists are particular about finding a disciple.

1115
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,920
I promised you to take this class

1116
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,920
not to fulfill you,

1117
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,480
but to fulfill myself.

1118
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,600
I think

1119
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,000
there are many students in the class

1120
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,160
who will meet the right disciples

1121
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,680
and are willing to go the wrong path

1122
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,440
and inherit everything.

1123
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:52,120
I

1124
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,680
ITY BIBLING

1125
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,360
Let the story seem very atmospheric

1126
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,120
The us in the sunset

1127
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,040
This youth

1128
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:27,840
The more it is, the more complete it becomes

1129
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,480
Missing you is happening

1130
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,160
There are always people

1131
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,520
Who are waiting for you to cross the mountain and the river

1132
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,760
You run towards the years and the stars

1133
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,000
I am sure

1134
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,200
Who are you?

1135
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,320
I admit

1136
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,640
It's not that pure, the heart is so heavy

1137
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,880
I'm already trapped in your eyes

1138
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,120
The feeling of being trapped

1139
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:08,360
The fate of the dream

1140
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:12,000
Is waiting for you

1141
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,840
There are always people

1142
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:19,120
Who are waiting for you to cross the mountain and the river

1143
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:23,400
You run towards the years and the stars

1144
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,600
I am sure

1145
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,840
Who are you?

1146
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,960
I admit

1147
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,280
It's not that pure, the heart is so heavy

1148
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:40,520
I'm already trapped in your eyes

1149
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,680
The feeling of being trapped

1150
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:50,200
The fate of the dream

1151
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:56,280
Is waiting for you
