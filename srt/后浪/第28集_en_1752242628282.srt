00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Untamed

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm not sure about the skin disease.

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If it's a hole in the flower pot, it'll be troublesome.

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll take you to the hospital.

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Three hours.

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The patient's wound is a risk.

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Tianzhen.

9
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You take the medicine.

10
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'll take it.

11
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Is there a needle in the wound?

12
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll pinch it first.

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Really?

14
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Can you pinch it?

15
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I can.

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's take the medicine.

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Well...

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He's a doctor.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He's a very good doctor.

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You can trust him.

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
He's so young.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He doesn't look like him.

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
His family is from the 14th generation.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
His father is a human heart disease.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He's not studying in the Chinese Medicine University.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Well...

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You're a young man with a human heart disease?

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Your father's book is so famous.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's called...

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The Chinese Medicine of the Spiritual Society.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Right.

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We have one in our house.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Please sign it for me.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Thank you.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
He, sign it for me.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He's very good.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Xiaomei, go.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Knock on the door of your house.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Tell him that he's getting better.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Our family has a doctor.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay, I'll go.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Tongtong.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I've never used this prescription.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If you're too strong,

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
let's go to the hospital.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I won't go to the hospital.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I trust you.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Tongtong.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Tongtong.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Are you feeling better after the injection?

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I feel like you can get to the hospital.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll drive.

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Don't take this medicine.

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What's wrong?

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
My god.

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This medicine is quite strong.

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm telling you.

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If you become a doctor,

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
you can't forget me.

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm the first person who gives you medicine.

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll give you my life.

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Do you know that?

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's very important.

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Tongtong.

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Tongtong, what's wrong?

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Tongtong.

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Tongtong, don't scare me.

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Tongtong, wake up.

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Tongtong.

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Tongtong.

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Tongtong, don't scare me.

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Tongtong, what's wrong with you?

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You're still messing around.

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm not messing around.

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I just feel that

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
the atmosphere is very tense.

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I just want to be active.

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't like this.

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Tongtong.

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
How do you feel now?

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I feel very nervous.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Why are you nervous?

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Nervous.

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll hang up before I accept the position of the doctor.

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No, no.

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Let's go to the hospital now.

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
No, listen to me.

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If I hang up,

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll say

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
you have to accept the position of the doctor for me.

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Then help me bury it next to my grandma.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Then put it on the tomb.

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Take a bag of clothes.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Take the medicine.

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And sacrifice.

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Do you understand?

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I won't.

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'll bury you in the tomb of the Wu family.

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And put it on the tomb.

102
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You should take the medicine.

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Why should I bury it in your tomb?

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Is it appropriate for me to bury it in your tomb?

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Your life is mine.

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The person you gave birth to is my ghost.

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What's wrong?

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What's wrong?

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What's wrong, Tao Tao?

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Your belly...

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Don't hang up.

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What's wrong?

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm afraid you'll fall into the pit.

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm a doctor. I have to be responsible for you.

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'll scold you if you faint.

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You don't mind?

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I really have to hang up after I take the medicine.

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Then I'll leave a gap.

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll go.

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Okay.

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Have you made up your mind?

122
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What's on your mind?

123
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Your life is mine.

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What do you mean?

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You're so big.

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No one has ever confessed to you.

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Confess?

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I've never seen anyone confess to you

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
when they were on the big screen.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yes.

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Then think about it now.

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll go.

133
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Okay.

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Do you want your uncle to come

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and show Mr. Ren?

136
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
No, no, no.

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's not the right time to come first.

138
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'll come tomorrow.

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Don't.

140
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Aren't they gone?

141
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
They can't leave.

142
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
They're confessing in the room.

143
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
They're in the room?

144
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes.

145
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What's wrong with that?

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's so weird.

147
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Young people nowadays don't understand.

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Don't you like Mengmeng?

149
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You asked her

150
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
if she wanted to die or live.

151
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Why do you think

152
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
she's like me?

153
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
She's just a patient.

154
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
She's your sister.

155
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Then it's not like I'm your sister.

156
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You're my sister.

157
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm your sister.

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm your sister.

159
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm your sister.

160
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Then it's not like I'm your sister.

161
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What do you like about me?

162
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What do you want from me?

163
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I eat a lot

164
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and I love fighting.

165
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I have no parents.

166
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And then...

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I want everything.

168
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I want you to cook for me.

169
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You can protect me.

170
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You don't have any extra support.

171
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You're brain is filled with water.

174
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Maybe...

175
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's not brain that's filled with water.

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's water falling out.

177
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I've been

178
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
saying this in my heart for a long time.

179
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I thought

180
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I might never say it in my life.

181
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Why did you say it?

182
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Because when I don't believe in myself,

183
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
you're willing to live and die for me.

184
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Then I have to

185
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
marry you.

186
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
God said

187
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I love you.

188
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It has nothing to do with you.

189
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
If you don't like me,

190
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
it's okay.

191
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But

192
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't want you to tell me.

193
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's mainly

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
whether it's right in the ethics.

195
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
We're both parents.

196
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm your grandma.

197
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You're my grandson.

198
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And then we...

199
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
If we're your girlfriend now...

200
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's right.

201
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What's wrong with it?

202
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
There's a real problem.

203
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Your mom doesn't even accept me.

204
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Can she really accept me?

205
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's me who's in love, not her.

206
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Don't worry about it.

207
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Can you not tell your mom about this?

208
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Don't let your mom know, okay?

209
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Coughing, poverty and love

210
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
can't be hidden.

211
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm sorry.

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Then we're still

215
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
classmates.

216
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Then you're

217
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
rejecting me?

218
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I just want to stand by you.

219
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
When I become a successor,

220
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
you can also accept me

221
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
as your family and friend.

222
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
At that time,

223
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
it might be better.

224
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Okay.

225
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Okay.

226
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I promise you.

227
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What's wrong with you?

228
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm fine.

229
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't want to see you.

230
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's so late.

231
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
it means they are together.

232
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

233
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,000
Tian Jun is with him.

234
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
There should be no problem.

235
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Now there is no news, it's good news.

236
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What's wrong, Tongtong?

237
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Does it still hurt?

238
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
How is it compared with what you just did?

239
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's more painful than before.

240
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Let's go to the ER.

241
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's too dangerous.

242
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
No need to go to the ER.

243
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I have a good heart.

244
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'll call my dad.

245
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You lie down and wait for me.

246
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'll go to the ER.

247
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Who is it?

248
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't know.

249
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Answer it.

250
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Hello, dad.

251
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Save me, Tongtong.

252
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You talk slowly.

253
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What's wrong?

254
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
He has abdominal pain.

255
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
His tongue is red and his tongue is yellow.

256
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
His pulse is like a sloth.

257
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm afraid it might be a blue stomach.

258
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And I'm worried about his gastrointestinal cavity.

259
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Did he have a concussion?

260
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
He had a concussion and drank medicine.

261
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What medicine did you give him?

262
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
30 grams of yellow.

263
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
30 grams of yellow.

264
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
12 grams of modan.

265
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
12 grams of modan.

266
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
10 grams of peonies.

267
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
10 grams of peonies.

268
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
20 grams of winter melon.

269
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
20 grams of winter melon.

270
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
20 grams of winter melon.

271
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Tianzhen.

272
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Your yellow modan soup is not bad.

273
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But you used so much yellow.

274
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What's the reason?

275
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
He has acute disease.

276
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I think he needs to take medicine for acute disease.

277
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So I...

278
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's not medical.

279
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The most important thing in the Chinese medicine is to be positive.

280
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You don't even change your symptoms.

281
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You can just add or subtract it.

282
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Send him to the ER immediately.

283
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
The faster the better.

284
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Okay, I'll do it right away.

285
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
No.

286
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Huang, what are you doing?

287
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Tianzhen.

288
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm not going to the hospital.

289
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I've told you.

290
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I have a bottom line.

291
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You don't even listen to my dad.

292
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Go now.

293
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I have no bottom line.

294
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I said I'm really not going.

295
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
If you have a three-way relationship,

296
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
what am I going to do in this life?

297
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm really not going.

298
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You believe yourself, Ren Tianzhen.

299
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
If you're still here, you go out.

300
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Stay out.

301
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
How is Tianzhen?

302
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
She's fine.

303
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
How is Tianzhen?

304
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Where are they?

305
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What's wrong with the investment?

306
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Your son is fine.

307
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I...

308
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Where's Tou Tou?

309
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm here.

310
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Is Tianzhen back?

311
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's you.

312
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm looking for my master.

313
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm looking for you.

314
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yes.

315
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Did you understand?

316
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't know.

317
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Why did you give her such a strong medicine?

318
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Who gave you the prescription?

319
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Tianzhen.

320
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Who's the patient?

321
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's Tao Tao.

322
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Tao Tao?

323
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
This house is fine.

324
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You have to be in touch.

325
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This house has to be Tao Tao.

326
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Just in time.

327
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Don't worry about sleeping.

328
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Thank you, master.

329
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Tianzhen.

330
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Let's go.

331
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Let's go to the hospital now.

332
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Give me the medicine.

333
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You're still drinking?

334
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Just give it to me.

335
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
No.

336
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I think before we start dating,

337
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
we need to set some rules.

338
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
If we don't,

339
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
we can't get along.

340
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What rules?

341
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Listen to me when it comes to big things.

342
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Listen to you when it comes to small things.

343
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What's big and what's small?

344
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll set the standard for big and small things.

345
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
For example,

346
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
things related to life and death.

347
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's big, right?

348
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Listen to me.

349
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Okay?

350
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Take the medicine.

351
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Wait.

352
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What if you drink to death?

353
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
If I drink to death,

354
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
congratulations.

355
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This is your shortest girlfriend.

356
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Go.

357
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Come in.

358
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Hello.

359
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Excuse me.

360
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Excuse me.

361
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Go ahead.

362
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You go ahead.

363
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's okay.

364
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Here's the thing.

365
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
There's a man named Niu in town.

366
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
He's got a lot of blood.

367
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
He's been unwell for decades.

368
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
He can't sleep at night.

369
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Right, Xun?

370
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yes.

371
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
We tried to persuade him not to come.

372
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He won't leave if he comes.

373
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yes.

374
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So we need you to take care of him.

375
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Please.

376
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Mr. Niu,

377
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
it's urgent to choose a cow.

378
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It may take some time to cure him.

379
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But I and Toto

380
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
won't stay here for too long.

381
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
If it's not good,

382
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
we can go to see the doctor.

383
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Okay, I'll go with you now.

384
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Okay.

385
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Mrs. Niu,

386
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
please give the medicine to Mr. Niu.

387
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Okay.

388
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'll go with you.

389
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
This youth

390
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
is slowly

391
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
becoming complete

392
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Missing you is happening

393
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Someone

394
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
deserves to cross the mountains and rivers

395
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
and share the years and stars with me

396
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm sure

397
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You are that person

398
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I admit

399
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm not pure

400
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
and my heart is so heavy

401
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm already trapped in your eyes

402
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I feel it easily

403
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The fate of that dream

404
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
is so deep

405
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
The dream of that dream

406
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Go to sleep.

407
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You can't sleep either.

408
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Are you worried about your son?

409
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
He's been treated.

410
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
He scared me.

411
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I almost died.

412
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's more than I've ever treated.

413
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I don't know how nervous I am.

414
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's boring to raise a son.

415
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
That's right.

416
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
This heartless one

417
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
How can he sleep?

418
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
How can you sleep?

419
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
This kid

420
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
is not bad.

421
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
He knows

422
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
that a shrimp in a big pot

423
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
is just a little big.

424
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Can he handle

425
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
the small thing?

426
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
He can definitely handle it.

427
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You're so confident.

428
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
If he can't handle it

429
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
he can't be a heir.

430
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
How hard is his life?

431
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
From childhood

432
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
he has experienced more

433
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
than the innocent one.

434
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The world is bigger than the dead.

435
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
There's no difference between the innocent one and the dead.

436
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Think about it.

437
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Back then, the Demon Emperor

438
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
wanted to test Shunli

439
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and put him in the forest.

440
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
He fought with beasts.

441
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Compared to this

442
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
what kind of test does Toto have?

443
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
This is the reason

444
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
why you think Toto is fine.

445
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
What reason?

446
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
What reason is this?

447
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
He's still a Chinese doctor.

448
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
In order to test Shunli

449
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
he married his two daughters.

450
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
You're just saying it.

451
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I don't have two daughters.

452
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I only have one grandson.

453
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You, me

454
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
and Linglan and Xinzheng

455
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
will be the best in our lives.

456
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
With this

457
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
how can we have a good child?

458
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Don't worry.

459
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Go to sleep.

460
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I can't sleep.

461
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Good morning, aunt.

462
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Good morning.

463
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
How is the little girl?

464
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Last night

465
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I saw her go to the toilet many times.

466
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
How is she now?

467
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Aunt

468
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
she'll be fine in the second half of the night.

469
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
She should be fine.

470
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
A great disaster never dies.

471
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
There will be a good time.

472
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
She has a boyfriend like you.

473
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
God will always be there for her.

474
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Don't be shy.

475
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm not.

476
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm not.

477
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm not.

478
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Don't be shy.

479
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I'm a new person.

480
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I can see everything

481
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
when I see you carry her in.

482
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Aunt, it's obvious.

483
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Do you need my help?

484
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
No, no, no.

485
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I don't need you.

486
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
You'll be busy later.

487
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
What am I going to do later?

488
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
The girl's medicine

489
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
needs to be taken for a few days.

490
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You can't leave for now.

491
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You can't leave for now.

492
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Can you

493
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
help me

494
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
to check on the patients

495
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
in the town?

496
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Aunt, I'm worried about my medical skills.

497
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm not very good at it.

498
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
No problem.

499
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It's good.

500
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I was buying vegetables

501
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
and passed by Uncle Liu's house.

502
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
His snoring

503
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
and snoring

504
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
is loud.

505
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I think he can hear it

506
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
even in 4087.

507
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It's good to have a laugh.

508
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Aunt, I'm alone.

509
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I don't have enough experience.

510
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
You can.

511
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You can.

512
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Aunt, he can.

513
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Let me tell you, Aunt.

514
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
He's a great doctor.

515
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You can find him

516
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
and get a good deal.

517
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yes.

518
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
That's great.

519
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
We finally invited

520
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
a doctor from the first-tier city

521
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
to help us with the diagnosis.

522
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Our pharmacy

523
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
is also well-known.

524
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It's open.

525
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
You're too kind.

526
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Doctor,

527
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
how much is your diagnosis fee?

528
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
One.

529
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
No money.

530
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
One.

531
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Yes.

532
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
One.

533
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
That's great.

534
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I'll go to see He

535
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
and tell him.

536
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Take care.

537
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Take care.

538
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Boss, one.

539
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
One.

540
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
One.

541
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Ah Zheng,

542
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
listen to me.

543
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
It's not easy

544
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
to get a doctor.

545
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You haven't had breakfast yet.

546
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
After that,

547
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
we'll have a doctor.

548
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Okay?

549
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
How about this?

550
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
We'll call

551
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
the number

552
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
and ask the doctor

553
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
to treat you.

554
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Okay?

555
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Hold this.

556
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Uncle He,

557
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
come here.

558
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Come here.

559
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Here, I'll give you a number.

560
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
You can find your grandma.

561
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Then,

562
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
you can show her

563
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
the old-fashioned way.

564
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
How much is the treatment fee?

565
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Okay, I'll tell her.

566
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
No money.

567
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It's just a diagnosis.

568
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
My grandma and I

569
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
don't even want to spend money.

570
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I'll pay for it.

571
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Listen,

572
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
look.

573
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
This is from the city

574
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
of Daihuang.

575
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Try it.

576
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It's fun.

577
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It's delicious and healthy.

578
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It smells good.

579
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It's still steamed.

580
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Uncle He,

581
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
you're right.

582
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I'll go call my grandma.

583
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Go call your grandma.

584
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Go.

585
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Zhang Dugu, come here.

586
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Hello.

587
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Look,

588
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
give this to your grandma.

589
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Okay.

590
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Here, hold this.

591
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Hold it.

592
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Here, hold it.

593
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
That's right.

594
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
This is good for your health.

595
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
When the doctor

596
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
is treating us,

597
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
it can also be used as a medicine.

598
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
If you need it,

599
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
you can buy some.

600
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It's good for your health.

601
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It's a comprehensive hospital.

602
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
There are so many people.

603
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Little girl,

604
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
doctor Shen,

605
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
come and eat.

606
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You have to eat more today.

607
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
If you need it,

608
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
you can buy some.

609
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
It's good for your health.

610
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Right?

611
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Yes.

612
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Let's eat.

613
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I'm sorry.

614
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm sorry.

615
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm sorry.

616
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I'm sorry.

617
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I'm sorry.

618
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I'm sorry.

619
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I'm sorry.

620
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm sorry.

621
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I'm sorry.

622
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I'm sorry.

623
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm sorry.

624
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I'm sorry.

625
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I'm sorry.

626
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I'm sorry.

627
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I'm sorry.

628
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I'm sorry.

629
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm sorry.

630
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I'm sorry.

631
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm sorry.

632
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'm sorry.

633
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I'm sorry.

634
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'm sorry.

635
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm sorry.

636
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I'm sorry.

637
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I'm sorry.

638
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm sorry.

639
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I'm sorry.

640
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'm sorry.

641
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I'm sorry.

642
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Go now, Xiao Morning.

643
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Xiao Morning?

644
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Xiao Morning?

645
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Xiao Morning.

646
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Xiao Morning?

647
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Surprise.

648
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Sir.

649
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I have something to ask you.

650
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I'm leaving now.

651
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Okay.

652
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Okay, bye.

653
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Bye.

654
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Bye.

655
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Bye.

656
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Bye.

657
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Bye.

658
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Bye.

659
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Bye.

660
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Bye.

661
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Bye.

662
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Bye.

663
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Bye.

664
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Bye.

665
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Bye.

666
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,320
Why hasn't the two kids

667
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,320
come back yet?

668
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,000
They went to do something good.

669
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,720
What good thing?

670
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,000
The chief called me just now.

671
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,040
He's not in good health.

672
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,560
He needs to rest for a few days.

673
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,680
It's good.

674
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,960
He's going to have a checkup.

675
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,200
They said

676
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,720
the village is in a good shape.

677
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,440
It's like a dragon.

678
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,440
There are all kinds of diseases.

679
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,080
Your son

680
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,760
needs to be hospitalized

681
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,880
in the morning.

682
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,440
Don't underestimate the villagers.

683
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,560
They have

684
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,160
many diseases.

685
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,360
It's hard to cure.

686
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,360
Don't worry, dad.

687
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,520
If he has something to do,

688
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,720
he'll call and ask.

689
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,920
How about

690
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,640
we go there too?

691
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,840
Luckily,

692
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,000
we have a big medical checkup.

693
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,880
Trust your son.

694
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,040
When he's on the dock,

695
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,440
you have to trust him.

696
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,320
What did you

697
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,720
eat today?

698
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,680
You never trusted him, right?

699
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,280
I should let Tianzhen

700
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,400
send back

701
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,080
every prescription

702
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,320
and show us.

703
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,440
He is fine now.

704
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,240
Are you accompanied by your dad

705
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,640
when he was wrongfully treated?

706
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,840
Shan Dao, your lecture is in 203.

707
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
I'll take you there.

708
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,440
No, I know.

709
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,040
I'll just come and say hello.

710
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,440
I'll also give Senior a post.

711
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,840
What post?

712
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,240
The post for the school's meeting.

713
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,040
Isn't it a gathering every year?

714
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,640
That's weird.

715
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,440
Those who never praise their son praise him.

716
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,040
Those who never attend the class's meeting also attend it.

717
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,640
The sun is rising.

718
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,040
What's the matter?

719
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,640
Nothing.

720
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,240
Continue talking.

721
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,640
I'll go to class.

722
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,840
30 years.

723
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,240
Xiao Bailing also attended it.

724
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,840
I went to listen to Shan Dao's lecture.

725
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,440
Okay.

726
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,840
Teacher Sun,

727
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,840
the teacher asked me to invite you to listen to Professor Wu's lecture.

728
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,640
I was making lunch.

729
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,640
Didn't you say yesterday that you were going to make soup for the teacher to nourish his stomach?

730
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,840
What soup to nourish your stomach with?

731
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,240
Speak of the devil.

732
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,240
This has pumpkin chicken soup,

733
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:35,200
and also

734
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,840
Teacher Song

735
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,280
It's okay.

736
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,040
She'll forget it soon.

737
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,920
I've never seen anyone

738
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,320
who cares more about her husband than her.

739
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,640
What else?

740
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,400
Who ordered the sesame paste?

741
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
You can order one for me too.

742
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,880
I ordered it for you.

743
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,720
Didn't you say you liked it last time?

744
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,640
I saw you, so I ordered it for you.

745
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,680
Thank you, monitor.

746
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,880
You don't have class tomorrow afternoon, right?

747
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,880
Then you can go to my house.

748
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,840
Didn't you finish

749
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,560
the model you wore with Le Le?

750
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,640
She's been asking me

751
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,880
when my uncle will come.

752
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,760
It's settled then.

753
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,240
Let's have dinner at my house tonight.

754
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,120
Say more.

755
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,360
You're back.

756
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,880
You're so loud.

757
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,400
Is there something good?

758
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,440
Yes, there's something to celebrate.

759
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,360
Really?

760
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:47,920
What a coincidence.

761
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,400
I have something good to share with you.

762
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,720
Really?

763
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,640
Let's have dinner together.

764
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,400
Let's have dinner together.

765
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,680
roadbah

766
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,000
Go away.

767
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,200
What are you doing?

768
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,600
You've got into a fight with Xinzheng again?

769
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,440
Do you even know who Xinzheng is?

770
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,600
Don't be mad at me.

771
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,360
You…

772
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,280
Mine, mine

773
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,320
are all mine.

774
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,800
Listen,

775
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,760
I'm sick of it.

776
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:50,720
Mom,

777
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,080
do you think

778
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,200
men

779
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,360
are always

780
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,320
immature?

781
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,280
You care about them

782
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,560
and they don't appreciate you.

783
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,800
Stop.

784
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,840
You're making me nervous.

785
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,280
Are you talking about the old or the young?

786
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:04,960
Mom,

787
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,840
the old and the young are the same.

788
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,680
The young

789
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,040
are just like Mei's family.

790
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,720
They go out secretly

791
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,960
and call to tell them they're safe.

792
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,080
Look at her.

793
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,120
How many days has it been?

794
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,920
Has she called once?

795
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,560
The old...

796
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,480
The old...

797
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,360
Stop talking.

798
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,160
Stop talking.

799
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,400
You're a girl.

800
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,680
Just tell me.

801
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,120
If you tell your dad,

802
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,200
he'll say you

803
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,560
have a bad feeling.

804
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,480
Actually,

805
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,880
it doesn't matter if it's your husband

806
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,160
or your child.

807
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,480
This house

808
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,040
or this flower

809
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,600
will never belong to you

810
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,240
in the end.

811
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,880
If that's the case,

812
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,000
why do you let them

813
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,120
live your life?

814
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:04,840
Mom,

815
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,880
how did you

816
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,880
spend your life with my dad?

817
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,560
I spent half of my life

818
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,560
with Xin Zheng.

819
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:14,960
I feel like

820
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,360
I still can't understand

821
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,480
his feelings.

822
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,360
His life is so long.

823
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,080
Why do you care about his feelings?

824
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,680
It's best

825
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,800
if he's by your side.

826
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,440
I'm telling you,

827
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,960
marriage is not a big deal.

828
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,960
It's not a big deal.

829
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,960
It's not a big deal.

830
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,960
It's not a big deal.

831
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,840
I'm telling you,

832
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,680
marriage

833
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,680
is like a merchant's prize.

834
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,200
You have to find someone

835
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,360
who's in the same direction as you,

836
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,440
not someone who's behind you.

837
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,720
I think Xin Zheng is nice.

838
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,440
He has a common language with you.

839
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,640
He has a career, too.

840
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,520
Right?

841
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,560
You two are a couple for life.

842
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,840
But I just feel

843
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,720
I'm on the boat alone.

844
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,640
He's standing on the shore.

845
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,320
He's not on the boat at all.

846
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,120
Who was it

847
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,120
who cried and shouted

848
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,360
to marry him?

849
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,160
It was me.

850
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,560
I think

851
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,000
what moved me the most

852
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,480
was his faith

853
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,720
in TCM.

854
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,680
And you know what?

855
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,960
I firmly believed

856
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,480
he needed a virtuous man like me.

857
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,840
That's good.

858
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,640
Don't be so formal.

859
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,200
Don't you like him at all?

860
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,000
So many people liked you back then.

861
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,640
That Wu Shandao

862
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,840
would take you to the cultural relics

863
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,040
and see the morning dew.

864
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,840
He was so busy

865
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,560
that he didn't even work for a year.

866
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,080
You just didn't like him, right?

867
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,400
Right.

868
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,480
Xin Zheng is a good man.

869
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,200
He's not like Wu Shandao.

870
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,040
He's a good painter.

871
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,840
I think

872
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,840
Xin Zheng

873
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,720
didn't take a good look at you.

874
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,920
He came to our house

875
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,920
and went straight to his master's study.

876
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,040
I don't know who it was

877
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,440
who put an apple in it

878
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,600
and put a cup of tea in it.

879
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,280
No.

880
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:18,920
I...

881
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,720
I was filial to my father.

882
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,880
He became our son-in-law.

883
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,560
So you're not filial to your father?

884
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,640
Why are you so annoying?

885
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,640
The world is in a trance

886
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:19,340
the story looks very

887
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,740
we in the sunset

888
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:56,140
Your heart is so heavy

889
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:00,340
I'm already trapped in your eyes

890
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,540
The song of love

891
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:06,860
The fate of the dream

892
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:11,140
is waiting for us

893
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,260
There are always people

894
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,580
who are worth your time

895
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:21,860
Let's share our years and stars

896
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:25,060
I'm sure

897
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:28,260
You are that person

898
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,460
I admit

899
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:34,660
Your heart is so heavy

900
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,860
I'm already trapped in your eyes

901
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,060
The song of love

902
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:48,660
The fate of the dream

903
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:55,060
The song of love
