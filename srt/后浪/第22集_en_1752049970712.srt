00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I haven't seen you for a long time.

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Teacher Meng.

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm pregnant.

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Really?

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Now, there are three children.

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The policy benefit is very good.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Teacher Meng has been wanting a child.

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Finally, I'm pregnant.

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Right.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Good thing.

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Why are you here?

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Tomorrow is the weekend.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I want to take Lele back to live for two days.

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
To spend the weekend.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Did you remember the date wrong?

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Next week is the time for Lele to go to dad.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I will send her there.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's just a matter of time.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It doesn't matter how long it takes.

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The court has given me Lele.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And it's also the time for dad to visit her.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Besides, I never

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
don't let you see the child, right?

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But you are like this today.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You don't even say hello.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You just come to pick up the child.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I can't accept it.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Besides, we have arranged this weekend.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
My baby.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Grandma.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Come here.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Do you miss grandma?

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Grandma, I miss you so much.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I miss you too.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Look, what do you do with grandma?

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What delicious food?

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Little boy, you are so playful.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There is yogurt.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yogurt.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Are you thirsty?

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Go.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Uncle.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Lele.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Do you like to go to grandma's house?

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Do you like it?

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Grandma misses you.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What are you looking at?

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Lele.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Lele.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You don't remember?

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We have an appointment with Sister Jianxi.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
She comes to play with you this weekend.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If you go to grandma's house,

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
we will be happy.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We should be honest and honest since childhood.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Right?

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Lele.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Brother Long and sister Yanyan

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
come to our house this weekend.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Didn't you say you miss them?

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You like to play with them, right?

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Your dad

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
ordered a set meal for your children.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And sister Yanyan

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
takes you to play games.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Dachengbao.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Disney.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Mom, I want to see

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
brother and sister.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I will play with sister Jianxi next week.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Bye, mom.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Lele.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Promise me.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Be obedient when you come to grandma's house.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't make trouble, okay?

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I promise.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Thank you.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Send her back early on Sunday night.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
She has to go to kindergarten on Sunday.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Don't worry.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's go.

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's go.

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Let's go.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's go.

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Qing.

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Tell me.

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
How much can you get every month?

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Mom.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I just started working.

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I can't make much money every month.

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So I have nothing to keep.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well.

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This year, it's spring and cold.

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Our Yu Miao

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
has died half of her life.

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Her money is floating.

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Your brother

101
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
is going to go to kindergarten this year.

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He has to save money for her.

103
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Mom.

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I understand.

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Dad.

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll save more money later.

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll send it all to my family.

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Mom and dad.

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I have no savings this year.

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll buy you two a red envelope.

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Happy New Year, dad.

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Mom, happy new year.

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's all?

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You don't make money as a doctor?

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You don't make money as a doctor?

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Why are you sitting here alone?

117
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I didn't think about anything.

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What didn't you think about?

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You just thought about something.

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Tell me.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You can't solve it even if I tell you.

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
How can you know

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I can't solve it if you don't tell me?

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
My future.

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm not sure about my future.

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I didn't find another job

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
after I came to the city school.

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I didn't expect

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I couldn't move to the city school.

130
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm not a hard worker

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
until now.

132
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's difficult to find another job.

133
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's not as serious as you think.

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
There's no way to solve it.

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But it's not you.

136
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Only me.

137
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You're so talkative.

138
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Let me do it.

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's okay. Let's do it together.

140
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Mr. Long.

141
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Have you heard about

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
the work in the hours?

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You told me.

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
There are many good things.

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
A master

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
is willing to do

147
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
good things for others

148
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
but not for himself.

149
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The hours

150
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
will not be able to move on.

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's just that the hours

152
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
are so high

153
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
that you're overjoyed.

154
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Now it looks like

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
a small seed.

156
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It will affect

157
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
the whole environment in the future.

158
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What do you mean?

159
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Look.

160
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
A master

161
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
has graduated from

162
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
a regular class

163
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and has gone through

164
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
the traditional way of teaching.

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He's doing this

166
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
because he hopes

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
everyone can be healthy

168
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and learn some

169
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
ways to live and die.

170
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
In this case,

171
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
it's not like

172
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
he's trying to make a name for himself.

173
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He can save a lot of money

174
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
for medical care.

175
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
If you don't worry,

176
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
there will be a solution.

177
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I found that

178
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
you're calmer than a master.

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Because I know

180
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
it's God

181
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
testing him.

182
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Is he determined enough

183
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
to do this?

184
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
As long as he passes

185
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
these difficulties,

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
he can be on the road.

187
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
There will be a noble person

188
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
waiting for him in front of him.

189
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
In this matter,

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm not as optimistic as you.

191
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Ms. Dong,

192
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I've been studying Chinese medicine

193
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
for more than a year.

194
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The teachers who came to

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
our class are all very good.

196
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But since I followed you,

197
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I've learned

198
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
what life is.

199
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I also used

200
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
your teaching method

201
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
to save people.

202
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I don't know about others,

203
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
but I know

204
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
it's time.

205
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So I want to

206
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
formally call you a teacher

207
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and be your apprentice

208
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
to learn new methods from you.

209
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Even if the class is disbanded,

210
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I can come every day

211
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
to learn from you.

212
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I believe that

213
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I have a strong learning ability.

214
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
After my efforts,

215
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I will definitely

216
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
follow your method.

217
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What about the other students?

218
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's not something

219
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I need to worry about.

220
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Everyone has their own fate.

221
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
If you say so,

222
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
it means

223
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
you haven't prepared

224
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
to be my apprentice.

225
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I can't take you in.

226
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Why?

227
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I feel something is wrong.

228
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Ms. Dong,

229
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
you once said

230
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
feeling is the soul of the technique.

231
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The teacher also said

232
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
that the most important thing

233
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
in learning Chinese medicine

234
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
is to be able to understand it.

235
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But what is this?

236
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You know that

237
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm a very rational person.

238
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
For me,

239
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
it's something that

240
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I can't touch the edge of.

241
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Have you ever been in love?

242
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
No.

243
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
To be honest,

244
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I haven't.

245
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I think that

246
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
falling in love

247
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
is a waste of time

248
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and emotion.

249
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It also affects my progress.

250
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I was going to

251
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
be single all my life.

252
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But now,

253
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm willing to get married

254
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
for a child.

255
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The word, feeling,

256
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
is the moment

257
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
when a man and a woman

258
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
meet and interact.

259
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You've missed

260
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
this moment.

261
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So,

262
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
it's hard for you

263
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
to feel the beauty in it.

264
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The kind of beauty

265
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
that is not

266
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
in any kind of power

267
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
or purpose between people.

268
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You can't feel

269
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
what I'm saying either.

270
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
There is a heaven and earth

271
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
on people,

272
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
rivers and rivers,

273
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and the universe.

274
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's because you've

275
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
closed this channel.

276
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You're saying

277
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
that I'm getting

278
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
more and more confused.

279
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Can't I learn

280
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Chinese medicine

281
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
by being single?

282
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Can't I pass on

283
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
the love

284
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I've never had?

285
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I hope

286
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
you can open

287
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
the channel of emotion.

288
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
When you open

289
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
the channel,

290
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
you can realize

291
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
the good that others do to you.

292
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Sometimes,

293
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
what can touch you

294
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
is not only

295
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
the good that others do to you,

296
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
but also the good that others

297
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
do to Shan Chu.

298
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The good that others do to you

299
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
is good for the river,

300
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
the good for plants,

301
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
and the good for animals.

302
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
All of these

303
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
will make you

304
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
so moved

305
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and so excited.

306
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You can't feel

307
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
what I'm saying

308
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
without opening the channel.

309
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The gratitude

310
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
we're talking about

311
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
is not just about love.

312
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This gratitude

313
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
is also the joy of gratitude.

314
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What is gratitude?

315
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's the gratitude

316
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
of the water

317
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
to return it to you.

318
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
When others

319
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
are a little better,

320
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
you have to give back to others,

321
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
not to be hurt by them.

322
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
When you can feel

323
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
the good that others do to you

324
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and give back to others,

325
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
you're actually building

326
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
a channel

327
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
of a positive and negative cycle

328
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
with others.

329
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The same is true

330
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
for the technique.

331
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The patient is a person first.

332
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
When you and he

333
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
build a channel of emotion

334
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and can feel

335
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
the positive and negative cycle,

336
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
you can correctly interpret

337
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
the information on him.

338
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The most important thing

339
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
in doing the technique

340
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and being a doctor

341
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
is to give

342
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
love from your heart.

343
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Love is the greatest

344
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
energy in this universe.

345
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The day is here.

346
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Life is also like this.

347
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You just care about the accumulation.

348
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Don't go to the book.

349
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Don't go to the應用.

350
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You will definitely be broken.

351
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
There is a gold and there is a silver.

352
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
One Yin and one Yang, that's the way.

353
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
In doing the technique

354
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and being a doctor,

355
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
the most important thing

356
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
is to give

357
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,960
from the bottom of my heart.

358
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,120
Love

359
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,960
is the biggest

360
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,160
energy in this universe.

361
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,160
The End

362
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,880
Chengyin, thank you so much

363
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,320
for taking care of Jianxi for me.

364
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,160
You're welcome.

365
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,680
I'm alone on weekends.

366
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,280
He can chat with me.

367
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,200
It's time to eat strawberries.

368
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,560
Mr. Song said

369
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,520
strawberries can improve your body and lungs.

370
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,080
Let Lele eat more.

371
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,120
Thank you so much.

372
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,480
You're welcome.

373
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
You always bring something with you.

374
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,880
That's what I should do.

375
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,520
Your clinic is quite busy.

376
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,080
How's your class?

377
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,600
The clinic is quite good.

378
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,360
But the class is a bit

379
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,440
busy.

380
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,440
Professor Ren is always

381
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,400
making a face.

382
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,720
He didn't have much fun with us before.

383
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,840
But this time,

384
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,160
he's in a bad mood.

385
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,480
He may be under a lot of pressure.

386
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,680
After all, he has to bring so many students.

387
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,040
I'll go wash the strawberries.

388
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,000
Did Lele come back?

389
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,720
Soon.

390
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,080
She said she was on her way.

391
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,520
Who is it?

392
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,880
Our little cutie,

393
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,120
Happy is back.

394
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,320
Hello, aunt.

395
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,040
Hello, Lele. You're so polite.

396
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,760
Hello, Jianxi.

397
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,200
Lele.

398
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,520
Jianxi, look.

399
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,560
These are all the photos I took.

400
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,840
Lele is so happy.

401
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,600
Where did grandma take you?

402
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,840
Grandma took us to a big hotel.

403
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,640
There are big grassland and swans.

404
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,000
Lele.

405
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,600
Where did you get the camera?

406
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Aunt Qianqiao gave it to me.

407
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,240
Aunt Qianqiao?

408
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Lele went to attend the wedding.

409
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:20,840
Look.

410
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,120
He's wearing a small suit.

411
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,960
He's so handsome.

412
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,760
Dad and aunt Qianqiao got married.

413
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm a little flower.

414
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,280
Grandma said I'm the most handsome.

415
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,160
Lele.

416
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,800
Did you spend the weekend at grandma's house?

417
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:36,920
No.

418
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,800
Grandma took me to dad's new house.

419
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,480
She asked me and brother Dalong

420
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,080
to make bed for dad and aunt Qianqiao.

421
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,880
Sister Yue Liang and sister Yanyan

422
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,720
didn't live together.

423
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,160
But grandma told me

424
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,920
that aunt Qianqiao has a little sister

425
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,080
in her belly.

426
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,320
I'll be her brother in the future.

427
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,800
Mom, what's wrong with you?

428
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,840
Go wash your hands.

429
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,280
Aunt Zhu bought you strawberries.

430
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,480
Go.

431
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,160
Thank you, aunt.

432
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,200
You're welcome.

433
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,600
Miss.

434
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,640
I won't keep you for dinner today.

435
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,320
We'll meet again next week.

436
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,320
Take Jianqi back.

437
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,360
Chenyin.

438
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,080
Are you okay?

439
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,840
I'm fine.

440
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,160
That man has nothing to do with me.

441
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,040
Okay, we're leaving.

442
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,440
Bye.

443
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,960
Listen to me.

444
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,920
Liu Changqing

445
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,520
is really going to kill him.

446
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,360
Do you know that for that body,

447
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,440
Tianzhen almost died?

448
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,760
He said he couldn't find him alive.

449
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,200
How could he do that?

450
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,920
Enough.

451
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,360
Don't blame him anymore.

452
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,320
Actually,

453
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,400
he didn't have to help us.

454
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,080
It's all a love letter.

455
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,600
Who would have thought

456
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,480
that this would happen?

457
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,480
It's destiny.

458
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,200
I think you're right.

459
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,360
It's really destiny

460
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,760
that you can't be in this job.

461
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,840
Think about it.

462
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,400
Since the beginning of the job,

463
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,960
things have been happening

464
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,280
every day.

465
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,440
Actually, I think

466
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,880
it's good for you.

467
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,560
The job is over.

468
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,040
The students go back to their homes

469
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,240
and find their mothers.

470
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,840
Master.

471
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,400
Madam.

472
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,040
I must continue

473
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,000
the job.

474
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,800
Maybe

475
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,880
I'll find another wife.

476
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,920
Don't worry.

477
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,120
I'll find another wife.

478
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,880
Ye Lin.

479
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,240
Wait.

480
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,640
Don't go, Ye Lin.

481
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,840
She's upset.

482
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,640
Why don't you tell me

483
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,520
the important things that

484
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,640
you're doing right now?

485
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,000
Chengying,

486
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,000
what's wrong?

487
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,000
You let my son

488
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:14,880
set the florist

489
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,440
to have a back row as child Apps.

490
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,440
How could you do it?

491
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,360
Did I assign you the iron both?

492
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,280
Why do I want you to prepare?

493
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,240
Besides,

494
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,360
I told you

495
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,480
I'm taking Lele back home

496
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
to celebrate the weekend?

497
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,040
But you didn't tell me

498
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,080
to let him attend his father's wedding.

499
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,280
What's the difference?

500
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,680
Besides, you already know it.

501
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,080
We're afraid you'll get angry if we don't tell you.

502
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,680
Look at your reaction now.

503
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,680
You're not good to yourself.

504
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,480
You think you can get married without telling me?

505
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,080
I'm telling you, from now on,

506
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,680
don't think about seeing your grandson again.

507
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,280
What do you mean by that?

508
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,880
I'm just curious.

509
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,880
Le Le is my grandson. I can see him whenever I want.

510
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,080
Why won't you let me see him?

511
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,080
Don't be so mean.

512
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,280
It's your son who has wronged me and our family.

513
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,080
Chenyin, it's my son who has wronged you.

514
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,280
But now, we've left the house to you.

515
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,880
We've given you money.

516
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,280
My grandson has given you everything.

517
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,480
My son has a new family now.

518
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,080
Chenyin, you have to learn to turn the tables.

519
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,080
You have to live your life.

520
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,880
And no matter if you like my son or not,

521
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,480
your son will have a sister.

522
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,280
They're a family.

523
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,480
You can't deny this.

524
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,280
Okay, okay.

525
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,480
Since you're going to have a new granddaughter,

526
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,280
then pretend you don't have a grandson.

527
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,480
From now on, I'm asking you, the Feng family,

528
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,680
to stay away from my son.

529
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,880
I won't allow you to get close to him again.

530
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,680
And I'm telling you,

531
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,680
my son is my only son. He doesn't have a sister.

532
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,080
I said no, but he doesn't have one.

533
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,280
Is she crazy?

534
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,480
Hello?

535
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,280
Hello, Lele.

536
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,080
I have something to tell you.

537
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,880
From now on,

538
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,680
except me,

539
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,680
no one is allowed to take Lele away.

540
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,480
Her father and grandparents can't do that either?

541
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,680
They've all come to pick Lele up before.

542
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,880
Especially them.

543
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,080
If I find out that they've taken my son away,

544
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,680
I'll call the police.

545
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,680
I'll call the police.

546
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,680
I'll call the police.

547
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,880
This isn't something that we can decide.

548
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,480
Why don't you discuss it together?

549
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,680
The two sides have signed an agreement.

550
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,880
From now on, only mom can pick Lele up.

551
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,680
No dad and grandma can pick her up.

552
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,080
You need a basis.

553
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,680
I'll take care of it.

554
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,480
Don't you think so?

555
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,680
Teacher Zhang,

556
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,880
you're a woman too.

557
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,680
How can you stand by them?

558
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,080
You've misunderstood. I'm not standing by them.

559
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,680
I think this isn't something that we can decide.

560
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
I think...

561
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,080
Why don't you discuss it with her father?

562
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,280
After the injury is healed,

563
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,080
you can't let adults have a conflict with your child, right?

564
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,080
Hello? Hello?

565
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,880
Hello?

566
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,080
Sell house?

567
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,680
Yes.

568
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,080
I want to sell the house.

569
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,080
If I have the money,

570
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,480
I can run it normally after I get the 10% of the amount.

571
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,880
Sell what house?

572
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,080
Where is there a house to sell it to you?

573
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,280
Our house...

574
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,280
Our house...

575
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,480
From buying a house to renovating it,

576
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,080
you haven't even spent a penny.

577
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,680
How dare you say it out?

578
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,080
I agree.

579
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,880
I'll pay.

580
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,880
It's useless if you agree.

581
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,680
There's no name on the house book.

582
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,680
Lingnan, don't be so narrow-minded.

583
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,880
My husband and my disciple,

584
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,480
they are people who want to do great things.

585
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,480
We are all his.

586
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,880
We have our own interests.

587
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,280
In the future, he will bring out a good disciple,

588
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,680
Liu Fangbaishi.

589
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,080
You can write a poem about this

590
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,680
as a teacher's wife.

591
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,680
Then you say,

592
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,880
Master Kong Liu Fangbaishi,

593
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,080
whose wife's surname is Shen?

594
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,280
He has 3,000 disciples.

595
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,280
He has no wife.

596
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,080
He's divorced.

597
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,280
That's after he sold the house, right?

598
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,480
Times are different now.

599
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,480
Now, the class is lost.

600
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
If you don't say anything, it's gone.

601
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,080
I can't just watch

602
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,480
and pull this team together.

603
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,080
It'll be gone if I say so.

604
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,880
You can't just think about the class.

605
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
Think about your son.

606
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,880
He's at the age of marriage.

607
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,880
Which girl would want to marry a man

608
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,080
who has no family?

609
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,280
Tianzhen has such a good family.

610
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,680
We've provided him with such a good education.

611
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,280
He's willing to get old for his partner.

612
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,480
He doesn't need to get married.

613
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,280
Lingnan is right.

614
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,480
When a child grows up, he needs to be respected.

615
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,680
Our family can't be without a plan.

616
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,480
You're on the right side.

617
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
Then buy me this one.

618
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,880
Dad!

619
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,280
It's written on the house book

620
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,880
my name and your mom's name.

621
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,480
I agree.

622
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,480
You're not mad anymore, right?

623
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,880
I...

624
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,480
Mom, he's the owner of our house.

625
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,480
The owner is with me.

626
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,880
It's a small matter.

627
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,080
It's a big matter.

628
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,680
It's up to your dad.

629
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,680
You're all over the place.

630
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,680
You're all over the place.

631
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,880
Why are you still so stubborn?

632
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,280
Think about it.

633
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,280
Where are we going to live after this house is sold?

634
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,480
You have a student.

635
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,880
Where is he going to live?

636
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,080
Where are we going to live?

637
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,080
We're not going to live on the street.

638
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,080
When your mom and I were young,

639
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,080
we lived in a house of 30 square meters

640
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,080
with our teachers, parents, brothers and sisters.

641
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,080
We lived in that house.

642
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,480
Lingnan,

643
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,680
you're just living a good life.

644
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,480
You don't have your mom's style.

645
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,080
Your mom is a great woman.

646
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,480
She's living a good life.

647
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,480
She's living a hard life.

648
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,480
From this point of view,

649
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,680
Xinzhe,

650
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,880
the woman you're looking for

651
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,880
is not as good as the woman I'm looking for.

652
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,080
Then I'll divorce her.

653
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,480
Go ahead.

654
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,680
Bring the baby.

655
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,880
Mom.

656
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,480
Mom, do I really take it?

657
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,480
Of course you do.

658
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,480
Master,

659
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,480
I'm sorry.

660
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,480
I've already become a man.

661
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,080
I even made you...

662
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,480
I even made you bear the consequences.

663
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
It's not a burden.

664
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,480
It's a test.

665
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,480
There's a god in the world.

666
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,080
They're watching.

667
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,680
They're watching how determined we are

668
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,480
to carry on this legacy.

669
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,280
This society is too complicated.

670
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,280
Everything is urgent and fast.

671
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,480
Look at the door of our community.

672
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,480
There are three houses selling houses and four houses selling phones.

673
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,280
But the hospital,

674
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,880
our family,

675
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880
has been working for 20 years.

676
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,280
And we've been cultivating talents.

677
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,080
Ten years of work,

678
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,480
a hundred years of people.

679
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,880
I'm almost at this hundred years.

680
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,280
I want to give you everything I can.

681
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,680
You're so kind to me.

682
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,280
You're so kind to me.

683
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,280
Thank you, Master.

684
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,680
All right.

685
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,280
Honey, don't worry.

686
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,280
We're all capable people.

687
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,280
We can earn money anytime.

688
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,680
When do you want to do that?

689
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,080
Do you think I don't want to go to the Chinese medicine school?

690
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,080
I don't want to continue with the poetry class.

691
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,280
I don't agree to sell houses

692
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,880
because I think this is fundamentally wrong.

693
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,280
Think about it.

694
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,680
You have such a social status.

695
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,080
And at this age,

696
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,880
you're living such a miserable life.

697
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,280
How will your students look at you?

698
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,080
Who will come?

699
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,280
Those who are a little bit smart

700
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,280
will all go to the investment school with Buffett.

701
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,280
99% of Buffett's earnings

702
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,280
are earned after the age of 60.

703
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,280
Honey,

704
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,480
we have to walk the right path.

705
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,880
We will never cheat.

706
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,280
We have to make friends with time.

707
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,280
We have to endure loneliness.

708
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,880
We doctors

709
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,880
can't always be for a penny.

710
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,680
I don't think it's good to earn money.

711
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,680
I don't want to.

712
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,480
Those who really learn Chinese medicine must be dedicated.

713
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,480
They see me so hard now.

714
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,480
They all look at me and don't leave me.

715
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
This is the real good side.

716
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,080
Those who look at Buffett for hundreds of billions of yuan

717
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,280
never see that they have donated hundreds of billions.

718
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,280
They can't learn well from the investment.

719
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,680
I will never let them come to me to learn Chinese medicine.

720
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,280
Right.

721
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,480
We just want to learn from the farmers.

722
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,480
We have to make a profit.

723
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,280
Sometimes, we make a profit, but we don't necessarily make a profit.

724
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,480
But they still have to work.

725
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,680
This is the right path.

726
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,280
We have to walk this path.

727
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,680
Coming.

728
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,280
Here.

729
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,880
I heard that women are good at hiding private money.

730
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,080
You didn't hide two more.

731
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,880
I don't do secret business.

732
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,280
No, you didn't?

733
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,880
Just this one?

734
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,880
Master, Madam.

735
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,880
I can't take your house.

736
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,680
I'm kidding.

737
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,480
People are so shameless.

738
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,880
It's enough to be shameless.

739
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,880
Lingda, I'm old. You can raise me.

740
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,880
Of course, I can raise you. What do you want to say?

741
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,480
Come.

742
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,680
I don't want to.

743
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,680
I really want to.

744
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,080
I can't reason with you.

745
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,080
Are you serious?

746
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,680
Then...

747
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,280
I have to work.

748
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,280
I don't want you to lie to me.

749
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,480
Master.

750
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,280
Can you pat me?

751
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,680
I don't want to.

752
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,240
I don't Otherwise,

753
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,840
he should be lessoned.

754
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,440
I don't mean it like that.

755
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,600
As you like granddaughter,

756
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,480
I trust you.

757
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,480
I swear to you not to.

758
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,680
It's heard by you...

759
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,360
after knowing your daughter.

760
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,120
7 years ago,

761
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,880
it was my first time seeing you.

762
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,520
and

763
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,040
he's not going to

764
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,680
gamble.

765
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,960
He's going to study.

766
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,360
It's normal

767
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,560
to succeed

768
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,240
or fail in studying.

769
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,880
It has nothing to do with his character.

770
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,240
But it has to do with his ability.

771
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,560
Aren't you worried

772
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,440
if his ability is good or not?

773
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,280
Let me ask you.

774
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,320
What does the Chinese medicine

775
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,320
doctor see?

776
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,920
He sees the patients.

777
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,480
He's a famous Chinese doctor.

778
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,960
He sees people.

779
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,840
When I was young,

780
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,800
I didn't see you clearly.

781
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,280
Besides, you're old now.

782
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,520
Let me tell you.

783
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,200
Xing Zheng

784
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,040
will have a great success.

785
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,160
He will be a great teacher.

786
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,400
Then tell your daughter

787
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,760
about it.

788
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,200
Or she'll

789
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,920
look down on me every day.

790
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,960
I won't tell her.

791
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,880
Why?

792
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,000
They're fighting

793
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,640
and they're happy.

794
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,520
What's the big deal

795
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,120
if they can't even

796
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,000
see their wives' faces?

797
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,200
I believe in Xing Zheng.

798
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,760
Besides,

799
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,720
isn't it more ugly

800
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,000
to see their faces?

801
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,680
Are you embarrassed?

802
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,160
You're old now.

803
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,520
I have no choice.

804
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,840
I'm not capable.

805
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,240
Take mine.

806
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,400
Put your parents' books back.

807
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,200
No.

808
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
You're against it.

809
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,000
I'll take my teacher's books.

810
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,560
My teacher and her mother

811
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,240
won't look down on me.

812
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,480
If I take this,

813
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,800
you'll look down on me

814
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,960
every day.

815
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,800
I used to

816
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,960
look down on you every day.

817
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,080
Take this

818
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,280
and give it to me.

819
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,520
Thank you.

820
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,960
Thank you.

821
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,360
Thank you.

822
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,560
Thank you.

823
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,800
Thank you.

824
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,960
Here.

825
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,200
Give the book

826
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,000
back to your teacher.

827
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,840
I don't want him to know

828
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,600
I've been away for a few days.

829
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,720
Thank you.

830
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,240
Thank you.

831
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,960
Thank you.

832
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,920
Thank you.

833
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,600
I have a suggestion.

834
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,880
You should be nicer to me.

835
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,880
I'm a person

836
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,760
with status and status.

837
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,960
I have millions of Weibo fans.

838
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,960
And I have many female apprentices.

839
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,680
Don't be afraid.

840
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,160
I don't want anything.

841
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,200
I'm afraid you're insecure.

842
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,120
Do you have

843
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,800
a female apprentice

844
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,320
who sells houses and lets you study?

845
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,960
If you have one, tell me.

846
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,280
I'll send you

847
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,280
a package

848
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,640
and send it to her.

849
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,920
I'll pay the express.

850
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,080
And you can't

851
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,520
return the goods.

852
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,680
The express is expensive.

853
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,680
I have the money.

854
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,680
I'm sorry.

855
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,680
I'm sorry.

856
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,680
I'm sorry.

857
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,680
I'm sorry.

858
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,680
I'm sorry.

859
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,680
I'm sorry.

860
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,680
I'm sorry.

861
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,680
I'm sorry.

862
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
I'm sorry.

863
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,680
I'm sorry.

864
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,680
I'm sorry.

865
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,680
I'm sorry.

866
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,680
I'm sorry.

867
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,680
I'm sorry.

868
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,680
Come on.

869
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,680
Thanks.

870
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,680
Tianzhen.

871
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,680
Professor Ren

872
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,680
has been staring at

873
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,680
the map for days.

874
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,680
Still, he didn't find the place.

875
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,680
He shouldn't have done that.

876
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,520
Professor Ren is a famous doctor, right?

877
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,080
There are so many relationships in the country.

878
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,280
If he gets sick, will he get a response soon?

879
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,880
Miss Xia, you don't know.

880
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,480
My dad and my uncle have two paths.

881
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,280
He doesn't like to deal with rich people, so he pushed them to my uncle.

882
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,880
He only treats the poor.

883
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,680
If you ask him to beg the rich, he won't get enough.

884
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,880
If you ask him to beg the poor, he won't get enough.

885
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,880
In the end, you have to blame Liu Changqing.

886
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,280
I'll think about it first.

887
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,680
Miss Xia, there are two people who are taking leave from the city hall.

888
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,480
The schedule and the schedule list will be re-arranged.

889
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,880
Yes. There are many people who are taking leave these two days.

890
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,880
I think the key is to hire a professional.

891
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,280
Please.

892
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,880
You can't expect all the students from the city hall.

893
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,280
I'll leave this to you.

894
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,880
Don't worry.

895
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,280
Mengmeng, what are you doing?

896
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,080
I'm washing my hair.

897
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,080
Go with them.

898
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,640
GLL is full.

899
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,640
You lost the bait with this money.

900
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,880
Then how are you still going to open the report car for Li F grain?

901
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,640
I'm not calling the police.

902
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,240
and he's here to get medicine.

903
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,200
That's good.

904
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,440
Look.

905
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,240
After three or five years,

906
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,320
you can follow him.

907
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,840
After three or five years,

908
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,160
you can go out.

909
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,040
By the time, think about it.

910
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,200
You're the most professional

911
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,120
in terms of professionalism and medical science.

912
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,040
You're the best.

913
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,320
Miss Xia,

914
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,120
I think so.

915
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,400
But he doesn't

916
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,560
follow our plan.

917
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,440
Look.

918
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,680
If our clinic

919
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,360
can't find a better dentist than me,

920
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
I might be

921
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,840
in this position.

922
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,120
But I have

923
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,160
the right to be the dentist

924
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,320
in my hands.

925
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,200
Right?

926
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,920
That's not as good as me.

927
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,680
You can follow me

928
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,840
after five years

929
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,800
and you can go out.

930
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,080
It's the tradition.

931
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,840
Different people have different fates.

932
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,440
It's not easy.

933
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,440
Boss.

934
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,760
Shi Ouchu's teaching is so weird.

935
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,440
What is it?

936
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,480
I want you to

937
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,240
give me a ride the longer you want.

938
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,520
Dad is waiting for me.

939
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,160
Thank you.

940
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,320
Thank you.

941
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,480
damaged by the rain

942
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,720
can't stop me.

943
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,120
It was where I fell

944
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:46,840
before falling.

945
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,640
Seriously?

946
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,160
He and daughter

947
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,960
have lived together

948
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,920
since childhood.

949
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,200
Now they live together?

950
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,200
Are you serious?

951
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,080
I'm sorry.

952
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,960
You're dead!

953
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,760
Help!

954
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,880
Yue, calm down!

955
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,360
You... you... you...

956
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,360
Why did you turn your face around?

957
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:06,840
Stop! Stop! Stop!

958
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,920
I'll send you to the hospital.

959
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,840
Why did you push me?

960
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,200
Calm down! Calm down!

961
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:10,840
You...

962
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,840
Didn't you already die?

963
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,280
Why are you shouting again today?

964
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,120
Gotcha!

965
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,800
I'll kill you today!

966
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,640
l'm sorry!

967
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,680
Tell Xia Laggyao

968
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,120
I'll wash the behaviors.

969
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:39,840
Go ahead.

970
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,920
You and Bullet's family

971
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,280
fell into a fight.

972
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,840
You got controls of a Bachy什麼

973
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,720
你瞭解嗎

974
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,800
When我出院一個監視手

975
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,600
Without any errors,

976
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,340
I would never learn the skill,

977
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,920
or since my disagree with you.

978
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,200
Even if you call the police,

979
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,680
in doing so this is the lowest reality.

980
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,560
I got the school eviction

981
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,080
because many people

982
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:28,080
I used to take the polycanthazone.

983
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,880
But I didn't want to.

984
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,080
I just coughed.

985
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,480
Cough?

986
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,480
Cough.

987
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,880
Then I changed to another mask.

988
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,480
I also took a tonic.

989
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,880
But the effect was not very good.

990
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,680
I had to take a flight in the future.

991
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,280
Now the doctor recommended me to take the polycanthazone.

992
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,680
I want to try again.

993
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,880
So I will come to you with a big balloon.

994
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,880
How did you know me?

995
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,680
I read your book.

996
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,880
The spirit of the soul.

997
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,280
There are patients who are the same as me.

998
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,680
They are all sick.

999
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,880
You have cured him.

1000
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,880
So I came to you.

1001
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,480
Miss Bally.

1002
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,680
I am sorry.

1003
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,680
Jasmine is my name.

1004
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,680
You can call me Molly.

1005
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,280
Molly.

1006
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,280
Molly.

1007
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,480
Molly.

1008
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,880
Molly.

1009
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,280
