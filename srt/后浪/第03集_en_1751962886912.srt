00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Eight o'clock. Very accurate.

4
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,200
Emperor's inner capital.

5
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,800
Ask quickly.

6
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,600
Starting today, you are the apprentice of the ten-storied class.

7
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Start learning Chinese medicine with me.

8
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,400
I'll let you do whatever you want.

9
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,000
I can't learn it.

10
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,400
I'm not joking with you.

11
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,000
I've been sleepy since I saw the words.

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,400
My brain is dizzy. Really.

13
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,000
We signed the contract.

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,400
Signed the contract?

15
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,200
I can't learn this.

16
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,000
How about...

17
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll clean up your room and cook you a meal?

18
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Don't kick your back. Put it down.

19
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,400
Your back hurts.

20
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,000
Your hip hurts, right?

21
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,600
Right.

22
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,000
How did you know?

23
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,400
This is the result of your kicking your back.

24
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Not bad. You're quite a doctor.

25
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
A very good doctor.

26
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
How good?

27
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
More than you can imagine.

28
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,400
How good is it to be more than I can imagine?

29
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,600
Looks like your imagination isn't strong enough.

30
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,000
You drank this morning.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,800
You drank so much food.

32
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,600
I never drink alcohol.

33
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,400
You said you wanted to start a...

34
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
What class?

35
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Ten-storied class.

36
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,400
You're just fooling around after drinking?

37
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,800
I never fool anyone.

38
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
I'm telling you, if I want to start a ten-storied class,

39
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,000
I just need to open my mouth.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,800
I can't close the door.

41
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,400
You're just saying it.

42
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Try it if you don't believe me.

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Little friend.

44
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,600
Experiment.

45
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,800
The data from the animal experiment I did last time came out.

46
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,000
You can analyze it for me.

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,400
I haven't seen you for a week. You have a cool personality.

48
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,000
You really want to go on a tough road?

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Don't come to me. I'm not in the mood.

50
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
What's wrong with you?

51
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,000
It's your Chinese medicine that caused trouble. Let us carry it.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I want to have emotions. Emotions are the source of evil.

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,400
That child's parents hit him.

54
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,800
What about Luoran?

55
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,800
He's just going to believe in Chinese medicine's nonsense and take medicine.

56
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,200
If he gets sick, he'll fall in love with us.

57
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,400
You can't talk nonsense.

58
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,800
What evidence do you have to say that our Chinese medicine is bad?

59
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,600
Enough. I'm scared of your Chinese medicine.

60
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,800
It's not good to be greedy.

61
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,600
Don't.

62
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Dr. Peng.

63
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Experimental brother.

64
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,200
I was going to ask you to do more experiments with me.

65
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,000
I really don't understand you.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,200
You're a good Chinese medicine teacher. Why do you always learn Chinese medicine?

67
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,600
Your father didn't agree. Why did you do such a bad thing?

68
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,400
I didn't learn it for him.

69
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,800
If he doesn't agree, I won't do it. Why?

70
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,000
Besides, I just want to prove to him that

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Chinese medicine has a clear path.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,800
Fine.

73
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,000
Master Ren is smart and has a high standard.

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,800
Master Ren is brave and brave.

75
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,800
We're not good at this. You can leave.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,600
Why are you packing up?

77
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,400
I have something to do at the hospital. I want to take a break.

78
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Let me take a break for a few days.

79
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,200
You're taking a break?

80
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,000
Master Ren.

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,400
I'll find you a good student.

82
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,000
Can someone come?

83
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,800
I have a question.

84
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,600
I have a very meaningful thing. Do you want to hear it?

85
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
What is it?

86
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,800
My father has a Chinese medicine teacher.

87
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Why don't you come and learn it?

88
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,400
Are you okay?

89
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Why do I have to learn Chinese medicine?

90
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,200
You think you're lucky and your child is not miserable enough?

91
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,400
The Chinese medicine in your eyes doesn't even know the ingredients of a molecule.

92
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,000
The absorption of the agent is not clear. The negative reaction is not clear.

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,800
The drug-efficient-function formula is not clear.

94
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,400
You can use such tricks to cheat money?

95
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,200
You're a liar.

96
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
You're a liar.

97
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,000
Just pretend to fight a fight.

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
See if you can find the evidence that Chinese medicine is a false science.

99
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Are you your father's biological son?

100
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,200
You have a grudge against your father?

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,600
You want to kill your father by using your hands, right?

102
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,600
Using your hair to make a mess.

103
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,800
Who is better at seeing the truth?

104
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,400
How about it?

105
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,200
Brother Shi Yan.

106
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Don't regret it.

107
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,600
The judgment is as follows. Please write your order.

108
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,200
According to the Law of the People's Republic of China,

109
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,000
Article 113,

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,800
Article 159,

111
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,000
Article 161,

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,400
the judgment is as follows.

113
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,600
The defendant, Feng Zhuo, should pay the original charge of 3,120 million yuan

114
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,200
and pay the remaining interest.

115
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,000
If you don't accept this judgment,

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,600
you can submit your complaint to the court within 15 days

117
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,600
from the day the judgment is delivered.

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Jiangzhou medical school is not a place to be.

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,600
Lawyer Kong, I'll let you go.

120
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
See you later.

121
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,400
I think we should just see each other later.

122
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,800
Someone fainted!

123
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,200
What happened?

124
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Someone fainted?

125
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,800
Lawyer Kong, are you okay?

126
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
Lawyer Kong!

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Are you afraid of heart attack?

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,200
This is heart attack.

129
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,600
He fainted.

130
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Hurry up.

131
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,600
So,

132
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
I went to the class of senior students,

133
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
but I didn't get the reward from your father.

134
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
This is why I'm here to see you.

135
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
What are you talking about?

136
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,400
So lively.

137
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,800
Liao Qiang, you're here at this time?

138
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,600
I heard you two talking from afar.

139
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,400
You're talking nonsense.

140
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,800
You're talking nonsense.

141
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,400
You were still in the Chinese Medical Academy yesterday.

142
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,200
Why are you here today?

143
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,000
Don't mention it.

144
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The hospital sent me a letter of rejection last night.

145
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The Department of Health said they would recruit a specialist.

146
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'll try it.

147
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,400
I told him a long time ago.

148
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
You still don't believe me?

149
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,800
You can go to my grandpa's clinic.

150
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
There's no problem.

151
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,200
No.

152
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,400
My parents said

153
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,600
I must get a job with a good qualification.

154
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,000
If I can stay in Jiangzhou,

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,800
I can take my brother out.

156
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
When I make money,

157
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,600
I'll borrow money from my parents and relatives.

158
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,000
It's not easy for you.

159
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,200
You're taking the college entrance exam for the whole village.

160
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,000
Here.

161
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,600
Take the fruit and milk back.

162
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:53,620
It's a

163
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I can't go to school or the hospital this time.

165
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
My dad has a Chinese medical college entrance exam.

166
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'll go there to study.

167
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Mr. Wu agreed.

168
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What college entrance exam?

169
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Can I go?

170
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
Together.

171
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,400
We will go.

172
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,120
I og ad hard to help you

173
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,240
because of theデайтесь

174
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,240
You have brought me to my end

175
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,840
See you

176
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,720
Seems we

177
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,380
have nothing to say

178
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,780
Not the students.

179
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,800
When what they want to learn

180
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,240
and meet is the go-to.

181
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,600
I'm Yu Xin.

182
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,580
There are quite a lot of food at that restaurant.

183
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,100
Can I register?

184
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,780
Do you know what he is doing?

185
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,080
I do.

186
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,100
Do you know him?

187
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,080
Right?

188
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,280
Yes.

189
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,600
Okay.

190
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,680
This is the best for me.

191
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,280
I'm going to help you.

192
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,480
Hello, mom.

193
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,600
Qian.

194
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,640
Listen.

195
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,320
The village head and the secretary

196
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,680
came to our house just now.

197
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,160
They all praised you

198
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,520
and said you were a hard worker.

199
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,720
You are the most capable

200
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,160
in our village.

201
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,520
Dad. Dad.

202
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,160
Come here.

203
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,640
Say something to your son.

204
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,440
Say it.

205
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
You are working.

206
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,000
You make a lot of money.

207
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,920
You should save some for your family.

208
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,800
Don't forget.

209
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,120
We have a brother

210
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,200
who wants to go to school.

211
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,280
We don't have to pay for it.

212
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,360
Dad, I know.

213
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,240
By the way, dad.

214
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,840
Our headmaster

215
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,560
has a morning class.

216
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,760
The teachers are all invited.

217
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,160
I want to follow him.

218
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,680
What?

219
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,960
Morning class?

220
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,640
You graduated, right?

221
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,160
You graduated and you are still studying?

222
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,320
Did you find a job?

223
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,840
I found it.

224
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,280
The headmaster...

225
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,200
The headmaster helped me find it.

226
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,720
Don't worry.

227
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,000
I have a future with him.

228
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,600
I...

229
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,360
I know.

230
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,640
It's the three-pronged hospital, right?

231
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,840
You should work hard there.

232
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,400
You should make a living

233
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,800
for our village, our country

234
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,120
and our county.

235
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,160
Do you hear me?

236
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,680
Okay.

237
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,560
Well.

238
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,200
The headmaster asked me to do it.

239
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
I have to hang up.

240
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,120
You don't know what to do.

241
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,880
You are going?

242
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,080
I have a sense of direction.

243
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,360
You must choose the right one.

244
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,320
Think about it.

245
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,760
You don't go to school

246
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,680
or the hospital.

247
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,520
It means

248
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,800
they are not good.

249
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,520
Tell your dad

250
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,600
to let me go.

251
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,880
Welcome, Zhao Dongxuan.

252
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,360
You are going, too?

253
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,680
Welcome.

254
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,720
Welcome.

255
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,600
Thank you.

256
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,480
Do you have the proper copy of my edition?

257
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,540
Have some more?

258
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,160
I am caraokes.

259
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,120
He can write vector reports.

260
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
I'm here.

261
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,520
Jiangzhou, the first district.

262
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,520
It seems like a country

263
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,720
to build many districts.

264
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,120
How can it be a country?

265
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
It must be the whole world.

266
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,120
Just you?

267
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,120
Do you know that the main force of global treatment

268
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,920
is Xiyi?

269
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,920
Do you know that extending the life of humans

270
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,520
is the invention of the human race?

271
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,120
We never denied

272
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,720
Xiyi's contribution to the world.

273
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,120
You denied us.

274
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,720
Alright.

275
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,320
Then tell me.

276
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,520
Give me a reason.

277
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Don't deny it.

278
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,120
Give me a hand.

279
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,720
Master, help us to check the height.

280
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Then you take care of it.

281
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,320
Zhenzhen,

282
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,720
you just need to be a little higher.

283
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,520
What?

284
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,120
You need to be a little loose.

285
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,720
Yes.

286
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,520
Okay.

287
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,520
It's fixed.

288
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,920
The golden phoenix fell into the well.

289
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,520
Liu Changqing is really a big fool.

290
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,120
He gave us this place

291
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,520
to help us to

292
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,320
clean it up, right?

293
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,920
We have nothing.

294
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,120
We can't use it for anything.

295
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,920
If he wants to find you to fix the needle,

296
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,320
you can do it in the painful place.

297
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
Let's not be a coward.

298
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,920
There is such a good place.

299
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,920
It's a good start.

300
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,720
Look at this broken window.

301
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,920
I can't close it.

302
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,920
Come on.

303
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
No, just open it.

304
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
Open it?

305
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,520
You...

306
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,120
Why hasn't Toto

307
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,320
come back from the toilet?

308
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,920
Toto,

309
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,920
why can't you

310
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,120
come back from the toilet?

311
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,320
There is no water.

312
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,120
I went to the general store.

313
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,920
The water is still yellow.

314
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,720
Is that so?

315
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,720
No, no, no.

316
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,920
Otherwise,

317
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,320
you can tell Liu Changqing

318
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,120
to find someone

319
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,520
to fix the door and window first.

320
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,120
Otherwise,

321
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,520
he will be so angry.

322
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,120
He can't stand it no matter how good he is.

323
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,720
This place is used for nothing.

324
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,120
We should be grateful.

325
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,320
After a while,

326
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,520
you can come here

327
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,320
if you want.

328
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,120
What I want?

329
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,520
That's you.

330
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,320
I don't have a good life like you.

331
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
You always come here

332
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,920
if you want.

333
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,720
I...

334
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,320
I always

335
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,920
do everything myself.

336
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,520
I always do everything myself.

337
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,320
Why do you look at these?

338
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,120
They are all ashes.

339
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,520
When the students come,

340
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,320
the first class is the labor class.

341
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,920
We should be clear-headed

342
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
and listen to them.

343
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,920
The other class is cleared.

344
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,520
We should be clear-headed.

345
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,520
Okay?

346
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,320
What are you talking about?

347
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,120
I...

348
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,920
I'm so tired.

349
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,320
I...

350
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,720
I will find someone.

351
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,720
Qu Yuan,

352
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,720
let me be the successor.

353
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
Now I know

354
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,920
that the successor

355
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,720
is better than being a horse.

356
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,720
You let me come

357
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,520
because I'm here to clean the place.

358
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,520
It's good to clean the place.

359
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,720
The air is clear

360
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,720
and the air is clean.

361
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,720
Enough.

362
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,920
Come on.

363
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,920
If you follow the order, you will be a good man.

364
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,120
If you follow the order, you will be a good man.

365
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
What does it mean?

366
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,320
It's a saying in the book.

367
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,920
It means

368
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
if you clean the inside

369
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,920
and the outside,

370
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,520
you can be like me

371
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,320
and have a deep love.

372
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
God.

373
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,320
If you are a man,

374
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,120
you can do

375
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,320
whatever you want.

376
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
Are you kidding me?

377
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,920
How can you be so good at it?

378
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,720
You can follow the order

379
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,320
and be a good man.

380
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,720
I can't follow the order.

381
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,520
But if I want to be successful,

382
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,920
I can do it.

383
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,120
Look.

384
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,720
I just want to be a man.

385
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,720
I can do it.

386
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,320
Really?

387
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,120
Yes.

388
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
All the money in the bank is in my house.

389
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,520
Money is nothing.

390
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,120
Once you are really good at it,

391
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,520
you will look down on money.

392
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,320
What is better than money?

393
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
It's not important.

394
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,920
Money is just a low-level enjoyment.

395
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,520
It's better than real ability.

396
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
Money?

397
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,920
Wrong.

398
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,120
It's hard to make a living without money.

399
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,520
If you have money,

400
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,720
you can run a school

401
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,120
in the center of the city.

402
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,520
If you have money,

403
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,920
you can use the best office to hold meetings.

404
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,720
Look.

405
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,720
You have no money.

406
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,720
You still have to deal with

407
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,920
these crap.

408
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,720
Tongtong.

409
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,520
Tongtong, be careful.

410
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,720
Don't fall.

411
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,920
Tongtong.

412
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,120
Add another pair of pants tomorrow.

413
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,120
It's cold.

414
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,520
Why are your ankles still showing?

415
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,920
Mr. Ren.

416
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,720
I saw the bed we slept in.

417
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,920
The mattress is too thin.

418
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,120
It's hard to sleep in.

419
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,320
I'm afraid Tianzhen won't get used to it.

420
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,520
How about we let him sleep in tonight?

421
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,720
Not that clever.

422
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,920
Not hard.

423
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,320
I knew it.

424
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,520
We'll be shooting later.

425
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,520
We'll be together.

426
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,920
I'll get you your stuff.

427
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,320
Guys,

428
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,720
please come outside and register.

429
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,920
You need to write your name here.

430
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,320
This is my name?

431
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,320
I mean your real name.

432
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,520
Except for Yang Bing.

433
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,320
Do you need a license?

434
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,520
Do you need to see your passport?

435
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,520
How about this?

436
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,920
Bring your college qualifications here.

437
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,720
Let me see.

438
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,320
Oh my god.

439
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,320
It's like a tour of the upper class.

440
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,520
You're a Chinese doctor?

441
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,720
Medical master.

442
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,720
Western medicine.

443
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,120
Do you know what a master is?

444
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
Doctor.

445
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,320
Tianzhen.

446
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,320
I think we need to check our household registration.

447
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,920
Otherwise, we can fill it in as we want.

448
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,720
What's this?

449
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,120
I see.

450
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,720
I mean my school's leg set.

451
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,220
It's the workshop.

452
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,320
stool.

453
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,720
cart bar.

454
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,520
Go.

455
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
Doctor,

456
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,720
you know what?

457
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,000
Mr. Cha, I...

458
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,560
Okay.

459
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,720
You're here.

460
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,320
No.

461
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,120
Ms. Rebecca.

462
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,960
This is a post-sale post-1982 post.

463
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,720
You can't drink it elsewhere.

464
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,040
You're called...

465
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,400
Rebecca?

466
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,200
I've never met a new girl.

467
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,760
Hey.

468
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,400
W業長...

469
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,760
Me, Uuyang.

470
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,360
Excuse me...

471
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,800
Jie.

472
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,400
Nanchen.

473
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,440
This way.

474
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,120
Chief He.

475
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,360
Okay.

476
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,840
Okay.

477
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:14,880
Boss.

478
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,280
Darling.

479
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,320
Darling?

480
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,920
Who are you?

481
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm his roommate.

482
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,160
Darling is darling.

483
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,120
It has nothing to do with you.

484
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,480
Darling.

485
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,080
Darling.

486
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,920
Here's the thing.

487
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,480
I'm very interested in Chinese medicine.

488
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,080
So I came to the side hall today

489
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,880
to learn.

490
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,560
Learn.

491
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
Our city class

492
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,480
is not a class

493
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,960
that anyone can come to the side hall.

494
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,080
I'm a nurse.

495
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,560
It's not easy for me to adjust a class.

496
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,720
I only listen to it once.

497
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,400
Once.

498
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,960
Which hospital's nurse?

499
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,720
People's Hospital Emergency Department.

500
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,440
You can sit down.

501
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,480
I know.

502
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,520
We sit together.

503
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,280
What's the matter?

504
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,240
Okay, students.

505
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,720
The Class of Middle and Junior High School

506
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,080
is officially open today.

507
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,360
From today on,

508
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,920
we are classmates

509
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,200
on the way of Chinese medicine inheritance.

510
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,920
So before the class,

511
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,680
I want to...

512
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,160
Handsome guy is here.

513
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,880
Please come with me.

514
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,720
The first class is the first.

515
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,000
To our ancestors,

516
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,280
emperor,

517
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,000
and child.

518
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,600
Okay?

519
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,880
Let's go.

520
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,480
Handsome guy.

521
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,320
I like it.

522
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,040
Zhang Zhongjing.

523
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,600
Always

524
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,240
pays tribute to everyone.

525
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,080
Seven tenths of the credit to students for he more speed skills.

526
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,080
It's six, seven,

527
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,880
Three sets of breathe,

528
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Let's go.

529
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,480
This small book

530
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,360
is called The Greatest Book of Book of Book.

531
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,640
Before we begin,

532
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,920
let's read it together.

533
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,680
The Greatest Book of Book.

534
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,800
The Greatest Book of Book.

535
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,160
Tang, Sun, and Zi.

536
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,480
Zhang, Zhan, and Yue.

537
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,920
The Fu and Jing Fong live in Nanjing.

538
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,960
The Cool and Ei species

539
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:29,840
Once colonized all the

540
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,920
To stop the dragon from Achkamont.

541
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,280
Slow down and be calm and masa.

542
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,960
The

543
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,600
The propulsion system is not yet fully equipped.

544
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,840
Don't drag me.

545
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,040
I'll talk to your headmaster.

546
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,120
Why?

547
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:48,800
Headmaster Lin.

548
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,720
Let me tell you.

549
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,400
Wait a second.

550
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,040
I'm not the principal.

551
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,840
The principal has resigned.

552
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,400
I'm the new principal.

553
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,360
What's the matter?

554
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,600
Resigned?

555
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
Impossible.

556
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,760
Isn't he still in class?

557
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,320
He's in the morning class,

558
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,440
but he's not here.

559
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,120
Where is he?

560
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,000
Don't worry.

561
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,160
Tell me first

562
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,520
what's the matter with you?

563
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,360
I can't explain it to you.

564
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,440
I have to find him.

565
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,560
Come back.

566
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,680
Do you know where he is?

567
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,640
Where?

568
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,920
Tell me first.

569
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,320
What's the matter

570
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,840
with him?

571
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,680
There's a murderer

572
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,840
in his class.

573
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,320
It takes seven years

574
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,760
to learn to get a certificate.

575
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,840
Before the class began,

576
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,640
we all took the poison

577
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,720
and went to the capital.

578
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,360
Before the class began,

579
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,680
we all

580
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,000
had to take the poison.

581
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,720
After four years,

582
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,640
we've been taking the poison

583
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,880
and sent to the capital.

584
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,000
It's been melting in our blood.

585
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,480
We've been

586
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,840
trying to be

587
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,640
Sun Si Miao and Zhang Zhong Jing.

588
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,160
Who are they?

589
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,560
How do we do them?

590
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,160
You'll know it later.

591
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,920
Life is about

592
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,480
reaching the highest and reaching the lowest.

593
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,720
We have to set

594
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,280
a big goal.

595
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,160
Even if we can't reach

596
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,040
the same level as Zhang Zhong Jing,

597
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,160
at least

598
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,800
we're not

599
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,480
only looking for Wen Bao.

600
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,480
What's the problem?

601
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,720
I don't think it's right.

602
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,760
I think it's a high standard

603
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,320
to be able to get Wen Bao.

604
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,520
Are you like

605
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,440
a wild boar in the forest

606
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,880
or a wolf in the grassland?

607
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,120
There must be a difference.

608
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,720
You can't just ask for Wen Bao.

609
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,200
You have to understand

610
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,960
the real meaning of coming to the human world.

611
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,080
This name

612
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,560
is very advanced.

613
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,400
Once you understand it,

614
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,040
you'll have a bright future.

615
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,680
You'll be brilliant.

616
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,760
My wish

617
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,560
is for you all

618
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,720
to become a clear person.

619
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,320
If one or two people

620
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,680
like Confu and Zhang Zhong Jing appear,

621
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,480
I'll be very happy.

622
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,200
Why are you laughing?

623
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,480
There's a story.

624
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,360
Is there anything funny?

625
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,080
It's my dream

626
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,800
to teach people.

627
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,160
I don't want to get any benefits

628
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,680
from you.

629
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,840
My only hope

630
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,640
is that

631
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,360
no matter what your purpose

632
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,560
or identity is,

633
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,040
you must cherish

634
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,280
your time here.

635
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,520
Don't meet patients

636
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,920
or unexpected events

637
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,320
without a plan.

638
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,960
Don't regret it.

639
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,760
You didn't learn

640
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,240
a thing here.

641
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,840
Master,

642
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,480
if one day

643
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,000
a person like Zhang Zhong Jing

644
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
appears in your disciple,

645
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,360
can you tell him

646
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,000
that we are his fellow disciples?

647
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,080
Although we're in the master class,

648
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,320
I still hope

649
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,960
you can call me teacher

650
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,600
and I'll call you student.

651
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,320
Don't call me master.

652
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,440
I understand.

653
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,840
What do you understand?

654
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,400
If you make trouble outside,

655
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,360
I won't call you master.

656
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,080
Do you understand?

657
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,560
Okay, students.

658
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,520
Today is the first class.

659
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,080
We're working class.

660
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,040
Let's clean the yard

661
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,520
and clean the hall.

662
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,400
So that

663
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,960
we can go in and out

664
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
and sleep well.

665
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,280
Okay, class is over.

666
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,720
Xin Xin, don't do it.

667
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
I'll do it for you.

668
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,720
I'll do it for you.

669
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,440
Take a rest.

670
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,480
Slow down.

671
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,960
What are you doing?

672
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,600
I'm working.

673
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,400
You can't do it.

674
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,760
So I said

675
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,520
you just give me the money.

676
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
I'll do it for you.

677
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,080
Okay?

678
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,320
No need.

679
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,600
I'll ask someone

680
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,800
if they can give me the money.

681
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,240
Who?

682
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,840
I'll ask someone

683
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,080
if they can give me the money.

684
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,720
Okay?

685
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,480
Okay.

686
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,200
I'll ask someone

687
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,120
if they can give me the money.

688
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,960
Okay?

689
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,920
I'll ask someone

690
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,560
if they can give me the money.

691
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,760
Take it easy.

692
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,560
Don't CC the floor.

693
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,760
It'll be dirty if you do it.

694
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,920
No, I don't like to do it.

695
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,120
But here,

696
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,720
I'm better at work.

697
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,960
Listen,

698
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,080
don't move.

699
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,040
This is not a good idea.

700
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,720
Say no more.

701
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
Keep working.

702
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,920
You should quit TV sekarang.

703
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,640
That makes sense.

704
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:39,360
Right.

705
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:40,840
Naive

706
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,680
You think I played with you

707
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:44,940
Show me

708
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,180
Watch again

709
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,200
Let me go

710
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,220
Young F decisions

711
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,080
No

712
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,140
Here I come

713
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,080
It's hard right?

714
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,380
What happened?

715
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,560
Give it back to my depart

716
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,200
Stop

717
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,060
How come the phone is broken

718
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:02,920
It is broken

719
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,380
Who's that things

720
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,020
I caught him

721
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,380
What happened

722
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,200
Stop

723
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,180
I didn't know he is wall's

724
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,480
What happened

725
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,520
Give it back

726
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,080
How can you fight when you work?

727
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,320
You first.

728
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,240
Are you a ghost?

729
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,400
You're wronged.

730
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,120
Don't fight.

731
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,080
Tianzhen. Tianzhen.

732
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,560
Get out.

733
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,160
Here's the thing.

734
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,520
He came to the police station to find my senior.

735
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,880
I didn't see him.

736
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,960
Besides, I'm afraid he'll get into trouble.

737
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,520
Right?

738
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,520
Don't do this.

739
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,320
I brought him here.

740
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,240
If I fight, I'll get into trouble.

741
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,720
Go.

742
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,840
Stop fighting.

743
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,640
Stop.

744
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,920
Stop.

745
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,240
Stop fighting.

746
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,320
Stop it.

747
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,360
Stop.

748
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,560
Enough.

749
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,440
Stop.

750
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,400
Let's talk.

751
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,760
It's okay.

752
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,920
What's going on?

753
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,400
It's him.

754
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,080
That lady.

755
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,640
She hit me with the guard.

756
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,520
I saw it.

757
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,920
Let's talk.

758
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,480
The person you're looking for is there.

759
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,520
If you need anything,

760
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,800
just tell her.

761
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,320
Don't do it again.

762
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,400
Okay.

763
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,600
The person I'm looking for is him.

764
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,200
The murderer.

765
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,240
Lady.

766
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,160
I don't know who you are.

767
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,000
But I need to remind you.

768
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,080
The second rule of the 246th Article of the People's Republic of China

769
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,680
clearly states that

770
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,960
the fact of deliberately making up and spreading falsehood

771
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,800
will cause harm to others.

772
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,080
Those who are severely punished will be charged with defamation.

773
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,280
You're indeed the first major criminal in Jiangzhou.

774
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,680
Mr. Yang.

775
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,840
You don't know me.

776
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,520
But there's one person you can't forget.

777
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,920
Kong Zhiyuan.

778
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,680
Mr. Kong.

779
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,120
You're him.

780
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,160
I'm the wife of the man you forced to death.

781
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,840
Okay.

782
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,240
Calm down.

783
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,080
I'm sorry.

784
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,760
I'm sorry for what you did.

785
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,880
But I didn't.

786
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,320
You didn't?

787
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,560
It's you!

788
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,400
You forced him to death to win the lawsuit.

789
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,520
You're a woman who's willing to sacrifice her life.

790
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,480
Why didn't you save him?

791
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,560
You just watched him die in front of you.

792
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,880
I'm sorry.

793
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,480
I'm sorry for what you did.

794
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,080
Stop talking, Rui Beikang.

795
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,640
Tell me.

796
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,120
I have nothing to say.

797
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,120
You don't have a heart?

798
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,400
You're a cold-blooded murderer.

799
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,800
You can't die a good death.

800
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,240
I won't let you off even if I'm a ghost.

801
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,720
Give me back my husband.

802
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,000
Give me back my husband.

803
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,520
You two's grudge.

804
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,920
Go out and settle it.

805
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,640
I won't go out.

806
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,440
He's crazy now.

807
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,320
If I go out with him, I'll be beaten to death.

808
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,720
He's right.

809
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,920
Call the police.

810
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,920
You can't go!

811
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,920
You can't go!

812
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,040
The tossing TB?

813
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,760
Give me my bag.

814
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,120
Here.

815
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,600
You can't be too excited.

816
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
I'm too excited.

817
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,520
He...

818
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:03,960
He...

819
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:11,120
He's been

820
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,000
infected or sealed.

821
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,560
Why...

822
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,160
Why did he suddenly...

823
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,400
What happened, Lu Man?

824
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,000
You're pregnant, you know?

825
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,560
Pregnant?

826
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,760
His pulse is very weak.

827
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,240
It's hard to say

828
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,200
if he can be saved.

829
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,360
He needs to go to the hospital.

830
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,560
He needs to go.

831
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,440
My car is there.

832
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,000
Okay.

833
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,720
I'm going into the city.

834
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,680
I'll go with them.

835
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,160
Okay.

836
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,280
Come on.

837
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,040
Clean up here.

838
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,160
We have class later.

839
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,840
Don't worry.

840
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,160
Dr. Song

841
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,000
is a rich man.

842
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,960
He'll help you

843
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,160
to get to the hospital safely.

844
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,520
Don't worry.

845
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,880
You killed her husband?

846
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,040
Didn't you hear?

847
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,120
He said

848
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,280
he's a man

849
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,600
who doesn't know anything.

850
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,160
You're so annoying.

851
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,320
You're a good sweeper.

852
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,280
You can't be a good sweeper.

853
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,320
Don't try to challenge me.

854
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,120
Or you'll be in trouble

855
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,720
if I don't help you.

856
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,440
Got it?

857
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,680
He's out of breath.

858
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,440
The nurse,

859
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,360
come and check on him.

860
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,600
Come

861
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,240
There's a mess

862
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,440
Africano.

863
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,320
You forgot about class.

864
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
I'm sorry.

865
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Well...

866
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Stop acting.

867
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,600
You've walked all the way.

868
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,600
I'll leave first.

869
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,600
Rebecca.

870
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Rebecca.

871
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
Everyone, move aside.

872
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,600
Take some space to breathe.

873
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,600
I can't.

874
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,600
Where are you?

875
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,600
Jiang Beika.

876
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
Jiang Beika.

877
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
It's a flower.

878
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
I'll get the needle.

879
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Here.

880
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,600
Here.

881
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
Here.

882
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,600
I'm fine.

883
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
I'm fine.

884
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,600
The one who wanted to hear this has left.

885
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,600
No, Rebecca.

886
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,600
I really admire you.

887
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,600
You're so good at it.

888
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
Why did you cut my clothes?

889
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,600
What are you doing?

890
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
I cut it.

891
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,600
I cut it in case of emergency.

892
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Do you know how much my clothes are?

893
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Laura Piana, pure and elegant.

894
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,600
23,800.

895
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,600
You cut it for me.

896
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,600
Isn't your life 23,800?

897
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,600
My life is not yours.

898
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,600
I'm my personal trainer.

899
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,600
You really cut it for me.

900
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,600
Why are you so ungrateful?

901
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,600
You saved me with kindness.

902
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,600
How can you say that?

903
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,600
Fine.

904
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,600
You're a lawyer.

905
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,600
You can sue us.

906
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,600
Professor Ren is good.

907
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,600
You couldn't wait to save me.

908
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
I cut it for you.

909
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,600
You don't have to pay me back.

910
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600
It doesn't fit the common sense.

911
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,600
It definitely doesn't fit the common sense.

912
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,600
You're crazy.

913
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,600
I mean,

914
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,600
you can save people with kindness.

915
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,600
It doesn't fit the common sense.

916
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,600
Because you don't understand the reason.

917
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
This position.

918
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,600
Night-time gold.

919
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,600
It's said that

920
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,600
there are nine locks in the body.

921
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,600
This is a lock called soul lock.

922
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
Remember,

923
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,600
in case of emergency,

924
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,600
night-time gold

925
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,600
is pulled forward.

926
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,600
Pull forward.

927
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
Some patients

928
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,600
may wake up.

929
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,600
That's awesome.

930
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,600
Professor Ren,

931
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,600
how long do I need to learn this kind of technique and needlework?

932
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,600
This technique.

933
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,600
Five years.

934
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,600
Five months.

935
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,600
Old Chinese medicine.

936
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,600
It's only worth it when you're old.

937
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,600
At least fifty years.

938
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,600
Five days.

939
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,600
Five days?

940
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,600
Five days?

941
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,600
Can anyone do it?

942
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,600
Anyone can do it.

943
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,600
Wait, my nephew.

944
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,600
I have to learn this.

945
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
I have to learn this.

946
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,600
When the night-time gold hits,

947
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
people will be alive.

948
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
Right?

949
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
I have to learn this.

950
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,600
You're running away without learning.

951
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,600
You're trying your best.

952
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,600
It takes five days to learn this technique.

953
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,600
But you have to know the reason

954
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,600
for the whole life.

955
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
No need.

956
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,600
I don't need to know the reason.

957
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,600
I just need to learn it.

958
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,600
Professor Ren,

959
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,600
you have to teach me.

960
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,600
Lawyer Kong fainted in front of me.

961
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,600
If I knew this,

962
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600
he wouldn't have died.

963
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,600
There's only one life.

964
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,600
His life is none of your business.

965
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,600
It's meaningless to make such a metaphor.

966
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,600
Guys,

967
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,600
you just joined the school.

968
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,600
You don't know the reason.

969
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,600
So you need to know the technique.

970
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,600
We still have a lifetime to learn the technique.

971
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,600
But I have to learn it right away.

972
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,600
I have to learn it.

973
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,600
Professor Ren,

974
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,600
you were right this morning.

975
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,600
I don't want to be helpless

976
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,600
when this happens again.

977
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,600
And we can use the emergency room every day.

978
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,600
Can you teach me first?

979
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,600
Because I have limited time.

980
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,600
I may not be able to learn it with you later.

981
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,600
Right, we have to learn it right away.

982
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,600
We have to learn it right away.

983
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,600
We have to learn it right away.

984
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,600
Okay.

985
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,600
For you,

986
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,600
we'll talk about Chinese medicine in the next class.

987
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:09,600

00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:39,600
