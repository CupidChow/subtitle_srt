00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Give me a smile.

4
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,240
Get lost.

5
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,760
Xiao Hong.

6
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,720
You don't have any grudges with Xiao Peng.

7
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,480
Why do you two

8
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,760
look so happy when you meet?

9
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,080
If you're really bored,

10
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,920
go to the pharmacy and help.

11
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,080
Besides,

12
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,600
you've been running around here for three days.

13
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,520
I guess the hospital

14
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,680
will fire you soon.

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,080
Then you can support me.

16
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,600
Why are you here again?

17
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,000
You've been here recently.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,520
The frequency of your work

19
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,000
was so high when you were

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,600
pretending to be in class.

21
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,240
What's wrong with you?

22
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,240
Are you off duty?

23
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,960
What are you talking about?

24
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,520
Xiao Hong, here.

25
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't want it.

26
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,400
Just drink it.

27
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,520
Drink it.

28
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,560
Xiao Peng.

29
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,520
Xiao Peng.

30
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,680
If you don't want it,

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,320
we'll drink it.

32
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,000
Give it back.

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,200
Give it back.

34
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,840
Give it back.

35
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,880
Here.

36
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,840
You're right.

37
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,880
You're afraid that no one will drink it.

38
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,200
Miss.

39
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,880
Open it.

40
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,560
Do you think

41
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,720
something wrong

42
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,680
happened to my family?

43
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,800
It's like a pig

44
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,440
is licking me.

45
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,440
Is God

46
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,880
going to take us away this year?

47
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,520
It's normal to be sick.

48
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,200
No one is not sick.

49
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,720
Besides,

50
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,480
cancer cells

51
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,160
are not incurable.

52
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,840
It's a chronic disease.

53
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,480
I like what you said.

54
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,960
I think

55
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,200
it's a chronic disease.

56
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
I'll treat it slowly.

57
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,080
Then I'll use

58
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,960
Chinese medicine and medicine.

59
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,920
But

60
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,640
Xiyi asked me to open the knife

61
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,000
to take away all my children's bow and bow.

62
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,000
He said I'm old enough

63
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,040
to use it.

64
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,520
What do you think he's talking about?

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Once I took away my children's bow,

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,440
I didn't have any more chicken and vegetarian.

67
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,400
I'll be an old woman soon.

68
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,680
I don't want to open the knife.

69
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,200
Professor Ren,

70
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,880
I believe you.

71
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,560
I choose to treat it here.

72
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,480
Can you help me keep my children's bow?

73
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,400
It's right that Xiyi asked you to open the knife.

74
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,760
What's the point

75
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,560
of keeping your children's bow

76
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
in this situation?

77
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,680
Professor Ren,

78
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,560
how can you say that?

79
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,680
You taught us

80
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,920
that every organ in the body

81
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,120
is precious.

82
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,520
If we take it away,

83
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,360
we can never get it back.

84
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,280
You said

85
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,960
the surgery should be more serious.

86
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,440
Why are you talking about this today?

87
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,160
When my husband left,

88
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
he entrusted our family to you.

89
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,920
I even donated so much money to the clinic.

90
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,040
You don't admit it when you take it.

91
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,080
You don't care about me.

92
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,040
Then...

93
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,840
No.

94
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,040
I...

95
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:57,960
I...

96
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,440
I know you're not like this.

97
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,200
Tell me the truth.

98
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,640
Do you think I'm hopeless?

99
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,840
I can't hold it anymore.

100
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,560
I'm giving you a pulse.

101
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,240
Please don't talk to me, okay?

102
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,760
I hope you can go to Xiyi for the surgery

103
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,240
because you're old.

104
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,040
Do you know what kind of person

105
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,240
is suitable for Chinese medicine?

106
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,880
Take it back.

107
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,640
Here, take it.

108
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,480
Okay.

109
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,560
Thank you.

110
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,280
Thank you.

111
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,040
Thank you.

112
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,840
Thank you.

113
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,520
Thank you.

114
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,320
Thank you.

115
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,080
Thank you.

116
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,840
Thank you.

117
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,800
Thank you.

118
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,560
Thank you.

119
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,320
Thank you.

120
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,640
Hey there.

121
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,360
Hello.

122
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,160
Hello.

123
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,760
You're Pberserker, right?

124
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,480
You know her.

125
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,640
You must be a fan of mine.

126
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,440
Really?

127
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,200
Exactly.

128
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,040
Yeah.

129
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,520
You're Liu's fan as well?

130
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,720
Yeah, I like him so much.

131
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,800
Handsome and pr MIch.

132
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,880
When he's dancing,

133
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,320
he's like opening his own door.

134
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,140
Slap-his-스터.

135
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,300
I'll be a good person, okay?

136
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,140
You helped Toto

137
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,580
get the tickets a long time ago?

138
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,340
He told us to vote for

139
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,700
everyone in the school.

140
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,340
Yes, including us.

141
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,540
Who?

142
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,620
Who does Toto like?

143
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,860
An idol.

144
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,020
Isn't this Liu's son?

145
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,780
The one who likes to sing and dance,

146
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,820
the one who doesn't like to read?

147
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,380
Yes.

148
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,420
After he joined

149
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,860
this street dance program,

150
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,300
he's been very popular.

151
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,700
He has been in the top three

152
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,700
in recent weeks.

153
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,860
And he also told us

154
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,100
if he couldn't win the championship,

155
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,500
he would be sent home to inherit his property.

156
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,580
We've been trying our best

157
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,780
to win the championship.

158
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,860
You're also my treasured boy's fans.

159
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,940
I know him.

160
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,100
He's a fan of our hospital.

161
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,380
Xiao Peng, you're wrong.

162
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,020
He's not a fan of our hospital.

163
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,980
He's a fan of Toto.

164
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,260
It's my first time to be so close to an idol.

165
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,380
No wonder he said

166
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,980
his fan is Zang Honghua.

167
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,900
He's so knowledgeable.

168
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,140
Even if he's knowledgeable,

169
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,300
he's a fan of Zang Honghua.

170
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,580
We've been

171
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,180
so close to him.

172
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,580
Don't interrupt me.

173
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,260
You said

174
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,740
the treasured boy, Zihong,

175
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,020
likes to have a girl's voice.

176
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,060
I'll go to the internet cafe

177
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,220
to report him.

178
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,580
Don't talk nonsense.

179
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,340
Toto doesn't like

180
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,380
such a shallow person.

181
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,340
You're shallow.

182
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,260
Mind your own business.

183
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,100
Tianzhen,

184
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,620
are you reading the hot search?

185
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,580
Hot search.

186
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,260
Look.

187
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,140
What's wrong?

188
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,820
Mom, you gave me...

189
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,700
Hurry up.

190
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,580
What hot search?

191
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,420
Don't look.

192
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,700
You read it yourself.

193
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,820
Let me have a look.

194
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,660
Look.

195
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,780
I'm a doctor of Chinese medicine,

196
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,220
but I respect Chinese medicine very much.

197
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,380
Chinese medicine is a great subject.

198
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,420
If you have a headache,

199
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,740
don't wait in line.

200
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,660
I'll give you a lecture

201
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,980
when you're a Chinese doctor.

202
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,900
If you're sick,

203
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,220
and the doctor doesn't accept you,

204
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,100
don't waste the money.

205
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,380
The Chinese medicine will take care of you until you're old.

206
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,700
So I hope you

207
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,980
can go to Xiyi to get a knife.

208
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,460
Now is the time

209
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,460
when you can use your power.

210
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,060
Why don't you go?

211
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,180
What stage am I in?

212
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,100
Here's the thing.

213
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,140
The cancer, the cancer cells,

214
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,340
are like cars on the highway.

215
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,300
There are police chasing after us.

216
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,620
How can we catch them?

217
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,980
We must set a barrier on the highway.

218
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,060
Once Xiyi is open,

219
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,900
we'll set a barrier for you.

220
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,740
Only then can we catch them.

221
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,500
Well,

222
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,460
when you're done with the surgery,

223
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,580
I'll clean it up for you.

224
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,180
How long will it take

225
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,940
for me to clean it up?

226
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:02,700
Think about it.

227
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,180
You've been living a bad life

228
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,180
for so long.

229
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,260
So it's a long job

230
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,500
to clean it up.

231
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,260
You mean

232
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,780
I can live for many years?

233
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,580
I just put your pulse on.

234
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,700
You're a long-term patient.

235
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,660
It's okay.

236
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,060
No way.

237
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,220
I'm already suffering from cancer.

238
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,660
How can I live a long life?

239
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,620
Professor,

240
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,660
are you praising me?

241
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,820
People with cancer

242
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,340
can live a long life.

243
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,700
It's a god's will

244
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,340
to live a long life.

245
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,700
We're all mortal.

246
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,660
We eat and drink.

247
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,220
We're all sick.

248
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,540
I don't understand

249
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,060
whether you want to die or live.

250
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,700
If you really want to live,

251
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,340
and miss your old Zhu,

252
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,100
then...

253
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:54,860
I...

254
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,260
I don't miss him.

255
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,140
I want to live.

256
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,540
I want to live.

257
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,820
So I'm giving you this advice

258
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,100
not because

259
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,900
Zhu entrusted you to me

260
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,140
or because

261
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,900
you donated money to the clinic.

262
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,060
It's because

263
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,660
I'm a doctor.

264
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,420
I'll entrust you

265
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,500
to my very good friend.

266
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,340
He has the right

267
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,500
to do so.

268
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,180
When he's done with the surgery,

269
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,740
come to me.

270
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,100
What if...

271
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,740
What if the surgery fails?

272
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,820
You mean what if

273
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,020
there's a drop in 10,000?

274
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,500
Why would it be you?

275
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,660
Go.

276
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,500
Believe in science.

277
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,180
You said last time

278
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,660
not to believe in science.

279
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,980
You said that science

280
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,220
is not the only thing

281
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,980
that matters.

282
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,100
I listened carefully

283
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,900
to your lecture video.

284
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,380
I mean

285
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,820
don't believe in anything.

286
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,820
Don't believe in anything.

287
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,620
Believe in the truth.

288
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:12,900
It's time.

289
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,300
We should fire him.

290
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:14,900
I think

291
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,540
he shouldn't live.

292
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,860
And he's a member of the mission.

293
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,060
The Education Bureau is also scared.

294
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,900
He's really going to die.

295
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,540
You idiot!

296
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,260
He deserves it.

297
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,140
He should be shot

298
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,980
if he's a good job.

299
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,340
What a pity for that girl.

300
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,420
D corresponds to Tree of God in China

301
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,740
Mom.

302
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,100
I need to go to the hospital.

303
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,620
It's time.

304
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,300
Take these cycl Stephans

305
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,700
with you.

306
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,060
Let Toto, Xingxing, and Xingxing

307
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,020
take them with them.

308
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,220
Who needs to give them to whom?

309
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,740
The flu is coming.

310
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,220
Okay.

311
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,940
No problem.

312
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,780
And,

313
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,260
tell Toto

314
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,060
not to take the needle first.

315
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,860
Your dad and I will go over to eat with you at noon.

316
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,140
And then, when your dad is done,

317
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,860
we'll make the next step of treatment.

318
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,460
Okay, mom.

319
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,140
I'll take care of it.

320
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,660
Okay.

321
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,020
Toto

322
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,260
You're still here watching him?

323
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,340
Put this on.

324
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,220
My mom said

325
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,100
my dad would come this afternoon.

326
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,500
He might need to adjust the plan.

327
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:54,980
Okay.

328
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,220
Listen,

329
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,340
Toto is getting better at the needle.

330
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,060
When the doctor was checking his bed this morning,

331
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,220
he said that his foot

332
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,020
had a big reaction.

333
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,620
Really?

334
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,140
Yes.

335
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,340
That's great.

336
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,220
Don't hang anything in the room.

337
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,100
Don't allow it.

338
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,980
Okay.

339
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,540
Listen,

340
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,500
I want to stick the big tree next door.

341
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,300
His wife has been begging me for days.

342
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,580
Don't be ridiculous.

343
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,780
You're now a teacher for your uncle.

344
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,300
You're following my dad's instructions.

345
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,540
You can't make decisions on your own.

346
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,980
There's one year left.

347
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,900
I can catch up with you in a year.

348
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,900
You're finally going to sit down with me.

349
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,100
Of course not.

350
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,940
I'm still older than you

351
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,100
in terms of background.

352
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,460
You have to call me grandpa.

353
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,020
Toto, I'm leaving.

354
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,580
Call me if you need anything.

355
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,340
Thank you.

356
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,140
You're welcome.

357
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:53,860
Take care.

358
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,260
Grandpa,

359
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,980
I want to tell you something.

360
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,100
Do you want to hear it?

361
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,300
Zhang Jia Nan.

362
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,300
I don't know if he's a teacher.

363
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,940
Did you take good care of your uncle

364
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,780
when you were here?

365
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,620
You know everything.

366
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,580
I want to take good care of your uncle.

367
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,060
Look at him now.

368
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,700
Can I keep it in mind?

369
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,420
I should let Miss Zhu and my sister

370
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,580
come and see him.

371
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,220
It's better to take care of him

372
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,020
than to be happy.

373
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,260
That's what I'm most afraid of.

374
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,060
I'm going out.

375
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,540
Let's go.

376
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:53,860
Come on.

377
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,180
Let's go.

378
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,180
Aren't we going out for a walk?

379
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,500
Why are you playing with your phone?

380
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,380
I'm going out to this side.

381
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,420
Uncle Chi can't wake up

382
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,060
in a short time.

383
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,500
Let's go for a walk.

384
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,900
Ignore him.

385
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,060
Is it necessary?

386
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,540
What did Dad say?

387
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,580
My dad is not here now.

388
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,740
No one knows

389
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,980
we went out for a walk.

390
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,340
Uncle Chi is awake?

391
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:40,780
Tao Tao,

392
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,220
what does it mean?

393
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,060
I want to blow up Zhao Li Quan.

394
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,620
Li Quan?

395
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,900
What's wrong with him?

396
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,020
I think it has something to do

397
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,260
with Uncle Chi.

398
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,060
What does it have to do with him?

399
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,260
Every time Zhao Li Quan comes,

400
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:01,980
Uncle Chi's blood pressure

401
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,100
goes up.

402
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,460
You know, when Grandma Wu

403
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,220
and Mr. Shen came,

404
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,420
it wasn't so obvious.

405
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,660
Don't you think it's weird?

406
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,900
Uncle Chi likes Li Quan very much.

407
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,180
It's normal for him to react like that.

408
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,020
It's not normal.

409
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,300
I don't think

410
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,860
it's a normal reaction.

411
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,100
You don't have to guess

412
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,220
if it's not normal.

413
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,300
It's my intuition.

414
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,820
The intuition of the doctor.

415
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,060
I got the wrong intuition.

416
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,140
What's wrong with you?

417
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,180
Because I think the first reply

418
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:52,940
or the one who was happy

419
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,940
should be Zhao Li Quan.

420
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,420
But he

421
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,580
didn't react at all.

422
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,620
There are times when intuition is not accurate.

423
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,820
Hello, Ling Lang.

424
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,180
A big tree of flowers and cakes

425
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,340
were delivered to my house.

426
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,260
Did you make it?

427
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
It's here.

428
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,860
Did you send the flowers and cakes

429
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,020
together?

430
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,740
Look at you.

431
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,300
Your dad can't eat sweet things now.

432
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,980
I have to make him eat sugar-free.

433
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,620
You don't want him to live well.

434
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:31,700
Mom,

435
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,580
today is my big day.

436
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,900
What's your big day?

437
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,900
Today is the 30th anniversary

438
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,740
of my marriage with Xin Zheng.

439
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,100
Oh my god.

440
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,260
Well,

441
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,300
look at this.

442
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,140
I forgot

443
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,700
such an important thing

444
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,860
because of the theft.

445
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,380
Of course I have to celebrate it.

446
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,060
It's okay.

447
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,140
And I ordered

448
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,740
sugar-free tofu cake today.

449
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,980
My dad can eat it.

450
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,540
I see.

451
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,940
What should I do?

452
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,700
I haven't prepared

453
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,540
any dishes at home.

454
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,820
It's okay.

455
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,260
I'll order some online.

456
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:12,700
No need.

457
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,460
I told Zhu Xia

458
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,900
to ask him for help.

459
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,380
His dishes are delicious.

460
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,260
Actually,

461
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,020
I want to give him some money.

462
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,740
Okay.

463
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,260
But

464
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,220
Zhu Xia won't ask for your money.

465
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,260
It's different.

466
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,660
It's a happy event.

467
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,260
We should celebrate it together.

468
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,180
But I can't give him the money.

469
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,820
You can.

470
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,220
I've sealed the red envelope.

471
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,780
It's on the dressing table in your room.

472
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,900
You give it to him. He'll accept it.

473
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,220
I see.

474
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,020
My daughter,

475
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,020
look at you.

476
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,140
You're so

477
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,740
thoughtful and thoughtful.

478
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,140
You manage the house

479
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,460
and arrange everything

480
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,020
so well.

481
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,740
I'm so happy for you.

482
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,580
But

483
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,060
I want to ask you.

484
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,900
Does the male lead

485
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,220
remember this special day?

486
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,300
He doesn't.

487
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,940
He doesn't remember it.

488
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,940
But

489
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,700
as long as he can show up,

490
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,060
it's a good thing.

491
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,260
I see.

492
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,020
Tell Tianzhen and Toto

493
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,820
to come back early.

494
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,540
Toto can't come back.

495
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,020
His master asked him to take over.

496
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,100
It's a big deal for him.

497
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,780
We're family.

498
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,220
I see.

499
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,220
I see.

500
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,220
Goodbye.

501
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,820
My goodness.

502
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,300
My daughter has been married for 30 years.

503
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,940
He hasn't replied to my message.

504
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,660
Is it because he's working?

505
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,900
You really think you're a man of God?

506
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,220
You think too much.

507
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,300
If it wasn't for Li Quan,

508
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,940
Uncle might not be here.

509
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,740
Luckily, he went early that day

510
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,820
and found out later.

511
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,940
You didn't even try to save him.

512
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,580
Uncle knows what he's doing.

513
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,780
Maybe he's grateful

514
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,660
and he's grateful to be in danger.

515
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,100
No.

516
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,420
Zhao Li Quan lied to him.

517
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,620
He went to see Uncle.

518
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,220
He was fine when he went.

519
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,340
Someone could be his witness.

520
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,300
So I guess

521
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,460
when he went,

522
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,780
Uncle was fine.

523
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,100
Uncle also fell in front of him.

524
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,140
But when I asked him,

525
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,300
he was so stubborn

526
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,660
and wanted to get away.

527
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,980
That's weird.

528
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,140
Why didn't you tell me

529
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,340
such an important thing?

530
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,500
How long have you known?

531
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
I told your father.

532
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,060
Shouldn't you

533
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,900
tell me first?

534
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,820
Of course I should tell Master first.

535
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,580
He's your Master.

536
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,860
I'm your husband.

537
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,220
We'll be together

538
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,700
for the rest of our lives.

539
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,620
How about this?

540
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,020
Can we make a rule?

541
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,500
The important thing

542
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,500
should be discussed with me first.

543
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,300
No.

544
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,020
The important thing

545
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,420
should be discussed with Master first.

546
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,580
In your mind,

547
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,780
is your husband important

548
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,700
or Master?

549
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,700
Master is important.

550
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,460
I'm thinking.

551
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,580
Are you crazy?

552
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,020
Why are you jealous of your father?

553
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,420
I'm not jealous.

554
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,540
Jealousy is competing with competition.

555
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,660
I'm competing with love.

556
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,340
In front of the Chinese medicine,

557
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,340
I'm nothing.

558
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,740
Look at the position of the heir.

559
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,820
You're more important than me.

560
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,660
It's your mother's birth.

561
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,460
Your mother is the most important person.

562
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,740
It's your mother's birth.

563
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,860
Your mother has been fighting with your father

564
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,660
for the rest of her life.

565
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,300
That's the only theme.

566
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,700
Quan.

567
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,300
Mr. Wu is awake.

568
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,500
How is he?

569
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,060
No.

570
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,580
You're here to stay in the hospital.

571
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,780
Why are you here so soon?

572
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,420
I saw your message and came.

573
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,340
Can he talk?

574
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,060
Yes.

575
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,700
What happened?

576
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:34,940
It's...

577
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,300
Li Quan...

578
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,020
Li Quan...

579
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,580
He...

580
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,300
He's gone.

581
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,140
He's gone to sleep.

582
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,260
He said he was coming.

583
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,620
Mr. Wu misses me.

584
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:51,980
I have to go check on him.

585
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,780
Zhao Xiaocheng.

586
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,420
Wait.

587
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,940
You can't go in.

588
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,620
Why can't I go in?

589
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,540
You're disgusting.

590
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,060
You said you kicked me out

591
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,140
of the hospital.

592
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,260
You said you wanted to take a rest.

593
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,260
But he said

594
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,580
he was tired of kicking me out.

595
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,780
The school has changed.

596
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,060
We don't know why.

597
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,540
Quan.

598
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,860
Don't worry.

599
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,220
Since Mr. Wu is awake,

600
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,420
he'll get better soon.

601
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,620
You'll see him sooner or later.

602
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,220
Don't worry.

603
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,780
No.

604
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,140
I have to see Mr. Wu.

605
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
You can't go in.

606
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,300
I've talked to Mr. Li.

607
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,260
Anyone who wants to go in

608
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,620
has to go through his consent.

609
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,820
If you want to go in,

610
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,220
call and ask Mr. Wu.

611
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,500
Does anyone

612
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,020
include Mrs. Wu and Mrs. Niu?

613
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,700
Quan.

614
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,540
Hello, Mrs. Wu.

615
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,740
It's me, Li Quan.

616
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,580
Mr. Wu is awake.

617
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,420
What did you say?

618
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,780
Mr. Wu is awake?

619
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,820
Is it true?

620
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,260
Mr. Wu didn't tell me.

621
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,300
I'll go in now.

622
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:10,860
Wait for me.

623
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,020
Let's go in together.

624
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,980
Come on.

625
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,820
I'll wait for you.

626
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,100
Okay.

627
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,340
Mom.

628
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,300
Don't worry.

629
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,060
Be careful.

630
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,820
I'll go in first.

631
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:38,940
Tao Tao.

632
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,980
Mr. Wu is awake, right?

633
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,260
Yes.

634
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:41,820
Really?

635
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,620
Ms. Shen.

636
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,260
Mrs. Wu.

637
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,660
Mr. Wu is stable now.

638
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,580
Don't worry.

639
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,020
What do you mean?

640
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,180
Is he awake or not?

641
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,580
Good girl.

642
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,380
Thank you for taking care of him.

643
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,740
Since Mr. Wu is awake,

644
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,700
can we go in and have a look?

645
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,740
Mr. Wu was awake for a while.

646
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,700
Now he's asleep.

647
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,780
He's sleeping well.

648
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,060
If you want to see him,

649
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,700
ask Tao Tao to say hello to the nurse.

650
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,820
Only Tao Tao has seen Mr. Wu

651
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,060
when he's awake.

652
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,740
We should let Mrs. Wu

653
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,940
and Mrs. Wu in.

654
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,100
They'll be relieved.

655
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,540
Why are you here again?

656
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,660
You can't see so many people.

657
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,900
You can only see two at a time.

658
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,100
I'll go in with Mrs. Wu.

659
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,500
Quan.

660
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,940
Mrs. Wu is more worried.

661
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,100
Let Mrs. Wu and Mrs. Wu in.

662
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,300
What's so good about it?

663
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,300
They're all the same every day.

664
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,620
How can they be the same?

665
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,580
I just said it.

666
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,820
He was awake this morning.

667
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,740
So we...

668
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,820
Who said it?

669
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,700
Tao Tao.

670
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,300
Maybe it's just for a while.

671
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,180
I just finished my work.

672
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,340
I haven't had time to ask.

673
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,100
Come in.

674
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,580
Mrs. Wu.

675
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,740
Look.

676
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,100
Nurse.

677
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,300
Let us three go in together.

678
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,500
He's Mr. Wu's student.

679
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,380
Yes.

680
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,020
I sent Mr. Wu here.

681
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,340
I miss him so much.

682
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:56,540
No.

683
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,420
Only two.

684
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,340
Only you two.

685
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:58,780
Come.

686
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,100
Let's change clothes.

687
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,780
This way.

688
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:08,820
Quan.

689
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,660
How are you recently?

690
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,900
I don't see you often.

691
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,500
What are you two doing?

692
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,780
You're fighting.

693
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,860
We're all good friends.

694
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,260
Why do you have to be like this?

695
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,540
This is fun, Mr. Wu.

696
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,240
I'm leaving now.

697
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,420
Go on.

698
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,860
You'll go in once you wait.

699
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,540
Sit down.

700
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,420
Have a break.

701
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,100
All right.

702
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,380
That's enough.

703
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,620
Come on.

704
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:50,860
It's nothing.

705
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,540
I'm fine.

706
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,660
där

707
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,300
As long as the one

708
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,940
How about it

709
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,180
Still more weak

710
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,100
It seems that

711
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,620
Whether she sleeps or he

712
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,860
We should let her

713
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,940
have a rest

714
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,340
Try not to disturb her

715
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,740
I'm sorry.

716
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,940
Shan Dao,

717
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,140
you've been listening to me since you were a child.

718
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,940
You've never let me down.

719
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,140
I believe

720
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,540
you can do it this time.

721
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,340
Try harder

722
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,740
and rest well.

723
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,740
Tomorrow,

724
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,140
you can help me buy some food again.

725
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,740
I'll be waiting.

726
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,140
Thank you, Daorui.

727
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,140
Thank you.

728
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,540
Thank you.

729
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,940
Tao Tao, thank you.

730
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,940
All this time,

731
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,340
you've been taking care of me.

732
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,340
Thank you.

733
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,340
Thanks.

734
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:13,940
Tell me,

735
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,540
why did you stop?

736
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,180
I'm sorry.

737
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,180
I'm sorry.

738
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,060
When you saw

739
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,060
Mrs. Shen and Mrs. Shen,

740
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,140
what did you think

741
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,340
about their faces?

742
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,700
I was wrong.

743
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,100
I know you want to

744
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,300
kill Zhao Li Quan.

745
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,100
You want to make things clear.

746
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,900
If it's as you expected,

747
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,540
Zhao Li Quan wants to kill Uncle Shi.

748
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,660
Besides, he doesn't have

749
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,900
enough reasons.

750
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,300
If you do that,

751
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,460
will Uncle Shi be able to do it?

752
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,700
Grandma is over 80 years old.

753
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,020
You saw her eyes at that time.

754
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,100
Did you think of the result?

755
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,060
I'm asking you.

756
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,140
I was wrong, Master.

757
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,420
You can only say that?

758
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,620
What are you talking about?

759
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,180
I know

760
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,780
Zhao Li Quan did it.

761
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,180
Zhao Li Quan knows it too.

762
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,420
I know he did it.

763
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,780
You're talking to me

764
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,780
for no reason.

765
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,060
Master, you said

766
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,660
it's like a window to the soul.

767
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,740
I know it.

768
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,620
Toto,

769
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,100
we won't let a bad person go,

770
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,180
but we can't wrong a good person.

771
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,340
The essence of doctors

772
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,260
is to cure and save people.

773
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,300
But what's your primary task?

774
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,060
It's to ensure the safety of the patient.

775
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,660
If you lie,

776
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,460
the operating table

777
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,140
of Director Li will come over.

778
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,860
The chief doctor

779
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,020
can you bite this lie?

780
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,980
Is it a lie?

781
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,340
It will directly affect the treatment.

782
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,300
What?

783
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,140
What...

784
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,020
What should we do?

785
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,020
You're usually so energetic.

786
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,500
Why are you so tired now?

787
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,420
But I haven't improved at all.

788
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,220
What do you think?

789
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:39,940
I haven't improved.

790
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,020
You're right.

791
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,740
Toto,

792
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,660
your starting point is good.

793
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,700
You want to do something for the good path,

794
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,220
and you did it well.

795
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,700
I let you stand up

796
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,580
and never leave.

797
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,940
Sometimes the starting point is good,

798
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,060
but you can't ignore the consequences.

799
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,380
If it's good, you should praise it.

800
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,100
If it's bad, you must criticize it.

801
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,900
I'm always like this.

802
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,500
I'm just not sure.

803
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,140
Master,

804
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:10,820
what...

805
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,380
What should we do?

806
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,260
If Master can't wake up,

807
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,780
Grandma and Master Shen

808
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:19,820
will...

809
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:22,940
They will...

810
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,860
They will be disappointed.

811
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,420
Then I...

812
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,700
All right.

813
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,900
You're still here.

814
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,220
You haven't recovered yet.

815
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,500
It's a big mistake.

816
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,900
I won't punish you.

817
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:45,820
Punish me.

818
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,780
Why do people want a master?

819
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,700
It's for your own good.

820
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,340
You really have a way?

821
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,700
How can I be your master?

822
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,500
All right.

823
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,340
Go back.

824
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,020
Go.

825
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,420
Grandma,

826
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,300
it's wine and cake.

827
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,100
When did you get so serious?

828
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,860
It's a big day.

829
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,220
No one celebrates birthday in our family.

830
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,420
What day is it?

831
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,220
Today is your parents'

832
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,980
30th anniversary of marriage.

833
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,260
Today?

834
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,980
Why are you playing with your phone again?

835
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,620
You're so naughty.

836
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,060
Mom, we're back.

837
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,100
You're back.

838
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,300
What's going on?

839
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:02,940
I...

840
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:07,940
Dad.

841
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,900
Forget it.

842
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,340
If he remembers

843
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,540
what day it is today,

844
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,380
it will be scary.

845
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,740
It's been 30 years.

846
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,020
I'm used to it.

847
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,860
You've completed

848
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,980
all the tasks you assigned to me.

849
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,100
Thank you, mom.

850
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,580
The anniversary of marriage.

851
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,460
We just...

852
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,260
We celebrate the anniversary

853
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,580
of marriage every day.

854
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,300
He remembers the feelings.

855
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:35,860
He remembers.

856
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,900
You should believe him.

857
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,540
Right.

858
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:38,940
Dad,

859
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,620
you're so good at talking.

860
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,540
I just found out.

861
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,420
It's the man's desire to live.

862
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,100
Do you know?

863
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,740
Xing Xing told me

864
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,660
that Mr. Wang

865
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,180
wanted to come back.

866
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,500
He wanted to come back?

867
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,100
Yes.

868
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,100
He's been living in the hospital for a long time.

869
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,660
It's true.

870
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,780
He's used to it.

871
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,820
And he likes this.

872
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,180
He's better than being in the hospital.

873
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,820
But he's feeling on super low levels,

874
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,580
and he wants to stay in hospital.

875
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,620
He's scared.

876
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,900
He must feel soulsive.

877
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:54,540
And so пом

878
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,260
Grandpa.

879
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,660
Let's have a good talk.

880
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,340
The wine is fine,

881
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,580
but you must drink more.

882
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,740
Right.

883
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,580
Okay, it's my turn.

884
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,620
Hurry up.

885
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,460
Your dad is going to talk.

886
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,540
Okay, I'll be right there.

887
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:14,900
Come on.

888
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,780
It's ready.

889
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,180
Dad,

890
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,420
Mom,

891
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:20,820
Master,

892
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:21,860
Mrs. Zhang,

893
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,300
I'd like to

894
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,180
toast you two.

895
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,140
You are my birth parents.

896
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,900
You gave me such a good life,

897
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,660
taught me skills,

898
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,100
and taught me how to be a person.

899
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,740
You gave me

900
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,540
such an disobedient wife

901
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,820
and an unfilial son.

902
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,700
You're so funny.

903
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,900
I gave you your happy life.

904
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,860
Yes.

905
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,020
I gave you such an excellent son.

906
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:50,820
Yes.

907
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,460
I'll toast you with the second glass of wine.

908
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,340
Don't mess up the mood.

909
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,340
Master,

910
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,540
I didn't let you down.

911
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,060
Although I'm not good at it,

912
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,980
I'm still grateful to my family,

913
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,100
to my wife,

914
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,940
and to your daughter.

915
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,260
In terms of teaching people,

916
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,220
I've done what you asked.

917
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,700
Thank you.

918
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,340
Thank you, Mrs. Zhang.

919
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,060
Thank you, Dad and Mom.

920
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,660
Han Yicheng,

921
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,420
don't just stare at me.

922
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:33,860
I...

923
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,900
Look at me carefully.

924
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,780
We're doing this

925
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,900
to show you our respect.

926
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,660
I'm afraid

927
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,060
you won't be able to attend

928
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,660
your 30th wedding anniversary.

929
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,940
But your parents will remember

930
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:55,220
our etiquette and rules

931
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,820
and do as you wish.

932
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,980
You can do as you wish in the future.

933
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,620
And now,

934
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,300
you only need a wife.

935
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:07,940
Grandpa,

936
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,380
I got it.

937
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,500
Don't worry.

938
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,180
Remember all of these.

939
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,980
This is your homework.

940
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,100
When you go home tonight,

941
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,620
you have to write a wedding note.

942
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,260
Yes, sir.

943
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,420
You talk too much.

944
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:23,940
Here, Master.

945
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,100
Please.

946
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,060
Hello, Mr. Ren Tianzhen.

947
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,540
What's that noise?

948
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,820
This is a gift from you.

949
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,260
Please give me a verification code.

950
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:38,860
Thank you.

951
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,420
Verification code.

952
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,020
0316.

953
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,140
0316.

954
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,140
0316.

955
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,140
0316.

956
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,140
0316.

957
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,140
0316.

958
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,140
0316.

959
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,140
0316.

960
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,140
0316.

961
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,140
0316.

962
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,140
0316.

963
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,140
0316.

964
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,140
0316.

965
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,140
0316.

966
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,140
0316.

967
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,140
0316.

968
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,140
0316.

969
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,660
Okay.

970
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,780
The service is over.

971
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,260
Goodbye.

972
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:05,780
Thank you.

973
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,780
Thank you.

974
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,780
He can't beat me.

975
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:15,980
Really.

976
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,500
Really.

977
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,260
He can't beat me.

978
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:17,780
He's good.

979
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,660
My dad is not only good at talking.

980
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,660
Mom, look.

981
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,500
He secretly ordered a gift for you.

982
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,260
He just wants to give you

983
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,700
an unexpected surprise.

984
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:32,940
No.

985
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,380
Why are you looking at me?

986
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,940
I'm not good at eating.

987
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,860
Our son has grown up.

988
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,860
He's mature.

989
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,460
Come on.

990
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:52,980
Come on.

991
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,620
Thank you, son.

992
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,540
Master, Mrs.

993
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,820
Let's have a meal together.

994
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,020
Come on.

995
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,300
Happy wedding anniversary.

996
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,100
Thank you.

997
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,140
Happy wedding anniversary.

998
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,140
Happy wedding anniversary.

999
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,140
Happy wedding anniversary.

1000
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,140
Happy wedding anniversary.

1001
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,500
It's been 30 years.

1002
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,140
At first,

1003
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,980
I wanted to

1004
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,500
find a dragon in the human world.

1005
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,260
But I didn't expect

1006
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,300
I married a long-eared man like you.

1007
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,700
What's the common name of a long-eared man?

1008
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,220
Dragon.

1009
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,420
A dragon is also a dragon.

1010
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,460
Dragon.

1011
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,420
Do you remember this place?

1012
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,020
I was here

1013
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,100
and asked for your hand in marriage.

1014
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,180
Party.

1015
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,060
Give me a hand.

1016
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,220
Marry me.

1017
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:51,420
The Long Ballad

1018
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,420
Episode 18

1019
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,420
The city is in a trance,

1020
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:25,420
making the story seem very interesting.

1021
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:30,420
We are in the sunset.

1022
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,420
This youth,

1023
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,420
the more it is,

1024
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,420
the more it becomes complete.

1025
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:48,420
Missing you is happening again.

1026
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,420
There are always people

1027
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:55,420
who are worth your crossing mountains and rivers.

1028
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:59,420
We will run towards the years and stars together.

1029
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:03,420
I am sure.

1030
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,420
Who are you?

1031
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,420
I admit

1032
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,420
that my heart is not as pure as it used to be.

1033
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:16,420
I am already trapped in your eyes.

1034
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,420
The feeling of love,

1035
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:23,420
the fate that we just had,

1036
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,420
is waiting for us.

1037
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,420
There are always people

1038
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:33,420
who are worth your crossing mountains and rivers.

1039
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:38,420
We will run towards the years and stars together.

1040
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,420
I am sure.

1041
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,420
Who are you?

1042
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,420
I admit

1043
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:51,420
that my heart is not as pure as it used to be.

1044
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,420
I am already trapped in your eyes.

1045
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,420
The feeling of love,

1046
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:05,420
the fate that we just had,

1047
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:12,420
is waiting for us.
