The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,400
What do you mean today?

4
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,680
I don't mean anything.

5
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,200
I just don't want to worship a person who doesn't know the origin and is sending food.

6
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,880
What's wrong with that?

7
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,840
Is that a low-level person?

8
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,400
When did you grow up to be a person who is a low-level person?

9
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,200
I respect every old woman.

10
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,200
But she sent food, didn't say anything, and even lied.

11
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,800
Yanjing.

12
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,600
I told her that I wanted to quit the job.

13
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,000
She just took the delivery and threw it on me.

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,200
That's why I was wearing a very fancy dress that day.

15
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,600
She couldn't even do her job well.

16
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Now you're asking her to treat others.

17
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,200
Are you looking at this too casually?

18
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,400
Let's not say that she was brought up by you.

19
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,600
Even if one day she really becomes a person who is a low-level person,

20
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
I won't worship her.

21
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,400
You're not worshiping her.

22
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,600
She's her ancestor, the Liu Sect of Jiang.

23
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Why are you here?

24
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,000
Do you know each other?

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,800
We know each other. Who is he?

26
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,600
He's my son.

27
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,000
If you don't want to worship her,

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
you don't want to do this job anymore,

29
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,000
you should leave now.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,600
You won't be wronged at home.

31
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,200
I told you when I was little that I didn't want to study Chinese medicine.

32
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
You forced me.

33
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,400
It was all of you who forced me.

34
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,000
I didn't even have the right to choose.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,600
What did I sleep in when I was born?

36
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,700
I slept in a pulse.

37
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,200
The anesthetic stick is a gauze.

38
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,200
The medicine box in the Zhuo River is a pen and a pen.

39
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,800
Now I'm almost done with my master's degree and I'm about to finish my PhD.

40
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,000
You told me that I don't want to study and that I can leave.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,400
Why didn't you say that two years ago?

42
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,600
Where do you want me to go now?

43
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,400
Wherever you want to go.

44
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,000
Aren't you bad at medicine?

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,600
Find a job that doesn't require medicine.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,400
Tianzhen, please bow.

47
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,600
My back is injured. I can't bend it.

48
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,800
You're not going to sign the new certificate?

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,600
Yes.

50
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
The Chinese medicine is a system.

51
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,800
You can't be angry with it.

52
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,600
You have to be sincere and be willing to give it a try.

53
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,200
I will remember it, Master.

54
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,800
Tianzhen.

55
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,400
Tianzhen.

56
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,400
Li Zhe,

57
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,800
you're not going to sign the new certificate?

58
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,600
I'm not going to sign it.

59
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,000
Lvye. Li.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,800
It means wearing comfortable shoes.

61
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,000
You know if it's comfortable to wear when you're older or younger.

62
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,800
It's okay.

63
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,800
You still have dozens of years of practice time.

64
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:42,600
In the future, you can wear suitable shoes in any environment.

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,000
Go.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We need to talk.

67
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,600
Look at your son.

68
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,400
He's so motivated.

69
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,200
He didn't learn anything.

70
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,000
He's a bad temper. He took everything.

71
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,400
My son has nothing to do with you, right?

72
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Look at his temper. Who does he look like?

73
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,800
He's not like me.

74
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,000
Look at me.

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,800
I do whatever you ask me to do.

76
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,400
Right?

77
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,000
You can't ask your son to be like that.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,200
Besides, that little girl.

79
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,800
Look at her.

80
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,600
She looks like a successor.

81
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,000
You let her sit in the main seat.

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,200
You let all of us give her a salute.

83
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,600
If I didn't obey you and give you face,

84
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,600
who can help her?

85
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,400
I've done everything for the sake of the Chinese medicine and you.

86
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,800
But you can't ask your son to do that.

87
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,800
You always say that you want to follow your heart.

88
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,800
If your son doesn't accept it, you can't force him.

89
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,200
If you do that,

90
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,400
his waist will be in trouble.

91
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,000
He can't have surgery.

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,400
Besides, your son is right.

93
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,000
He can be a doctor like Sun.

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm afraid the Chinese medicine will be laughed at by everyone.

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,600
Although I said that,

96
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:20,600
I'm really worried about this child.

97
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,400
From the beginning,

98
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,400
she should be a successor.

99
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,000
But whether she can sit in the seat

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,400
and be a doctor depends on her performance.

101
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,800
If she's a normal child,

102
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,800
there won't be any problem.

103
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,200
But if she's like this now,

104
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,600
if you can teach her well,

105
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,200
maybe it's the hope of the Chinese medicine.

106
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,000
So, whether she can be a successor

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,600
or a successor in prison

108
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,200
depends on your ability.

109
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,800
Right.

110
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,200
What are you doing?

111
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
A successor?

112
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,200
Really?

113
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,000
Just an old man?

114
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,200
Big brother?

115
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Uncle.

116
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,800
An uncle took me to a clinic.

117
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,200
Good guys and bad guys.

118
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,400
What do you call me?

119
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
What?

120
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Uncle.

121
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
Call me Master.

122
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,800
It's none of my business.

123
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,600
I'm so stupid.

124
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,200
And what do you call me?

125
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,800
What?

126
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,000
Master Zhang.

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,600
Master Zhang?

128
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,400
Master Zhang.

129
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,000
A successor.

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,600
That scene looks like a TV series.

131
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,400
It's not that real.

132
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,200
No.

133
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,200
You're in some marketing agency, right?

134
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,000
I don't think so.

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,400
That show.

136
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,800
The decoration.

137
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
And those people.

138
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,600
I'm telling you.

139
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Those liars are acting so real.

140
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Don't you watch the news?

141
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
There are more than 300 people in the WeChat group.

142
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,200
Just to fool one person.

143
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,800
And some people have been in the front for three or five years.

144
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,600
They're trying to get money.

145
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,400
Right.

146
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,600
That news two days ago.

147
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
It was a scam.

148
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,200
It made a whole Paris mall.

149
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,600
It's full of luxury goods.

150
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,400
Then...

151
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,200
If it's a rumor, what did it lie to me?

152
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,600
Money.

153
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,000
I don't have any money.

154
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,000
Oh no.

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,600
Oh no.

156
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,400
It's Si.

157
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,800
It's not Si.

158
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,600
It's not Si.

159
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Mr. Tian.

160
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
What if...

161
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,600
What if it's Si?

162
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,600
Si.

163
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
I'm telling you.

164
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,800
I'm so lucky today.

165
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
I have to go to the prison.

166
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
I'll go.

167
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,200
Tomorrow is Monday.

168
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,000
The director has to check the whole house.

169
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If I didn't wait for you, I would have gone to bed early.

170
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
Go with me.

171
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,800
Go play by yourself.

172
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,400
No.

173
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,200
Let go.

174
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,600
No.

175
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,200
Let go of me.

176
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,600
Let go.

177
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,400
I want to sleep.

178
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,000
Tian Xinxing.

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You're so heartless.

180
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,600
See you later.

181
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Tian Xinxing.

182
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,000
What if it's Si?

183
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,800
What if it's Si?

184
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
What if it's Si?

185
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
What if it's Si?

186
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
What if it's Si?

187
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,000
Tian Zhen, you go first.

188
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,400
Calm and calm,

189
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,800
long life and long life.

190
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,400
A generation of great poets.

191
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,800
He talks too much.

192
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,800
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?

193
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,600
Today is my last day of internship.

194
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,000
I made a small gift for everyone last night.

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Not bad.

196
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,400
You should do that.

197
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,800
Linglan.

198
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,200
You didn't sleep well last night.

199
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,800
You're not pregnant.

200
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,200
I hope you can live better.

201
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,600
Don't say that, daughter.

202
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,800
What were you thinking about last night?

203
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I was thinking about Si Shangpi.

204
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,400
You're all disobedient.

205
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,800
How can I not be worried?

206
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,600
Did you eat cold food yesterday?

207
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,400
No.

208
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,400
You should have had ice cream.

209
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,200
I'm an old Chinese doctor.

210
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,800
How can I eat ice cream?

211
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,600
And it's not very common.

212
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,200
Because it's cold and hot in the coffin.

213
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Should it be durian or pineapple?

214
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,400
Is it too hot?

215
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,000
I ate two bowls of it.

216
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,600
About 50 grams.

217
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,400
Dad!

218
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,800
Song Yiren.

219
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,400
I told you not to eat it.

220
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,800
What if the blood sugar is too high?

221
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,000
I didn't eat it.

222
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,600
The secret is down the amount of seasonings.

223
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,600
I saw Erliang put the top.

224
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,400
Eight thousand taels of Russia,

225
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
five hundred taels of China,

226
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,000
one hundred thousand taels on the side.

227
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
How much...

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Eat, eat.

229
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,200
Don't be shy.

230
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Grandpa.

231
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,400
Drink this yoghurt if you feelитесьistic.

232
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,160
It's healthy with this sugar.

233
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,880
You're getting more and more skillful.

234
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,920
You can even taste the ice cream.

235
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,440
Tell me.

236
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,440
Did you see the durian ice cream

237
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,560
when I asked you to get me the grass yesterday?

238
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,120
Did you see the durian ice cream

239
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,280
that my dad hid?

240
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,000
Your dad

241
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,200
never did anything in his life.

242
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,280
When he ate the ice cream last night,

243
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,640
he threw the spoon there.

244
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,160
I took it and smelled it.

245
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,320
He smoked you.

246
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,520
And then you...

247
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,240
You even had done that dessert.

248
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,280
You won't learn until you sit at home and enjoy yourself again.

249
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,440
Welcome.

250
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,200
The girl who does not know you

251
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,120
is quite good

252
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,100
for her to redefine

253
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,020
her own feelings.

254
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,340
I am seeing her

255
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,340
and thinking

256
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,760
what she should be saying,

257
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,860
maybe we will meet

258
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,120
at the crossroad of my life trends

259
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,220
before we are old.

260
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,080
What are you thinking?

261
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,360
I have not seen it.

262
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,160
I have the ability to communicate with the sky.

263
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
I can find you

264
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
wherever you go.

265
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,160
What time is it now?

266
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
Why don't you go to the clinic?

267
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
Why should I go to the clinic?

268
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
I've already paid

269
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
the money yesterday.

270
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
It's over.

271
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,160
Why should I go?

272
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,160
I'm serious about this.

273
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,160
When you left yesterday,

274
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
I told you that

275
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
you should go to the clinic

276
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,160
at 8 o'clock in the morning.

277
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
I'm serious about this, too.

278
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
I'm serious about this.

279
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
The 100 yuan yesterday

280
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,160
is over.

281
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,160
If you go there today,

282
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,160
you won't get paid.

283
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,160
Okay.

284
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
I'll pay you 100 yuan each time.

285
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
I'm not going.

286
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,160
I thought I was going

287
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,160
to be a group actor yesterday.

288
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,160
Right?

289
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
I'll go there for 100 yuan.

290
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
Who knows that

291
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,160
she's a big actress?

292
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,160
The price of a big actress

293
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
is different.

294
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,160
Can I get 100 yuan?

295
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
No.

296
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
Okay.

297
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,160
As you said before,

298
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
it's 4800 yuan a month.

299
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,160
But we need to write a word.

300
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,160
In case you

301
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
have to pay more in the future.

302
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,160
We don't run a bank.

303
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
We can't print it.

304
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,160
Give me the pen.

305
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,160
I'll write it now.

306
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
Look at my house.

307
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
It looks like

308
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
there's a pen in the ground.

309
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
I'll write it now.

310
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,160
You're writing it yourself.

311
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
Go get your ID card.

312
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,160
Why do I need ID card?

313
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,160
You can just

314
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
wrap the ID card

315
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
directly.

316
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
You can be more capable.

317
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
You know that

318
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,160
I have something important to do.

319
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
I can't waste my time

320
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
on you.

321
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
Go get your ID card.

322
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,160
Keep this one.

323
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
Put it away.

324
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,160
It'll be useful in the future.

325
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
What's the use?

326
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
You don't give me money.

327
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
Can I sue you with this?

328
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,160
No, I'm really...

329
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
I'm really curious.

330
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
Why do you

331
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
want me to go with you?

332
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Why me?

333
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
And...

334
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,160
And you don't really want me

335
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,160
to be the successor, do you?

336
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,160
This thing is very fake.

337
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
It's hard for me to accept it.

338
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,160
I do have many ideals.

339
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,160
What...

340
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Anyway, I have all of them.

341
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,160
Except for the successor,

342
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
especially the successor of the Chinese medicine,

343
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
I really haven't thought about it.

344
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
I have many ideals, too.

345
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
My ideals...

346
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
The successor

347
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,160
is not in my ideals.

348
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
But now I'm

349
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,160
a loyal successor.

350
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,160
And I'm doing well.

351
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
If you don't try it,

352
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,160
how would you know?

353
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
I know even if I don't try it.

354
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
I'm not interested in Chinese medicine.

355
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
What are you interested in?

356
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
Catching dolls.

357
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
I caught them all.

358
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
Look. Look.

359
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,160
Look.

360
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
Here.

361
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
You can catch them with this.

362
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,160
The most difficult one is this shark.

363
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
I caught two.

364
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
It's amazing.

365
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,160
It's so round.

366
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,160
I can catch it.

367
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
How much did you spend

368
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
on catching dolls?

369
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
I spent all the money

370
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
I had on eating.

371
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
I didn't need to catch them.

372
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
Do you know?

373
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,160
The money you spent on catching dolls

374
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
is enough to buy a claw machine.

375
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
You can play with it

376
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,160
at home every day.

377
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
I'm just saying you don't understand.

378
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,160
You can buy a claw machine by yourself.

379
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,160
Isn't that all yours?

380
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
It's your own claw machine.

381
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
Is it interesting to catch it yourself?

382
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
I don't understand.

383
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
Who are you fighting with

384
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,160
when you catch dolls?

385
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
I'm fighting with myself.

386
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,160
Do you know Shengfu Yu?

387
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
Shengfu Yu?

388
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
Yes.

389
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
Shengfu Yu.

390
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
Well said.

391
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
I think

392
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,160
you're talented in Chinese medicine.

393
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
Chinese medicine

394
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,160
is about finding the patient

395
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
and getting rid of him.

396
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,160
Defeating him

397
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
and treating the patient well

398
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
is more successful

399
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,160
than catching dolls.

400
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
That's all.

401
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,160
Let's go.

402
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
Don't you want to learn from me?

403
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
I'm not going to learn from you.

404
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
Do you want to learn from me?

405
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,160
Today?

406
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,160
Yes.

407
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
No, not today.

408
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
Tomorrow.

409
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
The hospital is going to make an appointment in advance.

410
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
I have to make an appointment on the first day.

411
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
If you come,

412
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
and tell me to go today,

413
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,160
I'll be embarrassed.

414
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,160
Fine.

415
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
I'll be there at eight o'clock tomorrow morning.

416
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
God will supervise you

417
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
at the hospital.

418
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,160
Eight o'clock is a little too early.

419
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
I'll be there at eight o'clock tomorrow morning.

420
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
I'll be a little late.

421
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,160
Will you deduct money?

422
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,160
Thirty-six to five.

423
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
Grandma, are you okay?

424
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,160
Not less.

425
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
Your disease will get better soon.

426
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,160
Today is the last day

427
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
of my internship here.

428
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
I'll leave you to others

429
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,160
from tomorrow.

430
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,160
You must listen to the doctor

431
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,160
and cooperate with the doctor's treatment.

432
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,160
Eat well and sleep well.

433
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
Okay.

434
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,160
Grandma,

435
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,160
you must stick to your will.

436
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
You will recover.

437
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,160
I'll come back to see you.

438
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
I'm sorry.

439
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
I'm sorry I'm late.

440
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
You said you would come out

441
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,160
and play, but you were late.

442
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,160
I was about to leave for Japan.

443
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,160
A patient came.

444
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,160
You're just taking me to the mall.

445
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
Catch it.

446
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,160
Come on.

447
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
Come on.

448
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,160
Come on.

449
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,160
Okay.

450
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,160
I caught it.

451
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,160
I caught it.

452
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,160
I caught it.

453
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
You want to play too?

454
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
Come on.

455
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
Come on.

456
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
I'll watch you play.

457
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,160
Do you know which one I want most?

458
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,160
Which one?

459
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
The chicken and the cat.

460
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,160
Which one is chicken and the cat?

461
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,160
I don't want to play anymore.

462
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,160
Come on, rabbit.

463
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
I don't want to play anymore.

464
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,160
Which one do you want?

465
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
Chicken and the cat.

466
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,160
If you can't catch it,

467
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,160
I'll go over there

468
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,160
and buy one for you.

469
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,160
No.

470
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,160
It feels different to buy it.

471
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,160
What does it feel like?

472
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,160
It's the kind of feeling

473
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
when you have to

474
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
catch it.

475
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,160
It's the feeling when you catch it.

476
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,160
Wait here.

477
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
Wait here.

478
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
Boss.

479
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,160
50 yuan more.

480
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,160
You're having fun.

481
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
It's okay.

482
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
What do you mean?

483
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,160
Okay.

484
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
You have to catch more.

485
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
Okay.

486
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
Catch more.

487
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,160
So much money.

488
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,160
Is it for me?

489
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,160
I've never

490
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,160
taken money from you in my life.

491
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,160
So much money.

492
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Come on.

493
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,160
Okay.

494
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,160
No.

495
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,160
I can't.

496
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,160
I'll wait

497
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
until they stop

498
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,160
because they're

499
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,160
being pressed by the ones behind.

500
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,160
I'll catch

501
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,160
the ones behind first.

502
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,160
Come on.

503
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,160
I'll tell you

504
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,160
I quit.

505
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,160
What?

506
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,160
I quit.

507
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,160
Don't be ridiculous.

508
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,160
Why did you catch it

509
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,160
so happily?

510
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
You really did.

511
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,880
Why are you so happy?

512
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,080
I just got it today.

513
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,520
Impossible.

514
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,440
Don't say you're a principal.

515
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,920
You're the dean.

516
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,240
You haven't been here for a year.

517
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,040
How can you get it?

518
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,760
I applied for it a year ago.

519
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,760
A year ago?

520
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,400
Why didn't you tell me?

521
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,080
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

522
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,680
I thought if he didn't approve it,

523
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,320
I wouldn't have to tell you.

524
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,720
It's approved.

525
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,280
So you're here to inform me, right?

526
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,600
Do you need me to go to your office

527
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,800
and move everything home for you?

528
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,000
I don't care about anything else.

529
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,920
I'll move Wu Ji back.

530
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
Move it yourself.

531
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,520
I'll go.

532
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,640
What are you thinking about?

533
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,920
How's the interview at the hospital?

534
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,120
I guess it's not good.

535
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,760
There are too few people today.

536
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,680
The elimination rate is high.

537
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,280
You have to be confident.

538
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,440
You have to believe in yourself.

539
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,080
The teachers are all acquaintances.

540
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,040
You're the best in the hospital.

541
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,560
See you at the hospital.

542
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,120
I'll go back first.

543
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,160
Mom, do you think I owe him in my previous life?

544
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,040
It's right that he moved these things home.

545
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,840
They're all good things.

546
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,080
In the future, they'll be passed on to our naive people.

547
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,160
They're all naive rich people.

548
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,400
There are also cash books in it.

549
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,080
If you have time, go to school.

550
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,080
Go to school and see.

551
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,480
Maybe there's a masterpiece.

552
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,880
I won't go. I can't afford to lose that person.

553
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,800
What's embarrassing about this?

554
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
It's embarrassing.

555
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,120
The new government is back.

556
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,480
Come on.

557
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,720
Then why don't you ask him?

558
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,520
What's the purpose of doing this?

559
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,160
In this life, I asked him.

560
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,000
Has he ever answered me?

561
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,880
He's always doing whatever he wants.

562
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,760
Look at that time.

563
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,560
He went to Yuanjian Hospital to get buried.

564
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,120
He didn't say a word.

565
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,720
He just took the bag and left.

566
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,560
He even emptied the house.

567
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,960
It's the New Year.

568
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,520
He took me and Tianzhen...

569
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,800
You know, we only have two and a half cents

570
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,600
on our bank card.

571
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,360
Mom, two cents and three cents.

572
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,320
If I didn't have you as my birth mom,

573
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,040
Tianzhen and I would never have lived to this day.

574
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,920
Do you think he has this family in his heart?

575
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,520
Does he have me in his heart?

576
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,800
He has all the people in his heart.

577
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,120
You help him to do the final mission.

578
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,760
We help you overcome these difficulties.

579
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,840
You don't need a husband.

580
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,360
Don't you have a family?

581
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,200
I have a family?

582
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,800
Dad, I've been suspecting that

583
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,440
you didn't have a son-in-law.

584
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,560
You married a daughter-in-law.

585
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,240
He's so ridiculous.

586
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,120
You're so cunning.

587
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Mom, I'm back.

588
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,880
Come back.

589
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,560
Honey, grandma.

590
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,200
What are you doing?

591
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,360
Your dad is off duty.

592
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,760
If your dad is off duty, you should...

593
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,360
What else?

594
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,680
I find you...

595
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,920
You're as cold as your dad.

596
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,160
You're heartless.

597
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
You're cold.

598
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,200
I'm cold like my dad.

599
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,000
Who am I cold like?

600
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,760
Ren Tianzhen.

601
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,040
You're so selfish.

602
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,920
You complained to your son that your husband is bad.

603
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,800
Did he say his dad is bad or you?

604
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,800
He's right.

605
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,120
Mom, say something.

606
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,200
They're wrong.

607
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,680
You're right.

608
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,720
You're right.

609
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,680
Come on.

610
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,200
Listen to me.

611
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,680
Get back to work.

612
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,360
They're all gone.

613
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,480
Dear Ms. Zhang Jiru.

614
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,960
Don't be so reluctant.

615
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,120
Here, take it.

616
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,800
This is for you.

617
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,360
Sorry for the intrusion.

619
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,400
Mr. Liu.

620
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,320
Professor Ren.

621
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,400
Help!

622
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,140
terrorism?

623
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,220
No.

624
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,380
Qin стен du is a lover of master why not have died

625
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,120
there is...

626
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:22,680
Sitten du is a lover of master why not have died

00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,860
there is...

628
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,700
Okay.

629
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,020
It's absolutely right

630
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,740
to have a good time.

631
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,100
Say it.

632
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:34,900
If you

633
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,900
listen to my advice

634
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,660
and don't eat and drink,

635
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,620
you won't knock on our door

636
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,700
during the day

637
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,380
and give me a big gift.

638
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,420
Go away.

639
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,340
Leave me alone.

640
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,100
How can you not drink

641
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,620
when you're in Jianghu?

642
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,980
I have no choice.

643
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,980
I'm going abroad tomorrow.

644
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,500
You're in your own body.

645
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,300
I advise you not to go abroad.

646
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,420
I can't.

647
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,460
I'm going abroad

648
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,860
for my own good.

649
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,580
You don't know

650
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,260
there's a kind of

651
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,340
medicine for pain relief abroad.

652
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,700
It's amazing.

653
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,260
As long as you take it,

654
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,460
you'll be fine.

655
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,220
The real medicine is the cure.

656
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,620
It's okay for people to eat anything.

657
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,580
The western medicine is too powerful.

658
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,100
Unlike Chinese medicine,

659
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,260
you have to take medicine

660
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,980
and take a pill.

661
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,460
You can't even think about it.

662
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,100
I'm going there

663
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,580
to make the medicine

664
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,260
our domestic agent.

665
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,460
If it works,

666
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,780
I won't look for you anymore.

667
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,100
If it really works,

668
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,660
I'll congratulate you.

669
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,260
What?

670
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,740
You're going to do a housework?

671
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,980
I'm going to have a

672
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,140
Chinese medicine class.

673
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,740
I'll find a classroom

674
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,580
to study in.

675
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,740
A class?

676
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,180
Well,

677
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,300
what a coincidence.

678
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,220
I have a place.

679
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,540
I'm applying

680
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,980
to be a Chinese medicine industrialist.

681
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,860
I have a copy of the certificate.

682
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:04,820
Well,

683
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,940
I'll give you a job.

684
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,140
What's your job?

685
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,020
Don't make fun of me.

686
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,540
I'm not making fun of you.

687
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,460
I'm doing my best

688
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,460
to support the Chinese medicine industry.

689
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,780
Besides, you've helped me

690
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,740
so much over the years.

691
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,220
You need it now.

692
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,900
I'll do my best.

693
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:23,820
Right?

694
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,580
I don't have money to pay you.

695
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,940
Don't mention money.

696
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,940
With your great grandson as a witness,

697
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,260
the people around you

698
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,900
will be impressed.

699
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,420
Really?

700
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,780
It's a classroom.

701
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,900
It's a deal.

702
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,340
Are you crazy, Sun Tao Tao?

703
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,820
What's this?

704
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,060
To celebrate

705
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,380
the new job of Rong Huo 4800.

706
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,340
You?

707
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,060
Chinese medicine successor?

708
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,140
Yue Xin?

709
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,180
You're the one.

710
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,060
You're the one.

711
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,900
You're the one.

712
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,900
You're the one.

713
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,740
You're the one.

714
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,740
You're the one.

715
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,740
You're the one.

716
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,740
You're the one.

717
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,740
You're the one.

718
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,740
You're the one.

719
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,300
Yue Xin 4800.

720
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,060
Which one is suitable for your character?

721
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,940
Is it important?

722
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,380
What's important?

723
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,460
You know me, right?

724
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,780
There's a handsome guy in it.

725
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,860
He's tall, thin, white, and cute.

726
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,100
Really?

727
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:31,780
Do you have a picture?

728
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,540
I don't have a picture.

729
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,780
I'm like a pervert.

730
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,220
I have to take a picture of him.

731
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,220
Right.

732
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,500
What do you mean by cute?

733
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,820
How can I describe it?

734
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,660
You have a right.

735
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,420
I have a wound on my waist.

736
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,180
I can't bend it.

737
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,540
It's high.

738
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,980
And then you feel

739
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,740
you can't reach it.

740
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,100
And you feel excited.

741
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,700
And then you feel like you're challenging yourself.

742
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,540
Okay.

743
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,420
I agree with you.

744
00:32:59,420 --> 00:32:59,900
How about this?

745
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,180
You stay in there

746
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,180
and stabilize your position.

747
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,700
And then you take her back to me directly.

748
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,900
I'll definitely bring you back.

749
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,740
I thought you were going to

750
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,140
introduce me to your boyfriend.

751
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,220
But you left him behind.

752
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,140
You stayed behind.

753
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,660
You and me are the same.

754
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,100
Why are you so different?

755
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,620
I'm different.

756
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,220
I...

757
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,740
I'll give it to you.

758
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,580
By the way,

759
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,300
it's my first time meeting you so privately.

760
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,340
By the way,

761
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,180
the person you don't like most

762
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,980
is sis Xia ok?

763
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,220
What's up?

764
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,020
What's up?

765
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,840
I'll like it.

766
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,240
Your father is of a certain age.

767
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,040
He resigned without a second thought.

768
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,240
You want to discuss this with me to avoid asking me?

769
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,640
Of course.

770
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,840
If you ask me

771
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,720
I could not disagree with it.

772
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,840
Prof. Yan,

773
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,240
I would like to discuss something with you.

774
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,640
You are doing something for customers, I don't mind.

775
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,440
But will you give something to the families?

776
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,320
Families are just a part of society.

777
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,080
Right?

778
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,040
to contribute to the society.

779
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,160
Family is also

780
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,000
a part of society,

781
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,640
right?

782
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,320
I've made up my mind.

783
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,240
I must

784
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,520
get the job done.

785
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,240
Okay, okay.

786
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,240
Professor Li Wen

787
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,960
is so generous.

788
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,200
He has provided

789
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,440
a free place.

790
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,840
It's a deal.

791
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,160
Don't expect me to help you.

792
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,120
You heard it.

793
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,040
I don't need your help.

794
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,120
I need you

795
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,320
to pay me.

796
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,920
What's the problem?

797
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,960
We don't have the ability

798
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,880
to let all students

799
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,880
live with us.

800
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,360
But I hope

801
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,960
the students of the master class

802
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,440
can focus on studying.

803
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,880
I want to provide them with time.

804
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,200
At least

805
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,800
some time before the class,

806
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,760
we can

807
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,360
study together.

808
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,000
Professor Ren,

809
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,520
do you think

810
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,280
there's a gold mine

811
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,840
under our house?

812
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,320
I'm telling you,

813
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,960
the only thing we have

814
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,440
is a big pit like you.

815
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,360
At first, the master class

816
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,280
was proposed by Shandao.

817
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,560
I think it's okay.

818
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,040
I support him.

819
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,440
Who knows

820
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,280
he'll be in trouble.

821
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,800
But later, I heard nothing.

822
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,440
He quit.

823
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,160
I think it's a good thing.

824
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,560
It's a great blessing.

825
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,680
I also think

826
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,920
it's probably God

827
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,320
who gave me

828
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,080
the honor of being a doctor.

829
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,000
So I think

830
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,720
I must

831
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,360
do this job.

832
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,160
Everyone thinks it's a big problem.

833
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,120
Why don't you think it's difficult?

834
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,040
Because his wife is not you.

835
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,360
So I don't think

836
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,440
it's difficult

837
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,720
to do anything.

838
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,160
But look,

839
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,440
it's not long

840
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,440
before the country admits its failure.

841
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,960
You're in the master class.

842
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,440
You have to go through

843
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,600
the procedures step by step.

844
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,440
What are you going to do?

845
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,640
What are you going to do?

846
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,960
There's always the first person

847
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,280
who eats crabs.

848
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,000
You can't just leave

849
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
without a strong man.

850
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,760
If there is,

851
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,880
there will be too many people on the road.

852
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,360
You know,

853
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,640
I've been looking for

854
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,520
the name of the country all my life.

855
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,120
Most of them

856
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,320
don't have the title of professor.

857
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,080
But my master is really

858
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,200
a man

859
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,680
who follows

860
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,120
every law.

861
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,600
They are all

862
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,160
the people I've spent half my life

863
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,080
to complete.

864
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,960
They are all talented.

865
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,000
So I think

866
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,240
we should invite them out

867
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,080
and give them a lesson.

868
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,480
Let's prepare our back first

869
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,040
and walk step by step.

870
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,400
As we walk,

871
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,840
there will be

872
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,920
a lot of people.

873
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,360
Are the people on the mountain

874
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,080
really there?

875
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,120
Yes.

876
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,480
Is Qiu Jianxian,

877
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,360
the important master,

878
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,160
willing to come?

879
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,800
As long as I invite them out,

880
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,320
they will definitely come.

881
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,440
In that case,

882
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,640
it's not bad.

883
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,520
If they are willing to come,

884
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,360
they will be born

885
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,840
in the postgraduate program.

886
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,120
It should be good.

887
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,360
It's good.

888
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,880
You know

889
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,240
what your son is like.

890
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,800
He is

891
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,000
a rebellious person.

892
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,880
He can't do anything good to him.

893
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,120
My son?

894
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,840
Why are you angry?

895
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,520
You know I always

896
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,960
humble the retreats.

897
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,040
Darling,

898
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,880
I'm just motivated by you today.

899
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,280
twenties

900
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,160
One, two, three.

901
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,040
And let you

902
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,960
celebrate the journey you have set off.

903
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,880
Move it to you.

904
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,200
Who will do that?

905
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,000
Come on.

906
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,520
I don't want to know.

907
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,400
Come on.

908
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,600
Okay.

909
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,360
Yes, I don't need to praise you.

910
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,920
I'm just following your instructions.

911
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,520
Since you've already thought of the worst outcome,

912
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,760
just go and do it.

913
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,440
Yes, Mom.

914
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,840
For the great work of the Chinese medicine, the outcome is good.

915
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,440
It won't be bad.

916
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,040
Have you arranged the lessons?

917
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,720
I'm working on it while I'm teaching.

918
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,040
How's the budget?

919
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,520
Master, you don't need to worry about this.

920
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,600
Your disciple is just a mere student.

921
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,720
He'll get the money.

922
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,120
He's just a mere student. I'll pay for it.

923
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:46,040
I have some savings that I can contribute to the family.

924
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,840
To the family?

925
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,640
Your grandson won't get married anymore?

926
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,960
It depends on my ability.

927
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:56,520
If my grandson is capable, he might even marry a wife.

928
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,320
If he wants to be capable, this is a good opportunity.

929
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,320
Let him get married.

930
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,560
Dad, is that your grandson?

931
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,520
You should go and tell him. You have to convince him.

932
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,720
He won't listen to us.

933
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,520
What do you want me to convince him?

934
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,280
Are you going to use me as a needle or to give me medicine?

935
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,240
No, no, no. What medicine?

936
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,680
I'm asking you to eat. Hurry up.

937
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,160
I'm just asking you to study hard.

938
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,880
Study hard?

939
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:36,320
The thing is, your dear father has resigned.

940
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,680
He wants to hold a Chinese medicine class.

941
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,800
Your grandpa hopes that you can join the class.

942
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:51,160
After all, this class will invite many Chinese medicine students to attend.

943
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,720
There will also be some famous doctors.

944
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,800
They will not only teach you the books,

945
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:02,880
but also some important medicine, medicine, and weaving.

946
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,000
These courses are indeed very good.

947
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,240
But your dad doesn't agree.

948
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,120
Why doesn't he agree?

949
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,480
Your level is not enough.

950
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,400
Is that grandson going?

951
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,560
Of course he's going.

952
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,200
Even a delivery man can go.

953
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,440
Why can't I be worthy of your class?

954
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,240
I don't agree with you on that.

955
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:31,120
You have to go to the end of the road to pick up medicine.

956
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,400
I don't dare to take this risk with your grandson.

957
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,520
I don't agree either.

958
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,480
In fact, that class is really hard.

959
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,920
It's not like you're in the house,

960
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,560
making a lot of money.

961
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,800
There may not be a result.

962
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,160
You just read your book calmly.

963
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,680
It's good to go to a regular hospital to work.

964
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,840
Right?

965
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,440
Mom, we've been talking about this every day.

966
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,560
I'll tell you my thoughts.

967
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,160
I hope I will face the living in the future,

968
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,880
not a patient labeled with something sick.

969
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,200
I said goodbye to Grandma Lu today.

970
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,520
She may leave the human world soon.

971
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,240
When I touch her with gloves,

972
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,320
she doesn't want to.

973
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,200
She wants to hold my warm hands.

974
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,040
The hospital is too busy.

975
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,600
No one can hold her.

976
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,240
I used to focus on the disease in the hospital.

977
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,360
Not the sick.

978
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,200
It's all about the disease.

979
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,760
I don't want to go on like this.

980
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,800
Since she's so determined,

981
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,640
don't stop her.

982
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,920
Let her go to the city office.

983
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,200
It's settled.

984
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,200
It's settled.

985
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,640
I agree.

986
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,640
Let's eat.

987
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,240
Let's eat.

988
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,800
No.

989
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,200
I smell a familiar smell.

990
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,240
Did I burn you again?

991
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,440
Mom.

992
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,840
Did you put too much wine in the dish?

993
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,760
No.

994
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,360
Really?

995
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,040
Try it.

996
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,360
No.

997
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,360
Try it.

998
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,960
No, right?

999
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,800
The city is in a trance.

1000
00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:00,160
The story seems to have a good atmosphere.

1001
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,000
The us in the sunset.

1002
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
This youth.

1003
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,360
The more it is, the more complete it becomes.

1004
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:23,000
Missing you is happening again.

1005
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,200
There's always someone

1006
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,520
who deserves to cross the mountains and rivers to complete it.

1007
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,760
Let's look back at the years and the stars together.

1008
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,960
I'm sure.

1009
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,160
You are that person.

1010
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,360
I admit.

1011
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,640
It's not that pure.

1012
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,840
I'm already trapped in your eyes.

1013
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,040
The feeling of being in a trance.

1014
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,360
The fate of the sunset.

1015
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,640
Waiting for the sound of the horn.

1016
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,760
There's always someone

1017
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,080
who deserves to cross the mountains and rivers to complete it.

1018
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,360
Let's look back at the years and the stars together.

1019
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,560
I'm sure.

1020
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,760
You are that person.

1021
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,960
I admit.

1022
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,240
It's not that pure.

1023
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:29,480
I'm already trapped in your eyes.

1024
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,680
The feeling of being in a trance.

1025
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:38,960
The fate of the sunset.

1026
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:45,480
The sound of the horn.
