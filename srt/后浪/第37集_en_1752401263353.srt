00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
How is the skin?

4
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I can't tell if it's good or bad without this.

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It doesn't matter if the tea is bad or not.

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You have to be good at it.

7
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Do you have anything to tell me?

8
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
No.

9
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No.

10
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What do you want to tell me?

11
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What do you want to hear?

12
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Human.

13
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What kind of human is it?

14
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's bad.

15
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's right.

16
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yin and Yang.

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
In fact, in one's life,

18
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
there are many evil thoughts.

19
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Even in marriage,

20
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
it's possible to kill the other person ten thousand times.

21
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
When you turn around and take the gun,

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
you suddenly find

23
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
a rose on the window sill.

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You will take it off.

25
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Give it to the other person.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:42,080
It's your

27
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and you can go back.

28
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What are you eating?

29
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Think about it first.

30
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Every word you say will have consequences.

31
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Think about it first.

32
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Don't need me.

33
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Your teacher, Wu Shandao,

34
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
when I was in school,

35
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
he copied a poem for me.

36
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's there.

37
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Open it.

38
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Read it.

39
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't knowMA'

40
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Why angry things stay forever.

41
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Obrigal Chinese man

42
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm a gentleman.

43
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm a lowly man who's lost his father.

44
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm a man of merit and good deeds.

45
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm a man of honor and honor.

46
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm a man of honor and honor.

47
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm a man of honor and honor.

48
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Good deeds.

49
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Good deeds.

50
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Ji Ziyin, who was sent to Shaoying.

51
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Rishi.

52
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I made a mistake.

53
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Go.

54
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay.

55
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Thank you, uncle.

56
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,760
Brother He.

57
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,280
Doctor Shen,

58
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,920
we're in a hurry.

59
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,320
What's wrong? Don't worry.

60
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,120
Tell me.

61
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,040
You've been drinking so strangely these days.

62
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,240
I have many patients here.

63
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,120
They have a cold.

64
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,200
I'm all because of

65
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,040
the medicine Liu Gai gave them.

66
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,000
It's not working.

67
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,280
Especially that Niu Bai Bai.

68
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,640
She coughed for days,

69
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,360
but she didn't get better.

70
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,040
She couldn't even breathe just now.

71
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,160
I was so worried.

72
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,320
Don't worry.

73
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,280
What's the symptom of Uncle Niu?

74
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,760
What medicine did you give him?

75
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,160
I'm just wondering.

76
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,400
Someone has a cold,

77
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,160
someone coughs,

78
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,200
someone has a fever.

79
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,560
Someone said that they didn't have any taste in their mouth.

80
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,760
I have it.

81
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,200
The ginseng,

82
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,320
the poison,

83
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,360
and all kinds of other medicines.

84
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,480
They're all useless.

85
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,320
What should we do?

86
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,800
Can you come over?

87
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,520
I'm so worried.

88
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,120
Uncle He.

89
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,840
Uncle He.

90
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,440
Tao Zi, why are you here?

91
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,720
Grandma has a cold in the provincial city.

92
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,040
Dad sent her to the provincial hospital.

93
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,160
The people there are queuing in line

94
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,960
to the main street.

95
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,080
They can't even get the number.

96
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,280
Dad asked me to hurry up and go.

97
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,720
I'll come back to you as soon as possible.

98
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,480
How about this?

99
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,280
Tell Auntie to go.

100
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,000
Tell Auntie to come here.

101
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,480
Hurry up.

102
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,040
Okay.

103
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,160
I mean, little doctor.

104
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,200
Can you come here to get the diagnosis?

105
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,080
I can't come here even if I'm busy.

106
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,760
This is...

107
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,800
This is the most prestigious place in the city.

108
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,240
Everyone trusts you.

109
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,520
You're here.

110
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,840
Everyone's condition is half better.

111
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,760
Okay.

112
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,640
Brother He.

113
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,200
Don't worry.

114
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,080
I'll pack up my things

115
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,000
and go there as soon as possible.

116
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,320
Okay.

117
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,080
Well, there are too many patients.

118
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,680
Can you come here with your girlfriend?

119
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,480
Well, she's busy.

120
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,680
I can go there alone.

121
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,120
Okay.

122
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,680
Hurry up.

123
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,280
Thank you.

124
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:36,640
Have youany xIs-

125
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,160
No.

126
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,880
Very refreshing.

127
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,120
We need to rush

128
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,280
Brother

129
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,660
Only for you

130
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,700
Drink a cup of tea

131
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,420
That will be enough

132
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,140
Smoke a cigarette

133
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,220
Go

134
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,140
Do you know how serious this is?

135
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,360
I know I was wrong.

136
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,400
Mr. Wu once told me

137
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,600
that Li Quan

138
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,080
had to go back to the city school.

139
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,520
He couldn't forget his true nature.

140
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,360
I kept asking myself,

141
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,520
I asked,

142
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,680
Zhao Li Quan,

143
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,440
what is your true nature?

144
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,720
I want to be a doctor.

145
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,320
I want my family

146
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,760
to live a good life because of me.

147
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,720
But I can't go back.

148
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,960
Don't say you want to be a doctor.

149
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,880
You're not even a human.

150
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,080
If I tell you now,

151
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,400
you'll remember it soon.

152
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,080
Do you know that?

153
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,080
You'll carry the charge

154
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,520
of corruption, bribery,

155
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,920
and infidelity in your life.

156
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,760
Your parents and your family

157
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,920
will be angry because of you.

158
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,000
But

159
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,120
even if you kill me,

160
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,320
even if you kill me over and over again,

161
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,360
I'll always be your family.

162
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,720
If I die,

163
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,160
even if you kill me,

164
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,920
I'll realize my militaryello nigh hits the body.

165
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,720
You you called me.

166
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,360
Surrender.

167
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,600
You must be brave when you do it.

168
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,160
And you must be brave when you admit it.

169
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,720
You dare to do it and you dare to take the responsibility.

170
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,200
You should forgive me.

171
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,640
Please save me.

172
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,440
Please save me.

173
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,240
My parents will be so proud of me.

174
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,720
How can I live?

175
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,000
She wanted to get married.

176
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,440
Like that.

177
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,160
You used the fact.

178
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,000
You suddenly disliked her.

179
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,640
She even asked you to take over.

180
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,200
You were 71 years old.

181
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,520
Mom.

182
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,160
Mom, talk to me.

183
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,520
Can you high five me?

184
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,980
I definitely that

185
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:48,020
I want to live and work

186
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,320
You dare not

187
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,420
I have one sting on my side

188
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,900
Don't let go

189
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,800
I'm with you

190
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,880
He's dead

191
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:30,400
and he's been

192
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,000
a two-year-old black girl.

193
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,840
Li Qian?

194
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,120
Li Qian.

195
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,280
You really hate me.

196
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,080
Master.

197
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,900
Li Qian, please don't.

198
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,360
Please be my friend.

199
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,880
You have to drink in my heart.

200
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,200
Like a big stone,

201
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,640
I can say it more easily.

202
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,280
It's good.

203
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,240
Go to the bathroom, okay?

204
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,360
I'll go back to see you.

205
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,200
Go.

206
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,400
Where's he?

207
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,880
Inside the building.

208
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,760
Yes.

209
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,400
I can give you even more silver dollars?

210
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,120
How much is more?

211
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,880
I'm coming.

212
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,200
Hello.

213
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,520
It's okay.

214
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,320
She didn't go into the police station.

215
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,640
Where is she now?

216
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,360
I don't know.

217
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,480
Follow her.

218
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,160
Yu and a lovely couple.

219
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,520
You are going to meet them, right?

220
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,440
Of course.

221
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,800
마뿤

222
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,720
Look.

223
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,960
It's the next semi-morning.

224
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,360
See you there.

225
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,320
Hello.

226
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,720
Hi, mantra.

227
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,040
What happened?

228
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,280
I'll get it back

229
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,240
Go

230
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
Go

231
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,440
You even have the courage to die

232
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,440
Why don't you have the determination to make a new revolution?

233
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,440
It's okay

234
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm ashamed

235
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
I can't go back

236
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,040
You, the bastard before

237
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,640
I've already taught you to die

238
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,520
From now on

239
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,120
What sits in front of me is a new revolution

240
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,640
Can you do it again?

241
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
Yes

242
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,040
Are you sure?

243
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,040
Just 300,000

244
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,040
I'll lend you

245
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,040
Then you take the money and spend it

246
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,040
So you can go to town easily

247
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,040
Be a good person

248
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,040
I'm sorry

249
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
You know

250
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,040
How hard it is to train a person

251
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,040
He has to go through one test after another

252
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,040
Some people are roasted and hanged

253
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,040
So this person

254
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
There must be a teacher

255
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,040
Accompanied

256
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,040
Someone was wrong

257
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,040
That person is very good

258
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
Keep going

259
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
I hope you

260
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
Not yet

261
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,040
Know how to change

262
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
Good eyes

263
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
Thank you

264
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
Start tomorrow

265
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Go to work at the conference hall

266
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
Pay basic salary

267
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,040
You are serious

268
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Start from the medical work

269
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,040
Don't think about what doctor

270
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,040
You first make the spirit of the craftsman

271
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,040
Understand and then say something else

272
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,040
I look at it

273
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Naive now

274
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,040
Look at that room

275
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,040
Can you add a bed?

276
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,040
There are a lot of herbs in there

277
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,040
You work in the clinic during the day

278
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,040
I have to take medicine

279
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
You are also learning

280
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,040
I have a place to live now

281
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Just rented a house

282
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
Paid three months' rent

283
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
Then you have someone

284
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
I have one thing

285
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
I always don't understand

286
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,040
Want to ask you

287
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,040
Say

288
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
You taught us

289
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Say

290
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,040
Cheng Zeming is the name Cheng

291
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,040
The first medicine to be a person is Cheng

292
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
I have been with you for a long time

293
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,040
I often observe your star-shaped nest

294
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
But I still don't understand

295
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
What

296
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
Your secret relationship

297
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,040
It shouldn't be like that

298
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,040
Because I am a mortal

299
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Since it is mortal

300
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
There will be a mystery

301
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,040
Because I have suffered from mortal

302
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,040
So it's hard to understand

303
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
When you are

304
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,040
Everyone will make mistakes

305
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,040
In this life

306
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,040
All in the cultivation

307
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
Day after day

308
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
Know yourself

309
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
Can still walk

310
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,040
After that, you will be strong

311
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,040
Thank you for the knowledge

312
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,040
Thank you

313
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,040
Hello

314
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,040
Suer, what are you looking for me?

315
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
Toto

316
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
I may go to a small town

317
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,040
What happened?

318
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
Close to the flow of the line

319
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Lao He asked me to help

320
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,040
I am sorry

321
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,040
I am sorry

322
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
I am sorry

323
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,040
I am sorry

324
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
I am sorry

325
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
I am sorry

326
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
I am sorry

327
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,040
When will you come back?

328
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,040
If it goes well, three or five days

329
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,040
If there is a situation

330
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,040
Maybe ten days and half a month

331
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,040
You remember to switch shifts with Yang Xiao Hong

332
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,040
I also asked Wu Yu

333
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,040
He will join the wheel team

334
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,040
Very reliable

335
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,040
I know

336
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,040
Toto

337
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Do you remember I told you

338
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,040
The old house of my grandpa

339
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,040
I simply cleaned it up

340
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,040
The key is in the sleeping bag at the door

341
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,040
If you are tired

342
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,040
Don't want to go home

343
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
You just live there

344
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,040
Don't bother the situation

345
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,040
it is good

346
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,040
Then nothing

347
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,040
I'll hang up

348
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
No, wait

349
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
Be careful

350
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,040
Hang up

351
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,040
Goodbye

352
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,040
Goodbye

353
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,040
Come come

354
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,040
come

355
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,040
Why did you switch places?

356
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,040
There are so many patients

357
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,040
When people around you heard

358
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
The money has run here

359
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
Look at the village

360
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
Just put the charity

361
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,040
We gave it out

362
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,040
OK

363
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
OK

364
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
OK

365
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
OK

366
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
OK

367
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
OK

368
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
OK

369
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
Come

370
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
Come

371
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,040
Come

372
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Come

373
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
Come

374
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
Come

375
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,040
Come

376
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,120
We're getting a lot of pain

377
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,640
Yes

378
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,640
Aunt

379
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,680
Grandpa Ma said it's a big plague this year

380
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,640
I brought some sachets

381
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,040
We must hang them up in time

382
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,560
And I brought some medicine

383
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,280
We must make sure that

384
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,920
the whole village takes it in time

385
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,960
OK

386
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,120
Let's go, let's go, let's go

387
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,840
Come on, this way

388
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,320
Slowly

389
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,000
Take it slowly

390
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,640
Take the medicine

391
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,640
Here we are

392
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,120
Here we are

393
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,320
Bad liver

394
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,760
How's your rest recently?

395
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,640
Bad rest

396
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,720
Don't be too tired

397
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,400
OK, let me do it

398
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,120
Let the doctor check it for you

399
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,480
OK, OK

400
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,200
Hello, doctor Shen

401
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,600
Hello

402
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,000
Sit

403
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,200
What's your name?

404
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,040
My name is Ye

405
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,560
How old are you?

406
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,840
I'm forty-one

407
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,280
Let me check

408
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,280
Open your mouth and look at your tongue

409
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,440
OK

410
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,320
Go in

411
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:43,920
How many more minutes?

412
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,880
How many more minutes?

413
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,760
OK, hurry up

414
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,840
How's your rest recently?

415
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,040
Not very good

416
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,080
Open your mouth and look at your tongue

417
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,680
Open your mouth

418
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,520
OK

419
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,000
Hello

420
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,160
Bravo

421
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:39,720
Good

422
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,040
Go

423
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,140
Missing, Missing.

424
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,540
Number four.

425
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,340
It's Sverige Pig.

426
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,180
It's allergic to ah,

427
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,740
i said it's exotic partial phytonutriense.

428
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,740
We gave thekan particulate from First Class,

429
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,020
No, no, Grandma

430
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,020
It's Uncle Niu

431
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,180
You should go and have a look

432
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,180
OK, I'll go and have a look

433
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,100
Go

434
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,620
Go

435
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,100
Take some medicine

436
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,820
Thank you

437
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,100
Come on

438
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,340
Is it just an old problem?

439
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,260
How's the blood pressure?

440
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,580
Blood pressure is OK

441
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,500
It's OK

442
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,420
The cough

443
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,660
has improved a little

444
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,300
It's just a little bit at night

445
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,820
This morning

446
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,860
I had a fever

447
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,260
Little Shen Ye

448
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,060
I feel a little better in front of me

449
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,380
This

450
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,260
I

451
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,580
I guess I'm tired of these two years

452
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,860
Besides

453
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,460
I'm the one who's getting older

454
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,420
Dad

455
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,740
I'm the one who's getting the cold

456
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,060
I'm easy to be sick

457
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,060
It's OK

458
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,460
It's not OK

459
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,100
Did you almost fall just now?

460
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,540
I just fainted

461
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,620
It's OK

462
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,620
How is it OK?

463
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,860
Brother Hua told me to take care of you when he was in the hospital

464
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,740
You're busy

465
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,220
How can I tell him?

466
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,140
Who's in the hospital?

467
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,940
He's my son

468
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,620
He came back from Wuhan to save the patient

469
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,260
He said he went to the county hospital

470
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,620
What did the hospital say?

471
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,620
The doctor said

472
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,260
It's OK

473
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,460
He'll be fine after a few days of sleep

474
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,660
How long ago?

475
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,420
A few days

476
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,580
Come on

477
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,660
Tianzhen's phone

478
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,100
Tianzhen's phone

479
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:13,940
Give it to me

480
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,140
Tianzhen

481
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,020
How are you doing there?

482
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,500
It's almost the New Year

483
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,140
It's OK

484
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,260
Come back quickly

485
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,260
Tianzhen

486
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,980
Mom, let me talk to Grandpa

487
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,940
I have something urgent to ask him

488
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:27,900
No, no

489
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,420
You say, you say, you say

490
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,820
Grandpa, here's the thing

491
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,100
I can't go back for the time being

492
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,100
I've never seen

493
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,220
Such a complicated situation

494
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,900
I'm sorry

495
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,700
I'm sorry

496
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,460
I'm sorry

497
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,300
I'm sorry

498
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,140
I'm sorry

499
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,940
I'm sorry

500
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,500
I want to talk to you

501
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,740
Do you remember what the problem was

502
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,740
Do you remember

503
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:44,980
What isies?

504
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,900
It was old

505
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,460
Look, look, look

506
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,300
What's the case?

507
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
Ma'am termsoun

508
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,300
Yes, no

509
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,880
I took an infrastructure

510
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,100
Supplementary domestic wealth

511
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,300
I just reduced the regularknown

512
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,620
Even if only

513
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,640
A shield from intense

514
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,700
he had two patients

515
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:01,940
ILO

516
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,140
They went to university

517
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,020
So I want to ask

518
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,780
What was the problem

519
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,340
And there was no lung cooks

520
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,340
I'm really a little worried.

521
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,340
You can't handle it alone.

522
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,340
Hurry up and come back.

523
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,340
Mr. Kong needs me here.

524
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,340
I can't go back.

525
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,340
You little thing.

526
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,340
You haven't suffered this loss.

527
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,340
When I was in the middle of the year,

528
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,340
a good friend of your mother left.

529
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,340
How can you be such a bad guy?

530
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,340
Tianzhen, come back quickly.

531
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,340
Let's talk when you come back.

532
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,340
Tianzhen, Tianzhen.

533
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,340
Wait for me for a day.

534
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,340
I'll get ready.

535
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,340
I'll be there tomorrow noon.

536
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,340
Send me the address.

537
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,340
Okay, mom.

538
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,340
He's going too?

539
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,340
Tianzhen, listen up.

540
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,340
You must wear a mask.

541
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,340
And take the medicine with it.

542
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,340
Drink it three times a day.

543
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,340
I'll let your dad take some more.

544
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,340
If you don't get it,

545
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,340
you have to let them drink it.

546
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,340
Remember?

547
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,340
I heard it, mom. I know.

548
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,340
I'm hanging up.

549
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,340
Are you his mother?

550
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,340
What if it's a pneumonia?

551
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,340
The pneumonia was so serious that year.

552
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,340
You sent your own daughter

553
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,340
to the first line.

554
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,340
Tianzhen is a doctor.

555
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,340
She has to be used at this time.

556
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,340
My girl.

557
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,340
Back then, my daughter was the one who lost her tongue.

558
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,340
Now, my grandson is the one who can't lose his tongue.

559
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,340
You should take more care of the clinic.

560
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,340
It's hard to be sure now

561
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,340
when this disease will reach Jiangzhou.

562
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,340
Put on the mask.

563
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,340
Here.

564
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,340
Be careful.

565
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,340
You must take the hot-air door pillow out for a single dose.

566
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,340
Here, this is also...

567
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,340
The medicine for the fever.

568
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,340
I've already made a big order.

569
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,340
Put it here.

570
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,340
What else?

571
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,340
Here, just these few bags.

572
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,340
I'll take it.

573
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,340
If there's a big order,

574
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,340
our clinic will make medicine right away.

575
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,340
It's free.

576
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,340
So that all patients and families can drink it.

577
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,340
Professor Ren.

578
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,340
Wait, let me think about it.

579
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,340
What else?

580
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,340
Why do you have to leave overnight?

581
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,340
It's good to have a student with you tomorrow morning.

582
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,340
You can still change your hand on the way.

583
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,340
No need.

584
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,340
There should be nothing else.

585
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,340
Just go to the bank.

586
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,340
Alright.

587
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,340
You can go back.

588
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,340
Alright.

589
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,340
Take care.

590
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,340
I'm leaving.

591
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,340
Drive safely.

592
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,340
Be careful.

593
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,340
The End

594
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,340
Professor Ren.

595
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,340
It's really great that you came.

596
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,340
Where's Tianzhen?

597
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:58,340
Tianzhen sent Uncle Niu to the county.

598
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,340
He's in the county.

599
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,340
He's afraid that something bad will happen to him.

600
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,340
He's afraid that something bad will happen to him.

601
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,340
Why did you come so late?

602
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,340
It's not Tianzhen's fault.

603
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,340
It's Uncle Niu's fault.

604
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,340
He can't bear to spend money.

605
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,340
The password is 6-0.

606
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,340
The money in the card is enough.

607
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,340

Don't forget.

630
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,340
Face the fate.

631
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,340
Be brave.

632
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,340
To fight.

633
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,340
To face the love.

634
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,340
You look handsome.

635
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,340
It's just a name.

636
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,340
It's just a name.

637
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,340
I'm not handsome.

638
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,340
It's just a name.

639
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,340
I'm not handsome.

640
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,340
It's hard to come.

641
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,340
I'm not handsome.

642
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,340

00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,340

645
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,340
I'm not handsome.

646
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,340
I'm not handsome.

647
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:27,340
Mlet Z keinen88

648
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,340
You taste it.

649
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,340
Xie Yunzhao.

650
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,420
Sir.

651
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,580
Ter есть Zhou.

652
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,700
According to the condition,

653
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,520
I wrote up the prescription

654
00:37:53,520 --> 00:38:02,600
and 400 nakaaaa ko

655
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,280
How are you, Effects?

656
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,460
What about you, Y Alan?

657
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,660
That's good. Don't worry.

658
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,860
Look at your age.

659
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,860
You're still in the hospital.

660
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,460
Shut up. Take care of yourself.

661
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:29,060
Okay. I will remember. Don't worry.

662
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,660
Okay. Goodbye.

663
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,060
Dad. Dad, something happened.

664
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,860
What happened?

665
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,460
Uncle Ning's son passed away.

666
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,060
What happened?

667
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,260
He went to Shengcheng by himself. But the hospital is already full.

668
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,660
He was fine when he went. He suddenly fell while waiting.

669
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,660
He never woke up again.

670
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,260
How is Shengcheng?

671
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,060
I asked my classmates. They were confused.

672
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:01,060
They lack manpower and protection. Many doctors were infected.

673
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,060
Shengcheng Hospital

674
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,460
Tianzhen, the foreign bones

675
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,260
wrote a prescription for this disease.

676
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,060
I'll pass it to you later.

677
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,660
Okay.

678
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:24,060
This place is small. The disease won't be spread for the time being.

679
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,660
You stay here.

680
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,260
Dad, you stay here.

681
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,660
I'll go to Shengcheng.

682
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,660
Hello, Xiao Kai.

683
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,260
Please tell me.

684
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,460
Call Luo Yongxin.

685
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,060
Hello?

686
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:05,260
Director Luo, I'm Ren Xinzheng.

687
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:08,460
Old man, something happened.

688
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,060
I know. Director Luo,

689
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:15,060
I'm on my way to Wuhan. How is it?

690
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,660
Not good. Don't come.

691
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:21,660
Let me tell you. Many colleagues in the hospital are infected.

692
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,860
There are also internal medicine.

693
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,260
Two doctors.

694
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:34,660
Some of them fell sick and died recently...

695
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,260
and died.

696
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,460
Are they dead this year?

697
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,260
Not yet.

698
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,500
Trace log

699
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,500
I need to take a seat

700
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,860
Tianti

701
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,140
Why did she call the engagement person from the mountain?

702
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,260
Did she have an affair?

703
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:13,940
How did this happen,

704
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,060
and make other people smear it?

705
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,620
No.

706
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:26,040
Let me go make another

707
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,980
pillow each day.

708
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,640
It'll be good for her brain

709
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,880
to learn to weave a handkerchief

710
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,700
or play some games even in bed.

711
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,140
All right.

712
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,440
It's dark now.

713
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,760
Why don't you go for needlework?

714
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,480
Master hasn't called me before.

715
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,660
I never know

716
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,700
about the therapy plan.

717
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,760
What's it known to be?

718
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,500
Just a few needlework,

719
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,860
and you'll go for it.

720
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,860
You...

721
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,860
You...

722
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,860
My legs are disabled,

723
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,860
but my brain isn't.

724
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,860
You should know that

725
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,860
I'm your master's

726
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:58,860
fellow apprentice.

727
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,860
Fine.

728
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,860
Let me ask you.

729
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,860
How did you fall?

730
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,860
Qingyuan Hall

731
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:38,860
There will always be some youth

732
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:42,860
It is not about hate and hatred

733
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:48,860
There will always be some people

734
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,860
Like the stars in the long night

735
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:57,860
Time is silent

736
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:01,860
Memories are all memories

737
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:07,860
Every moment of memory

738
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,860
Is warm and equal

739
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:15,860
If there is no pain in life

740
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,860
I will light up a city for you

741
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,860
People in the light

742
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,860
Are just ordinary identities

743
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,860
Use ordinary bodies

744
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:31,860
To light up the ordinary souls

745
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,860
Burn up the passion

746
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,860
Use one sentence, we
