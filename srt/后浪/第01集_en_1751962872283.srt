Ho-Ho.

3
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,680
Help me fry many dishes from kitchen.

4
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,800
There are 4800 chefs in the restaurant.

5
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,120
Are you sure?

6
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,960
Come here

00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,880

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,600
Feeling dizzy yet?

13
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,240
Do you have anything else to do?

14
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:31,960
It's fine.

15
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,040
JustHow about I walk a little bit and wait?

16
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,200
What is time really?

17
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:49,160

What's the hurry today?

22
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,920
The few bills I got announced today

23
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,560
I'll give you five yuan for each order.

24
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,960
Isn't it worth it?

25
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,240
We don't have to do anything

26
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,200
next time.

27
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,760
Really.

28
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,760
Next time?

00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,000

No problem.

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,520
Let's go.

33
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,560
Let's go.

34
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,880
Let's go.

35
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,600
Let's go, Du Da.

36
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Don't make any trouble next time.

37
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,120
I know.

38
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,160
Found it.

39
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,520
What?

40
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,680
The signature of Jiang's Trust,

41
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:56,920
the

42
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,840
30th-year University entrance examination tomorrow.

43
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:02,760
Also,

44
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,720
if the goddess

45
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,600
hurt you,

46
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,240
I needed you to

47
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,700
examine your health.

48
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,640
I'll be waiting at the military test center.

49
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,880
So I'll be helping you with them today.

50
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,080
Okay,

51
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,160
my pleasure.

52
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:13,880
Vice Principal,

53
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,920
can you

54
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,320
take me to the university

55
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,720
today with you?

56
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,160
If we can't get there at 3.30,

57
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,360
it'll be a disaster.

58
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,400
Call a taxi.

59
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,600
A taxi?

60
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,360
I'll make an appointment with you.

61
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,280
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,240
Let's have a noodle together.

63
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,840
Don't.

64
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,840
I've ordered take-out for us.

65
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,680
I'll go get it later.

66
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,440
Hello?

67
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,440
I'm downstairs. Where are you?

68
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,480
I'm at the door of your dorm.

69
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,360
Which door?

70
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
The door of your dorm.

71
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,720
Hello?

72
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,760
Hello? Can you hear me?

73
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,120
Hello?

74
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,080
I can't hear you.

75
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,520
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,040
I just got a call.

77
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,880
I'm downstairs.

78
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,880
Where are you?

79
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,560
I'm at the door of your dorm.

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,880
Coming.

81
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,160
Coming.

82
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,240
Let's go.

83
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,200
Go.

84
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,800
You said you'll be there at 500 meters.

85
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,240
You ran for 86 minutes.

86
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,600
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,240
You're late.

88
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,920
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,800
I'm so sorry.

90
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,240
There were too many cars on the way.

91
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Help me to make sure.

92
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,080
It's still hot.

93
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,840
It's really...

94
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,080
Well.

95
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
It's not easy to go out.

96
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,240
I'll send you two boxes first.

97
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,120
Help me to make sure.

98
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,840
Make sure.

99
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,000
Hello?

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,080
The flower garden, right?

101
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,560
Yes. I'm at the flower garden of your dorm.

102
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,400
How many flower gardens do you have?

103
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,320
The one in the east.

104
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,760
The one in the west, right?

105
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,880
Okay. I'll come there later.

106
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,840
Okay. Thank you.

107
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,440
Okay.

108
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,800
Do you have a word of truth?

109
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,320
If you're late, just say you're late.

110
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,200
I can understand.

111
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,760
I believe others can understand.

112
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,680
You're lying to me in front of me.

113
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,840
If you don't explain it to me,

114
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,360
I'll...

115
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,960
Take the order.

116
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,640
Stop.

117
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,720
You don't understand me, right?

118
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,000
Do you want it?

119
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:12,960
No.

120
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,600
No?

121
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,800
Don't try to stop me.

122
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,040
Anование

123
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,160
Honestly speaking,

124
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,120
I don't care about you anymore.

125
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,840
No matter at where I live or in what case,

126
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,160
I don't care about you.

127
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,280
How is the results of the company,

128
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,440
let alone the class?

129
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,120
She is coming.

130
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,280
Here we are.

131
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,320
You have arrived after such a rush.

132
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,360
you never looked safe before.

133
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,040
But you said

134
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,960
education

135
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,000
means learning from what others studied.

136
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,360
How is it?

137
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,480
Can we

138
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,600
choose someone

139
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,000
from such a person of surname Liu?

140
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,400
Celestial trolleyemy

141
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,900
Everyone pots

142
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,900
You're so stubborn.

143
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,900
Why are you so stubborn?

144
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,900
Chen Zhen, are you okay?

145
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,900
You fell.

146
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,900
I'm leaving.

147
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,900
Don't be late for the toilet.

148
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,900
You didn't fart again.

149
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:14,900
I don't understand why it's so difficult to do something now.

150
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,900
Don't be angry.

151
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,900
Remember one thing.

152
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,900
Be neutral and peaceful.

153
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,900
Even the Buddha will jump on the bridge when something happens.

154
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,900
I have to do the work of the master.

155
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,900
I have to find things by myself.

156
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:41,900
Some Chinese medicine education problems are getting more and more obvious.

157
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,900
Look at us.

158
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,900
We teach students in western thinking.

159
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,900
What is our Chinese medicine?

160
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,900
It's the right way.

161
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:59,900
So I think the Chinese medicine education will be back.

162
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,900
Students should learn it.

163
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,900
It's wrong to teach.

164
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,900
If you don't teach well, it must be your problem.

165
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,900
I'm here.

166
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,900
The food is here.

167
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,900
What's wrong with you?

168
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,900
It's closed.

169
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,900
Help! Help!

170
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,900
Open the door!

171
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,900
Open the door!

172
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,900
Open the door!

173
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,900
Sorry, I'm late.

174
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,900
It's not late.

175
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,900
It's your turn.

176
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,900
Sorry.

177
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,900
I'm sorry.

178
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,900
What is the way to treat a broken open-lost bone?

179
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,900
A broken...

180
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,900
A broken bone is used to treat broken bones.

181
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,900
Do you want a pill?

182
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,900
No.

183
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,900
Don't be so mean!

184
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,900
Don't be in a hurry.

185
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,900
This is not a hard question.

186
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,540
I'm angry if I'm not nervous.

187
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,820
I'm sorry, teachers.

188
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,940
Can you repeat the question?

189
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,540
Sorry.

190
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,940
What is the method of

191
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,620
treating open-air fracture?

192
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,860
It's the method of treating

193
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,500
open-air fracture.

194
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,580
No.

195
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,900
Who is it?

196
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,260
The method of treating open-air fracture

197
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,860
is to perform a life-saving surgery.

198
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,500
It's a thorough check on the patient.

199
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,460
If there's a cardiac arrest,

200
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,860
the CPR must be performed.

201
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,500
The next step is to bandage and tissue.

202
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,420
You must choose a relatively clean cloth

203
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,260
to bandage it.

204
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,140
If it's exposed to the infection,

205
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,260
it can't be pulled back to the skin system

206
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,980
to prevent the doctor from miscarriage.

207
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,620
The third step is to fix it temporarily.

208
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,540
You must choose a relatively hard object

209
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,300
to fix it.

210
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,580
The fixed range should be above

211
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,580
the upper and lower joints of the fracture.

212
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,580
The fixed range should be above

213
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,100
the upper and lower joints of the fracture.

214
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,980
Let go of me.

215
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,860
Stop fighting.

216
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,500
Stop fighting.

217
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,020
Stop fighting.

218
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,060
Stop fighting.

219
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,300
Stop fighting.

220
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,100
Stop fighting.

221
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,940
Stop fighting.

222
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,060
The doctor is my answer.

223
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,940
Thank you, doctor.

224
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:18,940
Thank you.

225
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,300
Oh.

226
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,940
I misjudged you.

227
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:43,820
Cheers.

228
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,300
Thanks.

229
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,260
Why did he beat you?

230
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,560
Come on, I'm taking you on!

231
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,800
Is it?

232
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:37,760
Then show everyone

233
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,320
Master,

234
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,400
Madam,

235
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,120
I have an idea.

236
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,560
I wonder

237
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,160
if I can

238
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,560
be a teacher of Chinese medicine.

239
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,200
What is a teacher?

240
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,640
How to be a teacher?

241
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,080
The old school people

242
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,880
have been taught to be a teacher.

243
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,720
It's easy

244
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,960
to say that.

245
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,560
But how to operate it?

246
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,200
Master is easy to learn.

247
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,560
These years,

248
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,720
you have been trained in Chinese medicine

249
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,720
and you have been trained in the army.

250
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,520
But how to be a teacher?

251
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,360
The college students of medical school,

252
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,880
besides,

253
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,120
you are doing this

254
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,720
because you are against the school.

255
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,920
You are trying to be a leader.

256
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,840
Madam,

257
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,440
the order of the 52nd Department of Health

258
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,800
clearly stipulates that

259
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,120
all students who have studied Chinese medicine,

260
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
high school students,

261
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,080
or other students,

262
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,840
as long as they are teachers for three consecutive years,

263
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,000
and finish the exam of medical qualification,

264
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,880
they can get the qualification of medical education.

265
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,320
Actually, I think

266
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,440
the idea of Chinese medicine is to help

267
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,600
and not to resist.

268
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,840
Your idea

269
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,600
is interesting.

270
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,240
Slow down.

271
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,880
You should make it clear

272
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,000
what is a teacher.

273
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,240
A public teacher.

274
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,040
No one is taught.

275
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,320
It's a online Chinese medicine.

276
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,680
Online?

277
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,240
Yes.

278
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,840
Chinese medicine is not a study.

279
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,440
There are three thousand students like Fu Zi.

280
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,600
Chinese medicine has been here for thousands of years.

281
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,840
What I'm afraid of is that

282
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,320
it will spread to the wrong people and ruin the world.

283
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,560
If the spread of the disease

284
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,960
meets someone who is not righteous,

285
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,520
and the person who can learn

286
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,720
does bad things

287
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,160
and is not good at learning,

288
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
what should we do?

289
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,320
Madam,

290
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,480
God knows what will happen.

291
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,440
God's will is to be honest.

292
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,280
As long as it is honest and trustworthy,

293
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,000
it will not be full of troubles.

294
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
If you don't understand this,

295
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,280
you give it a money tree,

296
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,680
it can't spend money.

297
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,200
Isn't it said by god?

298
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,000
You are the headmaster of a university.

299
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,120
It's hard to

300
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,000
manage the school.

301
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,800
Why do you have to go this way?

302
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,240
I think

303
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,560
I have been teaching for half my life.

304
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,200
I have taught many professional doctors.

305
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,720
But there are still too many patients.

306
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,800
I can never finish it.

307
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,560
In fact, we are all

308
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,440
making a fuss at the end.

309
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,400
Ignore the essence of Chinese medicine.

310
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,520
The essence of Chinese medicine is

311
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,840
not to treat the disease, but to treat stomach disease.

312
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,680
The upper body treats stomach disease.

313
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,320
The Chinese medicine treats stomach disease.

314
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,800
The lower body treats stomach disease.

315
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,600
We are the lower body.

316
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,200
The students who teach

317
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,960
are also lower bodies.

318
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,280
They don't have the characteristics of Chinese medicine.

319
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,680
In fact, my biggest dream

320
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,560
is to spread Chinese medicine to thousands of families.

321
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,680
To treat stomach disease.

322
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,960
I also think

323
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,280
maybe if I want to train

324
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,080
Zhuo Ge again,

325
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,560
I can be a high-ranking teacher.

326
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,280
You are so generous.

327
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,560
Good.

328
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
When you take your child

329
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,480
to the road of true happiness,

330
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,280
don't be the monster of the road.

331
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,640
You are the monster.

332
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,040
Aunt, I have thought about it.

333
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,040
Spreading Chinese medicine

334
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,720
is my responsibility and dream.

335
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,000
Now Chinese medicine has lost

336
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,360
its ancient way of protecting itself.

337
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,880
It has lost its foundation of self-health.

338
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,080
Then Chinese medicine

339
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,560
has reached

340
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,040
the point of forgetting the foundation

341
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,160
and weakening the ice bones.

342
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,160
So I want to

343
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,360
try to explore

344
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,360
the traditional model of teaching with teachers.

345
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,120
To test it.

346
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,680
Do you know

347
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,480
that beating people is illegal?

348
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,720
I know.

349
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,520
But that scumbag

350
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,960
beat me once and again.

351
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,880
You are so strong.

352
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,160
He is beaten to a bone by you.

353
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,720
You can do a wound test.

354
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,360
If he wants to sue you,

355
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,120
you...

356
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,520
You will go to jail.

357
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,600
I am asking you.

358
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,840
Sit down.

359
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,720
No.

360
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,800
Then...

361
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,280
Then...

362
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,400
What do you mean?

363
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:26,880
Then I...

364
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,880
Then I will be able to see

365
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,160
whether I will be in charge or not.

366
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,760
You have called the police.

367
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,880
Why can't you wait for us

368
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,960
to solve the problem?

369
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,280
I am waiting.

370
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,480
The situation is not allowed.

371
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,680
Zhao Man.

372
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,160
What if we are there to search?

373
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,080
Right?

374
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,640
You...

375
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,800
It's not the first time.

376
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,920
Every time,

377
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,320
you are kind and do bad things.

378
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,200
Last time,

379
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,640
you were kind.

380
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,640
But then,

381
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,960
you were beaten.

382
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,360
Can't you remember?

383
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,800
Going through,

384
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,880
losing and living life.

385
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,080
A door has been opened.

386
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,600
What's that?

387
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,680
Is it a手上心?

388
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,360
Stubborn.

389
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,560
What's up?

390
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,160
It's like he is also behind you.

391
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:18,960
Let me see.

392
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,480
Where does it hurt?

393
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,240
Hurry.

394
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:22,840
I...

395
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,160
Get up.

396
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:23,560
I need to see you.

397
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,800
I am hungry.

398
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
I'm so happy.

399
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
Thank you, Aunt.

400
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
What's the matter?

401
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
You're so happy.

402
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Aunt.

403
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Aunt.

404
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Shan Dao said

405
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
he found the heir

406
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,800
of the Jiang clan.

407
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Really?

408
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,800
Where is he?

409
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,800
Who is she?

410
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
She's a little girl.

411
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
She's in her early 20s.

412
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
In her early 20s,

413
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,800
she's a college student.

414
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
No.

415
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
She's not in her 20s.

416
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
What does she do?

417
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
Shan Dao said

418
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
the child's birth father was ill.

419
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,800
There was a heavy flood that year.

420
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
The child's mother

421
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
died to save the child.

422
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,800
The child

423
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
almost died.

424
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
When he was found,

425
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
he was almost dead.

426
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
Then he lived

427
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,800
in the orphanage.

428
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
When he was 18,

429
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
he came out to the world.

430
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,800
Can you believe what Wu Shan Dao said?

431
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
He didn't just

432
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
find you a person to trick you.

433
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Yes.

434
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
You have prejudice against Shan Dao.

435
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
I...

436
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
I've read the information.

437
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,800
The child's mother

438
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
has a photo of the deceased.

439
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Although it's a long time ago,

440
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,800
I can still see

441
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
that Mei Yu Jian

442
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
is quite similar to this child.

443
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Really?

444
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
The child's mother

445
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,800
is also a Chinese doctor.

446
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
I have a photo here.

447
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
Let me see.

448
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
The child is quite spiritual.

449
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
My master told me

450
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,800
that Zhong Zhen and Jiang Shizhen

451
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,800
are from the same family.

452
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
They are each

453
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
a descendant of the same family.

454
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,800
He is the real master

455
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,800
that Jiang Shizhen taught.

456
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
Jiang Shizhen

457
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
is the first generation of the successor.

458
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,800
He is very skilled.

459
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
And he is very brave.

460
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
During the Anti-Japanese War,

461
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
he cured countless patients

462
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,800
with Jiang Shizhen's method.

463
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
You all know

464
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,800
that the war is not

465
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
a small thing.

466
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,800
But with a small silver needle,

467
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
he can make a big difference.

468
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
It's a great thing.

469
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
Although

470
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,800
the child has never read any books,

471
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,800
he is like a Chinese doctor

472
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,800
in the world of medicine.

473
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
How did he study in high school

474
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
when he was 18?

475
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
When he was in high school,

476
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,600
he was a

477
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
scholar of embroidery.

478
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,800
He was a master of embroidery.

479
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,800
The key is whether he is a good person.

480
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Yes, master.

481
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
I want to take a good look at him.

482
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
I'm back.

483
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
You are back.

484
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Let's eat.

485
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,800
Have you finished?

486
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
Yes.

487
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,800
That's great.

488
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
You know how to cook, right?

489
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
What is the way

490
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
to treat the open fracture?

491
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
It's the way

492
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
to treat the open fracture.

493
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
The group can't protect you for long.

494
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,800
In the future, you have to rely on

495
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
your real ability

496
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
to get to work.

497
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,800
I don't need their help at all.

498
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
You don't know how to be grateful.

499
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Everyone on the scene

500
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
knows that

501
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
you can stop for 30 seconds.

502
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
Please, Professor Su,

503
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
stop acting.

504
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Sit down.

505
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
What's wrong with your father?

506
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
You are really

507
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
in a happy day.

508
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Why do you want to stop him?

509
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,800
Why can't you see

510
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
the child's own efforts?

511
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,800
Let's eat.

512
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Let's eat.

513
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
Come on.

514
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Stop talking.

515
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
Dad, come on.

516
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Eat.

517
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,800
By the way,

518
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
I just wanted to ask you.

519
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,800
Where did you get this dress?

520
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Didn't you ask for

521
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
the formal dress in the exam?

522
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,800
Where is your dress?

523
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
It's red and green.

524
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
You are so sloppy.

525
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
You You.

526
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
Grandpa Ma.

527
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
You are still in the hospital?

528
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
You are still in the hospital?

529
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
You look so unwell

530
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
after eating these.

531
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
People have

532
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
seven emotions and six desires.

533
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Only the one with a heavy mouth

534
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
can have such a bad mouth.

535
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
I have to ask you

536
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
to give me more information.

537
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
I have to ask you

538
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
to give me more information.

539
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
I have to ask you

540
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
to give me more information.

541
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
I have to ask you

542
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
to give me more information.

543
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
You are a human.

544
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
Your dad is not a human.

545
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
You scolded my dad.

546
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
I have to tell him.

547
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Your dad is not a human.

548
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
He is the God of Heaven,

549
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Xia Fancheng.

550
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
I am praising him.

551
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
He is a god.

552
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,800
He is better than me.

553
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,800
You

554
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
don't have the burden of your ancestors.

555
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
You can't be your dad.

556
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
You can't be your dad.

557
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Everyone

558
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
can't be your dad.

559
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
Your dad and your mom

560
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,800
are the standard of the people of the ancestors.

561
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
I am just

562
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,800
hoping that you

563
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
can be happy.

564
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,800
It doesn't matter if you get married or not.

565
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
I would have

566
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
given you to your dad long ago.

567
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800
I don't want to live

568
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
a life without people.

569
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
I don't even want to eat ice cream.

570
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
And

571
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
the people who are counting on you

572
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
are your grandpa's

573
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
grand-grandchildren.

574
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
I don't know

575
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
what happened to them.

576
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,800
They were not as good as you back then.

577
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,800
I helped them back then.

578
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Now

579
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,800
they help you.

580
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
This is called

581
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
a hug is a hug.

582
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,800
You are as smart as my grandson.

583
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,800
You are smart and diligent.

584
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,800
You are diligent and diligent.

585
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
You can come here

586
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,800
with your real ability.

587
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,800
That is

588
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,800
the most important thing.

589
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,800
Come on.

590
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,800
Drink some wine with me.

591
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,800
Grandpa.

592
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
This is you.

593
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Little boy

594
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
you are not being righteous.

595
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
You are just trying to break the bridge.

596
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Comrade Song.

597
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
I didn't give my mom and grandma

598
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
a small report.

599
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,800
Just drink it.

600
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,800
This...

601
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,800
Shaoxing Dongpu Ancient Town.

602
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
18 years.

603
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
This wine

604
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
has been buried under the single-clarified tree for 18 years.

605
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
In the bottom of the jar

606
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,800
are all the fragrant of osmanthus.

607
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,800
It's both

608
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
in the lung

609
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
and in the liver.

610
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,800
Grandpa.

611
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
You are really my grandson.

612
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Five colors

613
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
five flavors.

614
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
Five colors

615
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
five flavors

616
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
five colors

617
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
are all very good.

618
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
Grandpa, you are not playing with the skin.

619
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,800
I want to have a sip.

620
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
No, no.

621
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,800
Grandpa, don't drink too much.

622
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
This is grandpa.

623
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
My mom and grandma

624
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
are hitting me on the butt.

625
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
Good boy.

626
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
Good boy.

627
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
Grandpa.

628
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
Shunzhang.

629
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,800
Brother.

630
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,800
I can't get this person back for you.

631
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Who is this person?

632
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
The successor.

633
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
His behavior

634
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
is a good thing.

635
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
Yes.

636
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,800
This girl is cool

637
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
and graceful.

638
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
It's not the first time

639
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,800
that this brother hits his sister.

640
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
Last time, his sister

641
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,800
hit him so hard.

642
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
Why?

643
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,800
He made trouble

644
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
outside.

645
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,800
He asked his sister

646
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,800
for money every Wednesday.

647
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,800
For this, his sister divorced.

648
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,800
According to your experience,

649
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,800
how much money does this brother pay?

650
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,800
It's hard to say.

651
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
I guess it's not less.

652
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,800
This guy

653
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
will not reconcile

654
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,800
without money.

655
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
OK, it's OK.

656
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
I'll talk to them

657
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
then.

658
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
Who is this girl?

659
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
Why are you so helpful?

660
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Uncle Shi.

661
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,800
100,000 yuan?

662
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
When did you

663
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,800
give me 100,000 yuan

664
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,800
at home?

665
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,800
And you asked me to give

666
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
the money to a stranger.

667
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,800
How can you be a stranger?

668
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,800
That's your uncle.

669
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
What a bad guy!

670
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,800
You just put me here.

671
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
You are my uncle,

672
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,800
my father, and my uncle.

673
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
How many uncle's

674
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,800
you have put in my life

675
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,800
are innocent?

676
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
Daughter,

677
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,800
be careful.

678
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
You have to pay

679
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,800
for your mistakes.

680
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,800
It's...

681
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,800
I didn't say anything wrong.

682
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,800
Tell me.

683
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,800
Even if he is really a teacher,

684
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
with his current character,

685
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,800
can he teach us?

686
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
You and your grandpa

687
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
spent decades

688
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,800
to turn Chinese medicine

689
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,800
from rural villages

690
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,800
into a normal business

691
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
with a master's degree

692
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
and a doctor's degree.

693
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
This industry

694
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
has already

695
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
been in the top of the list.

696
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
And a person like him

697
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
who has been in prison...

698
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
From your uncle's

699
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,800
and Wu Shandong's data,

700
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
if this kid

701
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
is really

702
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
a descendant of Jiang's faction,

703
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,800
he will be

704
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,800
eliminated at a very young age.

705
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800
If we don't save him,

706
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,800
will Jiang's faction

707
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,800
really be eliminated?

708
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,800
From the point of view of justice,

709
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
Jiang's faction

710
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,800
has a grudge against the people.

711
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
From the point of view of filial piety,

712
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Jiang's faction

713
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
has a grudge against us.

714
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,800
So we have to save him.

715
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
How do you know

716
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,800
he can teach us?

717
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,800
We didn't give up

718
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
on someone like you

719
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
who can't teach us.

720
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
I'll pay you

721
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
100,000 yuan.

722
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
I'll take your uncle back.

723
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,800
Mom, my dad has private money.

724
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
My car...

725
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
You're still young.

726
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Can you stop

727
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,800
doing things?

728
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
You're lucky this time.

729
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
He won't chase you away.

730
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
What if next time

731
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,800
a girl learns to protect herself?

732
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Will you?

733
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,800
Do you understand?

734
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
I understand.

735
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
I've finished.

736
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,800
He's waiting for you outside.

737
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
Who?

738
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
I'll pay you 100,000 yuan.

739
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,800
You're lucky this time.

740
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
I'll take your uncle back.

741
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,800
You're lucky this time.

742
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,800
What if next time

743
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,800
a girl learns to protect herself?

744
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,800
Will you?

745
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
I won't.

746
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,800
I won't.

747
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
You...

748
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
You know me?

749
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,800
Yes.

750
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,680
I've seen it before.

751
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,760
Then why?

752
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,120
No reason.

753
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,280
I want to ask you.

754
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,800
What's your plan

755
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,160
in the future?

756
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,360
Plan... plan...

757
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,160
Take a step by step.

758
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,600
I'll make a suggestion.

759
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,840
Learn medicine from me.

760
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,200
Chinese medicine.

761
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,600
Brother, I haven't graduated from primary school.

762
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,440
I've graduated from high school.

763
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,440
You...

764
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,720
Who are you?

765
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,360
What organization is this?

766
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,360
This...

767
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,840
This is the Public Security Bureau.

768
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,560
You're a good person.

769
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,960
You've met a good person.

770
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,960
Okay, thank you.

771
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,440
I'll leave first if there's nothing else.

772
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,080
Come.

773
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,600
Is there a car?

774
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,080
What do you mean?

775
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,280
Did you drive here?

776
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,680
The elevator is not here.

777
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,680
Why don't you

778
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,880
give me a ride?

779
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:03,880
Let's go.

780
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,280
Where are you going?

781
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,760
Tell me where you're going.

782
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,640
University City.

783
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,040
What are you going there for?

784
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,000
To go to school.

785
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,680
University City snack street.

786
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,080
Be a chef.

787
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,000
Four thousand eight hundred a month.

788
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,960
Work.

789
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,800
Find a job?

790
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,000
Then follow me.

791
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,720
One hundred yuan a day.

792
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,760
Pay the bill on the day.

793
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,480
If you don't want to do it,

794
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,560
you can go right away.

795
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,520
To be honest,

796
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,360
I don't understand your politics.

797
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
You have kids?

798
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,840
One son.

799
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,560
Are you still in good health?

800
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:50,600
Yes.

801
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,560
But you are not slacherous.

802
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,640
Do I have to do upper body training?

803
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,520
You are always so enthusiasm.

804
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:04,640
Alright.

805
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,160
You agreed so quickly?

806
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I'm still not through

807
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,400
with your mentality and model.

808
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,280
I eat and live, and I get paid.

809
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,120
That's great.

810
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,640
Why are you looking for me

811
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,040
when it's so great?

812
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,880
If I were you,

813
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,160
I would never look for you.

814
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,480
God is looking for you.

815
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,320
God?

816
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,120
What do you mean?

817
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,720
Well,

818
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,560
I'll take you somewhere.

819
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,200
After you get there,

820
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,480
don't say anything

821
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,520
I say,

822
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,400
okay?

823
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,480
I can't say anything

824
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,480
no matter what?

825
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,120
Yes.

826
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,640
Don't say anything

827
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,440
no matter where you are.

828
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,640
What?

829
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,000
What are you doing?

830
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,160
So many...

831
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,160
What?

832
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:14,880
Wait.

833
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,440
Where is this?

834
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,000
Why are there so many white...

835
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,120
From now on,

836
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:22,960
your mouth

837
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,400
is on the air-conditioner.

838
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,440
Why are you so nervous?

839
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,640
I tell you,

840
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,360
I won't do anything bad.

841
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,200
I'm talking to you.

842
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,200
Give me the money first.

843
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,320
Why do you need money for your phone?

844
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,920
I thought you were giving me money.

845
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,160
Transfer.

846
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,440
Don't be a coward.

847
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,080
Come on.

848
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,840
A trap.

849
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,040
Do you want it?

850
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Really?

851
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,200
In this year,

852
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,200
someone even uses a trap.

853
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,680
Go.

854
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,120
I'll tell you again.

855
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,760
I won't do anything bad.

856
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,200
I won't do anything

857
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,360
that will cause me to be a criminal.

858
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,520
You should know who

859
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,040
just kicked you out.

860
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,440
I got into the trap

861
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,920
not because I did something bad.

862
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,160
Do you understand?

863
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,640
I'm very pure-hearted.

864
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,920
After all,

865
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,600
I've been educated for nine years.

866
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,160
I'm not that fish that's lost its net.

867
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,240
Shang Xu...

868
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:59,160
Give each other love.

869
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,520
Cross the life's ripples.

870
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,000
Don't be afraid of the wind and rain.

871
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,720
Don't be afraid of the waves.

872
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,120
Don't be lonely.

873
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,320
Don't be sad.

874
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,120
A little bit of blood is a little bit of blood.

875
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,080
Today, I'm going to introduce

876
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,760
a new colleague to you.

877
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,280
She's my elder.

878
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,880
She's also your elder.

879
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,520
Hello.

880
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,680
Her name is...

881
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,160
What's your name?

882
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,120
Name?

883
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,400
What's her name?

884
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,160
Sun Toto.

885
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,960
Toto is a name of a cat.

886
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,760
What's your name?

887
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,840
I suddenly forgot.

888
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,800
Her name is Sun Toto.

889
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,120
She's supposed to be

890
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,760
the head of the Toto family.

891
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,560
Who gave you that name?

892
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
The head of the welfare home.

893
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,920
Sit down.

894
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,760
Sit down.

895
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,520
Sit down.

896
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,360
I'm the junior.

897
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,080
Sit down.

898
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,480
Her name is Sun Toto.

899
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,960
She grew up in the welfare home.

900
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,280
Although she grew up in the welfare home,

901
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,920
she's not

902
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,400
the welfare home of Wugen.

903
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,840
In order to find her,

904
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,320
my master has worked hard these years.

905
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,080
At the same time, he didn't fail

906
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,280
his family and ancestors.

907
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,200
So today,

908
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,000
with everyone's witness,

909
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,840
Sun Toto finally

910
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,840
has returned to the family.

911
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,560
My mother...

912
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,920
My mother made this.

913
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,540
Is this correct?

914
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,180
1 chord soup diet

915
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,540
Wish your ancestors

916
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,780
good luck

917
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,140
Acarр tree

918
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,860
Wake up

919
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,780
This, this is how to make vest

920
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,260
there are so many of them

921
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:01,860
Get rid of them

922
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,140
So stupid

923
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,500
Please.

924
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,740
Sun T household увеп

925
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,700
is from a Religious school.

926
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,460
And he's a descendant of the Jiang clan.

927
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,760
His mother died early

928
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,140
due to an old man.

929
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,540
She was a great person,

930
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,040
and his family was quite handsomer.

931
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,420
Although Sun T

932
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,180
has never been trained professionally,

933
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,940
his family member

934
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,980
and

935
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,660
I am

936
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,060
very lucky

937
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,460
to be with you.

938
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,060
I believe that soon,

939
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,060
Sun Toto will become

940
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,260
the successor of Jiang's Sect.

941
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:54,340
Sun Toto and my master Song Yiren

942
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,060
are the same generation.

943
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,740
So

944
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,060
I should call him Master Uncle.

945
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,700
Similarly,

946
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,340
he is

947
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,940
everyone's master.

948
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,500
Now,

949
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,740
please

950
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,020
pay your respects to him.

951
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,340
Toto,

952
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,020
you are inferior to me in class.

953
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,060
But I have

954
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,700
a loyal lineage.

955
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,340
So

956
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,820
we should be the same generation.

957
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,180
From now on,

958
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,660
you should learn Chinese medicine from me.

959
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,740
So you should call me Master.

960
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,780
So I won't

961
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,580
be polite to you.

962
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,380
This is my lover,

963
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,780
Song Linglan,
