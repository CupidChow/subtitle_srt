00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Untamed

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,400
So,

4
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,480
you can't be the successor.

5
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,960
I'll be the successor.

6
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,480
I'll be the successor.

7
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,680
You're so deep in your heart.

8
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,360
Oh, I remember.

9
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,640
You said you wanted to go to

10
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,200
the Dragon Boat Castle, right?

11
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,000
I heard that

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
it's getting dark.

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,600
You can't go there.

14
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,560
You have to go somewhere else.

15
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,280
That's why

16
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,280
I'm not going there.

17
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,280
Are you crazy, Ren Feng Zhen?

18
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,360
It's New Year's Eve.

19
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,560
Don't force me to scold you.

20
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,600
You don't know the level of a master.

21
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,280
You're so stubborn.

22
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,040
What are you doing?

23
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,240
What do you mean?

24
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,920
You have to cherish your life.

25
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,640
Stop talking nonsense.

26
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
Cherish your life.

27
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,880
Your life doesn't belong to you alone.

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,360
It belongs to the one you love.

29
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,480
You can call him Jian Xi.

30
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,160
His life doesn't belong to him alone.

31
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,240
It belongs to his mother and Chen Ying.

32
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
No difference in features.

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,360
It doesn't huge.

34
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,760
You're naive.

35
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,160
You don't know anything.

36
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,400
You've changed.

37
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,200
You used to ride a car

38
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,120
in a red light.

39
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,560
Why does it look like

40
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,600
you're a teacher now?

41
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,520
What is the cause of

42
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,080
your remaining training in the end?

43
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,120
Fine.

44
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,000
Really?

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,480
Hello, Tao Zi, I'm next.

46
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:17,080
I want to ask about the house.

47
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,240
This is the way out.

48
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,440
Where should we go first?

49
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,600
Where should I go first?

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Where should I go first?

51
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,680
I'll drive over later.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,560
We need to hurry up.

53
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,960
My family is waiting for me to make dumplings.

54
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,520
Okay.

55
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,520
There will always be some youth.

56
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,480
The love and hatred that never ends.

57
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,760
Thank you.

58
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,560
Hello, Ms. Sui Guang.

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,760
You're back.

60
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,240
Grandma.

61
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,520
Li Qun, you're back.

62
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,800
Hello, Li Qun.

63
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,000
Right, Miss, you're back.

64
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,840
Grandma,

65
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,600
happy birthday.

66
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,640
Hello, auntie, hello.

67
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,380

00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,960
Hello,้ 대박

69
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,040
Any spectacular adventure

70
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,800
WangOMG Yo전에, you are back

71
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,040
Hello, miss Zhang

72
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,040
Welcome back

73
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,060
You are back

74
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,280
You are back

75
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,640
I am still Limian

76
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:36,880
You are back

77
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,920
I am back

78
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,700
Yo bers

79
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,520
Dad, mom

80
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,840
We are back

81
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,960
Blacky is back

82
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,280
Xiao Hong,

83
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,040
I brought you back.

84
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,440
Mom, what did you bring me?

85
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,720
They are all here.

86
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,680
I knew it.

87
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,560
Here, have a taste.

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,720
Xiaodi,

89
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,800
Quan is back.

90
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,280
Mom,

91
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,320
have a taste.

92
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,120
What is it?

93
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,840
It's delicious.

94
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,600
Brother,

95
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,680
I'm not kidding.

96
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,800
I'm still making the sauce.

97
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,520
My classmates are so jealous of me.

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,160
My brother brought it back from the city.

99
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,000
You're kidding.

100
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,760
Here.

101
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,640
This...

102
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
You're a grown-up.

103
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,200
You're still playing with toys.

104
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,960
Li Xuan.

105
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,160
Have a taste.

106
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,920
You're back.

107
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,480
Dad,

108
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,760
you're back.

109
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,080
I didn't know.

110
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,520
I didn't know that my legs hurt.

111
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,120
Come on.

112
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,640
Your dad has been in pain

113
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,800
for the past two days.

114
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,160
Let's have a look.

115
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,960
Let's go.

116
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,320
This way.

117
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,880
Yes.

118
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,440
Here.

119
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,600
Be gentle.

120
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,560
You have a stomachache, dad.

121
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,560
Are you mad?

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,720
I'm just a wet.

123
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,720
I got it from working in the summer.

124
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,720
My dad works in the summer,

125
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,760
so do you.

126
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,880
Why don't you get wet?

127
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,400
Who knows?

128
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:10,960
Dad,

129
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,000
don't be mad.

130
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,040
Don't be mad.

131
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,080
I'll give you acupuncture at home.

132
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,800
It'll be better if I massage you.

133
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,400
I'm not.

134
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,240
Your mom always scolds me

135
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,040
when something doesn't go well.

136
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,160
She's happy about it.

137
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
She's blaming me.

138
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,600
What did she scold you about?

139
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
About your brother.

140
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,680
I've told her several times.

141
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,440
I don't want her to study.

142
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,920
She won't do it.

143
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,040
She said she wanted to learn from you.

144
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,360
She wanted to study in the city

145
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,600
and become a city person.

146
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,440
Dad, listen to me.

147
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,640
It doesn't matter if she becomes a city person.

148
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,120
She needs to study.

149
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,720
Kid,

150
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,440
we can't afford it.

151
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,360
Besides,

152
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,200
you two can live in the city.

153
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,680
We're getting older.

154
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,840
Who will

155
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,480
run our family?

156
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,320
Right.

157
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,520
No one in our hometown is bullied.

158
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,240
Our fish pond

159
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,040
is under the supervision of many people.

160
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,840
Dad,

161
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,440
let's give the toys

162
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,680
to the village head's grandson.

163
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,360
Let's have a matchmaking match.

164
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,800
We have to work for ten years.

165
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,840
Ten years later,

166
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,680
we'll have your brother.

167
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,640
Right.

168
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,400
Dad, mom,

169
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,920
I don't have much money this year.

170
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,280
I'll make you two a red envelope.

171
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,560
Happy New Year.

172
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,120
Mom, happy New Year.

173
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,760
That's all?

174
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,440
You don't make money as a doctor?

175
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,920
It's just the beginning.

176
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,520
I'm an old Chinese doctor.

177
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:45,920
Well,

178
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,360
we've borrowed a lot of money

179
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,120
to support you to go to school.

180
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,760
It's not enough to pay you back.

181
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,520
What are you talking about?

182
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,880
It's just a kid's wish.

183
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,640
He just started it.

184
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,360
Next year.

185
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,640
It'll be fine next year.

186
00:07:59,400 --> 00:07:59,920
Quan,

187
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,000
don't listen to your dad.

188
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,200
He won't say nice things.

189
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,160
Actually, he's looking forward to your return.

190
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,000
You went to the market

191
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,600
without knowing it two days ago.

192
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,320
Look.

193
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,080
I bought a new cotton quilt.

194
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
It's so cool.

195
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,000
Quan,

196
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,320
do you have new clothes?

197
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,120
Change it.

198
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,000
Why?

199
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,840
It's nice.

200
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,440
You're not like a city person.

201
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,920
Go to the village head's house with me.

202
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:25,920
Right.

203
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,320
Why go to the village head's house?

204
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,200
To get married.

205
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,120
The niece of the village head's house

206
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,520
is your classmate.

207
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,360
Her name is Wang Yinghua.

208
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,160
Remember?

209
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,200
If you two can get married,

210
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
our family will be great.

211
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,600
You can live in the village

212
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,520
without looking at others' faces.

213
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,120
Mom, I don't want to get married.

214
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,760
Go to see her.

215
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,400
My child,

216
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,000
Wang Yinghua's dad is the deputy county head now.

217
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,480
Look at your fate.

218
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,240
Go.

219
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,160
Let's go together.

220
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,520
How can I be a high-ranking person?

221
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,240
I don't believe it.

222
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,160
High-ranking?

223
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,400
You're a city person now.

224
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,800
You have a degree and work in the university.

225
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,520
And your instructor is the headmaster.

226
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,040
Right?

227
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,920
I've told them.

228
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,800
You'll be the dean of the university.

229
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,160
Right.

230
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,080
He will be our high-ranking person.

231
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,480
Dad, you can't be ridiculous.

232
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,000
Let's go.

233
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,280
You can't listen to him.

234
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,840
I'm not ridiculous.

235
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,440
Go.

236
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,000
Dad, I won't go.

237
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,680
Go.

238
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,040
I don't believe it.

239
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,680
No.

240
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,200
Li Xin.

241
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,480
Remember to love your brother.

242
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:18,960
Go to see him.

243
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,400
No.

244
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:19,880
Go to see him.

245
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,600
Go to see him.

246
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,440
Go to see him.

247
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,040
I'd rather not go to see him.

248
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,400
Goumasun.

249
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:15,880
We can have noodles later.

250
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,720
Go to trap hour later for it.

251
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,680
Ah Gong.

252
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,880
We must have a lot of noodles.

253
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,960
Just these.

254
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,400
It doesn't matter if there are too many noodles.

255
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,260
Later, I'll make

256
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,040
stockspot collapsed soup.

257
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,420
Add some chicken testicles,

258
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,200
tomatoes, and lots of other ingredients.

259
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,360
It will put an extra nieuwe jewelry.

260
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,200
I will get rid of them all.

261
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,200
Speaking of food,

262
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,280
you ate a lot.

263
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,120
Look at your stuff.

264
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,600
He is right.

265
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,080
Israel is small,

266
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,000
your hunger is bigger.

267
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,760
Am I right, Gouma?

268
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,800
and the spring festival

269
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,560
will be held.

270
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,840
This year, when Toto is home,

271
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,920
our family's new year is even better.

272
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,400
Look at your parents.

273
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,840
They are so happy.

274
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
I think

275
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,080
this is the first time

276
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,160
Toto has celebrated the new year with his family.

277
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,680
He wrote the spring festival,

278
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,360
the New Year's flowers,

279
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,080
the New Year's Eve dinner,

280
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,880
the dumplings, and the TV.

281
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,440
He is so excited.

282
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,640
Actually,

283
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,080
this kind of ceremony

284
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,280
is for the children.

285
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,320
Yes.

286
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,560
Give me a kiss.

287
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,600
Yes.

288
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,040
Give me a kiss.

289
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Be careful.

290
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,120
Handsome.

291
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:32,960
Okay.

292
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,720
Give me a kiss.

293
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,320
I'm done.

294
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,440
I'm so surprised.

295
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,560
What's wrong?

296
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,520
No.

297
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,280
You are so ugly.

298
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,320
The New Year.

299
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,960
No.

300
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,120
We can't put the firecrackers in the New Year.

301
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,480
We need to play the football.

302
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,720
Play the football.

303
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,880
Oh my god.

304
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,200
You are right.

305
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,520
There is a big party

306
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,840
at home.

307
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,120
The noise

308
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,920
is getting louder.

309
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,880
But

310
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,240
my little heart

311
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,080
can't stand it.

312
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,480
Hurry up.

313
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,960
My little heart is okay.

314
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,960
Here comes the dumplings.

315
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,640
Time to eat.

316
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,560
Two dumplings.

317
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,520
It's not cooked.

318
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,040
It's good.

319
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
Qian,

320
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,400
Is it cold in here?

321
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,000
No.

322
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,120
I put a hot water bag in your quilt.

323
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,200
Thank you, mom.

324
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,720
Have you tried this dress?

325
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Your dad has put a lot of effort into this dress.

326
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,120
Try it on.

327
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,720
I'll iron it for you later.

328
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,800
Mom.

329
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,800
I don't want to go on a blind date.

330
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,160
Why?

331
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,640
You don't like that Wang Yinghua?

332
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,440
Let's meet first.

333
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,920
Love can be cultivated.

334
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,600
Quan'er.

335
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,720
Then tell me honestly.

336
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,360
Do you have a crush on someone?

337
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,840
No, mom.

338
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,640
Who can fall in love with me

339
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,200
with my condition?

340
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:51,960
What's wrong?

341
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,000
What's there to choose from?

342
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,320
You'll be the dean of the city in the future.

343
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,240
Mom, you're talking nonsense again.

344
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,120
Since I came back,

345
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,720
you and my dad have been making noise.

346
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,640
It's so funny to hear that.

347
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,240
I'm not a kid.

348
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,160
I'm not a kid.

349
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
I'm not a kid.

350
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,160
I'm not a kid.

351
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
I'm not a kid.

352
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,240
You're not laughing at me.

353
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,440
What are you laughing at?

354
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,520
It's a matter of time.

355
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,920
What's the matter of time?

356
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,120
It's not a matter of Yinghua.

357
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,320
Then do you really have a girlfriend?

358
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,640
What's the family like? How old is she?

359
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,680
Is she pretty?

360
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,240
Mom.

361
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
If I really have a girlfriend,

362
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,720
I'll bring her back to see you.

363
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,320
Okay?

364
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Of course.

365
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,680
I decide to take care of two of you.

366
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,560
Be gentle!

367
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,800
Be gentle!

368
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,580
Mom!

369
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,100
Mom!

370
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,640
Go away!

371
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,640
Let me sit.

372
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,340
Fsnawhter.

373
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,900
Mom.

374
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:20,160
I'll stand on the back of the line

375
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:27,160
You once said that I could sit beside you

376
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:34,160
Together under the sea of water

377
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,840
Once again, I notice the

378
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:46,160
fear I was shaped into

379
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:53,140
You know the sort of rewarded

380
00:16:53,140 --> 00:17:00,760
for this financing

381
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,880
Incredible, 헝

382
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,560
to

383
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,320
Zhou Zifeng

384
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,880
Toyo

385
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,680
I can read you

386
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,360
That's a good thing

387
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,400
So it seems

388
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,200
It's nice

389
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,000
To thank God

390
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,320
Recruitment

391
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,240
Tao Tao

392
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,840
I think new clothes look good

393
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,800
I can't live a happy New Year.

394
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,160
How beautiful the flowers are!

395
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,360
Well,

396
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,840
the flowers are for you.

397
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,080
You'll have more happiness

398
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,320
next year.

399
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,680
Master,

400
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,960
I think

401
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,600
my black clothes are fine.

402
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,640
What color should I wear?

403
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,600
Red is good.

404
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,160
There's no such thing as black in New Year.

405
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,920
Red is a joy.

406
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,520
It's red.

407
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,680
Come here.

408
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,240
Go.

409
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,560
You're going to send a red envelope?

410
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,600
Wait.

411
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,880
Why...

412
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm an adult now.

413
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,480
I can still get a red envelope.

414
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,600
You're not married.

415
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,640
You don't have kids.

416
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,440
You'll always be our kid.

417
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,040
You'll be a grown-up

418
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,600
when you get married.

419
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
You know,

420
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,600
we can't even send a red envelope this New Year.

421
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,680
It's not enough.

422
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,480
Tianzhen,

423
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,000
bring the bouquet here.

424
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,680
I'm finally not lonely this year.

425
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,800
Otherwise, I'll be the only one

426
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,920
to kowtow every year.

427
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,800
Kowtow?

428
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,000
Okay.

429
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,600
Come on.

430
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,240
Come on, Teng.

431
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,800
Let's have a bite.

432
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,640
Be delicate.

433
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,280
Say a few clever words.

434
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,320
Wait a moment.

435
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,640
What's the matter?

436
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,600
Come on.

437
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,320
Come on, come here.

438
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,160
Come.

439
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,400
Come, come, come here.

440
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,120
Help me out.

441
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,640
Come here, help me, come.

442
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,620
My children.

443
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,840
Thank you.

444
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,300
Help me hide it.

445
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,140
Thank you.

446
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,520
Wish you health,

447
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,520
a happy new year,

448
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,240
and longevity.

449
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,120
ading with great fortune.

450
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,120
Thank you.

451
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,280
You see,

452
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,440
now he's still young

453
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,680
and sensible.

454
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,440
Enough.

455
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,800
Enough.

456
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,600
Come on.

457
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,800
What are you counting?

458
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm counting

459
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,960
my 13th birthday

460
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,160
May my grandpa live a long life

461
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,600
and live a long life

462
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,960
You're so sincere

463
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
What about me?

464
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
May my grandma live a long life

465
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,400
Your grandson said

466
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,440
a thousand years of life is not enough

467
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,720
Dad

468
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,360
Give me the red light

469
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,720
Thank you, grandma

470
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,040
You call my grandson every day

471
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,400
You have to send me red light, right?

472
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,040
OK

473
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,440
Then you have to kowtow to me

474
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,640
or you will kick me

475
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,920
I can't find it

476
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,200
I can't find it

477
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,000
Grandma

478
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,280
Don't call me

479
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,840
Grandma

480
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,600
Don't

481
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,360
Grandma

482
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,960
Don't call me

483
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,400
Grandma

484
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,920
I called your grandma

485
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,840
I can't hear you

486
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,480
Hello, grandma

487
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,040
I'm sorry

488
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,440
I called your grandma

489
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,080
Grandma

490
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,760
Grandma

491
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,800
You have to send me a red light

492
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,440
This is the New Year

493
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,400
Grandma

494
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:07,760
Hurry up

495
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,640
Grandma

496
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,640
Grandma, come here

497
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,280
Hurry up

498
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,600
Hurry up

499
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,640
Mom, take it easy

500
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,440
Wait for me

501
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,000
Take it easy

502
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,200
I'll take a break

503
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,000
Grandma

504
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,400
Your little brother is better than me

505
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,680
Who gave you the disease?

506
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,920
I think he is sick

507
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,000
You are just over 40

508
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,600
You are not that important

509
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,000
You have to exercise

510
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,000
Mom, you see his old

511
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,400
I have to hurry up

512
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,640
I don't have much time left

513
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,360
I can't take Yi Han away

514
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,640
Where are you going?

515
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,600
I'm going to the other world

516
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,080
Mom

517
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,480
You are walking with your brother

518
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,480
You want me to die?

519
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,160
OK

520
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,440
I don't need you two to accompany me

521
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,360
You go back

522
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,400
I go by myself

523
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,880
Mom, don't rush

524
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,200
I'll accompany you

525
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,360
I'll accompany you with my life

526
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,360
Mom, wait for me

527
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,400
Take it easy

528
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,600
I'm not watered

529
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,800
Master, you want me?

530
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,520
Yes

531
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,000
Uncle

532
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,560
Don't drink

533
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,400
Happy birthday

534
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,840
Monkey

535
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:34,960
Grown up

536
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,120
It's different from the past

537
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,280
Wait for me

538
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,840
It must be different

539
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,800
Come on

540
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Red envelope

541
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,640
OK

542
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,520
Back to the original

543
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,560
What's the original?

544
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,960
You said that the master gave red envelopes

545
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,680
Red envelope

546
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,480
Today we have a formal meeting

547
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:47,960
I know it

548
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,240
Where is the red envelope?

549
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,680
How can you be so stingy?

550
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,680
Uncle

551
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,240
Hurry up

552
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,440
Hurry up and get down to business

553
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,840
Who is this?

554
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,120
He is our Jiang's true sect

555
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,160
The heir, Sun Toto

556
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,880
Don't don't don't

557
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,360
Don't worship

558
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:07,760
Don't worship

559
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,440
They are all elders

560
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,280
Uncle

561
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,400
Don't worship me

562
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,520
I don't have a red envelope

563
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,840
I received it this year

564
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,720
Not so good

565
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,040
Toto

566
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,880
Let's worship

567
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,160
Express the gratitude of our overseas disciples

568
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,600
To be honest

569
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,520
I really didn't dare to think

570
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,160
We have a lifetime

571
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,680
Can also see

572
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,160
The heir of our Jiang's true sect

573
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,960
It's lucky

574
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,640
I didn't expect it

575
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,960
My master learned that the Jiang's true sect

576
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,400
The heir is the heir

577
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,920
Excited for more than half a year

578
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,960
Half a year ago

579
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,000
We booked a ticket

580
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,960
To come here

581
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,520
Recognize the ancestors

582
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,600
So many years

583
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,960
We are overseas

584
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,200
With this needle

585
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,000
Saved a lot of people

586
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,400
It's not as good as the sect

587
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,960
Settled

588
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,000
We Chinese

589
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,480
Can get to know each other

590
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,480
Rely on

591
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,280
Jiang's true fate

592
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,040
We overseas Chinese

593
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,120
Can be respected and accepted

594
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,600
Have the current social status

595
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,800
With Jiang's true

596
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,760
It's closely related

597
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,720
My brother and sister

598
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,000
In Jiujin Mountain

599
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,160
There is a big clinic

600
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,720
Many foreigners

601
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,240
Come in civilization

602
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,960
Are all brought up

603
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,640
Finally walked out by themselves

604
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,120
This is really

605
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,520
Too great

606
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,120
Sun Tao Tao

607
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,080
Recognize the origin of the Tao

608
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,600
Recognize the origin of the Tao

609
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,160
Don't stand

610
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,040
Sit down

611
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,120
Come come come

612
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,040
Sit sit sit

613
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,880
It's not easy

614
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,600
Talk to you

615
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,160
We come back from overseas

616
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,240
What's up

617
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,640
OK

618
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,640
To let me learn

619
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,760
This is a shoe board

620
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,720
This is

621
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,800
Three

622
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,520
You think about how many three

623
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,480
Don't want to shut me up

624
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,600
Don't want to shut me up

625
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,880
Give me some face

626
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,040
Give me some face

627
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,760
Give me some face

628
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,280
Uh

629
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,280
I said little

630
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,160
Don't marry him

631
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,800
Don't marry him

632
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,640
Tell me

633
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,600
Round it up

634
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,480
Most foolish

635
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,080
Let it be

636
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:44,600
Sister

637
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,760
Dad, a dog

638
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,200
Head meat

639
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,000
what happened

640
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,720
Be careful.

641
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,760
Xia.

642
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,640
How much is the delivery

643
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,800
of the rich and the rich?

644
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,840
Is the delivery not here yet?

645
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
The rich is enough.

646
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,360
But the

647
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,240
rich and the rich

648
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,120
are not

649
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,200
in the same stock.

650
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,080
You've seen it.

651
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,640
Look.

652
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,600
The delivery is so big recently.

653
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,000
The delivery

654
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,640
can't be delivered for a while.

655
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,600
The company

656
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,680
has to wait until the 15th of September

657
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,800
before it can be delivered.

658
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,760
That's what happened in the year after.

659
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,360
The next step is to keep the change.

660
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,760
The season is coming.

661
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,680
Don't let Jianxi

662
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,400
come to the clinic these days.

663
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,920
There are so many people.

664
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,800
Yes.

665
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,080
Look.

666
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,600
This...

667
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,280
This is the appointment for this afternoon.

668
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,800
There are so many people.

669
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,400
We can't finish them by dinner.

670
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,160
That's all.

671
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,160
We can't talk about the patient anymore.

672
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,800
Okay.

673
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,640
Miss.

674
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,280
This way.

675
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,680
Okay.

676
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,640
Jianxi is home alone?

677
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,640
Recently,

678
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,280
Lele is on a cold vacation.

679
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,440
I sent her to Chenyin's home this morning.

680
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,000
These two kids can take care of her.

681
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,680
That's good.

682
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,520
You and Chenyin

683
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,440
can rest assured.

684
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,200
Yes.

685
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,600
Miss.

686
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,200
Do you want to cook some

687
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
orange peel and ginseng water

688
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,360
for the reception tomorrow?

689
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,560
We need to give the patients

690
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,320
who are on the long-term care

691
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,400
a little more time.

692
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,320
Okay.

693
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,680
I'll leave it to you.

694
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,280
Thank you.

695
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,560
Okay.

696
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,600
Miss.

697
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,280
Okay.

698
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,160
Please check.

699
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,840
Here.

700
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,600
Please follow me.

701
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,360
Here.

702
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
There are patients

703
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,680
who have an appointment.

704
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,720
Please write down their names.

705
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,320
Okay.

706
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,160
Okay.

707
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,360
Wait.

708
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,280
Tell us their names.

709
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,080
Tell us their names.

710
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,200
Shaohong.

711
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,280
Shaohong.

712
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,040
Mu Zili.

713
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,800
Mu Zili.

714
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,680
No.

715
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,080
Mu Zili.

716
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,240
I made an appointment.

717
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,640
I didn't get the number this morning.

718
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,920
I want to get it earlier this afternoon.

719
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,800
I have to pick up my grandson

720
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,000
to do the interest class.

721
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,480
Just give me one.

722
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,160
I've been feeling so bored recently.

723
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,720
I want to ask Professor Lin to take a look.

724
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,960
You're eating and drinking

725
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,160
so much during the New Year.

726
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,480
You've only been back for a year.

727
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,240
I'm sure I can make

728
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,800
more delicious dishes.

729
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,440
I can taste the taste.

730
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,480
Then you don't have to go

731
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,640
and see my master.

732
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,040
I can show you.

733
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,040
You're a night-hunter.

734
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,520
You mean you've killed too many people

735
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,120
and you've been cursed.

736
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,280
Stop talking nonsense.

737
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,360
What night-hunter?

738
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,920
Don't listen to him.

739
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,400
He hasn't even touched

740
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,680
the door of the Chinese medicine.

741
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,760
You told me that

742
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,760
you're a night-hunter.

743
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,560
But you've been cursing me

744
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,640
since I told you.

745
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,560
It's the same thing.

746
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,480
I know what I'm saying.

747
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,760
You don't know. Stop talking nonsense.

748
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,680
You can't learn

749
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,280
from a cat that can draw a tiger.

750
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,280
You're just drawing a tiger and a cat.

751
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,840
Don't worry.

752
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,600
You can do it

753
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,520
in the line.

754
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,800
You can do it.

755
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,640
I'll brush my teeth.

756
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,840
Okay.

757
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,760
No.

758
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,560
You have to make an appointment.

759
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
You have to make an appointment before you see it.

760
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:37,800
This cat is good.

761
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,720
Just give me one.

762
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,440
No.

763
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,480
Shao Hong.

764
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,200
I'll go.

765
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,200
I'll go.

766
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Give me the third one.

767
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,800
Give me the third one.

768
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,400
Excuse me.

769
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,840
Shao Hong.

770
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,720
Baby.

771
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,600
Give me a number.

772
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,160
Baby.

773
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,520
Give me a number.

774
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,040
I can't.

775
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,880
I've bought all the people today.

776
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,600
You have to make an appointment.

777
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,200
Baby.

778
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,160
I can't stand it.

779
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,360
I'm in a hurry.

780
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,240
Just hang up the number.

781
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,400
I'm in a hurry.

782
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,160
Give me one.

783
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,680
Give me one.

784
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,400
Give me one.

785
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,200
Give me one.

786
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,520
Give me one.

787
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,480
Give me one.

788
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,760
I've bought all your numbers.

789
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,280
Come on.

790
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,040
Give me one.

791
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,200
Give me one.

792
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,280
Give me one.

793
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,280
Give me one.

794
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,560
Give me one.

795
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,000
Give me one.

796
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Give me one.

797
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,880
What's wrong with this Tao Tao?

798
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,480
She has been acting for three days.

799
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,160
I just praised her a few days ago.

800
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,760
Why did she make trouble again today?

801
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,080
It's not her fault today.

802
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,160
It's her fault.

803
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,760
She made trouble.

804
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
Do you hear that?

805
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,160
Do you hear how she's making trouble?

806
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,880
This is a clinic.

807
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,880
Not a vegetable market.

808
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,800
This is the place for treatment.

809
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,000
This is the place for buying vegetables.

810
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,600
You're all patients.

811
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,920
You're all sick.

812
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,640
You're all loyal.

813
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,160
Are you sick?

814
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,360
Are you sick?

815
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,200
Who's sick?

816
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,120
I'm sick.

817
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,960
We had a fight because of the lack of money.

818
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,080
Yes.

819
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,760
Are you comparable to me?

820
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,360
Are we friends?

821
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,440
We're friends.

822
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,880
We can't compare.

823
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,400
Right?

824
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,200
You're sick again.

825
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,840
What did you eat this time?

826
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,160
Look at what you said.

827
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,280
What can I eat?

828
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,080
This is the smell of the wild.

829
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,600
Among so many patients,

830
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,760
you're the one I hate the most.

831
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,680
Don't see me.

832
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,440
Do you know why?

833
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,160
You're all bacteria.

834
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,200
I'm afraid you'll spread it to me.

835
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,400
You'd better go.

836
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,600
I'm a patient.

837
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,800
I'm friends with Professor.

838
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,840
Who's your friend?

839
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,360
My master doesn't have such friends.

840
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,480
Don't spread it out.

841
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,400
It's embarrassing.

842
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:16,760
Let me tell you.

843
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,200
My master is a kind person.

844
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,320
He's kind.

845
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,240
He doesn't even open animal medicine.

846
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,120
He doesn't dare to open more.

847
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,840
Of course.

848
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,000
Can he be like you?

849
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,080
Can he be your friend?

850
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,720
Can he be friends with a person

851
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,840
who killed animals?

852
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,840
You...

853
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,280
Sister.

854
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,680
You're not a patient.

855
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,440
You're a patient.

856
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,240
The animals you eat

857
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,680
turn into hatred.

858
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,680
They follow you every day.

859
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,640
They're always watching you.

860
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,480
They watch you eat,

861
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,280
they watch you vomit,

862
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,080
they watch you drink,

863
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,040
they watch you pull.

864
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,040
Listen.

865
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,920
You're a patient.

866
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,600
You don't keep your mouth shut.

867
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,640
My master

868
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,440
can't save you.

869
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,200
Right.

870
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,960
Right what?

871
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,720
I didn't say it to you, right?

872
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,360
You're a rat.

873
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,000
You're a rat.

874
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,200
You've done everything.

875
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,320
Look at your face.

876
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,560
Look at your face.

877
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,160
What's the point of running here every day?

878
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,760
Your father and your mother are here.

879
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:09,800
Bad.

880
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,080
What are you doing?

881
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,240
Here.

882
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,640
You're just teaching them a lesson.

883
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,480
I don't dare.

884
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,000
Are you coughing again?

885
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,360
Last time you looked at your phone,

886
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,640
you fell into the water.

887
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,520
Coughing is the root of the illness.

888
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,120
The bubble on the screen

889
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,200
is the video of you playing mahjong.

890
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,360
You don't care about your own child.

891
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,960
Who are you to care about?

892
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,680
Last time, God didn't take your child away.

893
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,760
He's already given you a hard time.

894
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,280
You don't even know how to repent.

895
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,720
You're here again.

896
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,600
Is it that hard to sleep early?

897
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,800
Brother.

898
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,920
Is it that hard to stay up late?

899
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,560
And you, uncle.

900
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,320
You fight every day.

901
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,400
Look at how you forget.

902
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,240
And you, sister.

903
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,840
You're always hungry and want to fight.

904
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,120
You want to fight when you see a disease.

905
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,640
You even use your child as a shield.

906
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,280
Aren't you ashamed?

907
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,600
This is your own body.

908
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,840
You don't even pay attention to it.

909
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,160
No one can control you.

910
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,440
It's not that our clinic doesn't give you treatment.

911
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,320
It's that no one can treat you well.

912
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,560
You said it.

913
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,920
The prescription is open.

914
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,400
You just don't do it.

915
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,160
You run to the clinic every day.

916
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,800
One, two, three times.

917
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,920
You run here.

918
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,360
You're so excited.

919
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,120
You're like a monster.

920
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,240
Like a monster?

921
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,080
Your mom.

922
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,840
You're waiting here quietly.

923
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,800
Who's yelling?

924
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,720
Who's fighting?

925
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,640
Get out.

926
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,920
Stop it.

927
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,840
I agree.

928
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,320
What do you agree?

929
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:04,680
I...

930
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,840
Did you make an appointment?

931
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,080
Did you sign up?

932
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,640
No.

933
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,360
I'm here to find you.

934
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,480
Wait.

935
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,080
Okay.

936
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,360
This is your ghost sword.

937
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,480
I think

938
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,400
we can leave our clinic to Tou Tou.

939
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:23,960
Zhen Xi.

940
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,720
Didn't you say

941
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,560
we doctors can't choose patients?

942
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,200
Look at him.

943
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,320
He chose patients

944
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,080
who are his own patients.

945
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,200
How can you be a doctor

946
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,400
when you're like him?

947
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,720
I think

948
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,840
there are two types of doctors.

949
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,400
One is a vicious killer.

950
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,640
The other is a kind-hearted mother.

951
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,440
Tou Tou is a vicious killer.

952
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,400
It's very suitable.

953
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,600
I think some patients

954
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,400
can't be spoiled.

955
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,160
They can't be kind-hearted.

956
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,120
You should scold her.

957
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,840
You have to scold her.

958
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,240
If you scold her,

959
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,520
we've been

960
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,480
trying to do it for years.

961
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,960
But we can't do it.

962
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,560
You...

963
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,680
You don't want to be your Bodhisattva anymore?

964
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,240
Tou Tou has finished scolding us.

965
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,080
We can be our Bodhisattva.

966
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,800
You're so sinister.

967
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,280
You're finally here.

968
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,320
What did you eat again?

969
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,960
Well...

970
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,120
I had a little cold

971
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,040
during the Spring Festival.

972
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,000
I couldn't hold myself.

973
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,240
I thought it was a cold one.

974
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,640
I ate it and took a sip with Yunshen.

975
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,640
But it turned out to be like this.

976
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,160
You're so lucky.

977
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,840
You still dare to be so hasty.

978
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,240
You're so lucky.

979
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,240
You're so lucky.

980
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
You're so lucky.

981
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,240
You're so lucky.

982
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,240
You're so lucky.

983
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,720
You can't be

984
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,920
an ordinary person who eats radish and cabbage.

985
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,520
No.

986
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,440
You see,

987
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,760
we've been living for decades.

988
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,840
We can't be so greedy

989
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,280
and want to eat and drink.

990
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,120
What's the point of living?

991
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,200
The world of adults is already very hard.

992
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,080
Look at me.

993
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,640
I'm not greedy.

994
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,960
I'm not stingy.

995
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,640
I just like to eat.

996
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,240
It's like what you said,

997
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,080
you can't eat this or that.

998
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,400
You're so happy.

999
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,480
You're 120 years old.

1000
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,480
What's the point?

1001
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,880
It's very painful.

1002
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,080
Is it because of you?

1003
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,440
You said

1004
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,720
you wanted to keep your mood.

1005
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,360
I ate a cold one

1006
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,000
and a hot one.

1007
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,560
I was happy when I ate it.

1008
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,400
After eating it,

1009
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,520
I felt at ease.

1010
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,280
Although I can't gain weight,

1011
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,200
I'm healthy.

1012
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,640
You said

1013
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,120
you're healthy.

1014
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,840
You're healthy.

1015
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,120
Your heart is the most important.

1016
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,520
Your heart is unhealthy.

1017
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,000
God has arranged so many delicious foods for us.

1018
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,840
You don't eat them.

1019
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,000
You prefer to eat those that are not available.

1020
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,800
So you're

1021
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
unhealthy.

1022
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,200
You're the best.

1023
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,080
You're my biggest fan.

1024
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,600
Don't talk nonsense.

1025
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,360
My master can't help you

1026
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,720
if you do something bad.

1027
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,080
What bad thing?

1028
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,800
Master,

1029
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,400
he ate so many bad foods

1030
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,080
and he didn't listen to me.

1031
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,240
You can't control him.

1032
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:34,880
Forget it.

1033
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,840
Call the police.

1034
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,760
But like what he said today,

1035
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,760
you should call the police.

1036
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,960
Yes, I should call the police.

1037
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,360
Don't.

1038
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,040
Stop it.

1039
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,360
Stop it.

1040
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,320
Look at her.

1041
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,600
Yuan Shui,

1042
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,720
you have so much land.

1043
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,080
But you're so ungrateful,

1044
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,400
and you're so arrogant.

1045
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,480
You're so different from

1046
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,280
your father.

1047
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,360
Stop talking nonsense.

1048
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,960
He's not my apprentice.

1049
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,360
He's my master.

1050
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,840
He's here to teach me.

1051
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,280
I'm so tired.

1052
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,480
I'm so tired.

1053
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,000
I'm so thirsty.

1054
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,720
I need to sleep.

1055
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,520
I'm so tired.

1056
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,360
I'm so tired.

1057
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,760
I'm so tired.

1058
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,840
I'm so tired.

1059
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,840
I'm so tired.

1060
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,840
I'm so tired.

1061
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,040
I'm so tired.

1062
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,680
I'm so tired.

1063
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,760
I'm so tired.

1064
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,200
I'm so tired.

1065
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,680
Zhou Beihang,

1066
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,680
this is Zhu Changming's medicine.

1067
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,160
Just keep it there.

1068
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,040
I'll go get it later.

1069
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,240
Okay.

1070
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,960
I saw you didn't sign up

1071
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,840
for the medicine class.

1072
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,640
Why?

1073
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,520
Aren't you a dad?

1074
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,240
You're so active.

1075
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,960
Why are you so curious?

1076
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,080
I can't just be a dad.

1077
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,800
I have to be a mom.

1078
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:05,960
What do you mean?

1079
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,760
This time,

1080
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,040
you have to learn for me.

1081
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,480
I have to complete

1082
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,080
my life first.

1083
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,120
Besides,

1084
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,920
you're all gone.

1085
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,960
The clinic is so busy.

1086
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,920
I have to keep an eye on it.

1087
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,320
I'll help you.

1088
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,160
It's okay.

1089
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,080
I'll help you.

1090
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,440
Zhao Liquan,

1091
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,520
what time is it?

1092
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,960
Do you know how many people are here?

1093
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,880
I'm sorry.

1094
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,800
Qingqing had a fever last night.

1095
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,960
I made her some medicine.

1096
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,560
I just gave her a push.

1097
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,320
She had a fever?

1098
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,360
Why did she have a fever?

1099
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,320
I guess she's exhausted.

1100
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,200
The clinic is the busiest.

1101
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,240
I'll go change.

1102
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,680
Help me ask for a leave.

1103
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,680
Ask for a leave?

1104
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,320
How much?

1105
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,360
What sign did you read

1106
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,920
three times each day?

1107
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,480
You're very pleased

1108
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,680
doing all the chores.

1109
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,800
And you

1110
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,240
gave her widemia

1111
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,280
and all the schedule

1112
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,160
to build you a new home for her.

1113
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,200
That tomato

1114
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,560
makes it hard to sit still.

1115
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,080
It's good to be kind.

1116
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,720
I don't want to.

1117
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,360
Is there anything else that's uncomfortable?

1118
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:57,960
No.

1119
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,600
I feel much better after taking the medicine.

1120
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,960
I heard from Zhao Li Quan that

1121
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,160
he made porridge for you.

1122
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:02,920
Did you take it?

1123
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,000
I finished my medicine.

1124
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,000
He said he insisted on making it for me.

1125
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,160
There's no problem with your pulse.

1126
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,400
It's just a fever.

1127
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,800
I'll get you some water after you get some rest.

1128
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,520
By the way, Xin Xin.

1129
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,800
If you're okay,

1130
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,160
please sell all my comic books.

1131
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,240
I can't use them anymore.

1132
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,440
I can get some money back.

1133
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,640
Okay.

1134
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,320
Be careful. It's hot.

1135
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,280
Let me see.

1136
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,680
You and Zhao Li Quan live together.

1137
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,440
Didn't you get any fever?

1138
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,520
He's a Chinese doctor. I'm a Chinese doctor.

1139
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,600
What's wrong with that?

1140
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,840
It's not a cross-section.

1141
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,200
What?

1142
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,800
A Chinese doctor,

1143
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,120
a nurse,

1144
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,280
and I even got a CPE.

1145
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,640
He's not cross-section.

1146
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,080
It's a good match.

1147
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,640
Don't you think

1148
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,360
two people are better than one?

1149
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,280
Just like you're sick today,

1150
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,840
he can make medicine for you.

1151
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,560
What if I can't make it back?

1152
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,480
Don't say that.

1153
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,200
Sometimes,

1154
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,360
I do feel a little bit hurt.

1155
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,920
When two people

1156
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,360
are at home,

1157
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,080
we chat and eat together.

1158
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,400
I came back late in the afternoon.

1159
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,240
He waited for me at the small alley.

1160
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,640
It's really warm.

1161
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,760
But every time I have this kind of idea,

1162
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,160
I pull myself back.

1163
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:41,600
I

1164
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,120
can't

1165
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,760
choose him.

1166
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,080
I land on the wrong foot.

1167
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,440
How am I supposed to continue knowing?

1168
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,280
She

1169
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,960
picked me from the small alley.

1170
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,760
She's not too young now.

1171
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,800
She didn't even come with me here.

1172
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,600
So she will nothing if I continue doing this.

1173
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,320
It'll be easier for her to do this.

1174
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:15,800
Team Leader

1175
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,800
There will always be some youth

1176
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,800
Meeting doesn't matter hatred

1177
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,800
There will always be some people

1178
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,800
Like the stars in the long night

1179
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,800
Time is silent

1180
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,800
Memories are all over the years

1181
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,800
The food and drinks in memories

1182
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,800
Are warm and equal

1183
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,800
If life is short and there is no pain

1184
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,800
I will light up your life

1185
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,800
The people in the light

1186
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,800
Are just ordinary identities

1187
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,800
Use ordinary body

1188
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,800
Light up the ordinary people's souls

1189
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,800
Burn the heat of the gun

1190
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,800
Use one sentence, we

1191
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,800
Only for this world

1192
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,800
There are people in the dream

1193
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,800
Not just ordinary identities

1194
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,800
Use ordinary body

1195
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,800
Light up the ordinary people's souls

1196
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,800
Burn the heat of the gun

1197
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,800
Use one sentence, we

1198
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,800
Only for this world

1199
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,800
There are people in the dream

1200
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,800
Not just ordinary identities

1201
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,800
Use ordinary body

1202
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,800
Light up the ordinary people's souls

1203
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:55,800
Burn the heat of the gun

1204
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,800
Use one sentence, we

1205
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,800
Only for this world
