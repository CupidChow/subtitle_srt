00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,400
You should stop being so dependent.

4
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,600
I'll teach you. You do it.

5
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,400
It's not good.

6
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,400
You child.

7
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,800
My legs are disabled. My brain isn't disabled.

8
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,200
You should know that I'm your master's classmate.

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,400
Fine.

10
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,000
Let me ask you then.

11
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,600
How did you fall?

12
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,800
I really don't remember.

13
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,400
Look, I asked you and you said you don't remember.

14
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,000
How would I know if you were a needle?

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,200
How about I recite the Emperor's inner scriptures for you?

16
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,800
Or else, you can rely on my acupuncture skills.

17
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,000
Enough. Rest well.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,200
If my master doesn't...

19
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,000
I haven't replied to your message yet.

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,600
I'll just put it in the same place as yesterday.

21
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,400
Whose disciple is this? Who's home?

22
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Is it not hot?

23
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,600
It's not hot.

24
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,400
Who is my mom?

25
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Is it Xiao Bailing?

26
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,800
Who?

27
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,400
You can't remember what I asked you.

28
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,600
I'm not at ease with what you asked me to do.

29
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,800
We can never step into the same spot.

30
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,200
Everything is still based on what your master said.

31
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,800
I hope that the person I don't remember is him.

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,400
Then you decide.

33
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,000
Hey!

34
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,200
No! Are you confused or awake? I can't tell.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,400
Then you tell me.

36
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,400
You don't know what I'm saying.

37
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,000
Your master,

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,400
I don't know if he's awake or confused.

39
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,600
Hurry up and call me.

40
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,400
Ask Shen Xing how my mom is.

41
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,600
What are you talking about?

42
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,800
Hurry up and call him. Don't be a mess.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,800
Tianzhen, did you watch the news?

44
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,000
How are things over there?

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,600
Are the two people in charge of Niu's father's case confirmed?

46
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Are there any quarantine conditions?

47
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm fine here, Mom, don't worry.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,400
It's just that Niu's son didn't come back.

49
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Niu's fine. He's currently living in the county hospital.

50
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,600
How are you and my grandma?

51
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,400
We're all fine. Don't worry.

52
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,600
Is the situation in your town under control?

53
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,200
It is. My dad came.

54
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,400
He came and told me that the prescription he left was very correct.

55
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,800
I already told everyone what my dad asked.

56
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,600
If there's anything, don't come over. I'll go up.

57
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,800
Do you still have a mask? Do you want to send some more?

58
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,200
I still have a mask. I brought a lot.

59
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,800
Tianzhen, is the medicine you brought enough?

60
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,400
It's almost the new year.

61
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,800
I don't know if the express will stop.

62
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,200
We'll send you some more.

63
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,400
Also, the flow-tube sachet is still working.

64
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,600
Did you bring it?

65
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,600
I did. I've been wearing it. Look.

66
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,200
Here.

67
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,600
Tianzhen, let me tell you.

68
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,800
The situation now is not realistic even if you come back.

69
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,000
You must be fine.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,400
Good thing your dad is there. We can be at ease.

71
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
Be fine.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,600
Tianzhen, you tell your dad to come over and talk to me.

73
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,800
My dad won't let me. He wants to maintain social distance.

74
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,600
Where is he?

75
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,200
He's sitting across from my room. We're not staying in the same room.

76
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,600
Then go over and take a picture and let me see.

77
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,400
No, mom. If you want to talk to him, just call my dad.

78
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,200
Why are you bothering me?

79
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,200
Ren Tianzhen, where's your dad?

80
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't lie to me. Tell me the truth.

81
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,200
My dad went to Wuhan.

82
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,400
What?

83
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,600
Such a big matter. Why didn't he tell his family?

84
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,000
Stop fighting.

85
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Hello?

86
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,400
Are you in Wuhan?

87
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,000
Yes, I'm in Wuhan.

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,200
Many of our colleagues here are infected.

89
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,400
The hospital is in need of resources.

90
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,200
How about this? Get me some masks and disinfectants.

91
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,800
Let's close the clinic first.

92
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,600
Get some masks and send them over.

93
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,200
There are almost no protective measures here.

94
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,800
Okay, I know. I'll go make the plates right away.

95
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,400
How about this? Leave some for your parents.

96
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Don't worry about us. Protect yourself.

97
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,200
Yes, yes, yes. Don't worry about us. You're in the first line.

98
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,400
You're the first in safety.

99
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,200
I heard what Master said.

100
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,600
Linglan, I'll leave Master and Aunt to you.

101
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Our family...

102
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,400
is in your hands.

103
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
Don't worry.

104
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,800
Protect yourself.

105
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,200
Don't worry.

106
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,800
I'll be there.

107
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,600
Is there a patient?

108
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll be there.

109
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,600
Goodbye.

110
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,600
Mom and Dad,

111
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,000
I've decided to take Xinzheng's parents to Li Lan's house.

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll secretly take them back.

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,600
Linglan, I support you.

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,800
I'll go to Yunnan to pick up Grandma and Grandpa.

115
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Then I'll go to the clinic to prepare for the official checkup.

116
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,200
I'll also go to the Shandong side to take a look.

117
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,600
Do you want to come back?

118
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,800
I'll be the one to decide if my son can stand on the doctor's feet.

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,200
It depends on this battle.

120
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
And he's staying in Hubei.

121
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,000
When necessary, he can also help Xinzheng.

122
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,800
I'll go prepare.

123
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Hello, Tongtong, where are you?

124
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,200
This is my daughter.

125
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,400
She can stand on the big stage.

126
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,200
My daughter...

127
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,800
This point...

128
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,000
She broke me.

129
00:08:51,800 --> 00:09:15,600
Annihilator

130
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,400
Old Zhang,

131
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,960
Oh, Mr. Wang.

132
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,160
You are the famous Professor Ren.

133
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
No, I don't.

134
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,360
I read your books.

135
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,080
And

136
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,800
Mr. Luo has been telling me

137
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,920
your legendary story.

138
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,840
Thank you

139
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,520
for coming

140
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,720
when we were in such a difficult time.

141
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,320
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,840
How is it going with us?

143
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,880
Not good.

144
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,160
We used Aqimei,

145
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,960
Baifule

146
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,680
and some other herbs,

147
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,600
including

148
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,920
Chinese medicine.

149
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,240
Now it seems

150
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,120
that the herbs are not good for the body.

151
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,240
It's a little small,

152
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
but I'm not sure.

153
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,360
By the way,

154
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,880
when I was checking the room,

155
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,600
the patient told me

156
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,640
that you felt much better

157
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,120
after you got the injection.

158
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,720
It's like the big stone in your chest

159
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
has been removed.

160
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,880
I was telling Professor Ren

161
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,280
that he felt much better

162
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,760
when he got the injection.

163
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
Yes, yes.

164
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,560
I really don't understand

165
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,920
Chinese medicine.

166
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,360
We, the Western medical team,

167
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,320
haven't figured out the virus.

168
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,520
What's the result?

169
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,200
The research has begun.

170
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,400
The key is

171
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,360
that the patient will be said to be effective

172
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,040
after the injection.

173
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,880
Is it a psychological comfort?

174
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,200
In fact, I think

175
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,040
Western medical research is

176
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,640
about the disease of life.

177
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,200
So what Chinese medical research

178
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,920
is about is the disease of life.

179
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,640
The virus is like a seed.

180
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,400
If the seed is going to sprout,

181
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,040
it must have an environment,

182
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,720
soil and temperature.

183
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,160
I don't care what kind of seed it is.

184
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,480
I'll destroy its growth environment.

185
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,560
Then the virus will naturally disappear.

186
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,280
You mean

187
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,600
the survival environment of the virus

188
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,120
is human, right?

189
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,400
You understand very well.

190
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:56,840
Yes.

191
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,200
It's warm and warm.

192
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,960
It's warm and cold.

193
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
No matter what disease it is,

194
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,920
it's equal to its condition.

195
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,520
In the disease,

196
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,800
its infectiousness is not too strong.

197
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,640
As long as it has been in the most dangerous days,

198
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,840
it will recover naturally

199
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,720
when it has the immunity.

200
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,360
You're right.

201
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,840
I have a request.

202
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,480
Go ahead.

203
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,160
We can't take the patients here.

204
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,640
And the community

205
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,480
is still sending patients to us.

206
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,200
Look.

207
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,800
In our clinic,

208
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,120
there are so many patients

209
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,240
less than 300 square meters.

210
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,320
If there is no disease,

211
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,640
it will spread to the patients.

212
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,360
The patient just told me

213
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,440
that you have a very fast diagnosis.

214
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,000
I want to

215
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,200
do this.

216
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,560
Can you help us

217
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,760
to strengthen the community

218
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,720
and relieve the pressure on our side?

219
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,600
Of course.

220
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,240
The material on the base is more difficult.

221
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,680
Please consider it.

222
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,280
If you agree,

223
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,160
I will introduce you to the hospital.

224
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,160
No problem.

225
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,480
No problem.

226
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,560
Great.

227
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,840
Great.

228
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,720
Thank you, Professor Ren.

229
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,280
Thank you.

230
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,000
Thank you.

231
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,560
Thank you.

232
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,920
You really helped us a lot.

233
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,480
Today is the last day of the delivery.

234
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,280
We have to rest

235
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,480
after packing up.

236
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,320
Come.

237
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,840
Yixuan.

238
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,000
Hello, Professor Ren.

239
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,480
How is your side?

240
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,480
I'm fine.

241
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,000
Have you found your true self?

242
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,640
Professor Ren, what do you mean?

243
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,720
If there is a hard battle,

244
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,320
would you like to be with us?

245
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,200
Of course I would.

246
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,640
I really need someone here.

247
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,960
If you have to,

248
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,080
it's a life-or-death situation.

249
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,800
Professor Ren,

250
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,960
I've died once.

251
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,560
You gave me my life.

252
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,400
I'm not afraid of this disease.

253
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,600
Great.

254
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,400
Your mother has prepared the needle

255
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,440
and protective material.

256
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,160
You...

257
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,320
You drive Yang Xiaohong's car.

258
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:07,960
Okay.

259
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,680
Thank you.

260
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,440
Professor Ren,

261
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,400
I should thank you.

262
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,480
Professor Ren's phone?

263
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,120
Yes.

264
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,080
He asked me to go to Wuhan.

265
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,080
Then drive my car.

266
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
You can bring more medicine.

267
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,280
Yes.

268
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,600
Okay.

269
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
Why are you here?

270
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,480
I'm going to Wuhan soon.

271
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,760
I'm here to see you.

272
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,880
Wuhan?

273
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,440
Are you crazy?

274
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,480
You didn't watch the news?

275
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,880
The experts said you couldn't go.

276
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,360
Why do you have to be different from others?

277
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,280
Do people need help?

278
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,480
Why are there so many people in the clinic?

279
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,120
I have to go.

280
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,120
I don't know when I can come back.

281
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
I came to say goodbye to you.

282
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,160
I'm sorry.

283
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,880
I'm sorry.

284
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,560
Thank you.

285
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,200
Here are the medical herbs.

286
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,080
Remember to drink them.

287
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,400
Oh, right.

288
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,600
I made two澤香籃.

289
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,400
I promise

290
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,700
I will send you an advance

291
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,260
dictionary

292
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,600
I'm leaving

293
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:40,940
the alleged seasons are coming soon to the爆發時

294
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,660
him onto you.

295
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,620
He didn't take much praises from you.

296
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,180
comprehension

297
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,540
It's that simple.

298
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,540
In fact, in the family,

299
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,340
you can treat the patients with paper.

300
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,420
You don't have to

301
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,220
go to the hospital

302
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,220
to treat the patients.

303
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,460
Professor Ren,

304
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,300
thank you.

305
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,500
You're welcome.

306
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,420
Professor Ren,

307
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,420
we've been

308
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,620
in the history.

309
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,340
Yes.

310
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,500
That kid

311
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,900
is your son.

312
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,300
He's filial to you.

313
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,300
Student?

314
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,180
He's like my son.

315
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,020
My son

316
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,340
is in Hubei,

317
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,780
treating patients.

318
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,660
You're a good man.

319
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,820
Your whole family

320
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,420
is a good man.

321
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,420
Thank you.

322
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,820
I'll go and give you Chinese medicine.

323
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,860
Have a good rest.

324
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,580
Professor Ren,

325
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,060
what kind of medicine

326
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,540
did you give my old man?

327
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,460
This is the Chinese medicine

328
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,140
for the epidemic.

329
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,380
You should drink it too.

330
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,860
You too.

331
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,740
Thank you.

332
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,220
Professor Ren,

333
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,100
come here.

334
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,940
Professor Ren,

335
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,900
your Chinese medicine

336
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,500
is for forgetfulness and anger.

337
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,460
But now,

338
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,100
we don't even know

339
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,540
what's wrong with the virus.

340
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,540
You just give them medicine.

341
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,340
The key is to give them the same medicine.

342
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:32,860
This...

343
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,060
This is not scientific.

344
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,580
I don't have time to explain it to you.

345
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,300
If you want to drink it,

346
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:36,660
you can drink it.

347
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,060
You can see

348
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,340
how many patients are out there.

349
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,700
It's a cold day.

350
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,580
If you wait outside,

351
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,300
the virus will definitely get you.

352
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,300
You decide.

353
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:43,900
Well...

354
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,740
How is it?

355
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:54,980
Dad, mom,

356
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,060
it's cold outside, right?

357
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,340
It's not peaceful this year.

358
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,140
So I brought you here.

359
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,620
Okay.

360
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,460
I haven't seen your granddaughter, right?

361
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,620
Granddaughter?

362
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,180
Granddaughter?

363
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,220
Tao Tao,

364
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,780
come here to see your grandparents.

365
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,020
Hello, grandparents.

366
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,020
I'm a new student of the master.

367
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,180
I've put my luggage here.

368
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,180
I'm leaving now.

369
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,260
What a little girl.

370
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,700
Tao Tao.

371
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,500
Tao Tao.

372
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,940
I'm going to see my master.

373
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,940
Love each other.

374
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,620
Love each other.

375
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,420
Go through life's ups and downs.

376
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,340
Don't be afraid of the wind and clouds.

377
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,100
Don't be afraid of the waves.

378
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,100
Don't be afraid of being alone.

379
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,420
Don't be a sad face.

380
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,460
Sad.

381
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,980
Love each other.

382
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,980
Love each other.

383
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,540
Don't be afraid of the wind and clouds.

384
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,540
Don't be afraid of being alone.

385
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,820
Here.

386
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,260
Send it to the master.

387
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,500
They're in a hurry.

388
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,140
Okay.

389
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,140
Okay.

390
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,020
And...

391
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,980
You can't put the glass here.

392
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,260
You can't put it here.

393
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,700
You have to put it on the top.

394
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,220
Okay.

395
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,980
You have to put it here.

396
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,980
Thank you.

397
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,980
Okay.

398
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,020
Put it here.

399
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,540
By the way,

400
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,860
did Tian Tian contact you?

401
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,060
Do they need it?

402
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,340
She's fine.

403
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,700
It's a small place.

404
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,860
The main thing is Wuhan.

405
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,900
Lixuan told me

406
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,860
that they have a house of uncle Xiang.

407
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,460
The team in our hospital

408
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,980
took all the luggage they could bring.

409
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,580
Didn't you register

410
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,980
the medical team in your hospital?

411
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,980
I did.

412
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,340
They don't want me.

413
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,340
They're all in the department of

414
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,820
the patient who has a stroke

415
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,700
and is suffering from anesthesia.

416
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,220
There must be children's disease, right?

417
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,700
Why don't they need a pediatrician?

418
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,180
In my opinion,

419
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,900
besides the department,

420
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,620
we should consider our own situation.

421
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,980
A single-parent man like me

422
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,060
who is old and has no money

423
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,060
should go to the front line first.

424
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,980
No.

425
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,220
Like you said,

426
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,620
every volunteer

427
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,180
should go there safely

428
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,220
and come back safely.

429
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:24,820
Like you said,

430
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,420
it seems that no one cares about you

431
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,860
and no one cares about you.

432
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,020
Yes. You're right.

433
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,180
Everyone should go there safely.

434
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,740
I just think that

435
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,060
after so many years of medical school,

436
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,540
I've learned

437
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:53,400
this skill of the

438
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,180
It's said that

439
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,140
all donations from the affected areas

440
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,980
are all free.

441
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,580
Really?

442
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,660
It's said that

443
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,460
Jiang没事

444
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,540
has taught his men

445
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,600
more than one lesson

446
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,000
as a medicinerator.

447
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,660
— Mr. Ren, give it a rest.

448
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,540
Just a little.

449
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,180
What fish do you encounter?

450
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,640
It may cause you

451
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,580
some problems.

452
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,820
Here's your water.

453
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,580
Thank you.

454
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,860
I will send a message to Toto later.

455
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,660
It's a plan to cure Wu Shandao.

456
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,660
Toto should be asleep by now.

457
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,460
He won't sleep until he answers my call.

458
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,860
It's my fault.

459
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,540
Feng fruits

460
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,220
Pig fat

461
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,460
Pig fat

462
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,660
D cents

463
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,180
Vivien

464
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,460
I'm here.

465
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,860
Do you like selling ummrrts in the village?

466
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,260
Wait for me to come in.

467
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,060
I'll do it on my high stage.

468
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,260
There won't be long.

469
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,860
The house is great.

470
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,120
tTIO

471
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,860
I'm here.

472
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,940
I have something to tell you.

473
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,660
I need to come to your Shuang lies base on the trial.

474
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,560
period,

475
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,800
I'd really like to have two

476
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,260
in-laws.

477
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,560
政府

478
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,360
is basing its village on

479
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,560
living in the mountains.

480
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,360
Madam.

481
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,560
Your parents

482
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,560
came from Yunnan.

483
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,800
There must be

484
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,560
a care technology

485
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,480
among them.

486
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,500
I'm sorry.

487
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,780
How's your family?

488
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,900
Is it closed?

489
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,820
Do you eat and drink less?

490
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,700
It's not good.

491
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,980
Do you have a guarantee of living in your home?

492
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,340
I just go to grab food at midnight.

493
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,700
Nothing else.

494
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,500
Just the community is closed.

495
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,460
No entry and no exit.

496
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,380
Do you need me to send some students to help you?

497
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,140
Just stay at home and don't go anywhere.

498
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,900
It's the biggest help to me.

499
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,940
Pills,

500
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,700
snoods,

501
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,540
youngest parents and youngest sisters.

502
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,700
On this list,

503
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,940
someone must Rio medidas today.

504
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,660
It's impossible.

505
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,160
Good

506
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,140
Beta,

507
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,620
you must copy it.

508
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,460
You coughed already,

509
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,460
I'm fine.

510
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,700
There are too many patients.

511
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,660
I won't joke about my health.

512
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:34,980
Go.

513
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,980
Okay, I understand.

514
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,500
Take care.

515
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,340
Drinking.

516
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,380
I'll get you some medicine.

517
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,300
I'm sorry.

518
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,940
It's time to take your medicine.

519
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,340
Okay.

520
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,420
I'm waiting for your medicine.

521
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,380
What's wrong with you?

522
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,020
Did you cough too?

523
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,220
Come on.

524
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,700
Let me show you.

525
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,820
Be quiet.

526
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,460
I heard it.

527
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,700
You've been coughing for days.

528
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,580
What's wrong with you?

529
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,420
I haven't coughed for days.

530
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,460
I just feel

531
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,820
a little bit.

532
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,420
Don't tell him.

533
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,220
Don't tell him.

534
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,020
Don't worry.

535
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,420
You should get a needle.

536
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,420
It's not a small thing.

537
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,220
Okay.

538
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,420
I'll go to the doctor's office later.

539
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,860
When he's in the hospital,

540
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,940
I'll go to the ward.

541
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,420
Then I'll be fine.

542
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:33,980
I also

543
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,340
received the notice of the ward.

544
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,740
They said I could go in tomorrow.

545
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,940
Zhao Yang is so beautiful.

546
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,420
But I don't know

547
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,740
if it's the last time

548
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,380
I see her.

549
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,180
What's wrong with you?

550
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,460
What's wrong with you?

551
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,700
Professor Lin.

552
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,820
Professor Lin.

553
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,660
Let's go inside and take a look.

554
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,300
Okay?

555
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,380
We'll go there next time.

556
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,380
How can I stay here?

557
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,700
What did you say?

558
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,180
Did your dad pass out?

559
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,660
Did he get serious illness?

560
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,260
Li Quan said he wasономnlich.

561
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:43,980
It wasn't tire diagnosis.

562
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,620
He thinks my dad is tired.

563
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:46,900
He cleans up and

564
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,420
makes all the bubbles.

565
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,020
Does he have a fever?

566
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,220
It's an severe fever.

567
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,260
No time to say no

568
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:11,460
Doctor

569
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,040
This is minutos

570
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,620
God

571
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,460
for hope

572
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,300
I'm sorry.

573
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,380
Go ahead.

574
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,260
Go to Xinzheng.

575
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,780
You've been

576
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,820
absent-minded for days.

577
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,500
You've lost your mind.

578
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,460
Go ahead.

579
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,460
He...

580
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,700
He won't let me go.

581
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,020
He won't let you go.

582
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,300
You're a doctor.

583
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,700
You should go.

584
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,060
Now the country needs people.

585
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,100
But what about you?

586
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,220
Your father and I are healthy.

587
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,700
Don't worry.

588
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,100
Xinzheng

589
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,940
entrusted his parents to me.

590
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,700
We'll take care of him.

591
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,860
Your father and I have been in a relationship for 60 years.

592
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,060
Aren't you relieved?

593
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,420
It's not about being relieved.

594
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,100
What's the problem?

595
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,900
Now Wuhan is sealed.

596
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,420
How can I get in?

597
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,820
I'm so worried.

598
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,060
Do you want to go or not?

599
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,020
Then it's okay.

600
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,500
As long as you want to go, there's a way.

601
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,060
It's easy to say.

602
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,060
This is the case of Jiang An District Court.

603
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,100
It's an invitation to the medical school.

604
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,460
Take this.

605
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,980
Your mother and I

606
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,780
worked with them two days ago.

607
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,180
Go now.

608
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,220
Go.

609
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,460
Okay.

610
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:14,740
Don't worry.

611
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,740
Don't worry about your family.

612
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,740
Can you see it?

613
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,820
Can you see it?

614
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:23,860
Look here.

615
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,300
Look here.

616
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,780
You can stand up today.

617
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,020
I can.

618
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,820
They stood up and jumped at me.

619
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,060
I almost didn't hold on.

620
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,620
Look.

621
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,500
But be careful.

622
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,180
He needs a brain shell on his head.

623
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,020
You have to wear a safety hat for him.

624
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,780
I know.

625
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,460
I'll go back and choose for him.

626
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,220
What color?

627
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,860
I'll choose it myself.

628
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,700
I'll go to the bathroom.

629
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,100
By the way, Mr. Du.

630
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,340
Be careful.

631
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,380
It's the first time we went to the memorial service.

632
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,980
And you said it's spring.

633
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,540
Although the temperature is still low,

634
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,940
spring is different from winter.

635
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,100
But I think you're talking nonsense.

636
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,580
What spring and winter?

637
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,420
I really feel spring today.

638
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,540
Okay.

639
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,140
Tell me.

640
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,580
How do you feel?

641
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,900
I feel it's spring today.

642
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,580
I felt wet at night.

643
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,620
I thought the ground might be warmer.

644
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,660
It means

645
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,460
you didn't lie to me.

646
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,500
I didn't lie to you.

647
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,540
It's the heaven and earth.

648
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,100
The heaven and earth?

649
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,180
The autumn is gone.

650
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,540
The spring is here.

651
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,740
You two are uneducated.

652
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,660
Because

653
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,540
servantés

654
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,780
were brought down to the ground.

655
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,060
So it's all a lie.

656
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,700
Shan Tao.

657
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,100
You old idiot.

658
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,580
You're almost recovered now.

659
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,100
You forgot the people treating you, right?

660
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,460
Exactly.

661
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,540
Wait a moment, sir.

662
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,740
Why are you coughing?

663
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,740
You can't cough now.

664
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,580
Menopause?

665
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,140
It's a secret secret.

666
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,380
I'm a bit sick now,

667
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,580
I'm hanging up.

668
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,660
I didn't finish.

669
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,660
An joy.

670
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,020
You're so bad.

671
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,980
No, Uncle.

672
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,820
I think I'm so...

673
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,020
I'm so nervous.

674
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,980
Will I get infected?

675
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,980
You're such a dumbass.

676
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,060
No.

677
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,180
Don't worry.

678
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,020
That's the situation.

679
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,500
I'm leaving for Wuhan right away.

680
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,100
You can count on me

681
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,460
and Zhu Xiang at the clinic.

682
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,780
Ms. Song, don't worry.

683
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,900
The clinic is closed now.

684
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,100
It's fine.

685
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,980
Everyone is at home.

686
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,460
They won't go out and run around.

687
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,660
Aunt, we'll keep in touch.

688
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,660
You should take care of yourself.

689
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,300
If you need anything

690
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,940
or if you have any situation,

691
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,860
just tell us.

692
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,060
We'll figure it out.

693
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,780
If we find an effective way,

694
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,220
we'll share it with the group.

695
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,140
Do we have any patients here?

696
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,380
Not yet.

697
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,620
But I have some friends

698
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,900
around Wuhan.

699
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,860
They have been

700
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,660
diagnosed with the disease.

701
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,020
And they can be tested abroad.

702
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,620
I'm so anxious now.

703
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,460
Don't worry.

704
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,500
Jiangzhou is safe.

705
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,420
I'm not anxious.

706
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,740
I just feel helpless.

707
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,540
You've gone to the front line to support them.

708
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,900
But we're still here.

709
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,580
We don't know

710
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,860
what to do

711
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,100
to help them.

712
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,580
I have an idea.

713
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,300
Tell Mr. Song.

714
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:22,900
Come on.

715
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,940
Ms. Song, Ms. Hong,

716
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,580
I have an idea.

717
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,980
I usually have a group of patients.

718
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,460
We're all

719
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,100
cheering for them.

720
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,020
But recently,

721
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,940
everyone is very anxious.

722
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,940
Some patients are diagnosed with the disease.

723
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,820
They can't find a place to stay.

724
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,740
Especially,

725
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,180
everyone is like me.

726
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,420
It's not convenient to go out.

727
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,500
Some are overseas patients.

728
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,020
They're all scared.

729
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,660
Can we

730
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,540
gather these

731
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,980
who are sick

732
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,220
but have nowhere to stay?

733
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,340
The doctors in our hospital

734
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,500
are at home now.

735
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,460
Why don't we go online

736
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,540
to help them?

737
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,260
At least,

738
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,180
don't make them feel

739
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,900
they're abandoned.

740
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,020
I think this idea is good.

741
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,980
We can

742
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,340
give them

743
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,020
some spiritual support.

744
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:09,860
But

745
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,260
we can have a western doctor

746
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,700
and a central doctor.

747
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,780
How about I call Peng Shiyan?

748
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,780
Okay.

749
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,460
Xiaoyang,

750
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,660
you can

751
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,260
sign with Peng

752
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,260
to call Tianzhen.

753
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,220
Tianzhen has real-life experience.

754
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,340
You can share it with the group.

755
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,380
Anyway,

756
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,860
we have to do our best

757
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,580
to help everyone who needs it.

758
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,620
Okay.

759
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,140
Take care, Mrs. Song.

760
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,700
I'll contact them now.

761
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,940
Okay, Ms. Song.

762
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,340
This idea is great.

763
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,100
I'll meet them later.

764
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,300
You must be careful

765
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,780
to protect them.

766
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,420
I'll meet them now.

767
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,100
Okay.

768
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,060
Chen Yifan

769
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,900
Why do you come again?

770
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,780
I'm fine.

771
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,140
I'm fine.

772
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,820
Go do your job.

773
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,820
Mr. Neng.

774
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,340
Maybe some people

775
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,260
sent me an invitation.

776
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,660
Here are some bed kisses.

777
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,620
Here are some bed kisses.

778
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,820
Food.

779
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:43,100
Xiao Gustou is performing jazz in 2D.

780
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:57,120
No wonder you look

781
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,120
so dull on stage.

782
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,000
Even Though You're So Salty laug h

783
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,520
You say

784
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,880
This

785
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,900
That's why we kept working as drake house.

786
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:14,900
Young guy.

787
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,940
You blackmailed me.

788
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,660
Bring it.

789
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,780
I blame it on you.

790
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,340
And now...

791
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,500
and now...

792
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,060
In the meantime,

793
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:36,180
It's time for me to take some Lord Qiang's books.

794
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,020
Take'em.

795
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,380
Mingxiang told me

796
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,620
that急症生 offense

797
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,820
is a dangerous disease.

798
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,900
What's more,

799
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,060
it's not normal to count on him.

800
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,420
I don't think

801
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,500
someone would do this.

802
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,580
But I hope

803
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,060
everyone can return to the campus

804
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:58,360
easily to的

805
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,220
and stay positive to this.

806
00:40:59,220 --> 00:40:59,980
Yes.

807
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,860
Thank you.

808
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,260
It is always good to

809
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,500
lead a high stride

810
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,820
reproduction kick

811
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,700
Ijä

812
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,660
Do you have any medicine there?

813
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,900
He said

814
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,740
this time try insulin

815
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,380
If she should the naturals

816
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,520
it's a yellow- Zelda

817
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,060
don't let her think about this

818
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,260
they will be bad

819
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,340
You should take water

820
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,080
and drink water

821
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,020
Okay, I see

822
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,140
You're so bad.

823
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,980
I'm not being careful.

824
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,100
You're just playing.

825
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:41,820
I'm so tired.

826
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,620
I need to rest.

827
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,620
Don't.

828
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,420
Hurry up.

829
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:44,860
Okay.

830
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,860
You're so anxious.

831
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,500
Go on.

832
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,220
Okay.

833
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:47,580
Okay.

834
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,460
My stomach is getting bigger these days.

835
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,380
Hurry up.

836
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,020
Zhenzhen, take this.

837
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,340
It's called medicine.

838
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,580
What's that?

839
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,900
Ma Hongliu.

840
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,740
Pusheen 15.

841
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:02,980
Xingren 9.

842
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,700
Chaihu 15.

843
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,780
Fengxin 6.

844
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,660
Zhigan 5.

845
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:13,300
Shengjiang 10.

846
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,220
This is a prescription for the epidemic.

847
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,940
I asked my dad.

848
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,500
He said that if you fry the glutinous rice into the main porridge of the word Jiao,

849
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,860
it can remove the wetness and help with the disease.

850
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,420
I'll sort it out later

851
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,980
and send it out as an article of the public account.

852
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,200
Perfume

853
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,180
hexagon wine

854
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:16,580
The atmosphere, the us in the sunset

855
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,420
This youth

856
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:29,220
The more time, the more complete it becomes

857
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:34,820
Missing you is happening

858
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,540
There are always people

859
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:41,780
Who are worth crossing the mountains and rivers to complete

860
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:46,100
Running together towards the years and the stars

861
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,380
I'm sure

862
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,580
You are that person

863
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,660
I admit

864
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:58,980
It's not that pure, the heart is so heavy

865
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:03,220
Already trapped in your eyes

866
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,380
The feeling of being trapped

867
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:09,700
The fate of the dream

868
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,700
Waiting for the sound of the sound

869
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,700
There are always people

870
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:20,180
Who are worth crossing the mountains and rivers to complete

871
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:24,500
Running together towards the years and the stars

872
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,860
I'm sure

873
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:31,140
You are that person

874
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,300
I admit

875
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,620
It's not that pure, the heart is so heavy

876
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,860
Already trapped in your eyes

877
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:44,100
The feeling of being trapped

878
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:51,780
The fate of the dream

879
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:58,180
Waiting for the sound of the sound
