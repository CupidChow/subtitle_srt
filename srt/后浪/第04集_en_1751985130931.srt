00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You applied for a large health fund.

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You created a few film research and development buildings.

5
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This building is not a research and development building.

6
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's not suitable for our support project.

7
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Please come this way.

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Leader, I reported to you

9
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
that our Chinese herb cultivation base

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
is a very small part of our industrial park.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Leader, look at the building over there.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We are going to

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
enter the top-class physical examination hospital

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and start a listed company.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Within five years,

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
the three hospitals will be opened.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The treatment and recovery of stomach disease

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
outside the three hospitals will be completed here.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Leader,

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
this is our plan for health.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Boss Liu,

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
you said it was five years later, ten years later.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
When the money comes, everyone will drink.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But with so much money,

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
we have to give it to people who have already been in the same group.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Now, a factory in this place

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
is you're sincere.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Secretary,

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Director,

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
do you know Ren Xinzheng?

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Professor Ren of the Chinese Medical University?

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Of course I know.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
My old man is looking for him for treatment.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Professor Ren is a miracle of Jiangzhou.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He is very successful in the country.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Professor Ren is the greatest sincerity of our industrial park.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Health industry

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
is mainly the cultivation of talent.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Talent cultivation must be educated first.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This leader knows that

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
as long as Professor Ren is here to testify,

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
he has a complete education blueprint.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Once his school is opened,

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
talent is released.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I am a healthy industrialist.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Then there is no worry about the future.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Is Ren here now?

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He has resigned and came out to support me to start a business.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I have the students to support me every day.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You are really a great man.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
My old man

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
said a few days ago that

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Professor Ren is not going to be treated.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The doctor of the Chinese Medical University

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
has taken off the name tag of Professor Ren.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I didn't expect to find him here.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Let's go and see Professor Ren.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm afraid you will be a poor man in the future.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Professor Ren.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Look who is here.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Congratulations to the class of the master class.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Thank you.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Professor Ren, do you remember me?

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I can't remember people.

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Then you must remember my father.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's the famous Cao Fanghua.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You remember him as your father.

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I remember you as my father.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I remember Cao Fanghua.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You cured his ear disease.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I went to your place with my father three or five times.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I have too many patients in the clinic.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So I...

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I understand.

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The government has put a lot of emphasis on support.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's a good part for education.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Professor Ren's class can apply for government subsidies.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes.

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So we invited Director Xia and the director of the board of directors.

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's see if there is any intention of cooperation.

84
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I applied.

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I didn't approve.

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So we will go to the site to work.

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You are so generous.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You will definitely approve.

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes.

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't know what Professor Ren's plan is.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
There is no plan.

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Let's take a step by step.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The master class has been running for many years.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So we should take a step by step.

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Professor Ren is very humble.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He has been a doctor in the Chinese medicine field for a lifetime.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So he has a good heart.

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Without the help of the leaders, he will definitely not succeed.

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
How about this?

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We can choose a day to make a fortune.

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Let's ask the professor to sell the house.

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay.

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No.

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Not today.

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I will go to class with the students soon.

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I will wait for the day when I don't go to class.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Then you can come.

110
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We may not have time next time.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If people have needs,

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
they will have time at any time.

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Well.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We don't need to have such needs.

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The leaders are healthy.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Let's take a safe pulse.

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Safe pulse.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Come on.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I won't see you off.

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I welcome the classes you are willing to take.

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Maybe we can use it in the future.

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What class are we going to have today?

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The Chinese medicine emergency method

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
that can help you get rid of the symptoms of brain and heart problems.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Before we talk about the Chinese medicine emergency,

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I want to ask you.

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What is the eye of the Chinese medicine?

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Who knows?

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yin and Yang.

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes.

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You are right.

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yin and Yang.

133
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
How can we distinguish Yin and Yang?

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Oh, no.

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We are back to the mystery again.

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's not mystery.

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's easy to distinguish.

138
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Because we are all lying down

139
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
before we walk.

140
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The place where the back is facing the sun is Yang.

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The place where the back is facing the ground is Yin.

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Our body has three Yin and three Yang.

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Sun,

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yang,

145
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yin,

146
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and Yin.

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:45,000
They are both the

148
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
opposite sides.

149
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Look.

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
This side is the opposite side.

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The opposite side is the opposite side.

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yang is the opposite side.

153
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yin and Yang is the opposite side.

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Tai and Yang are the opposite side.

155
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The same thing goes with Yang.

156
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
On the contrary,

157
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yin and Yang are the opposite side.

158
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Tai and Yang are the opposite side.

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The same things as this side.

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The opposite side is the opposite side.

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
They are easily different from one another.

162
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Is every Chapter clear?

163
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,240
I'll keep our company

164
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,720
and give you all the time

165
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,640
that you need.

166
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,600
That's my line.

167
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,560
Take a rest.

168
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
The object is here.

169
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,700
I'll get that.

170
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,320
Tongtong.

171
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,000
Tongtong.

172
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,280
To find something.

173
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
because people's bodies are divided into two parts.

174
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
One part is the form,

175
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and the other part is the form.

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I found that some students,

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
although they were sitting in the classroom,

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
the form had already left.

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
They were playing with their phones.

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I think it's better to let them sleep.

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
At least they can sleep and become a form.

182
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So I really hope that the students

183
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
can cherish their lessons in the classroom.

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
They can sleep if they can't hear.

185
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
They can sleep and become a form.

186
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
They can become a form, a form, and a form.

187
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I think they can sleep better than playing with their phones.

188
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Maybe we can become a form

189
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
by sleeping.

190
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What do you think?

191
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What do you think?

192
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Go to the bathroom.

193
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Go.

194
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Go.

195
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Why haven't you come yet?

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
How long have you been waiting?

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Aren't you hungry?

198
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You're always coming to bathe me.

199
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You should like to bathe me.

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Brother Shui,

201
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
don't be 혹시aring all the time.

202
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Being eyel Katie-faced

203
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
shows your health.

204
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Right?

205
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Don't be like your father.

206
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Let me ask you.

207
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
If your father went to watch

208
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Don't worry.

209
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,160
Xiao Tou,

210
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,040
you're the most troublesome one

211
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,280
when ordering food.

212
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,760
The ingredients are good,

213
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,720
but the shoes are not.

214
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The taste is good,

215
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,640
but the oil is not.

216
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,440
Enough.

217
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,400
Stop it.

218
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,480
Listen,

219
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,240
I've ordered food

220
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,400
from four people.

221
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,160
I'm not bragging.

222
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,320
These are the food.

223
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,640
I can't even tell

224
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,600
which one is the food.

225
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,000
I told you it's not good.

226
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,960
Don't order it.

227
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,080
It's just a problem.

228
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,000
It's the taste.

229
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,440
You're talking nonsense.

230
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,680
We've ordered

231
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,080
the best restaurants

232
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,920
in the neighborhood

233
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,920
except the ones that sell guns.

234
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,280
You can try it.

235
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,240
If you think it's okay,

236
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,160
we can

237
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,360
order new dishes.

238
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,400
Try it?

239
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
I can try all the dishes?

240
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,000
Of course.

241
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,920
I'm ready.

242
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,880
Let's get started.

243
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,040
Get ready.

244
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,800
Go.

245
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
You're using chopsticks.

246
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,520
You've tried it before.

247
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,680
How will others eat it later?

248
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,920
Why are you so good at it?

249
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,680
Can you do it for me?

250
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,440
This is your favorite, right?

251
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,280
They mainly make Sichuan dishes.

252
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,600
But now,

253
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,840
they make sweet and spicy dishes

254
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,880
to become Jiang Zhewen's taste buds.

255
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,720
Don't order it.

256
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,880
It's getting worse.

257
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,000
Next one.

258
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,600
You don't have to open it.

259
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,920
When you came in,

260
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,680
you smelled it.

261
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,120
This is my favorite.

262
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,520
It's the smell of the fat sausage

263
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,320
of the small and small farmers.

264
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,160
I got it.

265
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,440
It has

266
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,560
peas and pepper.

267
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,280
It smells so good.

268
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:39,960
Who is it?

269
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,760
It's you.

270
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,000
It smells so good.

271
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,880
Next one.

272
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,400
This is mine.

273
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,120
This one.

274
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,480
You're good at it.

275
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
It's a small sausage.

276
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,120
You can order it in such a good restaurant.

277
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,160
Can we eat this

278
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
every day?

279
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,080
You can eat egg rolls too?

280
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,280
You're not here to deliver food, right?

281
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,280
Where are you going?

282
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,520
You're here to write a video

283
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,720
for Michelin, right?

284
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,680
Next one.

285
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,680
Can you do it or not?

286
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,720
This is a bit strange.

287
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,360
The one who mixed wine, herbs,

288
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,240
pot and rice wine

289
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,640
is the one who

290
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,920
entered the restaurant, right?

291
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,920
But this one

292
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,120
is not the same as the one in the restaurant.

293
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
Is it their restaurant?

294
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,000
Tao Tao.

295
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,880
I admire you so much.

296
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,960
His restaurant is a chef.

297
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,560
The fat chef

298
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,720
opened his own restaurant.

299
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,400
Now he is a apprentice.

300
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,480
I know.

301
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,800
That Zhou Jing Hong.

302
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,640
He always cooks

303
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,000
in a bad way.

304
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,800
Yes.

305
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,400
How can you afford

306
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,760
a restaurant like Ying Xin Xiao Luo's?

307
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,800
The delivery we sent last time

308
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,040
was broken when we sent it back.

309
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,120
I said it was the delivery man.

310
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,200
You don't believe it?

311
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,240
Is your delivery man

312
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,600
a ghost?

313
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,400
Are you crazy?

314
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,120
Hong Shun Zhen.

315
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,040
What do you mean?

316
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,120
You can't see the little brother outside.

317
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,280
I'm not. I'm back.

318
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,560
I tell you.

319
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,680
You smelly bastard.

320
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,000
Do you think you can make money?

321
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,880
I'll kill you.

322
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,160
Be careful. Don't fall.

323
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:28,920
Come here.

324
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,280
I'll make you some money.

325
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,800
I'll really cut you off.

326
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,520
Don't worry.

327
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,080
You can't cut people short.

328
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,880
Tao Tao.

329
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,360
Did you learn all this

330
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,200
when you delivered the delivery?

331
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,800
I deliver delivery every day.

332
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,160
Of course I have time.

333
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,520
Brother.

334
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,280
I'm so lucky.

335
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
I'll listen to you

336
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,600
when you order delivery in the future.

337
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,360
Yes.

338
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,840
Whose inventory is this?

339
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,880
Why hasn't anyone taken it?

340
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,320
Son.

341
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,000
You're going to eat, right?

342
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,800
Really?

343
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,160
Both one goes into the mouth

344
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,160
and the other goes out.

345
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
You can have more experience

346
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,480
if you start with your mouth and lips.

347
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,280
Your mom is scolding me.

348
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,520
Do you know how to make

349
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,640
a one-time dish?

350
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,120
Do you know that some one-time dishes

351
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,760
are made with double-edged water?

352
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,760
Do you know that

353
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,640
the one-time dishes in your hand

354
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,680
may be expired

355
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,720
with large intestine liver bacteria

356
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,080
and liver cancer?

357
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,880
There is a nail on your chopsticks.

358
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,480
You just swallowed it.

359
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,480
Stop talking, okay?

360
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,800
Your mom just said

361
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,880
that the goods come from the mouth.

362
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,520
Stop talking.

363
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,800
Let's live for two more years.

364
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,240
What a crybaby you are.

365
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,160
Look at this.

366
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,040
How is it?

367
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
It's the same as the one in your hand.

368
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,840
It's not clean.

369
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,560
The internal organs of the正气

370
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,160
are not clean.

371
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,800
I can tell from the look on your face.

372
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,960
You must be a shy person.

373
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,360
You haven't suffered much.

374
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,120
You are so delicate when you eat.

375
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,520
You must be hungry

376
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,000
and fast

377
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,720
and healthy

378
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,240
before you can eat well.

379
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,040
Do you know that?

380
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,560
If you can't finish it,

381
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,280
I'll help you to share it.

382
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,720
You dare to eat it?

383
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,800
Boss,

384
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,840
are you not full?

385
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,120
Look,

386
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,520
I've been eating it.

387
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,720
If you don't mind,

388
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,680
you can eat mine.

389
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,920
I'm coming.

390
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,400
Thank you, boss.

391
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,280
There is a god called Tao Tian in the village.

392
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,160
He is a big mouth

393
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,680
and eats well.

394
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,960
I thought he was a maid before,

395
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,640
but I met him.

396
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,000
Do you know that

397
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,560
the anti-corruption is like a flower?

398
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,880
Friends,

399
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,400
I've tried all the dishes

400
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,520
for you today.

401
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,520
I think the best dish is

402
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,880
the small spring sun.

403
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,560
If we eat small spring food every day,

404
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,200
I'll eat it with my hands and feet.

405
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,880
What about you?

406
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,960
We have no money.

407
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,760
No,

408
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,360
why are you like this?

409
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,520
If we eat good food, we have no money.

410
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,000
If we eat bad food, the food is not fresh.

411
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,400
What?

412
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,520
We don't eat it anymore?

413
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,160
Then let's choose the one with high cost.

414
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,920
Fortunately, these shops

415
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,280
are not low-cost friends.

416
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,640
The ingredients are almost the same.

417
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,720
I agree.

418
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,440
The food is not the same now.

419
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,000
You can't go into the kitchen.

420
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,920
You can eat it.

421
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,600
It's so fragrant.

422
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,240
It's good to order food.

423
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
Just eat it.

424
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,720
How can that work?

425
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,520
You know it's not good.

426
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,720
Why do you spend money?

427
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,640
Isn't this the kind of

428
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,920
air that is filled with good things?

429
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,640
Never be picky about wine.

430
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,480
Nice.

431
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,160
Hero Peng.

432
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,480
Hero Peng.

433
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,080
How about

434
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,000
letting Peng Shiyan be our monitor in the future?

435
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,840
Okay.

436
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,880
Okay.

437
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,760
Wait a minute.

438
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,800
Let's eat.

439
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,520
Why are you the monitor?

440
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,800
Let's talk about eating.

441
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,560
About eating?

442
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,240
Okay.

443
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,360
How about this?

444
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,000
I'll cook for everyone later.

445
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,800
Okay?

446
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,200
You can cook?

447
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,400
Of course I can.

448
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,680
If it weren't for my nephew

449
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,160
asking me to be the heir,

450
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,680
I would be a chef now.

451
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,400
Really?

452
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,720
Okay.

453
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,000
Let's eat the food in the class tomorrow.

454
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,240
Let's take care of it secretly.

455
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,000
How about it?

456
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,480
I'll order

457
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,080
fish-flavored shredded pork.

458
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,080
Okay.

459
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,080
Fish-flavored shredded pork.

460
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,520
Okay.

461
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,160
Peng Peng.

462
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,280
Can I have a braised beef?

463
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,480
Sure.

464
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,960
Monitor, take the paper and write it down.

465
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,880
Let the monitor

466
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,040
write down whatever you want to eat.

467
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,800
What do you want to eat?

468
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,760
Roasted yellow-eared abalone with black pepper.

469
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,840
Roasted yellow-eared abalone with black pepper.

470
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,040
What the hell is this?

471
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,680
Here you go.

472
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,680
Be careful with my ginseng Fifty.

473
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,240
Mr. and Mrs. Ten,

474
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,040
Professor Lian,

475
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,960
all these years

476
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,960
did I destroy

477
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,560
one of your treasures?

478
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,240
It's not turns out

479
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,400
whether I even

480
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,320
separate ginseng Fifty and weeds.

481
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,360
Then we'll have a grandchild in law

482
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,040
not to mention.

483
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,320
Be careful.

484
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,200
Or you can do it yourself.

485
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,960
I know.

486
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,600
You are talking about Sun Toutou

487
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,800
in the corner.

488
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,600
I'm not talking about it.

489
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,200
I'm just saying it.

490
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,000
Sun Toutou

491
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,800
is different from us.

492
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,000
She doesn't have

493
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,760
such a good family environment.

494
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,760
She doesn't know

495
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,160
what is knowledge and etiquette.

496
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,960
No one teaches her.

497
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,560
What is etiquette?

498
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,960
What is elegance?

499
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,960
In fact, all these

500
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,560
should be done

501
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,560
in family education.

502
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,960
Now,

503
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,960
it's all up to Master.

504
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,360
Don't say that.

505
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,160
She has a special sense of taste

506
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,760
and smell.

507
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,560
I feel

508
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,720
she is a good person.

509
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,720
You feel she is a good person?

510
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,320
You should be patient

511
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,720
with Sun Toutou.

512
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,120
I'm not being patient with her.

513
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,520
I just

514
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,520
don't know her.

515
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,120
You know,

516
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,120
Wu Shandao

517
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,920
brought a little girl here

518
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,520
and put her in front of us.

519
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,920
She is so tall.

520
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,920
I've never seen

521
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,520
such a person since I was a child.

522
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,520
How can I recognize her?

523
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,720
You should believe in the power of education.

524
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,520
She just started to

525
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,720
be a good person.

526
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,320
If one day,

527
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,720
she can't be a successor

528
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,920
or a doctor,

529
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,120
she will become

530
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,520
a good girl who knows

531
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,320
and knows etiquette.

532
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,520
Isn't she also a good daughter-in-law

533
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,720
who is well-mannered

534
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,320
and good at food

535
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,320
for society?

536
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,720
Isn't she also a virtue?

537
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,920
A good daughter-in-law?

538
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,120
Who would marry her

539
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,720
if she were like her?

540
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,920
Nonsense.

541
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,320
The celebration of the new year is coming.

542
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,320
Her family is ready.

543
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,320
I won't do anything

544
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,920
that I should do.

545
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,520
I've asked Peng Shiyan

546
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,120
to count their food.

547
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,120
Speaking of this,

548
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,720
I have to tell you

549
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,720
that so many people

550
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,720
need money

551
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,120
to eat and wear clothes.

552
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:29,920
Yes.

553
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,920
The money is not

554
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,320
from the sky

555
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,320
or from your body.

556
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,520
I'm talking to you.

557
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,320
Can you find a sponsor?

558
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,320
You always

559
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,920
ask for money from your pocket.

560
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,120
No one can stand it.

561
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,720
You're a good daughter-in-law.

562
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,520
Do good things.

563
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,320
Don't talk about it.

564
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,520
If one day,

565
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,120
we can't get over it,

566
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,320
you can tell me.

567
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,720
No need.

568
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,520
Just now.

569
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,720
We can't get over it.

570
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,120
What a pity your feelings

571
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,920
are not farah.

572
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,160
No...

573
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,960
I'm sorry,

574
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,720
and Lin Liang worries we may not survive the second quarter.

575
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,520
Every match,

576
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,320
there always sweetinces.

577
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:20,920
Yes.

578
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,520
If I-

579
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,720
Spend more time with him.

580
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,120
I can't drink wine.

581
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,720
impressed.

582
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,520
Spend more time with him.

583
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,120
Don't you have our proper ramps?

584
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,720
Yes.

585
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,520
That's what I asked you to do.

586
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,520
Paste it and give him to you without any difficulties.

587
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,120
Give me all the money.

588
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,100
!?

589
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,320
You

590
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,600
walk too fast

591
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,620
Well

592
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:49,920
Zhou Ge

593
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,060
answer me

594
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,820
light out of the box

595
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,120
Why you are here to learn?

596
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,300
So good at

597
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,020
What the hell

598
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,320
You get the pay

599
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,820
Why should I learn means

600
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,040
and What the heck

601
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,100
what I do

602
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,540
Are you talking to me?

603
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,000
Can we save the money to buy snacks?

604
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,160
No.

605
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,280
Why not?

606
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,240
I said no.

607
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,040
How much can we spend on snacks?

608
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,040
You can buy whatever you want.

609
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,560
That's enough.

610
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,280
Hello, guys.

611
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,160
Excuse me.

612
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,120
I'm a shopkeeper nearby.

613
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,600
Can I...

614
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,320
Thanks.

615
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,720
Can I add your WeChat account?

616
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,480
What's your shop?

617
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,240
This is my shop.

618
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,280
Meijia Shop.

619
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,640
Okay.

620
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,640
Okay.

621
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,200
I've added it.

622
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,920
Okay.

623
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,640
Thanks.

624
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,200
It's okay.

625
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,360
Who do you think you are to add WeChat?

626
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,720
You know your sister-in-law

627
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,280
can take all your personal information

628
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,040
and accounts

629
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,880
and transfer all your money.

630
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,400
You have no sense of security.

631
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,600
What a coincidence.

632
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,400
First,

633
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,880
I have no money in my account.

634
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,720
Second,

635
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,040
she's so stingy.

636
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,520
If it's a robbery,

637
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,800
she might lose money.

638
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,680
Right?

639
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,680
Come on, Yuxuan.

640
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,440
Let's go somewhere else.

641
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,600
cosine Nonet soon,

642
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,120
no one came to the hospital.

643
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,920
What's going?

644
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,640
Lisa.

645
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,480
What's up?

646
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,240
I was thinking

647
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,520
What's wrong?

648
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,280
Do you want to call an ambulance?

649
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,560
Can you get me some red sugar water?

650
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,560
Your blood sugar.

651
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,680
Who are you?

652
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,800
We're doctors from the hospital.

653
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,400
Okay.

654
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,080
Shandao.

655
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,040
Brother,

656
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,280
are you going to take the kids to Hua Feng

657
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,200
for the sake of Qingming?

658
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,240
What else do you need?

659
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,440
Nothing.

660
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,920
Linglan will get it ready.

661
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,800
Are you going?

662
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,520
I have a few meetings.

663
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,560
I'll talk to you later.

664
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,640
But I checked the weather forecast.

665
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,480
It's raining these days.

666
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,840
So you have to prepare a pair of shoes.

667
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,920
The road conditions there are very muddled.

668
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,080
You mentioned it very well.

669
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,360
I'll tell Linglan.

670
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,960
Is Linglan by your side?

671
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,800
No, she's busy.

672
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,880
I called you today

673
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,680
to tell you something very important.

674
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,640
What is it?

675
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,240
Tell me.

676
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,520
Don't you want to take a walk?

677
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,560
What's up?

678
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,680
Old man.

679
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,520
What's up?

680
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,800
You're so mysterious.

681
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,080
Bai Ling.

682
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,560
Tell me, Qiao Jia.

683
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,160
I saw a patient

684
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,600
from a foreign country today.

685
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,400
He said

686
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,000
a immortal came to him.

687
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,560
And that immortal

688
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,600
recommended him to me.

689
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
What does this have to do with Bai Ling?

690
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,560
I guess that immortal is Bai Ling.

691
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,320
I've asked about his appearance and age.

692
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,200
He's not old.

693
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,520
And according to the patient,

694
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
the way he talked

695
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,680
should be from the class.

696
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,880
Not only the mountain,

697
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,920
there's another

698
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,600
more interesting place.

699
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,800
The place where the immortal lived

700
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,800
is on the edge of Mount Hua Feng.

701
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,080
So I guess

702
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,920
the immortal is Bai Ling.

703
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,520
He must still miss you

704
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,920
and know you'll come back every year.

705
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,520
Please.

706
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,600
This way.

707
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,040
Do you like it?

708
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,080
You still know how to eat.

709
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,120
I'm going to

710
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,640
make this fruit

711
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,680
well later.

712
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,440
Give it to our college dad.

713
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,280
Find it.

714
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,080
Let him take his notes

715
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,600
and other things

716
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,560
and copy them for us.

717
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,280
Share it.

718
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,400
You're back.

719
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,840
You've worked hard.

720
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,680
I've prepared

721
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,960
delicious and delicious

722
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,960
fruit for you.

723
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,800
Here.

724
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,680
I'm on a diet.

725
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,960
This is unsweetened yogurt.

726
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,680
It won't affect

727
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,920
your diet.

728
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,440
Here.

729
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,400
I don't eat fruit.

730
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,800
You have a special taste.

731
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,200
I'm not a big fan of fruit.

732
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,680
I'll take it as a gift.

733
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,680
But I remember

734
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,680
you've memorized the notes

735
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,680
very well.

736
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,680
You're a good lawyer.

737
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,680
How about

738
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
lending your notes

739
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
to your classmates

740
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,680
and sharing it with them?

741
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,680
Why?

742
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,680
To improve

743
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,680
our study.

744
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
No.

745
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,680
I'm trying to

746
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,680
memorize the notes.

747
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
You don't have it.

748
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,680
Why do you

749
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,680
want to use my work results?

750
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,680
Why are you

751
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,680
like my classmate?

752
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,680
This is not

753
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,680
the last elimination.

754
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,680
What's wrong with sharing it?

755
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,680
Although it's not the last elimination,

756
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,680
it's a bit of a advantage.

757
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,680
I've tried.

758
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,680
I have the ability.

759
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,680
I'm excellent.

760
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,680
Anyway,

761
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,680
the result is the same

762
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
as the person who tried.

763
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,680
It's unfair.

764
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,680
Oh my god.

765
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,680
You don't need

766
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,680
other people's help

767
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,680
in your life, right?

768
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,680
Okay.

769
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,680
Okay.

770
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
Great.

771
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
I'm leaving.

772
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
Where did you go?

773
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680
For a walk.

774
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,680
Why didn't you

775
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,680
call me for a walk?

776
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,680
We can walk together.

777
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,680
I can punch you.

778
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,680
It's great.

779
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,680
Sun Tao Tao.

780
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,680
Where's my water-boiled eggs?

781
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,680
I put them out.

782
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,680
I told you.

783
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,680
I only eat boiled eggs.

784
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,680
No.

785
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,680
The eggs will be more colorful.

786
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,680
Add some meat

787
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,680
and garlic flavor.

788
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,680
It will be more delicious.

789
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,680
Okay, Sun Tao Tao.

790
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,680
Only eat cucumbers?

791
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,680
You're a rabbit.

792
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,680
So many dishes.

793
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,680
Coming.

794
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,680
The last dish.

795
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,680
Tao Tao.

796
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,680
Did you make all of them?

797
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,680
Of course.

798
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,680
It's great.

799
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,680
Uncle.

800
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,680
Try the fish-scented shredded pork.

801
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,680
Eat it.

802
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,680
It's like noodles.

803
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,680
It's good.

804
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,680
It's gone.

805
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,680
It's gone.

806
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,680
Tao Tao.

807
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,680
You're a teacher.

808
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,680
But you still say it's good.

809
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,680
It's the highest evaluation.

810
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,680
You mean

811
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,680
it's not good to eat it after you eat it.

812
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
Come on, everyone.

813
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,680
Eat it.

814
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,680
Let's eat.

815
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
Try it.

816
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,680
Right.

817
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
Uncle.

818
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
Uncle.

819
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,680
We're going to the supermarket this afternoon.

820
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,680
There's a girl.

821
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,680
She's so cute.

822
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,680
I can't stand her.

823
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
I'll go up

824
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
and give her two stitches.

825
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,680
Okay.

826
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,680
It's amazing.

827
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,680
I believe in the needle.

828
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,680
Really?

829
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,680
Yes.

830
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,680
Son.

831
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,680
Tell me about your design.

832
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
I don't have it.

833
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
You're so modest.

834
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,680
Teacher Song.

835
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,680
Today, I took the girl's pulse.

836
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,680
According to her pulse,

837
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,680
she's not a girl.

838
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,680
I think she's too sick.

839
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,680
The experiment and the diagnosis

840
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,680
show that she hasn't eaten anything all day.

841
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,680
Her blood sugar is low, so she has a blood pressure.

842
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,680
I think the girl's

843
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,680
physiological period is coming.

844
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,680
How did you cure her?

845
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,680
I gave her

846
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,680
the fish vein and the rib.

847
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,680
It's balanced when she's in the pulse.

848
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,680
I think she's fine.

849
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,680
It's amazing.

850
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,680
After a while,

851
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
she's alive and kicking.

852
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,680
Really.

853
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
That's fast.

854
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,680
Where is she?

855
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
I don't know.

856
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
I think she's fine.

857
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,680
We didn't leave her contact information.

858
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,680
You didn't leave her?

859
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,680
No.

860
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,680
Go find her.

861
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,680
Where?

862
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
I know.

863
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,680
In the small alley behind the supermarket.

864
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,680
I know.

865
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,680
I know.

866
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,680
I know.

867
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,680
I know.

868
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,680
I know.

869
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
I know.

870
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
In the small alley behind the supermarket.

871
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
No. 7, Zimu Street.

872
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,680
I know.

873
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,680
I know.

874
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,680
I know.

875
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,680
I know.

876
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,680
I know.

877
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
I know.

878
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,680
No.

879
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,680
How did you know her address?

880
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,680
I scanned the QR code.

881
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,680
Have some water.

882
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,680
Dad.

883
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,680
Mom.

884
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
She's fine.

885
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,680
She just had a miscalculated sense of touch.

886
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,680
4 years old, no pulse.

887
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,680
7 years old, no kidney.

888
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,680
20 years of study.

889
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,680
20 years of kidney.

890
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,680
20 years of kidney.

891
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,680
Where did you learn it?

892
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,680
Master Yuan.

893
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,680
We didn't know your daughter was so young.

894
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,680
Who would have thought she could...

895
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,680
I have a question for you.

896
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,680
If this girl is not saved today,

897
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,680
you are legally a witness of murder.

898
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,680
Li Jun.

899
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,680
You should go back.

900
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,680
This should be it.

901
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,680
The equipment.

902
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,640
The

903
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,680
pull-out is unique.

904
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,680
No.

905
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,680
This is not a sunblock.

906
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,680
This is a sunblock.

907
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,680
This is not a sunblock.

908
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,680
My nephew said

909
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,680
the sun can shine in the sun.

910
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,680
The sun can't shine in the sun.

911
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,680
Look at your arm.

912
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,680
It's all black.

913
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,680
So this can't be a sunblock.

914
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
Weren't you sleeping in class?

915
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,680
I was in the class.

916
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
You were so talented.

917
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,680
I was a gold digger.

918
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,680
Don't touch it.

919
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,680
Don't touch it.

920
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,680
Okay.

921
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,680
I won't touch it.

922
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,680
So this is your fat man?

923
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,680
This is the little man

924
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,680
I learned about the gold and blood.

925
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,680
And a fat man.

926
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,680
This is ready.

927
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,680
Rebecca is never

928
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,680
ready to fight.

929
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,680
No.

930
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,680
It's not you.

931
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,680
It's the bar.

932
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,680
This is the tool I learned.

933
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,680
If you want it,

934
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,680
you can buy it online.

935
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,680
You're so petty.

936
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,680
Buy it yourself.

937
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,680
How do I search this?

938
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,680
Is it a horse or a banana?

939
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,680
The man is in the middle of the circle.

940
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,680
The man is in the middle of the circle.

941
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,680
The man is in the middle of the circle.

942
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,680
The man is in the middle of the circle.

943
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,680
You're too much today.

944
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,680
Get up.

945
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,680
Get up.

946
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,680
You think I'm talking about

947
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,680
your son's weight?

948
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,680
Look at your son.

949
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,680
He's fine.

950
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,680
You...

951
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,680
If it weren't for Toto

952
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,680
and us two here today,

953
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,680
that man would have been in the middle of the circle.

954
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,680
You think he's fine?

955
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,680
You think he's fine?

956
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,680
You think he's fine?

957
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,680
I think

958
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,680
that child

959
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,680
is gone.

960
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,680
I think this is

961
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,680
very reasonable.

962
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,680
You think your son

963
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,680
just got his medical license.

964
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,680
He's not a doctor

965
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,680
who works in the city.

966
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,680
He's not a doctor

967
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,680
who meets someone

968
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,680
who needs help in the supermarket.

969
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,680
Besides,

970
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,680
Peng Shiyan is also there.

971
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,680
Peng Shiyan studied Western medicine.

972
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,680
He's a doctor of the department of science.

973
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,680
He doesn't know

974
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,680
if friendship is reasonable.

975
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,680
Friendship.

976
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,680
It's a ancestral tradition.

977
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,680
I don't know.

978
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,680
It's not right.

979
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,680
Your son is right.

980
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,680
We shouldn't force him to study Chinese medicine.

981
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,680
This kid

982
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,680
is not a piece of cake.

983
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,680
You didn't make any mistakes.

984
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,680
You forgot about Master Chenfu.

985
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,680
We doctors

986
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,680
are just

987
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,680
living and dying

988
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,680
with our patients.

989
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,680
We are just living and dying with our patients.

990
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,680
It's cruel.

991
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,680
But it's the truth.

992
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,680
But it's the truth.

993
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,680
My son is only 26 years old.

994
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,680
How old are you?

995
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,680
The word murder

996
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,680
is really a bit poisonous.

997
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,680
Aren't you afraid of

998
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,680
ruining his confidence

999
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,680
in being a doctor?

1000
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,680
Confidence.

1001
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,680
Confidence.

1002
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,680
What confidence?

1003
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,680
What confidence?

1004
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,680
It's all about the heart.

1005
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,680
You love your son.

1006
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,680
Your grandparents love him.

1007
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,680
Your relatives and friends love him.

1008
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,680
If he makes any mistakes,

1009
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,680
you all wipe his ass.

1010
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,680
Just for his pride.

1011
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
In front of the life and death of the patient,

1012
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,680
any heart

1013
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
is worth nothing.

1014
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,680
You don't care

1015
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,680
about him at all.

1016
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,680
You only know to scold him when you have something.

1017
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,680
Why should you call him our parents?

1018
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,680
As parents,

1019
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,680
shouldn't you be responsible for your children?

1020
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,680
Sun Tuo has no parents.

1021
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,680
Who should be responsible?

1022
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,680
Responsibility

1023
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,680
is always responsible for yourself.

1024
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,680
Come here and practice.

1025
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,680
I don't want to write.

1026
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,680
Do you think I'm like you?

1027
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,680
After scolding my son,

1028
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,680
I can write with confidence?

1029
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,680
Let me tell you.

1030
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,680
I've been poor for so many years.

1031
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,680
I've been bullied by you.

1032
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,680
After being bullied,

1033
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,680
I have to digest it myself.

1034
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,680
I have to digest it slowly.

1035
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,680
It's a joke.

1036
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,680
What joke?

1037
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,680
You haven't rubbed it yet.

1038
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,680
Tianzhen,

1039
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,680
your dad is mad at you, right?

1040
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,680
It's not all your fault.

1041
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,680
We are also responsible.

1042
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,680
If we have a bad heart,

1043
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,680
we should be proud of it.

1044
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,680
I really

1045
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,680
have no sensitivity to the

1046
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,680
recovery.

1047
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,680
So,

1048
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,680
you are finally much better than our Xiyi.

1049
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,680
You have to be able to read the sky and the earth.

1050
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,680
You have to be able to handle all kinds of diseases.

1051
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,680
You are simply a god.

1052
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,680
Your parents

1053
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,680
are indeed the characters of the Great God.

1054
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,680
I was suspicious at first.

1055
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,680
I should have that girl

1056
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,680
insist on going to the hospital and seeing her.

1057
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,680
It's all my fault.

1058
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,680
Besides,

1059
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,680
that girl looks pretty honest.

1060
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,680
I have room now.

1061
00:41:45,680 --> 00:42:02,680
How Absolute turning this into an verloren!

1062
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,680
I want to eat.

1063
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,800
What?

1064
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,440
That girl is dead?

1065
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,280
No, no, no.

1066
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,200
She's just a crow's mouth.

1067
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,200
She's back.

1068
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,080
You scared me.

1069
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,440
Why did you do that?

1070
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,120
The bookshelf on the girl's side

1071
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,160
was cut off.

1072
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,120
How many people

1073
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,280
are in the bookshelf?

1074
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,360
Two.

1075
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,520
One more to go.

1076
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,600
Why are you cursing me?

1077
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,320
What's wrong with her?

1078
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,800
I think her uncle and niece

1079
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,960
are very nervous.

1080
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,880
She's having an affair.

1081
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,040
An affair?

1082
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:16,960
The Nation's Great Treasures

1083
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,960
Let the story seem very atmospheric

1084
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,960
The us in the sunset

1085
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
This youth

1086
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,960
The more it is

1087
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,960
It's getting complete

1088
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,960
Missing is happening

1089
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,960
There are always people

1090
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,960
Who are worth crossing the mountains and rivers

1091
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,960
To run towards the stars and the stars

1092
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,960
I'm sure

1093
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,960
You are that person

1094
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,960
I admit

1095
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,960
It's not pure, the heart is so heavy

1096
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,960
I've been trapped in your eyes

1097
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,960
The deep feelings

1098
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,960
The fate of the dream

1099
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,960
Wait for the sound

1100
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,960
There are always people

1101
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,960
Who are worth crossing the mountains and rivers

1102
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,960
To run towards the stars and the stars

1103
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,960
I'm sure

1104
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,960
You are that person

1105
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,960
I admit

1106
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,960
It's not pure, the heart is so heavy

1107
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,960
I've been trapped in your eyes

1108

The deep feelings

1109
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:03,960
The fate of the dream

1110
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,960
The sound of the cat
