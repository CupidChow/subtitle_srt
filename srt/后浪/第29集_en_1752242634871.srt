00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,800
I think it's Xin Zheng.

4
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,600
He didn't even look at you.

5
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,800
He came to our house

6
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,400
and went straight to his master's study.

7
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't know who it was.

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,400
He put an apple in it

9
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,800
and put a tea in it.

10
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,000
It's not like that.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,200
I...

12
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,800
I was filial to my father.

13
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,600
Then he became our son-in-law.

14
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,000
You're not filial to your father?

15
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,400
Why are you so annoying?

16
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm not talking to you anymore.

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay, okay.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,800
I won't talk to you anymore. I'm going to go.

19
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
No, no, no.

20
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
It's not over yet.

21
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,800
I don't know who it was.

22
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,600
You said that I'm not a big person.

23
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,200
I don't know who it was that I'm not a big person.

24
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,000
I just don't want to grow up.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,400
You've made me worry about you for the rest of my life.

26
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay, okay.

27
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Cheers!

28
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,400
I can tell that you're really happy today.

29
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,400
How can I not be happy when Shuang Xi leaves?

30
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,800
You're going to get married?

31
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,400
I'm going to marry.

32
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,800
What makes me happier than going to the bathroom?

33
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,400
Toto called me.

34
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,600
What did they say?

35
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,400
I've been bothering my client recently.

36
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't have time to go to the clinic.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,600
I'm just worried about this Tianzhen.

38
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,000
Meng Meng's situation is very bad for her.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,400
She can't get out of it.

40
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
Don't worry.

41
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,000
Ren Tianzhen and Sun Toto are doing very well.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,800
They're very busy.

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,600
Put on her mask.

44
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,000
Who's in love?

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,800
Tianzhen.

46
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,400
Tianzhen's in love?

47
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,000
Meng Meng just left and she's not showing her face?

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,600
She doesn't like Meng Meng.

49
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,800
She likes someone else.

50
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,400
Who?

51
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,800
I don't have kids. I don't need to study.

52
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,200
I don't need to go to the insurance company.

53
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,800
I don't have a delivery recently.

54
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,600
Me?

55
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,000
I've been in the company for a few days and you forgot about me?

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,600
You forgot about me within a few days?

57
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,000
Toto, you even know how to call me?

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,800
Where did you go? I can't find you in the hospital.

59
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,000
What are you laughing at?

60
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Do you want to hear my story about the Hollywood movie?

61
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,800
Hollywood movie?

62
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,400
Say it.

63
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,200
It's nothing. Come, let me rub your pulse.

64
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,600
I've found my original intention.

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,200
What original intention?

66
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,400
You forgot? I told you before.

67
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,800
I came to study Chinese medicine. What's my original intention?

68
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,200
Isn't your original intention to study Chinese medicine...

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,800
Do you know what's important?

70
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,200
There's a handsome guy inside. He's tall, thin, and white.

71
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,800
And he's cute.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,200
Toto, you really think of him?

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,200
Really. Why would I lie to you?

74
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,800
What's there to lie about?

75
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,200
Then how did you win him?

76
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,800
Tian Jingxin, is it possible that he won me?

77
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,200
Must I win him?

78
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,600
I just realized that you have a magical power.

79
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,000
Power? What do you mean?

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,600
I can tell from the way you grabbed me.

81
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,400
You're full of imagination.

82
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,800
I... could it be that I've been possessed by my master?

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,600
What's your original intention?

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,600
He said he has a power.

85
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
It's a saying from the Suwen.

86
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,600
It means that as long as you clean the inside and outside,

87
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,400
you can be like me.

88
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
You can be born and die.

89
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,600
Heaven.

90
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,400
Heaven!

91
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,800
The land.

92
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
The new master.

93
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,600
You won't just come to see me believe that you were hallucinating you.

94
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
what should I tell you?

95
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
This may be one of my LA friends'ολ uz месте,

96
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,600
but I don't want to tell anyone about what happened.

97
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
On top of that,

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
you didn't tell no one?

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,520
I won't say it. I won't. I won't meddle.

100
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,320
Especially your good buddy, Peng Yi.

101
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,760
No, what is it called? Peng Shi Ye.

102
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,960
I don't know how to say it.

103
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,240
He's just a big talker.

104
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,760
I won't say it.

105
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,400
Enough. I've finished my good news. What about yours?

106
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,880
I've been meeting with a client recently.

107
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,960
I made it clear this afternoon.

108
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,720
I can get the order now. I'll sign the contract tomorrow morning.

109
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,800
It's open.

110
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,520
Oh my god!

111
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,280
Congratulations! We bought the gift in time.

112
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,960
You were right. I got the bonus.

113
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,280
So I'll go and pay you a big price.

114
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,600
Do you like it?

115
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,600
Thank you.

116
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,920
It's pretty good.

117
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,000
You need a suit like this to go out and do business.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,920
You look young and not too young.

119
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,120
You can wear it tomorrow and sign the contract.

120
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,320
What do you think? Do you like it?

121
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,840
I like it.

122
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,800
Xing Xing.

123
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,360
How about we be together?

124
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
It's still cold.

125
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,440
It's cold.

126
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,120
It's cold?

127
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,040
Tao Tao, do you like it here?

128
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,000
I like it. The view is nice.

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,320
The air is nice. We can see the doctor in the day.

130
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,240
We can come here at night and walk around.

131
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,520
Don't you think the food the owner makes is delicious?

132
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Then let's find a place that's the same as this one.

133
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,360
And open a small clinic.

134
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,440
It's best to go to the mountains and the sea.

135
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,720
I can teach you to climb and dive.

136
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,360
We can plant vegetables.

137
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,120
We can plant whatever you like.

138
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,720
The most important thing is that no one will care about you.

139
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,240
When you sleep and when you wake up.

140
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,880
You can sleep until whatever time you want.

141
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,600
How free are you?

142
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,960
I think what you said is quite touching.

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,640
But I still think that

144
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,600
although the city is free, the city is smaller.

145
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,760
Then why? Don't you like it here?

146
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,200
I like it here.

147
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,960
I feel comfortable staying here once in a while.

148
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,440
If I stay here all the time, I'll be in trouble.

149
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,440
What trouble?

150
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,880
There are no teachers, teachers, doctors, and classmates here.

151
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,800
I have trouble in my heart.

152
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,960
Do you know?

153
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,080
If we just want to be happy,

154
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,160
then it's enough for us two.

155
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,120
But if we want to go far,

156
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,320
we need to be together.

157
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,880
If we don't have any school, we'll be alone and alone.

158
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,640
Right?

159
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,240
You're amazing now.

160
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,120
Your level is not that high.

161
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,280
You're so eager to climb up?

162
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,760
It's because I'm climbing from the bottom to the top.

163
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,840
So if I want to be a good successor,

164
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,800
I have to work very hard.

165
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,880
I have to work hard a thousand times to be a good successor.

166
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,080
Then I'll ask you a question.

167
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,400
Me and Zhong Yi.

168
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,800
You can only choose one out of the two. Who will you choose?

169
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,120
Zhong Yi.

170
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,960
You know that's my whole map.

171
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,480
But you're the first one to have my map.

172
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,160
Uncle Niu.

173
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,400
You can't sleep again?

174
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,480
Do you want me to give you another shot?

175
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,360
No, no.

176
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,880
Didn't you say your phone fell into the river?

177
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,840
I was digging the bottom of the river today.

178
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,000
I finally got it.

179
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,360
Look at the plastic bag. It's fine.

180
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,320
I feel that it can still be used.

181
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,080
Come on, I'll throw it in.

182
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,040
Don't fall again.

183
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,280
We'll get it. You guys get it.

184
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,120
Okay, okay, okay. You guys get it.

185
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,680
I do like you.

186
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,600
But I think...

187
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,960
only liking is not enough.

188
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,560
With our conditions,

189
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,680
we can't live in this city.

190
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,560
Then our parents...

191
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,600
they're all married.

192
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,840
They're all living well.

193
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,400
Yes.

194
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,280
Their generation can live with love for a lifetime.

195
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,480
They can build a life together.

196
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,400
But not now.

197
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,640
Now, marriage is not a matter of two people.

198
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,960
It's a matter of two families.

199
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,960
We should be realistic.

200
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,120
What about the house after you get married?

201
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,000
What about the school district house with the child?

202
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,400
With our conditions,

203
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,840
we can't afford the capital of this city.

204
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,200
Moreover, you have a brother.

205
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,960
He'll be an adult after many years.

206
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,160
Then, we can't say that...

207
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,960
if we can't afford the house, we won't get married.

208
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,840
If we can't afford the school district house, we won't have children.

209
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,920
I don't know what others think.

210
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,680
But in my opinion,

211
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,240
it's true.

212
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,160
I think if two people are together...

213
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,520
and it's more tiring than one person,

214
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,120
I'd rather not do it.

215
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,840
Because I'm already facing the difficulties of this city.

216
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,480
I don't want my child to lose...

217
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,320
from the moment he was born.

218
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,560
Can we work together?

219
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,800
For example, now,

220
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,840
I'm a medicine representative.

221
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,960
I can earn a single T-shirt if I do one.

222
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,040
The more I do, the more I earn.

223
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,320
How much can you earn from this?

224
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,920
A little more than 10,000 yuan.

225
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,440
Yes, I can't compare with others who earn more.

226
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,680
But it's good, right?

227
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,040
I'll be better than this.

228
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,560
But you know that...

229
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,520
this city needs more than 300,000 yuan for a toilet.

230
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,080
You need to work for three years without eating or drinking.

231
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,240
I'll work for three more years.

232
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,480
But your life is still unpredictable.

233
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,520
But if you're too thick-worked,

234
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,960
how much would you be able to work?

235
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,840
Ji, how come so many more companies like us...

236
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,800
are willing to take up jobs?

237
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,080
When I was little, when I was doing mathematics courses.

238
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:39,720
Prabhu shares

239
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
is too heavy for me.

240
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,200
We're not naive.

241
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
So we

242
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,280
don't allow

243
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,080
someone like Tou Tou

244
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,960
to appear.

245
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,760
Li Chen.

246
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,040
Let's be realistic.

247
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,880
I wanted to be a father.

248
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,800
What about about ז'asswsk

249
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,400
I'm shy till I die in a joining.

250
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,480
Actually,

251
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,960
We don't support Kaiss like there's no father after me,

252
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,200
but competition on chest is still not in vain,

253
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,480
Hurry up.

254
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,400
Come on, Tuotou.

255
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,880
Where's the money?

256
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,640
I'm here.

257
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,760
I'll change it for you.

258
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,080
Come on.

259
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,880
Let me do it.

260
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,480
It's okay.

261
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,680
Hurry up.

262
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,280
What are you doing?

263
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,040
Let me do it.

264
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:54,880
Mom.

265
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,720
It's so late.

266
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,600
Why don't you go to bed?

267
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,120
Come on, Tuotou.

268
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,760
I'll call your brothers.

269
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,680
Go.

270
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,560
Mom.

271
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,120
I...

272
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,640
Be careful.

273
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,080
I'm fine.

274
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,960
I'm fine.

275
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,760
Awesome.

276
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,480
I'm fine.

277
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:39,720
No.

278
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,480
I'm fit now.

279
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,720
Are you okay?

280
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,000
I'll give you a prescription

281
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,040
when you get to the hospital.

282
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
Take the medicine for two days.

283
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,320
Is it not done?

284
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:58,960
It's done.

285
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,320
I'll give you some more.

286
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:15,800
My mom

287
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,840
didn't talk just now.

288
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,720
She's scared.

289
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,520
I...

290
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,440
What are you doing?

291
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,280
You scared me.

292
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,480
Did you get hurt?

293
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,400
Mom.

294
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,280
If you go to the hospital again,

295
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,440
I'll hang up the phone here.

296
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,680
You know this hospital.

297
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
You scared me.

298
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,120
It's a hospital.

299
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,560
But now there's only the two of us.

300
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,120
I can't go.

301
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,240
Of course you can't.

302
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,200
What if someone comes in?

303
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,840
No one is here.

304
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,880
I haven't started working yet.

305
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,000
No.

306
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,880
I really can't.

307
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,880
Can you?

308
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,600
Tian Tian.

309
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,880
Can you?

310
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,600
Yes.

311
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,760
Are you two...

312
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,800
No.

313
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,800
Are you annoying?

314
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,000
Since I met you,

315
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,280
you've been talking nonsense

316
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,400
since you met me.

317
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,360
You're always talking nonsense

318
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
when you're not here.

319
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,360
Right?

320
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:22,800
Yes.

321
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,600
You're annoying.

322
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,640
Mr. Mei.

323
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,560
No.

324
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,640
Since you came back,

325
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,480
the atmosphere between you two

326
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,520
is really different

327
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
from before.

328
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,600
What's different?

329
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,440
It's just that

330
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,880
you're both

331
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,880
very different.

332
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,360
You're different.

333
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,680
How is it?

334
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,640
Great.

335
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,440
Isn't it great?

336
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,480
Great.

337
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,680
Brother Ou, let me tell you.

338
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,080
Don't be so naive

339
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,960
with my good brother.

340
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,360
He's not a natural.

341
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,880
He belongs to a good family.

342
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,160
He's too proud.

343
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,000
He's too proud.

344
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,720
You hope that

345
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,400
he and you

346
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,280
can be together.

347
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,160
It's impossible.

348
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,960
Impossible.

349
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,360
So you should forgive him.

350
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:20,960
Right?

351
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,400
Yes.

352
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,160
Yes.

353
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,760
Right?

354
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,120
Ou Chengyu.

355
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,520
You're really smart.

356
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,360
Of course.

357
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
What's in your mind?

358
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,880
You're so smart.

359
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,040
Wisdom.

360
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,280
How smart you are!

361
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,560
You're so smart.

362
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,920
You're so smart

363
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,040
that you can't find a girlfriend.

364
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,120
What a pity.

365
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,760
What a pity.

366
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,960
What a pity.

367
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,240
You're so smart.

368
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,320
You're so smart.

369
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:45,720
I...

370
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,840
I really don't understand

371
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,160
what's wrong with me.

372
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,960
Tell me.

373
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,360
I have ideals,

374
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,800
morals,

375
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,760
organization,

376
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,720
discipline,

377
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,560
culture,

378
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,480
and a new generation of

379
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,640
excellent young people.

380
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,760
Why don't I find a girlfriend?

381
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,960
Right, Brother Ou?

382
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,680
Why don't I find a girlfriend?

383
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,120
Sorry, brother.

384
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
I asked the wrong person.

385
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
Let me tell you.

386
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
I'm sorry.

387
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
I'm sorry.

388
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
I'm sorry.

389
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,960
One last time.

390
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,440
Wait.

391
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
Wait.

392
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,480
Why...

393
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,080
Why did you ask the wrong person?

394
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,600
I...

395
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,680
I'm a girl.

396
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,080
You can ask me.

397
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,120
You're a girl?

398
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,600
Yes.

399
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,080
Then you're my brother.

400
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,680
Then I walked over.

401
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,760
I saw that girl.

402
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
I told her.

403
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,520
I told her every time.

404
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:35,920
I told her every time.

405
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,520
I told her every time.

406
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,960
She was so anxious.

407
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,880
Please forgive me.

408
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
Please forgive me.

409
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,000
Mr. Wang.

410
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,640
Let me tell you.

411
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,520
Two words.

412
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,320
Stupid.

413
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,400
What?

414
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,680
I don't know about other girls.

415
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,560
But some girls

416
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,040
are not looking for a boyfriend.

417
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,800
She's looking for a father.

418
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,200
You're right.

419
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,480
That's what Yang Xiao Hong said.

420
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:55,920
Right.

421
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,640
So think about it.

422
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,120
She said it so clearly.

423
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,720
What if you don't think about it?

424
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,760
The emperor has ordered the dukes.

425
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,120
Your child will do it.

426
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,440
What if your child's mother can't do it?

427
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,160
Child's mother?

428
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,440
I like it.

429
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,160
You're so dark.

430
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,480
Don't take it to heart.

431
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,120
Okay.

432
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,280
Drink more hot water.

433
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,040
It's not good for your stomach.

434
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,920
What does she like again?

435
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,520
She likes...

436
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,440
Fan Xiao Hong.

437
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,840
I'm begging her.

438
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,560
Do you want to marry Yang Xiao Hong?

439
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,720
Is it possible?

440
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,120
She's right.

441
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:33,220
["Lim Si tend is east of the

442
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,240
rebel sky."

443
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,780
mana Shi Man sitting on the

444
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,480
horse at the sides of the mountain."

445
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,440
Ana laid her hands on the candle.

446
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,040
Just take it.

447
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
Where is he?

448
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,160
People come and go.

449
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,560
But there is no trace of him.

450
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,320
Are you missing him?

451
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,240
Everyone seems to be

452
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,280
not sad at all.

453
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,000
Qian Xi.

454
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,440
I'm not sad.

455
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,560
We are all sad.

456
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,000
And we are like you.

457
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,840
We miss Mengmeng.

458
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,800
But you should know

459
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,320
that in the world of adults,

460
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,840
you can't show your sadness

461
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,000
on your face every day.

462
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,520
And my master said

463
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,920
that the living are more important.

464
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,320
Sister.

465
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,680
Sister Xia.

466
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,400
Is the test done today

467
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,480
going to be the time for the medicine?

468
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,200
Yes.

469
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,440
We are going to start taking the medicine tomorrow.

470
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,680
I'm looking forward to it.

471
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,840
I think it will work.

472
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,480
Yes.

473
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,480
It will definitely work.

474
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,680
I and Toto

475
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,840
grind the medicine

476
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,960
and soak it.

477
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,400
Yes.

478
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,440
We made it

479
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,400
to celebrate all our blessings.

480
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,480
So it will work.

481
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,840
Xiaopeng.

482
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,000
I've thought it over.

483
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,680
Even if it doesn't work,

484
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,440
it won't affect our life.

485
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
Right, Qian Xi?

486
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,280
You don't know

487
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,920
that after I came to the clinic,

488
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,280
I've made up my mind.

489
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,480
I think

490
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,040
we are all safe now.

491
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,280
That's good.

492
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,160
Yes.

493
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,280
Come on, eat it.

494
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,080
Drink it.

495
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,240
Dr. Song.

496
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,360
Why are you standing here?

497
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,760
Dr. Song.

498
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,320
Dr. Song.

499
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,560
Long time no see.

500
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,400
Toto.

501
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,440
You...

502
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,680
You just got out of the hospital?

503
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,040
Yes.

504
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,360
I just got out of the hospital last week.

505
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,760
I came here to thank you

506
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,440
for the red eggs for my baby.

507
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,640
Thank you.

508
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,800
I have a small request.

509
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,520
You must come

510
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,200
to my baby's wedding.

511
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,080
Without you, there is no him.

512
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,920
Congratulations.

513
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,080
I will definitely go.

514
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,760
That's great.

515
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,280
Xiaohong.

516
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,680
Share these with everyone.

517
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,000
Okay.

518
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,040
Let's all be happy.

519
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,760
Congratulations.

520
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,080
Come on.

521
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,720
Let me see.

522
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,280
Okay.

523
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,480
Red eggs.

524
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,680
So many.

525
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,040
I saw a video

526
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,880
of you

527
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,560
in the WeChat circle a few days ago.

528
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,360
You are so cute.

529
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,680
You are so cute.

530
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,560
Right?

531
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,400
Here, Bingbing.

532
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,360
You take one.

533
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,880
Not bad.

534
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,320
You are recovering well.

535
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,040
This way.

536
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,920
You are recovering well.

537
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,840
And

538
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,280
you don't have

539
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,480
the symptoms of cold.

540
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,280
Really?

541
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,160
You have cold?

542
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,040
Isn't it hard

543
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,080
to get pregnant with cold?

544
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:15,920
Yes.

545
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,080
I used to have a cold

546
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,160
and cold belly.

547
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,280
It was like ice.

548
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,680
When I was a test tube,

549
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,200
I couldn't get pregnant.

550
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,880
I met Dr. Song.

551
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,840
Dr. Song

552
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,440
changed my lifestyle

553
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,000
and taught me to wear cotton pants.

554
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,240
I changed my lifestyle

555
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,240
and I got a cold.

556
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,240
I was so tired.

557
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,320
I changed my lifestyle

558
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,360
and I got pregnant.

559
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,560
Really?

560
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,760
So, Chinese medicine

561
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,840
is not about curing disease.

562
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,920
It's about health.

563
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
It's about keeping one's health.

564
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,040
Right?

565
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,520
Dr. Song,

566
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,120
I have a best friend.

567
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,160
This year,

568
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,120
she wants to have a baby.

569
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,760
I'm a front-wheel-drive.

570
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,800
She wants to

571
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,520
get pregnant seriously.

572
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,040
When do you have time?

573
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,760
I'll ask her to come to the clinic.

574
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,360
Okay.

575
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,040
Okay?

576
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,400
Thank you so much.

577
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,320
Mrs. Wang,

578
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,480
what do you need

579
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,640
to get pregnant?

580
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,240
First, you should ask

581
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,400
why you need to get pregnant.

582
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,520
Then you can ask what you want to do.

583
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,720
Doctor,

584
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,240
why do I need to get pregnant?

585
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,120
It's not a natural thing.

586
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,800
Look,

587
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,720
we often say

588
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,360
students, students, students.

589
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,640
There are two meanings.

590
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,240
The first meaning is

591
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,480
to live a sunny life.

592
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,760
The second meaning is

593
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,760
to live a life without regret

594
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,040
and live a long life.

595
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,160
Actually, everyone says

596
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,520
it's easy to get pregnant.

597
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,840
But it's not.

598
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,600
Yes.

599
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,200
Come on.

600
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,280
You can't say

601
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,000
you're pregnant.

602
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,440
You're pregnant now.

603
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,320
You need to get ready.

604
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,880
You must

605
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,760
get ready early.

606
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,920
Just like

607
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,400
when we had the test in primary school,

608
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
you couldn't

609
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,280
have a sudden fever.

610
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,000
Right?

611
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,080
Yes.

612
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,160
I remember I used to

613
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,240
eat ice cream

614
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,600
and drink cold drinks.

615
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,960
I used to show my legs

616
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,840
and back in my clothes.

617
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,320
And I showed my big feet

618
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,240
and my three-parted feet.

619
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,600
They were all exposed.

620
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,840
So when I came to the clinic

621
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,080
to see Dr. Song for the first time,

622
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,600
he asked me to return the photo

623
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,280
and give him

624
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,400
all the food I've been craving for over the past ten years.

625
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,320
Mrs.

626
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,360
Don't blame me for being arrogant.

627
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,320
We need to have a basis.

628
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,040
This is a public cold.

629
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,560
You can't touch it even if you can't see it.

630
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,520
You put your hand on your arm

631
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,960
and you said it's a public cold.

632
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,960
How can you prove it?

633
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,240
Besides,

634
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,360
I think that those pregnant women

635
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,400
drink a cup of ice water

636
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,160
after giving birth.

637
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,160
It's not a big deal.

638
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,040
Our monitor

639
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,520
likes to lift weights.

640
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,320
Have you ever had a menstrual cramp?

641
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,880
Why did you say it's not a public cold?

642
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,040
Women's menstrual cramps

643
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,440
are normal physiological reactions.

644
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,280
Look, many people

645
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,160
have menstrual cramps

646
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,840
here and there.

647
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,280
It's not normal.

648
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,320
Okay, that's it.

649
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,200
Next month,

650
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,360
we're going to invite some

651
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,720
gynecologists and children's gynecologists

652
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,520
to do a test

653
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,360
of the back operation.

654
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,120
You can invite your friend to come and see.

655
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,360
If he thinks it's useful,

656
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,040
he can register.

657
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,880
Thank you so much.

658
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,400
I'll register.

659
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,280
Wait.

660
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,240
You haven't met him yet.

661
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,800
Why do you want to register?

662
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,280
Didn't you hear what the master said?

663
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,920
You must prepare early.

664
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,640
If you succeed,

665
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,560
the water will come naturally.

666
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,240
Right, master?

667
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,600
Yes.

668
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,080
Right.

669
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,000
Master,

670
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,600
do men need to have a back operation?

671
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,000
Of course.

672
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,920
I also need to register.

673
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,680
I need to be prepared at any time.

674
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,360
Do I need to quit smoking and drinking?

675
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,280
It's the most basic requirement

676
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,800
to quit smoking and drinking.

677
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,720
You need to contribute to your family

678
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,520
and to society.

679
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,200
It's not something that can be solved by a mirror.

680
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,240
People love people.

681
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,800
If you want to be a person,

682
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,880
the first lesson is to learn to love people.

683
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,480
I want to impress you.

684
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,200
Are you happy with the success?

685
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:09,080
No.

686
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,760
Hi, dad.

687
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,160
Mr. Jian, his legs are cold.

688
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,480
He's got a reaction.

689
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,640
He's got a reaction.

690
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,040
Jian, do you feel anything?

691
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,440
His legs are cold?

692
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,720
I think I feel

693
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,400
the wind blowing on my face.

694
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,440
It's amazing.

695
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,280
The effect is already there without any alcohol.

696
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,160
Come on.

697
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,520
Dad, bye.

698
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,960
You're much better than before.

699
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,680
It's a good sign.

700
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,440
Professor Ren, thank you.

701
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,360
You didn't lie to me this time.

702
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,120
I have to be confident

703
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,280
in the confidence you told me.

704
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,000
You're right.

705
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,480
You must be confident.

706
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,480
I'm confident.

707
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,160
I'm confident.

708
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,200
I'm confident.

709
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm confident.

710
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,800
I'm confident.

711
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,000
Good.

712
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,400
Good!

713
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,520
Good!

714
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,640
Shifu.

715
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,360
Zhu.

716
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,040
The clinic must be vibesom solved.

717
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,120
We told you

718
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,040
when we last got hospitalized.

719
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,680
We're afraid you'll say bad things to him.

720
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,560
Hey, Zhu.

721
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,680
Hello, Professor Ren.

722
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,840
Hello.

723
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,960
I'm Zhu Changming's wife.

724
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,880
My husband

725
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,880
is dying.

726
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,880
Please take a look at him.

727
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,880
How could he do this to himself?

728
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,880
Are you okay?

729
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,880
I'm fine.

730
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
Professor Ren.

731
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,880
How could you do this to yourself?

732
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,880
I regret it too.

733
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,880
Really.

734
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
Professor Ren.

735
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
I regret it too.

736
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,880
Please save me.

737
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,880
If I recover,

738
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,880
I'll be a good man.

739
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Don't be afraid.

740
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,880
If you let go,

741
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
you don't need to regret.

742
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
But I'm really afraid.

743
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,880
Please save me.

744
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,880
I'm dying.

745
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,880
I'm sorry.

746
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
This is a candle.

747
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
It's from a master of mine.

748
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,880
I'll give it to you.

749
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,880
Take it with you.

750
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,880
It will light up.

751
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,880
When you're ready to go,

752
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,880
don't be afraid.

753
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,880
I'm sorry.

754
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,880
Professor Ren.

755
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,880
If I leave,

756
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,880
can you take care of our family?

757
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,880
Don't worry.

758
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,880
It's my responsibility.

759
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,880
Dad.

760
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,880
Thank you.

761
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,880
I'll take care of you.

762
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,880
Why don't you talk?

763
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
I'm sorry.

764
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,880
I didn't expect

765
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
I'd see you die

766
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,880
and not say goodbye to them.

767
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,880
People not only have to

768
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,880
say goodbye to others,

769
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,880
but also

770
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,880
to themselves.

771
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,880
Master.

772
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,880
I'm still young.

773
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,880
Tuotuo.

774
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,880
Life has five blessings.

775
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,880
Long life.

776
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,880
Rich.

777
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,880
Be prosperous.

778
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,880
Be good at cultivation.

779
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,880
Be famous in the exam.

780
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,880
Is being famous in the exam a good thing?

781
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,880
Yes.

782
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
Being good at it

783
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,880
means that

784
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
the last big success

785
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,880
in life

786
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,880
is a big success.

787
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,880
The last big success

788
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,880
in life is a big success.

789
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,880
Tuotuo, remember.

790
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,880
You have to prepare

791
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,880
for the last big success

792
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
in your life.

793
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,880
You're young now.

794
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,880
In the middle of your life,

795
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,880
in the old age,

796
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,880
you can't be bad.

797
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,880
When you die,

798
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,880
you'll be at ease

799
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,880
and not afraid.

800
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,880
I know.

801
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,880
Know what?

802
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
I know why

803
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,880
you brought me to see Zhu.

804
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,880
Zhu and Mengmeng

805
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,880
don't know

806
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,880
why they came

807
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,880
or why they left

808
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,880
or why they left

809
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,880
or why they left

810
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,880
and where they're going

811
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,880
no matter who they are.

812
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,880
So you want me

813
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,880
to start thinking now.

814
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
I want you to drive for me.

815
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,880
Hello,ção.

816
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,520

818
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,880
Hello.

819
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,880
Hello.

820
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,880
Can we start the search?

821
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,880
Yes, join our team.

822
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,880
Wait.

823
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,880
Can we have another round?

824
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,880
It's told that

825
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,880
allome's shop

826
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,880
has five items below the road.

827
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,600
t is

828
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,880
Postbox.

829
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,880
Postbox.

830
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,880
Postbox.

831
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,880
Postbox.

832
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,960
Let's go. I'll take you there.

833
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,840
Thank you.

834
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,720
You're early, Mr. Zeng.

835
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,640
Professor Ren,

836
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,960
two of your old patients

837
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,000
are here to see you.

838
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,480
It's not him.

839
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,480
We know Dr. Ren.

840
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,320
Yes. The doctor we're looking for

841
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,080
is younger and more handsome than him.

842
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,520
Yes. Dr. Ren is amazing.

843
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,160
If Dr. Ren isn't here, we'll leave.

844
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,520
Let's go.

845
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,760
Dr. Ren.

846
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,720
Why are you here?

847
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,840
We're here to thank you.

848
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,480
Look.

849
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,080
I brought some potatoes.

850
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,120
You're welcome.

851
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,400
I think

852
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,520
I'd like to show you

853
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,600
how to make it.

854
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,920
Look. It's just a little bit.

855
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,680
It's done.

856
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,960
No problem. I'll show you.

857
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,960
No. No. No.

858
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,400
We know you.

859
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,800
We came for you.

860
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,560
You don't know my dad is amazing.

861
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,920
I used to find some

862
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,320
older doctors.

863
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,280
But I don't think

864
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,960
they're as good as us.

865
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,480
You're here.

866
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,480
You don't want to see them?

867
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,320
No. I don't regret it.

868
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,920
I don't charge you.

869
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,000
No. No.

870
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,600
We know Dr. Ren.

871
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,400
Yes. We know Dr. Ren.

872
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,280
Dr. Ren.

873
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,440
What are you laughing at?

874
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,680
Dr. Ren.

875
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,440
Come on.

876
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,600
Try this cake.

877
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,800
It's very delicious.

878
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:15,880
It's cold.

879
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,720
What?

880
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,800
You're cold, aren't you?

881
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,920
This is

882
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,000
the old man who's looking for

883
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,120
the natural disease.

884
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,360
It's his own home.

885
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,880
It's warm

886
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,200
and warm.

887
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:30,960
I'll try it.

888
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,120
This one. This one.

889
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,880
This one.

890
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,280
You're hit, aren't you?

891
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,960
Dr. Ren

892
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,160
is better than Professor Ren.

893
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,720
It means I've educated him successfully.

894
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,880
I'm better than him.

895
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,400
You're so good at

896
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,720
talking to your son.

897
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,640
I think

898
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,360
our previous arrangements

899
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,320
are not good enough

900
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,600
for the teacher and the doctor.

901
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,840
He has to

902
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,400
take his own path.

903
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,240
It's called

904
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:14,960
medical care.

905
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,880
What's medical care?

906
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,200
It's the care of the father.

907
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:20,600
A patient

908
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,000
has to stay in the hospital for three years and five years.

909
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,160
The patient will take the initiative to find a doctor.

910
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,120
I agree with that.

911
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,600
Really.

912
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,160
We should let them

913
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,040
go to the country as doctors.

914
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,240
Right?

915
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,840
They should face all kinds of difficulties

916
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,280
and find a solution.

917
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,720
You'll be able to

918
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,440
get a job soon.

919
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,920
The only thing I remember

920
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,760
is warmth and balance.

921
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,760
If there's no pain in my life,

922
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,720
I'll light up a city for you.

923
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,320
The people in the light

924
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,680
are just ordinary people.

925
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,400
I use my ordinary body

926
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,480
to light up the ordinary people.

927
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,560
The soul hidden in the light

928
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,120
is burning with passion.

929
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,880
We use a sentence

930
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,320
to cure the people in this world.

931
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,520
The people in the light

932
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,280
are just ordinary people.

933
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,080
I use my ordinary body

934
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,680
to light up the ordinary people.

935
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,960
The soul hidden in the light

936
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,720
is burning with passion.

937
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:38,120
We use a sentence

938
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:42,360
to cure the people in this world.
