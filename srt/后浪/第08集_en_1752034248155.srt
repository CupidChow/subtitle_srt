1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Imagine this in your head.

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Imagine the seven stars of Beidou

5
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
as a bell.

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The seven stars of Beidou

7
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
point to the dust,

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
which is the ancient jade.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Dust?

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yes.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
When is that?

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
From seven o'clock in the morning to nine o'clock in the morning.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
When you have breakfast.

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But why is it called ancient jade?

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's not raining.

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It will rain tonight.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Ancient jade has rain.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
According to the wind,

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
this year will be a good birthday.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You are so smart.

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Our ancestors told me

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
that the seven stars of Beidou

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
are the most beautiful.

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
In the city,

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
we only know to wander around.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We all forget to look at the stars.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Liu Cixin has a novel called Zhao Wendao.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's about the earthmen after hundreds of years.

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
They made the earth

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
into a super accelerator.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
When they were going to travel together,

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
the emissary of the universe stopped them.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
People asked,

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
when did you start to find

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
our plan?

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The emissary of the universe said,

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
thirty-seven thousand years ago,

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
when ten emissaries

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
looked up at the stars.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
When we learn to appreciate

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
the beauty of being irrelevant to life,

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
when we are curious about everything,

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
we are the spirits of the earth.

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I can sleep on it, right?

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Can I sleep on it?

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Mom.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You can't put that bag on the bed.

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's too dirty.

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Take it down. Take it down.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
This one?

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Here.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Be careful.

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Come on.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Mom, let me do it.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Let me do it.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Mom, can I sleep on it?

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I can.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I can.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I can.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I can.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I can.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I can.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I can.

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I can.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Wait.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You must wash your face

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
before sleeping.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You can't go to bed like this.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I know.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Come on.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
There's only one house in the house.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You two live together.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You two take care of each other.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I will take care of Mengmeng.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Mengmeng, don't worry.

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I won't sleep.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I will definitely protect you

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
with my own eyes.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Mom, Sun Tong is not reliable.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Let me take care of Mengmeng.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
How can you say that?

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What do you mean by unreliable?

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Do you know that

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
walking in the world

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
is a way of living?

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
When you were with me,

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
you didn't have a way of living

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
when we first met.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Tianzhen, go back to your room.

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Go back to my room.

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I announce that

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
from today on,

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
we will have a male-female interview.

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't make any mistakes

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
after ten o'clock.

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Do you hear me?

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What about you and your nephew?

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Nephew?

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Your husband.

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Does it have anything to do with you?

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You two don't sleep together?

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We have another rule.

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
After ten o'clock,

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
everyone's cell phones

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
must be put in the living room to charge.

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
They can't be taken into the bedroom.

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
In this way,

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
we can avoid the radiation

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and have a good rest.

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Pay me the rent.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm telling you.

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I can't sleep without my cell phone.

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
In fact, many people

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
can't sleep because

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
they play with their cell phones.

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I have to listen to the story when I sleep.

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Usually, the story is told by my mother.

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't have a mother.

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So...

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So I have to put my cell phone

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
in the bedroom to sleep.

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You've grown up.

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You should have told your mother

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
to see you sleep alone.

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Are you stupid?

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We are in the same camp

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
in this question.

128
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I have my own mother.

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You...

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What are you doing?

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm playing with you.

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Look.

133
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You just torture yourself.

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You must torture yourself every day

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
to sleep in the golden skin.

136
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This is the vicious cycle.

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm talking to you.

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If you want to sleep well,

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
you can't put your cell phone in the bedroom.

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I can't control myself.

141
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You can learn to control yourself.

142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
From now on,

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
don't kick your legs.

144
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Come on. Sit down.

145
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Sit down.

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Start from the guide.

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Sit down.

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Come on.

149
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Put your hands in the middle of the bed.

150
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes.

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Just put your hands on the line.

152
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Down.

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Good.

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Cover your belly with your right palm.

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Left palm.

156
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Press the right hand.

157
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Turn the time.

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Start to rub.

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Turn the time.

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Turn.

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Turn the time.

162
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yes.

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Turn 25 times.

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Relax your shoulders.

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Don't put your back on the bed.

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Rub like this.

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Rub 25 times every night before you go to bed.

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Did Mengmeng learn it?

169
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Mom, she knows it.

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's good.

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yan Zhen, let's go.

172
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'll leave it to you.

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

174
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

175
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

176
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

178
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

180
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

181
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

182
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

183
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

184
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

185
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

186
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

189
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

190
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

191
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

192
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

193
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

194
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

195
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

196
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

197
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Here.

198
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,000
Is the films ready?

199
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,620
We'll miss out on

200
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,460
every task you justice me to complete.

201
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,660
Here.

202
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,660
Touch your hands.

203
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay, okay.

204
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,380
Everybody get yourself used to it.

205
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,880
I have more information of them.

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,920
Try to see if you outsmart the temple.

207
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,380
Maybe I'll not.

208
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,960
How did you execute the murder operation?

209
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,520
Haven't you seen there are hundreds of people

210
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,200
I'm fine.

211
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,360
You look like you're having a meal.

212
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,480
I knew something was wrong.

213
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,960
Yeah.

214
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,280
I took a big piece of meat

215
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,280
and it's all twisted.

216
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,160
You took such a big piece of meat

217
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,360
and you took it off with one hand?

218
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,480
You think you're a martial artist?

219
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
I can't just watch

220
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,840
and hit Li Quan.

221
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,320
I think you're worried about Sun Tou Tou.

222
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,840
If he hadn't been in good shape all day,

223
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,480
he wouldn't have caused such a scene.

224
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,920
Why do you always

225
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,680
take Sun Tou's side?

226
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,080
Don't deny that you're biased towards him.

227
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,680
You used to be so patient

228
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,240
with your students

229
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,880
and your own son.

230
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,360
You even want to hold him in your arms.

231
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,240
You're talking nonsense.

232
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,680
Why did you give him this?

233
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,000
As a housewife,

234
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,280
you must support yourself

235
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,200
and make a role model for the children.

236
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,480
Did you take the phone case

237
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,160
and charge it without doing anything else?

238
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,920
Am I not an authority

239
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,640
if I'm a housewife?

240
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,320
Besides,

241
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,040
It's not all about you.

242
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,560
Yes.

243
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,920
Yes.

244
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,720
Then please,

245
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
Mr. Song,

246
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,920
can you

247
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,720
help me

248
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,440
read the medical history of the golden egg?

249
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,040
Have you broken your hand?

250
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,280
You are so confident

251
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,480
about your family's ancestral memory.

252
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,760
It's not good.

253
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,920
You're in the business world.

254
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,040
You've been in the business world for a hundred days.

255
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,520
Who seeds the flower?

256
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:54,320
You're one of the

257
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,040
She has just been available.

258
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,040
The door is locked.

259
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,740
Tell Xiao Zhuo to hurry up and use the fuelle enabled.

260
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,540
Yes, my lady!

261
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,040
Hi there.

262
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,740
Where did you run off to at this time?

263
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,440
My lady,

264
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,140
did you have any problem with Your Majesty?

265
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,420
I need to go to the government

266
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,060
I have ordered it,

267
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,260
you may do it.

268
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,620
Great.

269
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,180
Meng Meng.

270
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,660
Meng Meng.

271
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,020
Meng Meng.

272
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,060
Nothing.

273
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,180
It's okay.

274
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,860
It's okay. It's me.

275
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,500
Mengmeng.

276
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,460
Mengmeng, look.

277
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,620
I've turned off the bell.

278
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,220
Mengmeng.

279
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,900
Oh no.

280
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,780
Where's Mengmeng?

281
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,820
What's wrong?

282
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,820
What's wrong?

283
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,660
What's wrong?

284
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,540
What's wrong?

285
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,380
What's wrong?

286
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,060
What's wrong?

287
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,820
What's wrong?

288
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,340
What's wrong?

289
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:16,860
Mom.

290
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,860
Dad, you go in.

291
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,100
I'll deal with it.

292
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,460
What's wrong with you?

293
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,660
Oh my.

294
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,340
Mom.

295
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,060
Dad.

296
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,980
Go back to your room.

297
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,020
It's okay.

298
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,340
Mom.

299
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,340
Call the head up.

300
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,340
Let him sleep in the living room.

301
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,220
I'll watch Mengmeng.

302
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,820
Okay.

303
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,460
You go back, too.

304
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,100
Mengmeng.

305
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,620
Mengmeng.

306
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,420
It's okay.

307
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,100
The phone is off.

308
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,580
Mengmeng.

309
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,460
It's okay.

310
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,100
There's no one else.

311
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,020
I'm the only one.

312
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,220
Come out.

313
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,180
Don't be afraid.

314
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:26,980
It's okay.

315
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,180
So early.

316
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:43,980
rest503

317
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,340
first

318
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:44,660
向

319
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,100
N shield

320
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,140
ask

321
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,900
beats

322
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,740
Your mom couldn't wake you up.

323
00:15:46,740 --> 00:16:07,780
ask

324
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,380
That day

325
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,260
you went to

326
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,060
prepare to start over.

327
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,140
You moved the ends of your head

328
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,260
I'm not afraid of bothering others.

329
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,300
Calm down.

330
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,220
Calm down.

331
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,340
Two little doctors came to our house.

332
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,300
One of them is not bad.

333
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,140
He's pretty good.

334
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,180
My parents, you,

335
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,140
have been recruiting patients in the house for a lifetime.

336
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,140
But I've never met

337
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,300
two of them.

338
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,260
Mengmeng is your son's

339
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,340
gift.

340
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,140
It's not me.

341
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,140
I'm not.

342
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,220
You say,

343
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,220
why is Tianzhen so good to Mengmeng?

344
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,340
Is it a little better than the doctor to the patient?

345
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,700
My master said Mengmeng

346
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,140
is rich and rich.

347
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,420
Do you like it?

348
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,500
That's not good.

349
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,580
This must

350
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,300
be killed in the cradle.

351
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,300
Mengmeng's mental state now

352
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,500
is so unstable.

353
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,980
Can't let them get along.

354
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,300
You're a Chinese doctor.

355
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,300
You don't choose people to treat or save people.

356
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,300
You choose your daughter-in-law to choose people.

357
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,260
Your choice in this life

358
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,620
is all in my hand.

359
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,180
Don't you have too long hands?

360
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,500
How can I have long hands?

361
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,740
Am I choosing my daughter-in-law?

362
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,900
I'm choosing my grandson's mother.

363
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,980
You,

364
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,060
say something.

365
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,100
Let Mengmeng go tomorrow.

366
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,140
We really don't have to consider it.

367
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,620
A single man and a widow live together.

368
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,140
How decent is that?

369
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,740
What single man and widow?

370
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,860
Toto is there too.

371
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,580
That doesn't count.

372
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,540
Tianzhen never looked at her.

373
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,020
That's a time when she hasn't spoken.

374
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:55,940
You,

375
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,540
take care of yourself.

376
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,700
Otherwise, Toto's insomnia will spread to you.

377
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,980
My son's business is my business.

378
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,540
I have to take care of it.

379
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,780
Did you hear that?

380
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,740
Mengmeng is leaving tomorrow morning.

381
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,340
Mr. Lin.

382
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,500
I'm insomnia.

383
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,020
I'm quite tired.

384
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,100
Let me wax you up.

385
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,580
Waking up early

386
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,340
is not gonna make me as tired as this.

387
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,820
Check out your zijnous

388
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,380
before going to sleep.

389
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,500
Why are you trying to make a sle neither?

390
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,980
I'm sorry.

391
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,780
Do you know that last night,

392
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,220
you scared Mengmeng with your phone ringtone?

393
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,420
No.

394
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,060
The ringtone on my phone

395
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,580
is the one that's been popular lately.

396
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,500
It's the one that stands on the tupo.

397
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,260
It's screaming.

398
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,260
It's screaming like this.

399
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,180
Why is it so scary?

400
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,220
Do you know how the enemy will eat the tupo

401
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:33,620
that can scream?

402
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,460
I don't want to know.

403
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,540
Spend some time.

404
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,300
I know.

405
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,380
When Mengmeng wakes up later,

406
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,420
can you ring the bell?

407
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,420
For example,

408
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,140
What do you mean by that?

409
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,260
Where's Mengmeng?

410
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,660
She's sleeping.

411
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:54,580
Dad,

412
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,180
Mengmeng was too noisy last night.

413
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,140
Let her sleep for a while.

414
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,100
Wake her up.

415
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,540
You need to get up and move your body

416
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,020
to be able to move normally.

417
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:01,940
Wake her up.

418
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:04,780
Wait.

419
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,140
You were scared last night.

420
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,740
Why didn't I...

421
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:07,980
Master.

422
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,220
Let's eat.

423
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,060
The fried buns.

424
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,380
You want to eat the fried buns?

425
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:19,900
What's wrong?

426
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,700
Sit down and wait for the food.

427
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,620
Why do we have to wait?

428
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,860
Wait for the guests to come.

429
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,020
Wait for the elders.

430
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:28,900
Senior.

431
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:30,940
Senior.

432
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,260
Senior.

433
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,180
Senior, hurry up.

434
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,780
What are you doing?

435
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,260
It's ready.

436
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,460
Can we eat now?

437
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,580
Let me.

438
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,060
What does it mean?

439
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,620
You...

440
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,060
What kind of organization is this?

441
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,540
The pulse in the morning.

442
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,140
The body condition of the person who has an accurate reaction.

443
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,140
This is our daily must-have.

444
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,580
Stretch your arms out.

445
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,180
No.

446
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,980
Can you eat first?

447
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,340
After eating, we can play well.

448
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,020
I'm starving.

449
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,300
Then it's not accurate.

450
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,460
I'll teach you.

451
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,420
Squat.

452
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,340
Squat.

453
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,140
Eat.

454
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,940
Do it.

455
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,420
Squat.

456
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,620
Squat.

457
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:24,820
Eat.

458
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,700
What's wrong?

459
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,420
Jump.

460
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,820
You're so accurate.

461
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,580
I remember.

462
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,500
When Tian Zhen was a kid,

463
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,620
he used to jump out of the sky

464
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,860
when he touched the pulse.

465
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,420
You're right.

466
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,260
If the pulse doesn't jump,

467
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,860
he's gone.

468
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,300
What else can you feel except jumping?

469
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:51,980
Nothing.

470
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,660
What else can I feel?

471
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,140
I feel hungry.

472
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,180
I want to eat char siu buns.

473
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,020
You've just learned it.

474
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,940
After a long time,

475
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,460
you'll feel the difference in pulse.

476
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,900
When?

477
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,500
When can I feel the difference?

478
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,140
How can I know it's different?

479
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,700
Everyone has different pulse.

480
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,420
Some people have a calm pulse.

481
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,860
Some people have a runny nose.

482
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,140
Some people have a weak pulse.

483
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,140
Some people have a weak pulse.

484
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,100
Remember.

485
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,660
When you touch the pulse for a long time,

486
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,820
you'll feel better.

487
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,860
Squat.

488
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,300
Not at all.

489
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,260
After a long time,

490
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,580
you'll feel better

491
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,420
when you touch the pulse.

492
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,580
Then you'll know

493
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,060
his personality and recent experience.

494
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:43,820
Zhixin,

495
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,820
I can tell

496
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,020
your recent experience.

497
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,140
You've made char siu buns recently.

498
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,580
Zhe, look at me.

499
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,100
Look at my personality

500
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,380
and recent experience.

501
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,260
I dare not say anything else.

502
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,660
Last night,

503
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,500
you must have slept the best.

504
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,740
Really?

505
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,220
I slept so well last night.

506
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:04,820
Today,

507
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,220
I'm so excited.

508
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,580
Zhe,

509
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,900
I scared you last night.

510
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,860
Are you okay?

511
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,500
Are you angry?

512
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:15,980
Come on.

513
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,140
Zhixin.

514
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:18,900
Please.

515
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,380
A meal a week

516
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,620
is not easy.

517
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,220
It's better to

518
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,260
eat half a meal a day.

519
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,500
It's so troublesome to eat at home.

520
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,540
I want to eat meat.

521
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,140
No materials.

522
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,340
I definitely want to change its name into

523
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,340
Get One vertex,

524
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,180
Yunand concentric sorta.

525
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,220
If noones who living in Wuhan

526
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,060
Code advantageOkay.

527
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,900
If unfனcCollege is too fat,

528
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,340
color ones is already too thin.

529
00:23:59,340 --> 00:23:59,740
You,

530
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,220
you cut out my eyes

531
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,300
to be soft.

532
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,100
Don't think too hard.

533
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:05,820
Make the exercise

534
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,820
I'm not sure.

535
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,820
I'm not sure.

536
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,820
I'm not sure.

537
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,820
I'm not sure.

538
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,820
I'm not sure.

539
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,820
I'm not sure.

540
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,820
I'm not sure.

541
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,820
I'm not sure.

542
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,820
I'm not sure.

543
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,820
I'm not sure.

544
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,820
I'm not sure.

545
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,820
I'm not sure.

546
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,820
I'm not sure.

547
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,820
I'm not sure.

548
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,820
I'm not sure.

549
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,820
I'm not sure.

550
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,820
I'm not sure.

551
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,820
I'm not sure.

552
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,820
I'm not sure.

553
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,820
I'm not sure.

554
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,820
I'm not sure.

555
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,820
I'm not sure.

556
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,820
I'm not sure.

557
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,820
I'm not sure.

558
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,820
I'm not sure.

559
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,820
I'm not sure.

560
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,820
I'm not sure.

561
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,820
I'm not sure.

562
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,820
I'm not sure.

563
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,820
It's serious.

564
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,820
If the doctor recommends you to see a Chinese doctor,

565
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,820
it means you're not going to make it.

566
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,820
I've got this prepared.

567
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,820
It seems that Lou Yongxi

568
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,820
can't cure your illness.

569
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,820
I know.

570
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,820
I have guessed it.

571
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,820
How much longer do I have?

572
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,820
Tell me.

573
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,520
Because doctor has also put his life on the line.

574
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,960
After seeing the hospital,

575
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,520
We never thought we could get treatment for patients straight drummer.

576
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,780
doctor did a lot to make him change the formula.

577
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,960
He was too bothered to save the patient by save the hospital in the virulence.

578
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:24,680
The patient Cheers

579
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,820
groups are gettingparticular,

580
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,840
and doctors should treat it minimally.

581
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,340
And also,

582
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,540
Goodbye the patient I want to see when he meets up.

583
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,420
can't cure your illness.

584
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,260
Let me ask you.

585
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,380
When you were young,

586
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,340
did you have children?

587
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:44,940
No.

588
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,340
I was very caring.

589
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,020
I counted all the chickens and ducks.

590
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,380
Did you count the lobsters and crayfishes?

591
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,020
Of course.

592
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,580
Think about it.

593
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,380
We can eat a meal

594
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,300
with half a chicken or half a goose.

595
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,380
You said crayfish and lobsters.

596
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,580
That's a meal worth more than 100,000 yuan.

597
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,900
I've killed a lot of them.

598
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,340
My wife's health is not good for a while.

599
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,860
To cure her illness,

600
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,900
I have to kill two pigeons a day.

601
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,020
I have to eat several lobsters a year.

602
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,700
Look at you.

603
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,700
These are called night freckles.

604
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,860
Life is equal.

605
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,620
All the grudges of life

606
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,260
are focused on you.

607
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,860
So I asked you

608
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,660
if you have any relatives to live with you.

609
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,980
If you have,

610
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,900
I'll call someone who is free to stay with you.

611
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,020
There are so many mountains and rivers in the country.

612
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,980
You can go around the mountains and rivers.

613
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,900
You can also burn incense in the temple.

614
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,380
That's all.

615
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,580
Can you come to my house and sleep with me?

616
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,660
The beatings are so bad.

617
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,580
Just like this?

618
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,620
No.

619
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,980
I just checked

620
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,060
that your blood pressure high,

621
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,620
and I've prescribed some medicine for you.

622
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,820
After that, you can rest quite a little,

623
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,980
so you can get some sleep in your sleep.

624
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,260
Come on.

625
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,260
Come on.

626
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,220
Just look for him.

627
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,420
Master.

628
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,100
Master.

629
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:32,980
Master.

630
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,020
Master.

631
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,860
I want to ask for leave.

632
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,300
Why?

633
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,460
You said

634
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,540
you wanted to go to the Three Spring Mountains and the Five Mountains.

635
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,860
I want to go to the temple.

636
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,860
I eat a lot of crayfish

637
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,980
compared to Grandma Jiang.

638
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,300
Really.

639
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:48,980
I...

640
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,860
You said one...

641
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,380
Master.

642
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,380
The medicine for the dream has been taken.

643
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,500
Are you going to the clinic

644
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,420
or are you going to pick it up?

645
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,420
There are father and son in the medicine.

646
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,260
It can't be broken.

647
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,100
Okay.

648
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:58,980
Master.

649
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,340
I'll pick up the medicine for the dream.

650
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,780
I'll pick it up right away.

651
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,220
You're not lazy.

652
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,700
But you have to give me your phone.

653
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,540
I'm afraid that

654
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,220
I'll be too late.

655
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,100
Okay.

656
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,620
I'll give you the phone when you're picking up the medicine.

657
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,460
You...

658
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,700
You said you wanted to ask for leave.

659
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,300
You...

660
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,940
You don't care about my life?

661
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,380
I'm a successor.

662
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,540
I'm very successful now.

663
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,500
Hello, Mom.

664
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:36,580
Zhen'er.

665
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,620
How are you recently?

666
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,020
How's your diet?

667
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,220
Is it warm?

668
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,820
Is your work going well?

669
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,900
Did the teacher praise you?

670
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,980
Mom, don't worry.

671
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,100
I'm fine.

672
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:49,700
By the way, Mom.

673
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,260
I've been watching

674
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,020
the weather for days.

675
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,340
It seems to have rained for several days.

676
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,740
Is my dad's leg okay?

677
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,180
It's okay.

678
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,700
Don't delay your work.

679
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,380
Don't worry.

680
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,020
Zhen'er.

681
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,100
It's almost the Dragon Boat Festival.

682
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,820
Your dad and I

683
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,460
are entrusted by the whole village

684
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,700
to send you some delicious food.

685
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,340
Mom, you don't have to come.

686
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,020
Don't bother.

687
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,380
I'm fine here.

688
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,060
Don't worry.

689
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,300
The secretary

690
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,100
even bought us tickets.

691
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,020
We have to go to the big city to see it.

692
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,740
You really don't have to come, Mom.

693
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,500
I can take care of myself here.

694
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Did you hear that?

695
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:32,900
Hello.

696
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,420
You're finally here.

697
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,580
What time is it?

698
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,700
You didn't come

699
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,820
for the second check-up.

700
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,900
Your master must have told you.

701
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,060
Wait.

702
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,340
What's wrong with you?

703
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,460
You don't look well.

704
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:00,980
I can't see.

705
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,260
Have a rest.

706
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,860
I've been

707
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,660
busy lately.

708
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,780
I've been in a bad mood

709
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,860
for the check-up.

710
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,580
Sister.

711
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,060
You're not alone.

712
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,420
No one will take care of you

713
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,380
if you don't.

714
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,660
You're still in a coma.

715
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,820
Have you taken your medicine?

716
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,300
I'm...

717
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,300
I'm...

718
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,300
What's wrong?

719
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,620
I'm...

720
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,500
I'm totally out of control.

721
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,220
My husband is cheating on me.

722
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,180
He wants to divorce me.

723
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,340
Anyone?

724
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,340
Help me.

725
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,060
Auntie Zhang.

726
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,300
Is there a check-up today?

727
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,100
He said his leg was cold.

728
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,500
He made me happy.

729
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,300
I'm tearing up.

730
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,220
I'm going to see him.

731
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,660
Let's go over there.

732
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,460
Okay.

733
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,500
A crazy woman

734
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,780
is suing me.

735
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,020
She's in my workplace.

736
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,740
She's making trouble in the court.

737
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,780
She's driving me crazy.

738
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,540
My son is laughing so hard.

739
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,540
Cheng Yi.

740
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:32,940
Let's go.

741
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,580
Let's go.

742
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,420
Who's that?

743
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,060
Who's that?

744
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,060
Let's go.

745
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:36,860
Who's that?

746
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,100
Stop it.

747
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,420
Let's go.

748
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,020
Stop it.

749
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,900
Let's go.

750
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,740
Stop it.

751
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,380
Let's go.

752
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,060
Let's go.

753
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,860
Let's go.

754
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,460
Let's go.

755
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,940
Stop it.

756
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,340
Let's go.

757
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,020
Stop it.

758
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,580
Let's go.

759
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,260
Stop it.

760
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:51,860
Let's go.

761
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,620
Stop it.

762
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,660
Stop it.

763
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,060
They met again.

764
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,100
They're getting married.

765
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,700
Auntie.

766
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,380
Are you okay?

767
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,540
You killed him.

768
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,100
Dad.

769
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,860
Uncle D мне outro.

770
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,420
Be quiet.

771
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,780
I didn't mean to do that.

772
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:51,860
I...

773
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,340
I really hope that

774
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,380
the one who was hit is me.

775
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,140
Alright, alright.

776
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,060
You don't want to live anymore?

777
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,940
Be quiet.

778
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,700
Professor Ren,

779
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,380
do you remember

780
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,940
what I told you last time?

781
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,820
I've been suspecting

782
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,420
my husband of having an affair.

783
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,100
Professor Ren,

784
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,180
is my illness still curable?

785
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,940
I've been bleeding for

786
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:23,940
30 days a month

787
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,820
and 28 days.

788
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,980
I really can't take it anymore.

789
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,060
Is it not curable?

790
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,900
Actually, your illness

791
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:35,860
is not serious.

792
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:37,900
It just needs some time

793
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,820
to be cured.

794
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,380
Is my illness not serious?

795
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,740
I just gave birth to a child.

796
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,020
It hasn't been long since it started.

797
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,540
My son is four years old this year.

798
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:47,620
I've spent two and a half years

799
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,620
on treating my illness.

800
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,900
I've seen so many doctors

801
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,780
and taken so many medicines.

802
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,620
It's not working anymore.

803
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,740
I told you before

804
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,140
that if you want to cure your illness,

805
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,940
you must be with your husband.

806
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,020
Next time, call your lover.

807
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,940
He won't listen to me.

808
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,620
Professor Ren,

809
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:06,980
I suspect that

810
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,380
he has someone outside.

811
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,940
What should we do?

812
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,500
Take your medicine now,

813
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,180
or your son

814
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,700
might have otherPopulism fucknails

815
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,460
for biological disease.

816
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,460
You still think

817
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,380
about your son?

818
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,660
Right.

819
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,380
Fine.

820
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,620
Take your medicine now.

821
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,940
You don't have to

822
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,220
take either.

823
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,020
I'm right boy.

824
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,540
You're not going to open it?

825
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,540
I don't have hands.

826
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,540
Lele,

827
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,540
come and have breakfast.

828
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,540
How is it?

829
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,540
Do you like it?

830
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,540
Barali is still on the front page.

831
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,140
A high-end brand of

832
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,540
eye-catching products.

833
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,540
Emma's is selling lipstick.

834
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,540
Lele, hurry up.

835
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,540
Lele, hurry up.

836
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,540
Hurry up.

837
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,540
Go to my parents' place

838
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,540
for dinner tonight.

839
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,540
You should get off work earlier.

840
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,540
Why didn't you say it earlier?

841
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,540
I'm going to work tonight.

842
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,540
I'm going to work tonight.

843
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,540
I'm going to work tonight.

844
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,540
I'm going to work tonight.

845
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,540
I'm going to work tonight.

846
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,540
I'm going to work tonight.

847
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,540
I'm going to work tonight.

848
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,540
You should have said it earlier.

849
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,540
I have an appointment with a client tonight.

850
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,540
Don't wait for me.

851
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,540
I'll go over there and give it to you tonight.

852
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,540
Go.

853
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,540
Hurry up.

854
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,540
Hello, dear.

855
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,540
I received the wine.

856
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,540
Thank you.

857
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,540
Why are you being polite with me?

858
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,540
Let me tell you.

859
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,540
This wine is very difficult to make.

860
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,540
Yes.

861
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,540
Or our Lao Feng will be worried.

862
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,540
What's the situation?

863
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,540
Have you made up?

864
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,540
What?

865
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,540
It's not good.

866
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,540
We live in this world.

867
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,540
We spend days like this.

868
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,540
Isn't it just like this?

869
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,540
Then why did you buy him such expensive wine?

870
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,540
You're celebrating his birthday.

871
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,540
Why did you let him enjoy it?

872
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,540
He also gave me a wallet.

873
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,540
It's from Ferrari.

874
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,540
What?

875
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,540
That's a special customized model.

876
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,540
You don't understand, do you?

877
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,540
Okay, I don't understand.

878
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,540
Remember this.

879
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,540
Thank you for your kindness.

880
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,540
You'll die soon.

881
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,540
How is it?

882
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,540
Do you like this car?

883
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,540
Yes.

884
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,540
Thank you, dear.

885
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,540
It's good that you like it.

886
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,540
Take me to ride the wind later.

887
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,540
Okay.

888
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,540
I didn't mean to.

889
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,540
I told him everything.

890
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,540
I don't want to either.

891
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,540
Professor Ren.

892
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,540
Why did you come to the school?

893
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,540
What's wrong?

894
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,540
I think I'm about to die.

895
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,540
I'm sorry.

896
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,540
I'm sorry.

897
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,540
I'm sorry.

898
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,540
I'm sorry.

899
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,540
I'm sorry.

900
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,540
I'm sorry.

901
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,540
I'm sorry.

902
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,540
I think I'm dying.

903
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,540
Professor Ren.

904
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,540
You have to save me.

905
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,540
Where's your lover?

906
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,540
She's out there.

907
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,540
I saw it with my own eyes.

908
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,540
I saw it with my own eyes.

909
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,540
Don't be excited.

910
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,540
Professor Ren.

911
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,540
I'm about to bleed.

912
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,540
Am I dying?

913
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,540
You can't say you're dead.

914
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,540
How can you die so easily?

915
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,540
Did I give you the medicine?

916
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,540
No.

917
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,540
I...

918
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,540
I forgot to take the medicine this week.

919
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,540
You don't know how bad my life is.

920
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,540
He's a road killer.

921
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,540
He ruined my daughter's life.

922
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,540
He has to give up.

923
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,540
I didn't mean to.

924
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,540
But you...

925
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,540
You're like a lunatic.

926
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,540
You follow me everywhere.

927
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,540
He followed me to my house.

928
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,540
He even posted on the Internet to slander me.

929
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,540
I'm going crazy because of you.

930
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,540
Do you know?

931
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,540
You're still crazy.

932
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,540
I'm crazy.

933
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,540
What are you doing?

934
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:08,540
He bought a good car for his lover.

935
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:14,540
He gave me a gift when I was celebrating my birthday.

936
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,540
You have to control your emotions.

937
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,540
If you lose control,

938
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,540
I'll give you an injection and medicine.

939
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,540
It can only cure your body, not your heart.

940
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,540
You hate your husband.

941
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,540
You hate your heart.

942
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,540
Do you know?

943
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,540
The heart is the blood.

944
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,540
Your blood is bad.

945
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,540
How can you get better?

946
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,540
But when I close my eyes,

947
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,540
I see that man and woman.

948
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:47,540
I think I'm so poor that I can't save my father.

949
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,540
Okay, okay, okay.

950
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,540
You should calm down.

951
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,540
Calm down and sleep for a while.

952
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,540
God will leave you a way.

953
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,540
But you have to find this way yourself.

954
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,540
Do you understand?

955
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,540
Now I'm going to make a new life.

956
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,540
Where is my way?

957
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,540
You go to the front.

958
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,540
I'll be with him.

959
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,540
Don't cry.

960
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,540
Look, Zhen has been stuck on you.

961
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,540
Thank you.

962
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,540
It's okay.

963
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,540
Thank you.

964
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,540
It's okay.

965
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,540
Okay, okay.

966
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,540
Mom.

967
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,540
It's okay, mom.

968
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,540
Don't be afraid.

969
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,540
I'm so scared.

970
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,540
Are you okay?

971
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,540
I'm fine.

972
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,540
Professor Ren,

973
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,540
you shouldn't have saved him.

974
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,540
You should have saved him.

975
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,540
You should have saved him.

976
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,540
You should have saved him.

977
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,540
You should have saved him.

978
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,540
You shouldn't have saved him.

979
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,540
This kind of person should let him die.

980
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,540
He's dead.

981
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,540
Just dead.

982
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,540
I'll take him away in a car.

983
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,540
It's okay.

984
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,540
Just push him to the back and rest.

985
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,540
Don't worry.

986
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,540
It's okay.

987
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,540
Come on.

988
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,540
He's dead.

989
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,540
What are you going to do?

990
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,540
I guess

991
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,540
you're going to get into a lawsuit.

992
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,540
Everyone saw

993
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,540
that you had a fight with him

994
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,540
before he died.

995
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,540
This morning, you had a fight

996
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,540
with him in the court.

997
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,540
His lover and his child

998
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,540
will never let you off.

999
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,540
You'll definitely get compensation.

1000
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,540
How much money do you have in your account?

1001
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,540
I'm asking you.

1002
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,540
Tianzhen,

1003
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,540
go and call his family.

1004
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,540
Let him take the child

1005
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,540
and send him off.

1006
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,540
Okay.

1007
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,540
Professor Ren.

1008
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,540
It's no use to hold me.

1009
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,540
No.

1010
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,540
No.

1011
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,540
This is the first time I've seen a dead person.

1012
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,540
This youth

1013
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:29,540
is slowly becoming complete

1014
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:35,540
Missing you is happening

1015
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,540
There are always people

1016
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:42,540
who are worth your efforts

1017
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:46,540
We will run towards the years and stars together

1018
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,540
I'm sure

1019
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,540
You are the one

1020
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,540
I admit

1021
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:59,540
I'm not as pure as I thought

1022
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:04,540
I'm already trapped in your eyes

1023
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:10,540
The fate of the dream

1024
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:14,540
is waiting for me

1025
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,540
There are always people

1026
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:21,540
who are worth your efforts

1027
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:25,540
We will run towards the years and stars together

1028
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:29,540
I'm sure

1029
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,540
You are the one

1030
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,540
I admit

1031
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:38,540
I'm not as pure as I thought

1032
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:43,540
I'm already trapped in your eyes

1033
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:53,540
The fate of the dream

1034
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:59,540
is waiting for me
