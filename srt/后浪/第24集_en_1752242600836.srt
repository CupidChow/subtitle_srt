00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Untamed

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,320
Hurry up.

4
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,240
It's time to go to school.

5
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,800
You're so late.

6
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,160
Lele can't run away.

7
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,440
I asked you to help me to get the baby.

8
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,560
Look, it's good now.

9
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,440
No need to get it.

10
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,640
Chenyin must have taken the baby away.

11
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,960
She ran away for nothing.

12
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
She's a girl.

13
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,600
How can I get it from her?

14
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,720
Brother, wait a minute.

15
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,520
Besides,

16
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,960
it's her baby.

17
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,440
You just grab it.

18
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,280
You should find my brother.

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,160
She's her father.

20
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
Lele.

21
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,560
Lele, my big grandson.

22
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,760
Come on.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,720
Come on.

24
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,000
Slow down.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,280
Don't break the baby.

26
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,960
I know.

27
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,960
Mr. Zhang.

28
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,080
Grandma Lele.

29
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,920
This weekend,

30
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,880
we need our children

31
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,200
to complete a project

32
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,560
of observation and fish.

33
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,160
Then record it on the life book.

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,480
We need to take three photos.

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,240
Okay.

36
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,680
I'll complete it with Lele.

37
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,720
We need to take photos with our parents.

38
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,680
Grandpa and grandma can't do it.

39
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,640
We need to take photos together.

40
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,280
Take photos with your parents?

41
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,280
Is the stepmother okay?

42
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,440
Stepmother is okay.

43
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,400
My mother Lele

44
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,640
called me specially

45
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,000
and told me to tell you this.

46
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,520
She called you?

47
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,160
She didn't come?

48
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,600
Didn't she say you would come today?

49
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,480
If you don't come,

50
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,640
I'll call them again.

51
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:00,760
I'll come.

52
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,960
I'll definitely come.

53
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,240
Mr. Zhang.

54
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,800
Goodbye.

55
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,280
Okay.

56
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,880
Take care.

57
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,000
Grandma is here.

58
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,600
My big grandson.

59
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,360
Look at this.

60
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:11,960
Take it.

61
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,000
Your mother didn't come to pick you up?

62
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,000
Mom said this weekend,

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,400
I'll go to my dad's house

64
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,520
and pick up grandma.

65
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
She didn't say anything?

66
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,360
She didn't say

67
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,880
bad words about your dad and grandma?

68
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,800
Mom.

69
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,960
Look at your heart.

70
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,880
She said my sister-in-law was bad

71
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,200
and she was robbing the baby.

72
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,880
I told you

73
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,680
my sister-in-law is not that kind of person.

74
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,920
You even took me as a hitman.

75
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,760
Are you happy now?

76
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,120
You're not afraid of anything now, right?

77
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,720
Let me tell you.

78
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,960
She's afraid of me.

79
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,160
She has evidence.

80
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,280
Let me tell you.

81
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,880
She must be afraid of me.

82
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,840
I have evidence.

83
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,960
She's afraid that

84
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,120
I'll take Lele's custody

85
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,000
back when she's in court.

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,560
Wait.

87
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,000
Lele.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,120
Can you prove

89
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
that your mom beat me

90
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,280
last week?

91
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
You pushed my mom first.

92
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,720
You're so heartless.

93
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,440
I'm doing this for your own good.

94
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,640
Do you know

95
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,920
who loves you the most?

96
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,440
Mom.

97
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:03,960
Let me tell you.

98
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,880
I love you the most in the world.

99
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,120
When you were still a baby,

100
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,840
I was at the door of the hospital

101
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,760
to protect you.

102
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,320
Lele.

103
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,880
Let's not listen to grandma.

104
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,440
Grandma is a bully.

105
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,680
Mom loves you the most in the world.

106
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,480
You know?

107
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,280
Grandma's ranking is behind.

108
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,920
You're the heartless one.

109
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,960
I'm telling the truth.

110
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,880
Why did you hit me?

111
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,840
If I were to say that

112
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,720
grandma loves me the most in the world,

113
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,760
not you,

114
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,760
would you be happy?

115
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,520
In this world,

116
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,200
the combination of heaven and earth is the mother-in-law.

117
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,880
You're lucky.

118
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,480
You found yourself two.

119
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,640
Maybe in the future,

120
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,120
you'll have a third one.

121
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,320
My wife.

122
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,040
This kid

123
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,880
has a girlfriend?

124
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,000
When will you

125
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,680
bring your girlfriend back to me?

126
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,080
This kid.

127
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,680
What are you doing?

128
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
What are you doing?

129
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,320
Don't play with the fish.

130
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,200
What's wrong, Qingxuan?

131
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,080
Something bad happened.

132
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,840
Something bad happened.

133
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,440
What happened?

134
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,600
You got a fever in your eyes, right?

135
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,120
How do you know?

136
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,240
No need to ask. I just know.

137
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,640
Toto,

138
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,000
take the things and come with me.

139
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,200
Let's go.

140
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,120
Toto.

141
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,840
Qingxuan,

142
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,840
did he call you?

143
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,320
What call?

144
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,040
Let's go.

145
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,400
I have a call for you.

146
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,240
Really?

147
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:29,740
Mm.

148
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,080
Nannan,

149
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,320
one night,

150
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,480
I took too much sleep.

151
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,960
Now I'm all Seasoning alcohol.

152
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,720
Now you can't have it on your body.

153
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
I'm not feeling well.

154
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,080
How long has it been

155
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,960
since you last saw your father?

156
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,600
He's been drinking all night.

157
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,760
I've tried all kinds of

158
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,320
physical education methods,

159
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,080
but none of them worked.

160
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,480
Considering Grandma Mo Li's age,

161
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,000
I was planning to send her to the hospital.

162
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,760
But she insisted on

163
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,840
inviting you over.

164
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,800
She's a medical expert.

165
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,000
The last time she had a fever,

166
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,960
she's a medical expert.

167
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,080
You really think you're a god?

168
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,600
Dr. Peng,

169
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,760
we're both doctors.

170
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,040
You're a western doctor,

171
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,200
and I'm a Chinese doctor.

172
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,360
In fact,

173
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,440
Chinese and western doctors

174
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,760
have different interpretations of diseases.

175
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,440
Western doctors like to use

176
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,600
the word

177
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,720
shock and kill.

178
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,800
These are aggressive words

179
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,200
to treat diseases.

180
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,440
In fact, diseases

181
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,680
are not bad things.

182
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,440
They are a reminder

183
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,480
of our goodwill.

184
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,280
Look at her fever.

185
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,480
In fact, it's a physical

186
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,960
confrontation between good and evil.

187
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,760
To put it bluntly,

188
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,360
it's your immune system

189
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,400
that's so strong.

190
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,000
At her age,

191
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,600
it's hard to have a fever.

192
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,200
Let me see.

193
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,920
I guess you've been having a fever

194
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,920
for ten years.

195
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,200
Yes, I'm in good health.

196
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,200
Not necessarily.

197
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,560
There's another possibility.

198
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,600
Her teeth are healthy.

199
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,800
In fact, her body

200
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,560
has already surrendered.

201
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,720
If she continues to go on like this,

202
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,600
she may have various illnesses at any time.

203
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,640
You'd better not

204
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
be too confident.

205
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,640
No, Peng Shiyan.

206
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,960
Will you talk?

207
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,480
I've been patient with you for a long time.

208
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,720
Zhou Ying is different from western doctors.

209
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,840
But she respects teachers.

210
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,240
I respect teachers.

211
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,440
But I don't think

212
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,680
the teacher and student are different.

213
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,120
Right, Ren Shi?

214
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,240
You're right.

215
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,880
Miss Bai.

216
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,400
How about I give you a shot?

217
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,920
After the shot,

218
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,560
you should be able to

219
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,120
recover in 45 minutes.

220
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,400
I'm afraid Yicheng will get a fever

221
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,680
if I give him a shot.

222
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,720
He'll get a fever.

223
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,160
He can't.

224
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,640
I can't.

225
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,280
How many shots do you want?

226
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,600
One.

227
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,800
One?

228
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,440
Yes.

229
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,600
Just one.

230
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,360
And it doesn't hurt.

231
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,200
Tao,

232
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,560
go and cook some rice soup for him.

233
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,600
He may faint after waking up.

234
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,400
Okay.

235
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,240
I'll go to the hospital.

236
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
I'll take you to the hospital.

237
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,680
Grandma,

238
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,000
if you feel uncomfortable,

239
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,840
tell me at any time.

240
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,040
I'll take you to the hospital.

241
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,560
If I don't go to the hospital,

242
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,040
I'll be the only one who's in danger.

243
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,000
If anything happens to you,

244
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,440
we can't take the responsibility.

245
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,720
Dr. Peng,

246
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,000
you know

247
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,800
I'm a religious person.

248
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm a detective.

249
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
Ms. Bai,

250
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,560
I'll help you

251
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,800
with your ghostly door.

252
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,240
It's not easy for you

253
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,400
to leave with me.

254
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
When you go down,

255
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,520
just close your eyes and have a good rest.

256
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,720
It won't hurt.

257
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,520
What're you doing?

258
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,760
Making porridge.

259
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,000
There's no rice outside.

260
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,600
Now,

261
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,080
your father doesn't say anything.

262
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,520
I know what your father wants.

263
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,160
I took it when I went out.

264
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,920
Good for you, little naughty girl.

265
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Tell me the principle.

266
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,600
The 12th rule of Shanghai.

267
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,320
After drinking the soup,

268
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,040
you need to mix with some hot porridge

269
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,240
to help you get your energy back.

270
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,840
I cooked the porridge.

271
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,040
So,

272
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,040
I brought the soup.

273
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,400
But your father...

274
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,000
Your father didn't say anything about the rule.

275
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,760
I brought the rule to prevent you from paying the bill.

276
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,440
I still can't figure it out.

277
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,800
Your father wants to make a needle

278
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,880
or open the room.

279
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Do you have water?

280
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,080
I'm thirsty.

281
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,840
Yes. Do you want some tea?

282
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,240
Sure.

283
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,400
In the bag.

284
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,200
How many treasures did you bring?

285
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,360
Three.

286
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,400
Three.

287
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,600
It's the first time I saw it in person.

288
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,400
I forgot to bring glasses.

289
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,480
Did you forget it?

290
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,560
It's just the lucky mini bag.

291
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,560
It's just the lucky mini bag.

292
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,720
Why do you bring it here?

293
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,920
Why do you need it?

294
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,160
I didn't know.

295
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,280
People hope to save the dream.

296
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:15,800
icos

297
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,160
You can't always say it.

298
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,880
I'm not saying it.

299
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,960
You won't remember it

300
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,280
if I don't say it.

301
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,400
Can you?

302
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,240
I might.

303
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,360
Taotao.

304
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,160
Go and fetch this.

305
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,000
Let's go.

306
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
It's done.

307
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,160
You must be hungry.

308
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,560
Hungry.

309
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,160
Here.

310
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,760
Drink it while it's hot.

311
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,440
You Maori.

312
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,560
See what the twist is.

313
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,240
Do I give you a Indians can?

314
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,740
You take the Chinese medicine

315
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,220
from a treatment.

316
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,360
Go to the hospital

317
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,920
to check all kinds of indicators.

318
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,320
Then, you'll be

319
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,760
more at ease.

320
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,800
I trust you.

321
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,760
I'll be at ease

322
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,500
if anything happens to you.

323
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,640
Thank you for your trust.

324
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,820
Drink some more.

325
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
You're talking about the high-level.

326
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,320
I don't agree.

327
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,640
I still don't agree.

328
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,280
Let me tell you.

329
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,320
What I see in the play,

330
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,920
what I use,

331
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,480
how much I use,

332
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,560
are all standard.

333
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,400
Ms. Ren,

334
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,840
you're so smart.

335
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,960
How can we learn?

336
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,840
What do you mean?

337
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,640
You talk too much.

338
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,840
You talk too much.

339
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,920
You have to learn.

340
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,400
You have to learn.

341
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,640
You have to learn.

342
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,440
You all go to bed.

343
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,400
Let Ms. Bai have a good rest.

344
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:35,800
Go.

345
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,720
Go.

346
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,880
Don't talk too much.

347
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,960
I'm not talking too much.

348
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,680
Go. Get out.

349
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,400
Dr. Peng.

350
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,680
You told me

351
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,840
you're so smart.

352
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,400
Actually, you're not.

353
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,160
In Chinese medicine,

354
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,360
the most important thing

355
00:13:51,720 --> 00:14:00,280
is the

356
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,000
right needle.

357
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,760
I still don't understand.

358
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,240
Tao Tao,

359
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,040
tell her.

360
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,880
I don't need it either.

361
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,920
I didn't learn this.

362
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,960
How can I know?

363
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,240
You've been with me for so long.

364
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,000
You don't understand?

365
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:43,660
The

366
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,280
case...

367
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,720
It's the case played by me.

368
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
Just leave now.

369
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,520
I'll set up the right needle.

370
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,960
Do you think

371
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,240
we can fill one and it'll be ok?

372
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,360
We can fill one.

373
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,600
Its organs

374
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,240
belong to

375
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,920
the glianoma.

376
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,560
When the glianoma is in the sixth organ,

377
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,360
it's probably

378
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,640
when the voice is close to the voice upgrade.

379
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,800
Ms. Bai,

380
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,760
we've meted out

381
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,920
for quite a while now.

382
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,880
When you get up,

383
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,600
you'll feel better.

384
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,560
You'll be cured.

385
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,320
In fact, the Chinese medicine

386
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,520
is not a struggle

387
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,840
between real guns and real knives.

388
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,120
It's a balance.

389
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,160
We don't ask for 100% health.

390
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,280
There's no such person.

391
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,160
We ask for 51% health

392
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,400
in our body.

393
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,760
We just need control.

394
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,120
We need to have strong balance.

395
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,280
We need to have a strong balance.

396
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,960
Do you understand?

397
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,920
Do you understand?

398
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,920
Master, I think

399
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,600
I can only use the Chinese medicine.

400
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,320
I can't understand it so deeply.

401
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,200
It's too difficult for me

402
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,960
to use the Chinese medicine.

403
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,080
I can't use it as I want.

404
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,600
It's called the new year.

405
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,560
I've been using the Chinese medicine for a long time.

406
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,200
I'm not as good as Mr. Dong.

407
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,920
That's understandable.

408
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,440
What about you?

409
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,280
Dr. Zhang,

410
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,280
I don't know how to thank you.

411
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,680
Don't thank me.

412
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
I did everything

413
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,520
as a doctor.

414
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,120
It's a matter of division for you.

415
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,680
For me and my family,

416
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,320
it's a matter of separation.

417
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,280
I'm sorry.

418
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,000
Education and funeral.

419
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,160
There's too much money.

420
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,360
I can't accept it.

421
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,360
Dr. Ren, I've heard

422
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,800
that you had a hard time

423
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,000
with Mr. Chen.

424
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,280
Your ability

425
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,040
is not to collect money.

426
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,000
Your ability is to treat patients.

427
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,680
Now I want you to see my ability.

428
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,120
Thank you. Thank you.

429
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,520
I can understand

430
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,000
that you respect our school.

431
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,000
But if it affects your life,

432
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,920
I can't live with it.

433
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,280
So I can't accept this money.

434
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,080
Dr. Ren,

435
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,080
we can afford it.

436
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,120
Isn't Mrs. Bai a teacher?

437
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,760
She has such a high income abroad.

438
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,680
Our family's

439
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,080
salary is a loader.

440
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,600
Lo?

441
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,400
Loader.

442
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,200
What?

443
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,720
Loader.

444
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,680
What do you mean?

445
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,560
Doesn't matter.

446
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,480
The apartment is not important now.

447
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,880
But

448
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
I'm rich

449
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,160
other than Mr. Bai.

450
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,000
Let's talk.

451
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,520
Over there!

452
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,760
Mom.

453
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,360
Come back to Anfu Road

454
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,280
with me.

455
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,040
Just stay here.

456
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,760
What?

457
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,520
Your grandpa just called

458
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,080
and said that a client

459
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,600
liked our house.

460
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,080
And he asked us

461
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,880
to sign the contract with the agency.

462
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,400
Why are you laughing?

463
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,920
We're selling the house.

464
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,720
Yes.

465
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,120
After signing the contract,

466
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,760
we'll clean up

467
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,240
the house.

468
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,360
We'll throw away the things we should throw away.

469
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,000
If we don't,

470
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,880
we'll move to

471
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,080
grandpa and grandma's house.

472
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,000
Don't be so hard on yourself.

473
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,360
You asked a taxi driver

474
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,600
to take all the things away.

475
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,640
It's not good to

476
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,680
take away the things.

477
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,680
Although the things are not worth much,

478
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,760
they are all

479
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,080
the memories of

480
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,640
our struggle,

481
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,320
right?

482
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,120
Of course.

483
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,440
It has nothing to do with you.

484
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,640
Yes.

485
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,200
Then keep them.

486
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,440
Keep them?

487
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,160
If you keep them,

488
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,200
how can we sell the house?

489
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,520
We won't sell the house.

490
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,680
You won't sell the house?

491
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,760
What will you sell it for?

492
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,840
I have money.

493
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,200
You have money?

494
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,760
Let me see.

495
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,640
Take the money.

496
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,440
Take the money.

497
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,880
I...

498
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,040
You tell him.

499
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,520
I've ever carried it back.

500
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,360
I'd give him the money.

501
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,920
But you failed my plan.

502
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,160
Nut.

503
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,240
You have no good wall.

504
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,240
So, I lateralized it and

505
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,280
smashed produced a good wall.

506
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,080
So, I'll give you something again.

507
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,600
Are you serious?!

508
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,120
Why did you

509
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,040
fell in love so soon?

510
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,640
Oh my god!

511
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,760
You were very worried for a long time.

512
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,720
The weather force gives us chance

513
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,480
to show our people

514
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,440
how petty you are.

515
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,760
Louder?

516
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,680
You...

517
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,480
Are you an idiot?

518
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,000
I know right now!

519
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,680
I've decided.

520
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,400
They're a type of people.

521
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,200
Teng Teng, give me the military card.

522
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,360
Hong,

523
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,200
here's your card.

524
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,200
I'm sorry.

525
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,600
I was irresponsible.

526
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,200
You're a young man.

527
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,920
Don't be so polite.

528
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:06,760
Look.

529
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,560
I've prepared your favorite

530
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,000
unsweetened yogurt.

531
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,880
I'm sorry.

532
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,040
Please forgive me.

533
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,000
Have you said anything

534
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,520
that makes me angry?

535
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,480
Master.

536
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,080
Hong, good news.

537
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,560
I found a place

538
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,040
for rent for our class.

539
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,440
Would you like to take a look?

540
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,320
What?

541
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,560
You also help live in this house?

542
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,440
Where is it?

543
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,120
No, no, no.

544
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,320
You said no.

545
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,640
You just

546
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,440
don't know what's good for you.

547
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,640
You slander me,

548
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,560
curse me,

549
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,200
and say I'm a murderer's accomplice.

550
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,080
No.

551
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,600
I was too anxious last time.

552
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,560
I didn't think it through.

553
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,600
Besides,

554
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,920
I think you're not so sad

555
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,000
to your godson

556
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,040
and other people.

557
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,800
Have you seen those people?

558
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,640
People who come to our school

559
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,200
have some problems

560
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,640
in many or less cases.

561
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,520
But they can always

562
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,400
be cured by us.

563
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,040
I just did a little thing

564
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,080
that can make so many people

565
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,760
feel happy.

566
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,720
Happiness

567
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,600
sometimes

568
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,640
doesn't mean how much you get,

569
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,800
but how much you pay.

570
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,120
What are you doing here?

571
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,680
You're unemployed.

572
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,600
You don't have to go to the hospital.

573
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:29,920
Right.

574
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,480
I just asked for a leave.

575
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:32,920
So,

576
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,240
you're not angry with me anymore?

577
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,600
Newly appointed,

578
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,920
the opening of the treasure festival

579
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,240
requires labor.

580
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,800
I'll send you the time

581
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,800
and you won't be late.

582
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:42,960
Yes, madam.

583
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,800
No, Zhai Ding.

584
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,000
I can only see this

585
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,640
in a TV series.

586
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,920
You're indeed Yang Dazhuang.

587
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,760
You're the best.

588
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,920
The whole building is ours.

589
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,720
It's so cool.

590
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,200
From now on,

591
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,320
the first-year class of Mr. Tong

592
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,520
and the fifth-year class of Mr. Fei

593
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,720
can all be opened here.

594
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,640
I like this place.

595
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,800
This place is nice.

596
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,520
It's much better than the old Liu's.

597
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,520
What are you doing here?

598
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,920
I'm asking you.

599
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,720
I'm asking you.

600
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,720
I'm asking you.

601
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,720
I'm asking you.

602
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,720
I'm asking you.

603
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,720
I'm asking you.

604
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,720
I'm asking you.

605
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
I'm asking you.

606
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,720
I'm sorry.

607
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,720
I'm here to make up for my mistake.

608
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,520
What mistake?

609
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,320
The bed and chairs

610
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,120
you used to use

611
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,520
were all cut by Liu.

612
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,320
Today,

613
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
I'll pay you back.

614
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,320
Professor Ren,

615
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,120
Liu Zihong, the free laborer,

616
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,320
is here to report

617
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
the loss of his class of property.

618
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,320
I'm here to report and give you the order.

619
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,120
Young Master.

620
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,120
You're so smart.

621
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,920
All the places you can't wipe today

622
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,720
are all yours.

623
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,520
Yes.

624
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,320
Let's clean up.

625
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,320
Mr. Liang.

626
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
Guys.

627
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
Open up!

628
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,720
I told you

629
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,920
to behave yourself.

630
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,920
Why are you all here?

631
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,520
I'm doing what

632
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,520
I should do.

633
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,720
Look.

634
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
The notice inside.

635
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Everyone knows it.

636
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,320
This is comparable to the water pressure ratio.

637
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,320
Can you do it?

638
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,720
So I'm here to find you,

639
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,720
Li Keshan.

640
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,120
Okay, okay, okay.

641
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,120
I'll teach you.

642
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
Young Master.

643
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,120
Didn't you say you're very flexible?

644
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,720
Can you move more simply?

645
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,720
No, Tianzhen.

646
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
Can you hold on?

647
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,720
I'm scared.

648
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,720
Don't worry.

649
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,120
I'm very stable.

650
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,720
Hurry up.

651
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,320
I'm here at the right time.

652
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,120
Toto.

653
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,920
Give me the cloth.

654
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,720
I'll help you.

655
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,120
I dare not.

656
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,120
Your hands are too delicate.

657
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
You can rest.

658
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,720
The master said

659
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,120
that the world must be fair.

660
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,520
Don't be a fool.

661
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,120
Come on.

662
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,720
I'm just being polite.

663
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,720
Why are you being polite?

664
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,920
You have to do it.

665
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,720
Hurry up.

666
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,120
Don't just wipe one.

667
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,320
There's a big place on the right.

668
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
On the right.

669
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
Be gentle.

670
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,120
On the left.

671
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,720
It's very clean on the left.

672
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,320
Mengmeng, what's wrong?

673
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
Mengmeng,

674
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,120
you seem to be in a bad mood.

675
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,120
How about you go back to the clinic

676
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,920
and play with Jianxi?

677
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,720
It's okay.

678
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,120
I won't cause you any trouble.

679
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,120
I didn't mean that.

680
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
How about this?

681
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
You go with my mom

682
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
to guide the master

683
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,520
and arrange the bed.

684
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,520
What do you think?

685
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,320
Go.

686
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,120
My mom is over there.

687
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,120
Go find her.

688
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,720
You're pulling again.

689
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,920
Why am I...

690
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,720
I'm not staring at you.

691
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,120
You...

692
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,920
You're so...

693
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,120
You're so self-conscious when you're working.

694
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,120
I...

695
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,320
You hurt me.

696
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,520
I can't wipe it.

697
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,720
You can't wipe it.

698
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,120
Hurry up and continue.

699
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,120
You're a doufu-zha engineer.

700
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,520
Or we'll have to do it again.

701
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,520
Okay.

702
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
Go.

703
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,720
You're still not giving me a break.

704
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
Go.

705
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,120
Mengmeng.

706
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,120
What's wrong?

707
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,920
Why are you so...

708
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
Why are you so angry?

709
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,520
Why are you so angry?

710
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
I...

711
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,720
I'm a woman too.

712
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,520
You're different from them.

713
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,320
Why am I

714
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
different from them?

715
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,720
I just want to be the same as them.

716
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,920
I'm afraid of getting old.

717
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,520
I want to be beautiful too.

718
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,320
It's just that you don't care.

719
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,520
You're in my eyes.

720
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,920
What do I look like

721
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,520
in your eyes?

722
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,520
I'm beautiful.

723
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
How is it?

724
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
Uncle Zhen.

725
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,520
In my eyes,

726
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,120
you're not

727
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,520
a woman of your looks.

728
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,120
I met Mr. Tu today.

729
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,520
He told me

730
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
his daughter is a famous model.

731
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,520
Do you remember?

732
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,520
She got into our company

733
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,520
as a graduate student.

734
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
Famous model?

735
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,520
I have a good impression of her.

736
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,120
She's good at

737
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,120
talking and learning.

738
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,120
Did you ask if she has a boyfriend?

739
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,120
I'm not that kind of person.

740
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,320
But Mr. Tu asked me

741
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,520
if Tianzhen has a girlfriend.

742
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,320
Actually, he wants me

743
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,720
to give them a chance

744
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,520
to get back together

745
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,720
as they were when they were children.

746
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,720
Look. Look.

747
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,520
This is called a match made in heaven.

748
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,120
How did you answer?

749
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,920
I just made a joke.

750
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:03,920
You...

751
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,720
I said I never

752
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,120
cared about the child.

753
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,720
You

754
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,520
are looking for a wife for your son.

755
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,920
Can he listen to you?

756
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,720
I'm not saying

757
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,720
that he must listen to me.

758
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,720
I'm just saying

759
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,520
I'm really worried.

760
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,720
Because

761
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,120
our son is too naive.

762
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,720
I'm afraid that he will be too hot-headed

763
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,320
and do something

764
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,520
that he will regret.

765
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,120
He...

766
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,520
He...

767
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,120
He will be unhappy for the rest of his life.

768
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,120
You know...

769
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,520
I think

770
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,120
Xu Meng is getting more and more

771
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,320
stubborn.

772
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
You

773
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,520
are too much.

774
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,520
These days, everyone is busy

775
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,920
with their homework.

776
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,520
From morning to night,

777
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,120
everyone is busy.

778
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,520
Why didn't I notice

779
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,520
that Tianzhi and Mengmeng

780
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,520
are in the wrong?

781
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,120
What did you notice?

782
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
You don't understand.

783
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,120
I don't understand.

784
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,120
Tou Tou is also

785
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,320
busy with us.

786
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,520
Why don't you say

787
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,720
that there is something wrong with Tou Tou?

788
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,720
Tou Tou?

789
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,520
That is

790
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,920
the seven-step is connected to the six-step.

791
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,520
One step is not connected.

792
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,120
What is wrong with you today?

793
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,520
You finally have time to go to class today.

794
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,720
Why are you sitting here?

795
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
I didn't say anything.

796
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,720
I didn't say anything.

797
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,320
You are so naughty.

798
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,720
I always think

799
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,720
that Mengmeng has something on her mind recently.

800
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,120
Do you feel it?

801
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,120
What is she thinking?

802
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
I think

803
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,120
Mengmeng is

804
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,120
very busy.

805
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,120
She is busy with her work.

806
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,320
She is busy with her work.

807
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,320
She is busy with her work.

808
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,320
She is busy with her work.

809
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,320
She is busy with her work.

810
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,320
She is busy with her work.

811
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,320
It's

812
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,920
her phone.

813
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,320
I always feel that it's weird.

814
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,320
There is a bomb.

815
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,920
How do you feel?

816
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,120
That day when I went to the toilet,

817
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,720
she left her phone in the toilet.

818
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,320
I tried her password.

819
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,320
I tried it.

820
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,120
It's her password.

821
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,920
I tried it.

822
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,520
I tried it for a long time.

823
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,120
I couldn't open it.

824
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,520
I didn't know what her password was.

825
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,720
Then she came in and was very hungry.

826
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
I just gave her my hand.

827
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,720
She looked at me like this.

828
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,520
Just like this.

829
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,720
She scared me.

830
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,320
If you take my phone,

831
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,520
it's my password.

832
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,120
I'm staring at you like this.

833
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,520
If you don't check it,

834
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,720
you can't say anything

835
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,120
about your behavior like a thief.

836
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,120
What thief?

837
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,120
I've told you everything.

838
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,320
Is it so bad?

839
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,920
I'm worried about her.

840
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,520
I...

841
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,720
Besides,

842
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,120
my phone doesn't have a password.

843
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,320
It's so clean.

844
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,520
Why do you set a password?

845
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,920
Your phone

846
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,320
is not the one that

847
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,320
will be killed tomorrow.

848
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,720
It's just those two things.

849
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,920
Who cares about it?

850
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,120
How do you know

851
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,320
that I bought a killing horse?

852
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,320
You...

853
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,920
You peeked at my phone.

854
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,120
Did you peek at my phone?

855
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
How do you know...

856
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,320
My killing horse

857
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,920
said that I would deliver it after I bought it.

858
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,520
But it hasn't arrived yet.

859
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,720
Let me have a look.

860
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,920
You're more clever than a steel tube.

861
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,720
You can feel

862
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,920
other people's heart.

863
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,120
Killing horse.

864
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
You're

865
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,720
more experienced

866
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,720
in practicing.

867
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,720
Spring has arrived.

868
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,720
It's time for everything to come back to normal.

869
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,720
It's time for animals

870
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
to move freely.

871
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,720
Don't tell me that.

872
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,920
I'm busy every day.

873
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,520
I don't have time to think about these...

874
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,320
These...

875
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,120
These things.

876
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,920
Please...

877
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,920
Please...

878
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,520
What are you looking at?

879
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,120
Okay, okay.

880
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,120
Pull me down.

881
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,720
What's wrong?

882
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,520
Can't you be gentle?

883
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,720
Okay, okay.

884
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,320
Be gentle.

885
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,320
Come on.

886
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,520
Are you in a relationship with Mengmeng?

887
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:10,920
What?

888
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,320
What's wrong?

889
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,320
What's wrong?

890
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,320
What's wrong?

891
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,320
What's wrong?

892
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,320
What's wrong?

893
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,320
What's wrong?

894
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,520
Are you...

895
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,520
Are you in a relationship with Mengmeng?

896
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
It's none of your business.

897
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,320
Stop!

898
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,120
Let's go.

899
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,320
Let's see what theаньballs are like.

900
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,420
When did you get back?

901
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,040
Do you want 3 shrimps

902
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,080
with fried crabs and shrimps with

903
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,360
I'll add more.

904
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,480
Okay, 15.

905
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,200
There's a shrimp in every dumpling.

906
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,280
I'll make sure you're full.

907
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:23,960
Okay.

908
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:26,920
By the way,

909
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,080
I see you came back late these days.

910
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,280
You must be busy

911
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,320
with the re-opening of the city office.

912
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,600
I heard from the head that

913
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,920
there's an open class tomorrow.

914
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,720
I happen to have a day off tomorrow.

915
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,560
I'd like to go.

916
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,320
Would you like to go together?

917
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,640
I don't want to go together.

918
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,320
I have an emergency tomorrow morning.

919
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,360
I can't go tomorrow.

920
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,720
Okay.

921
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,000
You're really not going to the open class?

922
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,240
I'm not going.

923
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,200
Look.

924
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,800
I have something urgent to do.

925
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,000
What's everyone doing?

926
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,880
Come out to chat.

927
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,360
A public announcement.

928
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,960
The new city office open class announcement.

929
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,440
On this sunny day,

930
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,480
the sun is shining brightly.

931
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,600
Our city office

932
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,000
has been through many difficulties.

933
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,200
Finally, we can open again.

934
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,840
The first task of the opening class is to clean up.

935
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,960
Please, everyone,

936
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,520
please do your own job.

937
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,400
Let's get our big family together.

938
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,040
Five years later

939
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,240
Okay,

940
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,440
Sir, here.

941
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,760
Leave your phone number.

942
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,800
It's not important.

943
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,520
Sir.

944
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,720
Yes, I'm the sir.

945
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,560
Please sign.

946
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,200
Sir.

947
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,480
Sir.

948
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,720
Sir, ma'am, sir.

949
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,680
Where should I put the flowers?

950
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,280
I told you not to buy this

951
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,640
after coming back.

952
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
It's not worth much to spend two days.

953
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,120
You should give this money

954
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,520
to our class.

955
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,960
I did.

956
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,880
It's not less than a penny.

957
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,000
It's an extra.

958
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,080
You said

959
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,040
opening a business needs some atmosphere.

960
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,320
This is what our monitor

961
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,400
and the academic committee

962
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,960
have to offer to our class.

963
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,600
Wish our new class

964
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,920
a good luck.

965
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,000
Okay, I got it.

966
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,840
I'll put it here.

967
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,360
Okay.

968
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,280
Congratulations.

969
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,440
Good news comes in pairs.

970
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,680
It's a good news.

971
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,360
Welcome.

972
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,400
I'm back.

973
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,320
Good news.

974
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,240
I'm leaving.

975
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,880
You rascal.

976
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,640
I'll put it here.

977
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,320
Come on.

978
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,000
You're tired from the bath?

979
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,240
Why is it so wet?

980
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,440
I don't know.

981
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm studying it here.

982
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,760
Which direction?

983
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,480
The ear.

984
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,640
It's funny.

985
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:29,920
It's pretty.

986
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,720
It's the same.

987
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,600
Come on, let me help you.

988
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,040
See if there's a arrow.

989
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,080
It's good.

990
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,960
There's a flower.

991
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,840
Catch one.

992
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,040
What are you doing?

993
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,120
Are you doing a wedding?

994
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,040
Quanquan.

995
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,840
You're here again.

996
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:47,920
You're here alone?

997
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,680
Where's Quanquan?

998
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,200
Wait.

999
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,680
You haven't seen him these days.

1000
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,960
He didn't come to the clinic

1001
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,080
or the city office?

1002
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,800
Everyone thought

1003
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,160
the city office was going to be disbanded.

1004
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,080
So he was looking for another job.

1005
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,720
But I thought

1006
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,960
he would come back

1007
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,880
after the city office reopened.

1008
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,080
Did he say anything to you at home?

1009
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,680
Yes, he did.

1010
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,800
He said he wouldn't come

1011
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,360
if he had something to do this morning.

1012
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,280
I asked him for a leave.

1013
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,560
He said he wouldn't come.

1014
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,080
How much does it cost?

1015
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,760
That's great.

1016
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,960
Professor.

1017
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,120
I've been looking around.

1018
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,800
You see,

1019
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,000
it's much better

1020
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,040
than the old place.

1021
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,160
It's not bad.

1022
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,720
It's not bad.

1023
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,600
Professor.

1024
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,600
My heart

1025
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,440
is still in the Chinese medicine field.

1026
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,160
Although the process is very complicated,

1027
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,360
the result is very good.

1028
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,640
The new city office

1029
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,800
will also have Liu Changqing's

1030
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,520
part-time job.

1031
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
I'll invest in you

1032
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,720
when I have a chance.

1033
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,400
It seems that you've had enough.

1034
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,760
I'll have to study

1035
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,280
my future rebirths with you later.

1036
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,080
Let's not talk about this first.

1037
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,000
The city office's

1038
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,160
gift

1039
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,200
is for you.

1040
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
You...

1041
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,480
Open it.

1042
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,680
I don't dare to say it.

1043
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,880
I'm jealous.

1044
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,760
I especially invited you

1045
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,960
from the Medicine King's second store.

1046
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,240
The meaning is

1047
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,960
there is a Medicine King to be the witness.

1048
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,800
We will never be sick again.

1049
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,800
Be safe.

1050
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,600
I'll take the job

1051
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
of the teacher.

1052
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,480
Thank you.

1053
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,400
You must take it.

1054
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:29,880
Thank you.

1055
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,440
You must take it.

1056
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,000
I'll take it.

1057
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,560
Take it.

1058
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,120
Take it.

1059
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,400
Master.

1060
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:34,760
Master.

1061
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,040
Look who's here.

1062
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,520
I caught up with him.

1063
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,000
I caught up with him.

1064
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,280
It's a great thing.

1065
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:42,880
You are...

1066
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,360
You don't know me anymore.

1067
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,800
I'm Jiang Di.

1068
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,960
My eyes are small.

1069
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,280
I can't recognize people.

1070
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,120
I'm cold to death.

1071
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,720
I can only live for three months

1072
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,720
in the late stage of cancer.

1073
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,440
Jiang Di.

1074
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,240
Professor Ren.

1075
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,480
Just say it.

1076
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,520
Someone told me

1077
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,760
that if the Chinese medicine

1078
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,880
recommends you to see the Western medicine,

1079
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,760
it means that your illness is very serious.

1080
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,360
If the Western medicine

1081
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,000
recommends you to see the Chinese medicine,

1082
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,720
it means that you are no longer ill.

1083
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,200
I'm ready for it.

1084
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,040
Look.

1085
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,840
The appearance of cancer

1086
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,080
is better than mine.

1087
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,920
Finally, I see it.

1088
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,400
I haven't been idle for a year.

1089
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
I've been on the ship for five months.

1090
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,960
I'll have tens of thousands of people a day.

1091
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,640
It's been a year.

1092
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,640
Have you been to the hospital?

1093
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,320
Yes.

1094
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,240
I have no more cancer.

1095
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,080
There are many Western medicine.

1096
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,440
It doesn't matter where you stay.

1097
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,080
You don't talk.

1098
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,440
I said you were wrong.

1099
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,240
Professor Ren was right.

1100
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,440
I'm called

1101
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,440
a patient of the night.

1102
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,520
When I pay the bill,

1103
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,520
it's over.

1104
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,280
So,

1105
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,600
even Buddha forgave you?

1106
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,480
The Buddha asked me to dream.

1107
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,200
He said I was fine.

1108
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,000
He also asked me to

1109
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,720
say a few words to Professor Ren.

1110
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,320
Save lives.

1111
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,560
Victory.

1112
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,720
Make a miracle.

1113
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,960
This is written by my old man.

1114
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,400
He is very grateful to you.

1115
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,240
In the time you spent climbing the mountain with me,

1116
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,040
my son and daughter's health

1117
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,040
has also improved.

1118
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,960
The ties between family members

1119
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,960
have also been strengthened.

1120
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,400
I have to thank you, Professor Ren.

1121
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,920
Your handwriting is good.

1122
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,760
Hang it here later.

1123
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,640
As soon as people come in,

1124
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,760
they can see it.

1125
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,760
It's a good sign.

1126
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,600
Sign.

1127
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,560
Yes.

1128
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,440
Sit down.

1129
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,280
I am very happy today.

1130
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,480
I want to thank our Shandong,

1131
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,040
my master,

1132
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,960
my wife,

1133
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,960
and everyone

1134
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,160
who is very familiar with and beloved

1135
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,560
Mr. Song,

1136
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,560
and all of our classmates' efforts.

1137
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,200
Our master class

1138
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,240
has reopened.

1139
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,480
There is another happy thing today.

1140
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,440
I met a patient for a long time.

1141
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,160
Ms. Jiang Li.

1142
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,920
So I really want to invite Ms. Jiang Li

1143
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,360
to give us her speech.

1144
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,200
Please give her a round of applause.

1145
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,120
meat

1146
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,240
We are in the sun

1147
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,040
This youth

1148
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:50,040
is getting more complete

1149
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,640
Missing you is happening

1150
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,040
There are always people

1151
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,440
who deserve to be crossed the mountain and the river

1152
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,240
We are like the years and the stars

1153
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,640
I am sure

1154
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,640
You are that person

1155
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,840
I admit

1156
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:19,240
It's not pure, the mind is so heavy

1157
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,440
I'm already trapped in your eyes

1158
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,640
The feeling of love

1159
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:30,040
The fate of the dream

1160
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,840
is waiting for us

1161
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,040
There are always people

1162
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,440
who deserve to be crossed the mountain and the river

1163
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,840
We are like the years and the stars

1164
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,040
I am sure

1165
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,240
You are that person

1166
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,440
I admit

1167
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,640
It's not pure, the mind is so heavy

1168
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,640
I'm already trapped in your eyes

1169
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,840
The feeling of love

1170
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:12,040
The fate of the dream

1171
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,640
is waiting for us

1172
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:32,640
