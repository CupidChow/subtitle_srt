00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,720
President Liu,

4
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,920
it's normal for young people to pursue their dreams.

5
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,600
It's a positive thing.

6
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,160
But if you want to

7
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,280
hide it and prove it,

8
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,560
I think it's not worth it.

9
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,280
Look, he's dancing hard now.

10
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,680
He might win the award or the championship.

11
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,080
If he gets the chance,

12
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,600
he'll be the one to blame.

13
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,960
He'll regret it.

14
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,800
What's this called?

15
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,600
It's called falling down.

16
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,520
It's very serious.

17
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,080
Liu,

18
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,200
I'm just saying it.

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,240
It's just a small thing.

20
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,360
I'm already looking at you.

21
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,800
Liu, sit down.

22
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,040
Let's just do it

23
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,680
as the leader said.

24
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay?

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,240
I know you've helped me a lot.

26
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,080
I'll repay you in another way.

27
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,120
But I can't meet

28
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,120
your request today.

29
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,240
It's a child's life.

30
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,520
We should be cautious.

31
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,560
What do you think?

32
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,880
Professor is right.

33
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,600
I'll listen to you.

34
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,080
What about me?

35
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,560
I've said so much.

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,280
You're right.

37
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,880
You chose your own path

38
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,120
before you said it.

39
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,800
You'll end up kneeling down.

40
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,920
Don't worry, Dad.

41
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,360
Let's just leave it at that.

42
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,400
I heard that Mr. Dong

43
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,680
is in our clinic.

44
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,480
You know that

45
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,520
my neck and waist

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,400
are old.

47
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,880
Please help me introduce him.

48
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,920
This is my duty.

49
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,920
I'll take you there now.

50
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,560
Great.

51
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,880
This child is so good-looking.

52
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,520
Yes.

53
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,120
He's a bit like you.

54
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,800
I can't help it.

55
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,800
You're wearing so many clothes.

56
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Aren't you hot?

57
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
This...

58
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
This is so...

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,800
What are you talking about?

60
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
You little brat.

61
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,800
You're so naughty.

62
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
This...

63
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
This...

64
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Help me!

65
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Help me!

66
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Help me!

67
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Help me!

68
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Dad!

69
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Dad!

70
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
My child!

71
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Dad!

72
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Dad!

73
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Dad!

74
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Dad!

75
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Dad!

76
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
My child.

77
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
You're going to break your waist.

78
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,000
My child.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,880
You're going to give birth.

80
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,240
Wait a minute. Relax first.

81
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,840
Come on.

82
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,440
Relax.

83
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,520
Listen to me.

84
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,200
If you listen to me, it's okay to have me.

85
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,400
It's you.

86
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,000
Right?

87
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,000
I can't leave.

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,440
I can't leave you alone.

89
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,800
Don't touch me.

90
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,520
I don't care about you.

91
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,640
You look so handsome.

92
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,840
I take care of you so carefully every day.

93
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,240
Why do you look like this?

94
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,920
Did you see my phone?

95
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,080
What?

96
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,920
Phone.

97
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,520
I didn't see it.

98
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,400
Master.

99
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,240
What's wrong?

100
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
Jianxi is here.

101
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,960
It's no use scolding me now.

102
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,880
Do you know?

103
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,480
The most important thing is the child.

104
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,920
You heard that I'm a child.

105
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,240
You saved me.

106
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,560
I'm a doctor.

107
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,960
You're a doctor.

108
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,760
Oh my god.

109
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,280
I won't die here, will I?

110
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,880
No.

111
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,640
You just give birth.

112
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,320
We're three people.

113
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,680
It's not easy to give birth to you.

114
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,000
Don't be excited now.

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,960
You have to keep your strength.

116
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,760
Do you hear me?

117
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,880
You have to keep your strength to give birth.

118
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,560
Okay?

119
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,520
I'll call an ambulance to save you.

120
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:12,880
Okay?

121
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,520
You hold on.

122
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,440
Do you hear me?

123
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,720
You...

124
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,680
You can't save me now.

125
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,920
If you fall into the water,

126
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,960
I'll die.

127
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,200
I can't die.

128
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,240
Peipei won't die.

129
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,040
You hold on.

130
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,400
Hello?

131
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,480
Hello, is this 208?

132
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,120
I'm on the road

133
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,440
to the forest.

134
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,760
There's a...

135
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,360
There's a baby coming.

136
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,680
Can you come here now?

137
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,680
Don't go.

138
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,640
Don't go.

139
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
You save my baby.

140
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,400
I won't go.

141
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,440
You save my baby.

142
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,000
Wait a minute.

143
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,160
I'll find a landmark.

144
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,840
Hello?

145
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,880
I don't have a landmark here.

146
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,920
Can you come here now?

147
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,120
I'm in a hurry.

148
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,080
Okay.

149
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,760
What's wrong?

150
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,240
I feel...

151
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,080
I feel...

152
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,680
I feel like I'm going to fall.

153
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,320
Wait.

154
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,200
Sit here.

155
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,080
Relax.

156
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,080
Take a deep breath.

157
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,080
Take a deep breath.

158
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,000
Don't worry. I'm here.

159
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,720
Cheng Hui.

160
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,960
You can't leave, Cheng Hui.

161
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,360
Take a deep breath.

162
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm here.

163
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,760
You can't leave.

164
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,680
Jingxi.

165
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,480
Why are you so thin?

166
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,800
Didn't you take the medicine

167
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,000
you gave me last time?

168
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,200
I did.

169
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,280
It didn't work at all.

170
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,800
She eats less and less now.

171
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,720
She can't eat anything recently.

172
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,600
Did her injury

173
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,080
cause anything else?

174
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,800
Which way is the best way?

175
00:07:49,680 --> 00:08:15,480
The vent

176
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,760
You believe Professor Ren? If he says it's not a big problem,

177
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,160
then nothing will happen.

178
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,160
Let's go out first, okay?

179
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,360
And you will be nervous here.

180
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,760
Come.

181
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,160
Come.

182
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,760
Come.

183
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,560
I'm calling you.

184
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,760
It's okay.

185
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,160
It's okay. You answer the phone.

186
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,960
My phone is running out of battery.

187
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,760
Where's your phone? Give it to me.

188
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,960
Don't touch me. Let me go.

189
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,960
Let go of my child.

190
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,560
Let go of me.

191
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,160
Help me.

192
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,960
I can't see anything.

193
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,160
What time is it?

194
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,360
No, it's 40 minutes.

195
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
One hour.

196
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,560
40 minutes.

197
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,360
40 minutes.

198
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
And I called the village doctor here.

199
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,560
It's okay. It will be there soon.

200
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
But I will die if I die.

201
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,560
No.

202
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,360
My child will die too.

203
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,960
We will all die here.

204
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,160
It's okay.

205
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,960
I won't die. I will go home.

206
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,360
I will die.

207
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,960
You will die if you die.

208
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,760
If I die,

209
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,960
I will be called Kong Tianyuan.

210
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,160
If I am a girl, I will be called Kong Ai Yuan.

211
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,560
Do you remember?

212
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,160
I know. I know.

213
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,560
You will be fine, Cheng Hui.

214
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
Jiang Cheng Feng.

215
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,160
Don't go.

216
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
When will you go?

217
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,560
My child will die.

218
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,360
Why?

219
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,360
Why can't you hear me?

220
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,960
You must cherish your time here.

221
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,160
Don't meet patients

222
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,960
or accidents.

223
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,560
But regret will regret.

224
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,160
You didn't learn the skill here.

225
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
I am a devil. Look at me, Cheng Hui.

226
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,160
I am a devil.

227
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,960
So you must hold on.

228
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,160
You can't let me go.

229
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,960
Do you know?

230
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,160
You must live well.

231
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,960
Do you understand?

232
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,560
Mom.

233
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,360
Cheng Hui.

234
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Help me.

235
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,560
I beg you.

236
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,160
Cheng Hui, wake up.

237
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
Cheng Hui, hold on.

238
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,960
Cheng Hui.

239
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,560
Cheng Hui.

240
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,760
Cheng Hui.

241
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
Cheng Hui.

242
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,360
Cheng Hui.

243
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,160
Your pulse is weak,

244
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,360
but not a big problem.

245
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,760
Tell me the truth.

246
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,760
I can't get better, right?

247
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,760
You've been lying to me, right?

248
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,760
I'm sorry.

249
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,760
Chen Hui, listen to me.

250
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
The ambulance is on its way.

251
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,760
But we can't wait.

252
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,760
I'll help you.

253
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,760
Okay?

254
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
As long as you do as I say,

255
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,760
we'll come together.

256
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,760
You and the baby will be fine.

257
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,760
Okay?

258
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,760
Believe me.

259
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
Save my baby first.

260
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
My baby.

261
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,760
Your baby's not in good health.

262
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,760
It's not that he has a headache.

263
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,760
What should we do?

264
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,760
Save my baby first.

265
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,760
You have to save my baby first.

266
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,760
I have to put my hand in first.

267
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,760
Then turn the baby's head

268
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,760
around.

269
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
It's okay.

270
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,760
I'll help you.

271
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
I'll help you.

272
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,760
I'll help you.

273
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,760
I'll help you.

274
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,760
It's okay.

275
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,760
It's okay.

276
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
Okay?

277
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
Believe me.

278
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,760
It's okay.

279
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,760
Wait.

280
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,760
I'm about to touch the baby's head.

281
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,760
I touched it.

282
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,760
Hold on, Chen Hui.

283
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,760
Hold on.

284
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
Can you see my hand?

285
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,760
You're going to be okay.

286
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
It's almost done.

287
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,760
Chen Hui,

288
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,760
listen to my order.

289
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
If I say one, two, three,

290
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,760
you have to do your best.

291
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
Do your best.

292
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,760
One, two, three.

293
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
Do your best.

294
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,760
Wait a minute.

295
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

296
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

297
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,760
We'll be done soon.

298
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,760
Chen Hui, you have to hold on.

299
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
Let's try again.

300
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Okay?

301
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,760
One, two, three.

302
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,760
Do your best.

303
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

304
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,760
Do your best.

305
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

306
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,760
Do your best.

307
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

308
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,760
Do your best.

309
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

310
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

311
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

312
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

313
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

314
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

315
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

316
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

317
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

318
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

319
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

320
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

321
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

322
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

323
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

324
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

325
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Chen Hui, you can do it.

326
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,760
Jian Xi, I can tell you the truth.

327
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,760
I didn't touch your medical record before.

328
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,760
But it's recorded in the ancient books.

329
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,760
It's also recorded in my master's secret record.

330
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,760
If it's about Chinese medicine,

331
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
experience medicine,

332
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,760
it means that there was a cure before.

333
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,760
But it's not.

334
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
If you're sick,

335
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:54,760
it means that there was a record of curing the disease before.

336
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,760
You're so sick.

337
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,760
You need time to recover.

338
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,760
Look, we're all caring about you and supporting you.

339
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,760
Your mother didn't give up on any treatment for you.

340
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,760
If you give up on it,

341
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,760
you'll really be hopeless.

342
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
The records

343
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,760
are all about curing the disease

344
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,760
and saving people in the ancient way.

345
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,760
A letter

346
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
tells me that

347
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
the ancient books don't deceive people.

348
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
You,

349
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,760
give me some time

350
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,760
and give yourself some time.

351
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,760
Let's work together.

352
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,760
How about it?

353
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
What if it doesn't work?

354
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,760
What if we can't find the net?

355
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,760
What if it's still useless?

356
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,760
Then I'll be trapped in the wheelchair forever.

357
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
Jianxi, you need to know

358
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,760
that you're not the only one who's sick.

359
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
And your mother,

360
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
Professor Song,

361
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
and me.

362
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,760
If we succeed after trying,

363
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,760
then we'll all

364
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
have more strength in our hearts.

365
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,760
If you don't try,

366
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
you'll give up.

367
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,760
It's a pity.

368
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,760
What if it doesn't work?

369
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
What if it doesn't work?

370
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,760
What if it doesn't work?

371
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,760
I won't stop you

372
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
from doing whatever you want.

373
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,760
Okay.

374
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
This is the last time.

375
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
If it doesn't work,

376
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,760
then you won't stop me from doing whatever you want.

377
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Okay.

378
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,760
This son...

379
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
is enough.

380
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
Thank you.

381
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,760
Thank you.

382
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Is enough.

383
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
Thank you.

384
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,760
Chen Hui.

385
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,760
Chen Hui, hang in there.

386
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,760
You can't sleep, Chen Hui.

387
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,760
Chen Hui.

388
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,760
Hang in there.

389
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,760
Is anyone here? Where are you?

390
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,760
Anyone?

391
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,760
Anyone?

392
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,760
Here!

393
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,760
Here!

394
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,760
Here!

395
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,760
Chen Hui, are you okay?

396
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,760
Here.

397
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,760
Here.

398
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,760
Yes.

399
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
Professor Ren,

400
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
you're right.

401
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
As long as we believe,

402
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
we can definitely create a miracle.

403
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,760
A few days ago,

404
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
I saw a news report on TV.

405
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,760
It said that a patient with a high blood sugar

406
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,760
was picked up by a hand massage.

407
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
Jian Xi,

408
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
you have to believe in me

409
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,760
and Professor Ren.

410
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,760
There are so many ways

411
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
in this world,

412
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,760
right?

413
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,760
Even if this trick doesn't work,

414
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
we're not afraid.

415
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
As long as there's a little...

416
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
As long as there's a little possibility,

417
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,760
I'll do my best.

418
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
You'll definitely stand up.

419
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,760
Professor Ren.

420
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
Professor Ren, come on.

421
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,760
Hurry up.

422
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
It's Mr. Yang.

423
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
What's the matter?

424
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
He called me many times.

425
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,760
Hello?

426
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,760
Hello?

427
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
Master.

428
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Master, I've learned.

429
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,760
What?

430
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
I've learned, Master.

431
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
I've learned, Master.

432
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,760
Thank you.

433
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,760
Jian Xi.

434
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,760
I hope

435
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
you can be as confident as us.

436
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,760
Let's work together

437
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,760
to fight against the disease.

438
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,760
We can't let him beat us.

439
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,760
The End

440
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,760
You said Mr. Yang and Chen Hui

441
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
have a good relationship.

442
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
By the way,

443
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
today, Yang Xiao Hong

444
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,760
is in the operation of the cable.

445
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
You should tell him.

446
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,760
After they arrived at the hospital,

447
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,760
they called me.

448
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
I've already told them.

449
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
No professional person

450
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,760
is allowed to do medical operations.

451
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
It's an accident,

452
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,760
but there's no next time.

453
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,760
There's no second time in this life.

454
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
Life is a miracle.

455
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,760
Do you donate this book?

456
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,760
Yes.

457
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
This...

458
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
This...

459
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,760
I bought it for money.

460
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
It's rare.

461
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,760
Can't you give it to your grandson?

462
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,760
The more you study, the more you lose.

463
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,760
I'm a teacher now.

464
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,760
I have to lose.

465
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
I donate these books

466
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,760
to my classmates who study hard.

467
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,760
How great is that?

468
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,760
Yes.

469
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,760
Then why

470
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,760
do you always lose and I increase?

471
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,760
When you donate,

472
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,760
I help you clean up.

473
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
When you were studying,

474
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
I helped you

475
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,760
move things back

476
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
and clean up for you.

477
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,760
So

478
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,760
the biggest shadow in the world is a couple.

479
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
When I get married,

480
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
I'll take you to heaven.

481
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
You think I'm a chicken?

482
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,760
You're not a chicken.

483
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,760
You're not obedient.

484
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,760
You're different from them.

485
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
I listen to you.

486
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,760
Get out.

487
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
I'm busy.

488
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
What's wrong?

489
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
My arm is broken.

490
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
Stop pretending.

491
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
Enough.

492
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,760
Don't be so greedy.

493
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,760
That's life.

494
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,760
Spring comes and goes.

495
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,760
That's the rule.

496
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,760
If you say so,

497
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
there's no one to work.

498
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Do you know

499
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,760
how many things

500
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,760
Chunjie has to do?

501
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,760
Clean up and clean up.

502
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,760
Two or three days.

503
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,760
Three or five days of pre-purchase.

504
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,760
A gift from relatives.

505
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,760
Money for the child's pressure.

506
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,760
The teacher and friend have to walk.

507
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,760
By the way,

508
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,760
this year is the Spring Festival.

509
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
What are you going to do

510
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
with the two children at home?

511
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
Your son said

512
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,760
Mengmeng's parents

513
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,760
are going to pick her up.

514
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,760
I remember going abroad.

515
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,760
I visited the museum and the playground.

516
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,760
Toto

517
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,760
has no parents and no family.

518
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,760
So the teacher

519
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,760
is his family.

520
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,760
Let's take Toto

521
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,760
as our second child.

522
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,760
The problem is I can't be the second child.

523
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,760
Toto has been performing well recently.

524
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,760
He made trouble for you before.

525
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,760
Now he has to help you work.

526
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,760
Yes, I admit.

527
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,760
He has made great progress recently.

528
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,760
But he used to make too many points.

529
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,760
No matter how much he has improved,

530
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,760
he hasn't come to his senses.

531
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,760
You are the one.

532
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,760
You are the family in the world.

533
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,760
I don't have

534
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
your kind of thinking.

535
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,760
I'm all alone.

536
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,760
I work alone.

537
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,760
I really want to

538
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,760
take care of everything one day.

539
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
I relax.

540
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,760
I can take a vacation and have a rest.

541
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,760
OK.

542
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
You can take a vacation this spring.

543
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,760
I'll arrange it.

544
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,760
You?

545
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
That's it.

546
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,760
Where does the sun shine?

547
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,200
Mom, don't move.

548
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,240
Mom, don't move.

549
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,640
Mom, don't move.

550
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,560
Don't move.

551
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,600
Don't move.

552
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,560
Don't move, stand there.

553
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,000
Linlan,

554
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,440
why did you fall down?

555
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,040
It's okay.

556
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,120
Mom, I'll do it for you.

557
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,280
Be careful.

558
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:38,480
Be careful.

559
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,760
The stairs are covered with water.

560
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,040
Come on, be careful.

561
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,760
Easy.

562
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,520
Are you okay?

563
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,080
Move a little.

564
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,000
My butt hurts.

565
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,400
It's okay.

566
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,680
It's okay.

567
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,920
It's a good thing that I work out every day.

568
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,720
I'm here to protect her.

569
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,360
You're making Xin Zheng

570
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
do the work.

571
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,400
I'm not.

572
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,920
You're making trouble for yourself.

573
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,400
Xin Zheng, stop working.

574
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,880
Sit in the study.

575
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,320
No, no, no.

576
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:05,800
Mom,

577
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,600
she rarely

578
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,200
does housework so self-willed.

579
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,360
Mr. Zhang,

580
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,200
do your best.

581
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,200
If you can

582
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,080
do housework

583
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,320
without any problems,

584
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:14,760
I'll even

585
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,400
do more self-study.

586
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,600
You're already doing it.

587
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,560
Stop talking.

588
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,320
I'm really fine.

589
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:19,560
I'm just...

590
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,720
Stop talking nonsense.

591
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,240
By the way,

592
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,080
there's a

593
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,360
mop in the yard.

594
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:25,840
Did you see it?

595
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,480
Yes, yes.

596
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,080
Over there.

597
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,880
Yes.

598
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,680
You have to put this mop

599
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,040
on the mop

600
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,280
and press it.

601
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,400
Drain the water.

602
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:33,920
Yes, yes.

603
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,800
Then mop it.

604
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,280
You're really fine.

605
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,400
I'm really fine.

606
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,040
Look.

607
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,760
Look.

608
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,240
It's jumping.

609
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:40,960
Don't move.

610
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,880
I'm really fine.

611
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,200
Thank you.

612
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,640
I

613
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,680
went to the Du Fu grass farm.

614
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,800
The Du Fu shoes

615
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,840
were out of the

616
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,640
sun in August.

617
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,040
I was hiding in the

618
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,160
shed and writing poems.

619
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,760
His wife

620
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,960
added a wooden stick

621
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,200
to the roof

622
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,360
to press the grass.

623
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,840
It can be seen that

624
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,640
the amazing achievements in history

625
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,840
were created by people who didn't work.

626
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,000
Now,

627
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,880
the history

628
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,000
is amazing.

629
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,440
My big disciple,

630
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,880
you were born with a lot of talent.

631
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,880
It's not for

632
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,520
the small use of land.

633
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,440
What's wrong?

634
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,400
Who made this for me?

635
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,320
What's wrong, mom?

636
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:24,920
I...

637
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,320
I have two fillings.

638
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,760
Why are they mixed together?

639
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,360
What's wrong, mom?

640
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:30,880
This...

641
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,560
You did it, right?

642
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,520
Mom, it's me.

643
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,320
Mom, it's like this.

644
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,520
When I entered the kitchen,

645
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,480
I saw that it was messy

646
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,800
and messy.

647
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,240
I mixed it together.

648
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,720
You know what?

649
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,520
I'm naive and don't eat shrimp.

650
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,360
I have to make two different fillings

651
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,560
of dumplings.

652
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,320
Mom,

653
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,800
she's not allergic to shrimp.

654
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,240
I think it's good.

655
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,960
Look, the pot...

656
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,560
It's good.

657
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,720
I made it this morning.

658
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,040
It's not easy to make it good.

659
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,160
It's good for men to cook for women.

660
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,840
I have to make her

661
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,960
do these chores.

662
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,240
Xing Zheng,

663
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,240
go read the book.

664
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,840
You,

665
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,640
go do the chores.

666
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,040
Yes.

667
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,640
Mom, don't go up.

668
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,360
Go, go, go.

669
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:15,840
Go, go.

670
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,520
Give me the gloves.

671
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,120
Give me the gloves.

672
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,640
Go.

673
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,360
Give me the gloves.

674
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,040
Give me the gloves.

675
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,640
What should I do?

676
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm wiping things.

677
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,520
Don't be so self-conscious.

678
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,560
Why are you sighing?

679
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,240
Did you fall off your chest?

680
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,640
Let me show you.

681
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,760
It's fine.

682
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,280
It's fine.

683
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:49,800
It's useless.

684
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,440
If you don't want to do it,

685
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,040
I'll do it.

686
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,560
You can stay by the factory

687
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,160
and teach me.

688
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,360
Don't.

689
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,840
Your husband is so active.

690
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,760
Our family

691
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,080
is very active.

692
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,560
Then wait until

693
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,800
Tian Zhen and Teng Teng come back

694
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,720
and let me teach you.

695
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,520
I'll teach you.

696
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,240
I'll teach you.

697
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,080
I'll teach you.

698
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,880
I'll teach you.

699
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,480
Let them do it.

700
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,280
The masters are studying.

701
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,760
They can't be disturbed.

702
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,520
Look.

703
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,320
She's sighing again.

704
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,120
No wonder

705
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,000
a gentleman knows

706
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,440
to make a good husband.

707
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,040
Are you going to say a gold-digger?

708
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,760
Look.

709
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,760
This person

710
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,600
is either a monk

711
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,520
or a monk.

712
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,080
Especially women.

713
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,760
Look.

714
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,360
Marriage

715
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,720
and marriage

716
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,840
are all female.

717
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,800
Right?

718
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,800
Tell me.

719
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,680
What do you mean?

720
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,400
I mean

721
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,400
I can

722
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,880
be a good host

723
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,880
and a good intern.

724
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,040
If such an excellent person

725
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,880
doesn't give me a marriage

726
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,840
and raises my level of being a monster,

727
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,000
then

728
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,560
I'll graduate

729
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,680
very early.

730
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,400
No.

731
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,520
It's not interesting.

732
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,080
So

733
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,200
I have you

734
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,640
and my son.

735
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,720
I can't bear to let go

736
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,120
and be angry.

737
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,440
Look.

738
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,840
In order to make me improve,

739
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,920
God has done a lot for me.

740
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,520
Did you mean

741
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,680
you'll make a forecast

742
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,240
and come here to settle all this?

743
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,640
Look.

744
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,920
I'll bring the couple

745
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,200
to our colleague,

746
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,160
and let them know

747
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,200
you're clearly

748
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,880
here.

749
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,320
You've made up your mind.

750
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,520
I and my son

751
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,720
have already bothered you.

752
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,720
Now clean your house.

753
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,040
Cleaning it once a year

754
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,240
and once a day

755
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,200
doesn't make a big difference.

756
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,200
I can't see you like that.

757
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,760
I can't.

758
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,880
I don't have your level.

759
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,560
You can sleep with your socks on.

760
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,640
I want to interview you.

761
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,080
How did you do it?

762
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,600
You were so calm when you sat down.

763
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,880
I was so calm when I sat down.

764
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,400
Look.

765
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,600
Rice and oil salt.

766
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,320
Then, the kitchen inspection.

767
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,560
Then, the old and the young.

768
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,400
Eat and wear.

769
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,920
I wonder sometimes.

770
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,320
How can a person's heart

771
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,920
contain so many things?

772
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,480
It's amazing.

773
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,640
When a person is dead, he lies there.

774
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,440
He doesn't think about anything.

775
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,560
Can you talk to me?

776
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,400
If you say so,

777
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,720
my only hope is to die.

778
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,120
Gou De.

779
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,520
I'm here.

780
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,560
Tiantian.

781
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,000
New year's gift.

782
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,400
Your dad bought it.

783
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,960
I know.

784
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:12,960
Gou.

785
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,800
Come.

786
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,880
See what you got.

787
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,760
If your dad buys it,

788
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,760
will you double it?

789
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,440
Of course.

790
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,480
Let me do it.

791
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,280
Gou.

792
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,480
Is that enough?

793
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,080
I think so.

794
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,280
You can go to the supermarket to see us.

795
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,080
Okay.

796
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,520
I'll report to my mom.

797
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,440
I'll clean up here.

798
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,360
Then, I'll clean the study.

799
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,840
Then, we'll go together.

800
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,080
I'm leaving. Hurry up.

801
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,160
Why do you buy it?

802
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,240
To see my mom.

803
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,720
I vaig variables by my own eye.

804
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,000
I don't understand.

805
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,560
I'm not lying.

806
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,560
In this notebook,

807
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,160
it's not a starting point or a ending point.

808
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,960
It's just a bookmark.

809
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,160
Why did you lie to them?

810
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,760
You two are already poor.

811
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,960
God knows the true meaning of a man.

812
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,960
The one who knows the truth knows the truth.

813
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,760
Isn't that what you said?

814
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,560
People can't lie.

815
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,360
People who study Chinese medicine can't lie.

816
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,760
Isn't that what you said?

817
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,360
Fine, come to your place.

818
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,360
I'm done.

819
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,960
Why?

820
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,360
Tell me.

821
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,360
Why?

822
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,960
Why did you lie to Jianxi?

823
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,160
I'm so anxious.

824
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,560
Why didn't you tell me?

825
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,160
Old Tou.

826
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,560
What is a doctor?

827
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,160
The most important thing about a doctor is

828
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,760
the heart.

829
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,760
God has the virtue of good life.

830
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,560
God is the only one

831
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,360
who will not punish me

832
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,960
for my unforeseen actions.

833
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,960
If he really punishes me,

834
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:22,960
I think

835
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,360
he can help Jianxi

836
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,560
and his mother and Chengying

837
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,960
to get away from this.

838
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,960
I agree.

839
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,560
Actually, I lied

840
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,560
not only for one person,

841
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,360
but for the whole life of a group of people.

842
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,160
The whole life.

843
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,760
A doctor.

844
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,760
They call me a doctor.

845
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
I should

846
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,160
do something for them, right?

847
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,560
Not to mention that

848
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,960
they paid the medical fees.

849
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,560
I didn't pay the medical fees.

850
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,560
You paid the wages.

851
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,960
Most people paid.

852
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,360
Jianxi's mother

853
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,960
is still working.

854
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,560
I didn't tell you this.

855
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,760
I mean why did you lie to them?

856
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,560
Old Tou.

857
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,160
Do you know how important Jianxi is now?

858
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,160
I don't know.

859
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,960
She's getting thinner and thinner.

860
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,360
I guess she's not over 80.

861
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,560
She can't move her legs now.

862
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,560
She's fine in other places.

863
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,160
If I tell her

864
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,560
that you're not well,

865
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,160
I'm sure

866
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,960
she doesn't want to live.

867
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,960
If she doesn't want to live,

868
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,360
her mother will also not want to live.

869
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,560
How will Chenyin live her life?

870
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,560
That's what she said.

871
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,360
I can't keep lying to her, right?

872
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,360
Sometimes I keep thinking

873
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,960
about the purpose of life.

874
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,160
How many offices

875
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,760
can we provide to patients?

876
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,560
Sometimes people lack faith.

877
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,160
With this faith,

878
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,960
everything should be fine.

879
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,960
I'm thinking

880
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,160
that I'm a good doctor.

881
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,960
I must follow that direction.

882
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,560
If I say you're a good doctor,

883
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,760
you don't believe me.

884
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,560
You definitely won't go that way.

885
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,560
Now technology is changing day and night.

886
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,360
Maybe in a year or two,

887
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,360
there will be a change.

888
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,360
You don't know.

889
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,360
I'm just thinking.

890
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,560
A chip

891
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,160
enters the brain.

892
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,160
If it can

893
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,760
move four branches,

894
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,360
it's good to live.

895
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,160
Are you a doctor or a western doctor?

896
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,760
Why are you a chip?

897
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,960
Why are you a scientist?

898
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,760
No matter if you're a doctor or a western doctor,

899
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,160
you should have faith.

900
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,160
No matter what power you have,

901
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,960
as long as you can help people,

902
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,160
you should do everything for me.

903
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,360
Respect the world and love people.

904
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,160
I see.

905
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,360
You know that

906
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,560
he should do it.

907
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,560
Can you do it

908
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,360
before I explain to them?

909
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,560
Well,

910
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,160
you're really making it hard for me.

911
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,360
You don't know how to do it.

912
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:27,960
How can I...

913
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,360
No, no, no.

914
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,560
I...

915
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,160
I...

916
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:33,960
I...

917
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,160
I can't do it.

918
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,160
There's only one way.

919
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,360
There's only one way.

920
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,360
You can put a dollar

921
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,760
in my wallet.

922
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,360
A dollar.

923
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,360
I'll...

924
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,960
What do you mean?

925
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,360
Why did you put a dollar in my wallet?

926
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,360
I won't say it.

927
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,360
I won't say it.

928
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,360
Do you trust me?

929
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,360
Do you trust me?

930
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,160
It's so lively.

931
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,160
What are you doing?

932
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
I'm going to the market.

933
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,160
What's wrong with you today?

934
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,360
Why are you so worried?

935
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,960
You don't look like yourself

936
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,760
when you go shopping.

937
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,560
You don't look like yourself.

938
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,160
From today on,

939
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,360
I'm not a pure person.

940
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,760
I'm starting to have something on my mind.

941
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,760
What are you singing again?

942
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,360
Why are you looking at

943
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,760
the drama?

944
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,160
What's on your mind?

945
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,760
Tell me.

946
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,760
I can't tell you.

947
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,960
I promised your father.

948
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,360
I won't tell him even if I die.

949
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,160
Okay.

950
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,160
Okay.

951
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,960
Why don't you ask more?

952
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,960
If you don't want to ask, just ask.

953
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,960
Let me put it this way.

954
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,960
I don't want to participate

955
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,760
in the game between you and the inheritance.

956
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,760
People are too much known.

957
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,560
So,

958
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,760
I don't want to know that much.

959
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,960
So,

960
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,960
you can't be the heir.

961
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,360
You have to wait for me.

962
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,760
I'll take care of this.

963
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,960
You're so deep in the game.

964
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,560
Oh, right.

965
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,560
I just remembered.

966
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,960
You said you wanted to go to

967
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,360
the Dragon Boat Pond, right?

968
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,360
I heard that

969
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,360
it's getting dark.

970
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:19,960
You can't go there.

971
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,560
You have to change your place.

972
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:20,960
No.

973
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,560
It's because of this situation

974
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,560
that I went there.

975
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,360
Your Highness.

976
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,360
We are in the sunset

977
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:24,360
This youth is getting more complete

978
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:30,360
Missing you is happening

979
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:37,360
There are always people who are waiting for you to cross the mountain and the river

980
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:42,360
To look back at the years and the stars

981
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:48,360
I'm sure that you are that person

982
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:54,360
I admit that I'm not as pure as I thought

983
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:59,360
I'm already trapped in your eyes

984
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:09,360
The fate of the dream just now is waiting for me

985
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:16,360
There are always people who are waiting for you to cross the mountain and the river

986
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,360
To look back at the years and the stars

987
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:27,360
I'm sure that you are that person

988
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:33,360
I admit that I'm not as pure as I thought

989
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,360
I'm already trapped in your eyes

990
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:47,360
The fate of the dream just now is waiting for me
