00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,240
This is the prescription for the epidemic.

4
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
I asked my dad.

5
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,360
He said that if we fry the glutinous rice into the main porridge of the word Jiao,

6
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,640
it can remove the wetness of the lentils and help with the disease.

7
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,280
I'll sort it out

8
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,000
and send it out as a public article.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Long Ballad

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,240
I said I'm not a new official.

11
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,240
You're much more serious than a new official.

12
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,280
Drink the medicine.

13
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,360
Thank you, Madam.

14
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,680
Now,

15
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:41,400
we should

16
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,600
have dinner first.

17
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,000
Slowly, slowly.

18
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,920
Slowly.

19
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,120
It's enough.

20
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:56,960
Okay.

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,720
Most patients don't understand this kind of treatment.

22
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,400
After all, a family has to be separated into several parts.

23
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,000
They will still worry about each other.

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,200
Special equipment. Special treatment.

25
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,200
Look at our family. Isn't it the same?

26
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,160
It just hurts.

27
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,200
Does it hurt?

28
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,240
Don't move.

29
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,880
If you are upset andition in public areas,

30
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,920
you will be that old and dosy, too.

31
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,760
It's okay.

32
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,680
Half a lifetime later

33
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,520
you are here.

34
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,080
Who is supposed to have the courage to say that?

35
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
I know.

36
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,160
You don't want her,

37
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,660
you don't want her to leftover me.

38
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,900
Don't you want to leave me?

39
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,660
Have a good rest.

40
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,780
I've written down the medical record today.

41
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,780
Send it to my dad.

42
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,500
Still angry with me?

43
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,300
Why?

44
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,540
What's so angry about?

45
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,060
I'm angry

46
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,660
because I'm not angry.

47
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,940
You're punishing yourself

48
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,940
for others' mistakes.

49
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,060
You're not worth it.

50
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,180
If you're really not angry,

51
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,860
come on.

52
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,060
Sit by my side.

53
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,740
Professor Ren,

54
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,180
please be self-pitying.

55
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,660
Sit on me.

56
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,700
Sit on your pedals.

57
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,300
Sorry, sorry.

58
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:56,980
Sit on your pedals.

59
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,260
Don't holler.

60
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,460
No, I'm not.

61
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,260
I don't want

62
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,540
to bother you.

63
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,660
It's so cold.

64
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,660
I know

65
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,660
that I'm the most important person

66
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,660
in your heart.

67
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,660
Otherwise,

68
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,660
how could you

69
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,660
climb up to the dead old man

70
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,660
and hold your son

71
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,660
in danger

72
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,660
and come to me?

73
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,660
You're thinking too much.

74
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,660
I'm a doctor too.

75
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,660
I should be here

76
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,660
to share my thoughts.

77
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,660
Li Xiao,

78
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,660
I can't say it.

79
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,660
I'm thinking too much.

80
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,660
I'm giving you

81
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,660
my personal dedication to Chinese medicine

82
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,660
and my personal care

83
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,660
to the patients.

84
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,660
It has nothing to do with personal feelings.

85
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,660
I'm leaving.

86
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,660
It seems that

87
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,660
you really don't have me in your heart.

88
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,660
I'm not the one who should be worried about you.

89
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,660
I'm just worried about you.

90
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,660
Did you see

91
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,660
the old man?

92
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,660
Yes.

93
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,660
He was not there.

94
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,660
He was sent to the hospital.

95
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,660
No.

96
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,660
He was in critical condition.

97
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,660
This time,

98
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,660
he can't come back

99
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,660
and he'll get an egg.

100
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,660
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,660
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,660
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,660
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,660
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,660
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,660
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,660
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,660
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,660
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,660
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,660
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,660
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,660
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,660
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,660
Boss Du.

116
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,660
I remember.

117
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,660
You said

118
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,660
a word to me.

119
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,660
You said...

120
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,660
How beautiful it is.

121
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,660
I just don't know

122
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,660
if it's the last time

123
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,660
I see you.

124
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
Who knows?

125
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
Who knows?

126
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,660
But

127
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,660
it's the last time.

128
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,660
We have to

129
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,660
love each other

130
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,660
and be happy

131
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,660
in our hearts.

132
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,660
Love each other.

133
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,660
Love each other.

134
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,660
Love each other.

135
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,660
Love each other.

136
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,660
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,660
I'm sorry.

138
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,660
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,660
I'm sorry.

140
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,660
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,660
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,660
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,660
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,660
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,660
I'm sorry.

146
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,660
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,660
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,660
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,660
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,660
I'm sorry.

151
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,660
Zhao Liqiong.

152
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,660
Guess where I am.

153
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,660
Where are you?

154
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,660
This is

155
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,660
the hospital in Wuhan.

156
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,660
The hospital in the Xie'er Putong ward.

157
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,660
The nurse in Class A, Tian Xixing.

158
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,660
You came to Wuhan?

159
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,660
It's my job to cure and save people.

160
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,660
Wuhan is in danger now.

161
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,660
You don't know?

162
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,660
Why can't I come

163
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,660
if you can?

164
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,660
Right?

165
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,660
Besides,

166
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,660
I feel closer to you.

167
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,660
By the way,

168
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,660
you left in a hurry last time.

169
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,660
I didn't have time to tell you.

170
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,660
Go ahead.

171
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,660
Protect yourself there.

172
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,660
Let's go back together.

173
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,660
You too.

174
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,660
Take care of the housework.

175
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,660
I'll take you back.

176
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,660
I'll take you back.

177
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,660
The moon in the sky

178
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,660
is the best gift for this world.

179
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,660
The lovers are willing to stay up late

180
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,660
to enjoy their love.

181
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,660
Tianzhen.

182
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,660
This is the poem you taught me.

183
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,660
You said

184
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,660
this is the most beautiful poem

185
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,660
you've ever learned

186
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,660
about the power of writing lovesickness.

187
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,660
You even asked me

188
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,660
if there was a famous writer in Japan

189
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,660
who expressed his feelings through music.

190
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,660
I asked you for a long time,

191
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,660
but you refused to tell me

192
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,660
what that was.

193
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,660
Now I know

194
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,660
how beautiful the moon is tonight.

195
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,660
Have you eaten today?

196
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,660
Are you hungry?

197
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,660
The food is good,

198
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,660
but I can't eat it.

199
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,660
Here.

200
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,660
It looks good when you eat it.

201
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,660
Is it bitter?

202
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,660
It's not bitter.

203
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,660
It's just a little bit bitter.

204
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,660
It's not bitter.

205
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,660
Is it bitter?

206
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,660
It's nothing.

207
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,660
It's just guilt.

208
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,660
What is guilt?

209
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,660
I see you all

210
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,660
fighting on the front lines.

211
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,660
I'm like a loser.

212
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,660
I can't do anything.

213
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,660
All right, just say a few words.

214
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,660
I'll give you

215
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,660
another cup of Chinese medicine.

216
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,660
I think you're still short of steam.

217
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,660
I can't do anything.

218
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,660
I eat and drink for nothing.

219
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,660
I feel guilty.

220
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,660
Don't feel guilty all the time.

221
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,660
It's not good for your health.

222
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,660
By the way,

223
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,660
Tianzhen said

224
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,660
you haven't contacted Toto for a long time.

225
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,660
Toto has been asking

226
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,660
for Wu Shandao's treatment plan.

227
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,660
I didn't contact him on purpose.

228
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,660
You haven't told him yet

229
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,660
that you're sick.

230
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,660
No.

231
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,660
You don't know his character.

232
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,660
If he knows that I'm sick,

233
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,660
he'll run to Wuhan

234
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,660
without any trouble.

235
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,660
He doesn't care about his son,

236
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,660
his wife,

237
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,660
or his parents.

238
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,660
He cares about

239
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,660
this little girl the most.

240
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,660
She's a real daughter.

241
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,660
She's the only one in the family.

242
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,660
You know what?

243
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,660
I don't need a father.

244
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,660
What's wrong?

245
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,660
Happy 38th.

246
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,660
You're 38 years old!

247
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,660
I think

248
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,660
you're nearly recovered.

249
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,660
I've never seen you

250
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,660
I'm here to see you.

251
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,020
My patient

252
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,660
is getting better.

253
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,020
Now,

254
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,140
he's a full-time volunteer.

255
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,260
He came to see me.

256
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,020
What do I want?

257
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,460
I asked him

258
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,500
if he had any roses.

259
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,660
He gave me one.

260
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,260
Put the flowers

261
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,420
here.

262
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,740
It'll make you angry.

263
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,260
It's pretty.

264
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,020
If it's pretty,

265
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,260
don't leave.

266
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,580
Let's enjoy the flowers together.

267
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,700
If you think

268
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,420
only one rose

269
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,060
can buy me,

270
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,700
reflect on your mistakes,

271
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,660
I'll tell you

272
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,380
I won't forgive you.

273
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,860
She's not my daughter.

274
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,980
I'm talking to you.

275
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,500
She's not my daughter.

276
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,980
Forget it.

277
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,740
Don't stop.

278
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,780
You can talk to me.

279
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,860
I don't want to talk to you.

280
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,020
Say it again.

281
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,260
Who do you want to talk to?

282
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,780
You stop me.

283
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:10,900
How many times

284
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,740
do I have to tell you

285
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,460
I don't want to talk to you?

286
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,540
I don't want

287
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,260
to

288
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,500
let you

289
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,420
go.

290
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,620
I know

291
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,260
No.

292
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,100
You evencoins me.

293
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,540
If you were under my trust,

294
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,140
would you test me

295
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,540
with such a thing of yours?

296
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,180
Today,

297
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,340
we'll make it clear.

298
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:02,740
Who is secret

299
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,740
She didn't tell me.

300
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,740
She just told me

301
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,740
that she brought back this girl

302
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,740
as the descendant of the Jiang's Zhen Sect.

303
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,740
But didn't Zhao Lixuan

304
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,740
give the evidence

305
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,740
and say that she didn't?

306
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,740
I don't know.

307
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,740
I really don't know like you.

308
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,740
Otherwise, when she went back,

309
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,740
you can ask Shan Dao.

310
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,740
What should I ask?

311
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,740
She said now

312
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,740
that she doesn't remember anything.

313
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,740
No.

314
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,740
Even if she can't remember anything,

315
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,740
with the current scientific level,

316
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,740
it's difficult.

317
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,740
Just do a DNA test.

318
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,740
Toto is not your daughter.

319
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,740
Why do you recognize her?

320
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,740
For Toto.

321
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,740
For the new letter she just established,

322
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,740
the letter.

323
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,740
Toto's temper.

324
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,740
We were so suspicious before.

325
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,740
She is the descendant of the Jiang's Zhen Sect.

326
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,740
Let Zhao Lixuan

327
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,740
fall into it.

328
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,740
We worked so hard

329
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,740
and worked so hard for so long.

330
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,740
It's useless to

331
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,740
rush it.

332
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,740
You're afraid of destroying your disciple.

333
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,740
You're not afraid of hurting my heart.

334
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,740
You ruined my heart.

335
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,740
I always think

336
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,740
we are a couple.

337
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,740
I went there with one eye.

338
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,740
You know everything.

339
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,740
I didn't expect

340
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,740
you to fall faster than Toto.

341
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,740
You've been practicing for so many years.

342
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,740
You must have known it.

343
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,740
You're too shy

344
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,740
to talk to me

345
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,740
and sleep with me

346
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,740
in bed.

347
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,740
You're not suitable

348
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,740
for Toto.

349
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,740
You're not suitable.

350
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,740
I'm not suitable.

351
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,740
Who said I couldn't fall faster than Toto?

352
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,740
Actually,

353
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,740
I never doubted you.

354
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,740
I also believe Toto is not your daughter.

355
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,740
I'm just angry

356
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,740
that you let me down

357
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,740
in front of so many people.

358
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,740
You don't give me face.

359
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,740
I'm angry.

360
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,740
I'm angry.

361
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,740
Hey.

362
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,740
What?

363
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,740
Miss your master?

364
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,740
I want to go home.

365
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,740
All of you?

366
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,740
All of you?

367
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,740
Then there are others.

368
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,740
You have no home

369
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,740
and you have to hide from me.

370
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,740
Is that good enough?

371
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,740
You can't go back

372
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,740
even if you want to.

373
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,740
I don't have a home.

374
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,740
Look at you.

375
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,740
Your master is so good to you.

376
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,740
You have no conscience.

377
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,740
It's because my master is good to me

378
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,740
that I can't go back.

379
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,740
Can Mr. Shen

380
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,740
take care of you and grandma alone?

381
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,740
I mean,

382
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,740
your master hasn't contacted you

383
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,740
for several days, right?

384
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,740
I've been busy.

385
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,740
It seems that your master

386
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,740
abandoned me.

387
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,740
Hello, Mr. Shen.

388
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,740
Don't worry.

389
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,740
I'm here.

390
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,740
I won't let you

391
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,740
be in danger.

392
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,740
Great.

393
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,740
Mr. Shen,

394
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,740
although you came to help me

395
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,740
under your master's guidance,

396
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,740
it's also under my guidance

397
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,740
and supervision.

398
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,740
I think you

399
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,740
should change your position

400
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,740
and don't just stand there.

401
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,740
From tomorrow on,

402
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,740
you will be my master.

403
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,740
Don't look down on me.

404
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,740
You think I can't do it?

405
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,740
Although your master is famous,

406
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,740
don't forget that

407
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,740
I'm also a father of Jiangzhou.

408
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,740
If you can't count one,

409
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,740
at least you can count two.

410
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,740
I'm telling you

411
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,740
if someone else

412
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,740
wants to be my master,

413
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,740
I won't bother.

414
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,740
I think you've been

415
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,740
trying your best these days.

416
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,740
That's why you're not the top.

417
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,740
But you're not the top.

418
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,740
It's your master's top

419
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,740
that's why he's willing to accept you as his student.

420
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,740
Don't hesitate.

421
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,740
You didn't say that

422
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,740
I'm a little bit moved.

423
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,740
I've decided.

424
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,740
Decided what?

425
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,740
When Yichun goes to the hospital,

426
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,740
I'll kowtow to my master.

427
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,740
If he can teach you two so well,

428
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,740
it won't be a problem for me, right?

429
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,740
I've decided to kowtow to my master.

430
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,740
You're so childish.

431
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,740
I won't accept anyone.

432
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,740
I'll accept you.

433
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,740
You can't refuse anyone

434
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,740
except your right.

435
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,740
You're not qualified.

436
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,740
Hello, everyone.

437
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,740
I'm Dr. Peng.

438
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,740
Today, the dishes I'll teach you

439
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,740
are fried rice tea and egg dumplings.

440
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,740
Let's make egg dumplings first.

441
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,740
Ms. Fan, are you ready?

442
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,740
Everything is ready.

443
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,740
Let's put the oil

444
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,740
in the pot

445
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,740
and heat it evenly.

446
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,740
Then,

447
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,740
put the beaten egg in it.

448
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,740
For dumplings,

449
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,740
I'll use the golden shrimp dumplings.

450
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,740
The shrimp in this dumplings

451
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,740
is complete and big.

452
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,740
The shrimp has rich protein

453
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,740
and many

454
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,740
minor elements that the human body needs.

455
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,740
So, we need to eat more shrimp.

456
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,740
The oil is almost hot.

457
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,740
We can put dumplings in.

458
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,740
Fry it for three minutes on low heat.

459
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,740
Remember,

460
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,740
it must be on low heat.

461
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,740
Be careful.

462
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,740
This is actually normal.

463
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,740
Don't you know?

464
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,740
Yes.

465
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,740
The fried eggs are very fragrant.

466
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,740
Do you know?

467
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,740
I'm just a little anxious

468
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,740
on behalf of Xiao Hong.

469
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,740
I was going to put eggs in it.

470
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,740
Stop talking.

471
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,740
Stop talking.

472
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,740
I'm not talking.

473
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,740
I'm talking.

474
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,740
I'm talking.

475
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,740
I'm talking.

476
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,740
I'm not talking.

477
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,740
I'm not talking.

478
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,740
I'm talking.

479
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,740
Oh my god.

480
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,740
Where?

481
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,740
Here.

482
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,740
How about

483
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,740
Bingfeng,

484
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,740
Tianzong,

485
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,740
and Xin Shu?

486
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,740
Actually,

487
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,740
is Tao Tao

488
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,740
my daughter?

489
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,740
She's my wife.

490
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,740
She's my father.

491
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,740
Isn't it the same

492
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,740
in ancient China

493
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,740
and Chinese culture?

494
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,740
Master

495
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,740
is father.

496
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,740
That's different.

497
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,740
You really can't tolerate

498
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,740
Tao Tao

499
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,740
becoming a member of our family?

500
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,740
I can't tolerate

501
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,740
someone else in your heart.

502
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,740
Why

503
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,740
have I been with you

504
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,740
for so many years?

505
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,740
I have to donate here today.

506
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,740
I have to support there tomorrow.

507
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,740
I have no right

508
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,740
to support you at all.

509
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,740
You're not good to me.

510
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,740
Other couples

511
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,740
spend money on each other.

512
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,740
You and I

513
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,740
are from different places.

514
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,740
We don't have to go to different places.

515
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,740
I've always been

516
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,740
in charge of this family.

517
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,740
In the end,

518
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,740
I'm the one

519
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,740
who can't

520
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,740
even get the basic loyalty.

521
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,740
What should I do?

522
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,740
You've ruined my trust.

523
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,740
You've said it today.

524
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,740
Is your trust back?

525
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,740
No.

526
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,740
There's one thing

527
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,740
I've been keeping it in my heart

528
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,740
and want to ask you.

529
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,740
You have to answer me

530
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,740
honestly today.

531
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,740
What's going on

532
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,740
between you and

533
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,740
Xiao Bailing?

534
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,740
What's the relationship between you two?

535
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,740
I only said that

536
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,740
I'm Toto's father.

537
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,740
You even found his mother.

538
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,740
You've been looking for him for so many years.

539
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,740
Doesn't it mean

540
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,740
you can't forget him?

541
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,740
If he hadn't dropped out of school,

542
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,740
we might not have started.

543
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,740
So your trust

544
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,740
is based on

545
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,740
suspicion.

546
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,740
Do you always

547
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,740
have him in your heart?

548
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,740
Do you?

549
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,740
Yes.

550
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,740
Let me tell you.

551
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,740
It's not what you think.

552
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,740
Do you know why

553
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,740
Xiao Bailing dropped out?

554
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,740
It's because of me.

555
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,740
It's my fault.

556
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,740
I let him down.

557
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,740
You don't know

558
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,740
how hard it was

559
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,740
for you to get here.

560
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,740
It's beyond

561
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,740
your imagination.

562
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,740
I've done a lot of things

563
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,740
to learn the essence of Chinese medicine.

564
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,740
Now it seems

565
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,740
some masters

566
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,740
do have a tendency to be stubborn.

567
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,740
At that time,

568
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,740
I didn't have

569
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,740
the ability to distinguish.

570
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,740
I

571
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,740
was a fool.

572
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,740
I

573
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,740
didn't have the ability to distinguish.

574
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,740
I was bold

575
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,740
and didn't have

576
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,740
a good teacher

577
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,740
to teach me

578
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,740
the basic treatment.

579
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,740
You can't imagine

580
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,740
how stupid

581
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,740
those people

582
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,740
in the past

583
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,740
were.

584
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,740
Trust me.

585
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,740
I'll let you know.

586
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,740
What happened?

587
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,740
Excuse me.

588
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,740
Shuang'er was wrong.

589
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,740
I thought

590
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,740
it was temporary.

591
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,740
We also asked for medical treatment.

592
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,740
We treated both Chinese and Western medicine.

593
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,740
Half a year has passed.

594
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,740
We can't go back.

595
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,740
Don't blame yourself.

596
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,740
Xiao Bailing was afraid that

597
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,740
you would be like this.

598
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,740
That's why he left.

599
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,740
Even Xiao Li

600
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,740
is the only one who can fix it.

601
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,740
You should learn it.

602
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,740
You can be a real doctor

603
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,740
and you can afford it.

604
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,740
I'm sorry.

605
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,740
He is a pain in my heart.

606
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,740
If I

607
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,740
do anything wrong in my life,

608
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,740
Xiao Bailing

609
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,740
is the one

610
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,740
who is the one

611
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,740
who can fix it.

612
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,740
For Xiao Bailing,

613
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,740
I'm really serious about learning.

614
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,740
I want to learn

615
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,740
the pure Chinese medicine

616
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,740
and be the best doctor.

617
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,740
No matter where he is,

618
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,740
I have to find him.

619
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,740
With my understanding of Chinese medicine,

620
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,740
I don't think I can do it.

621
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,740
I know

622
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,740
you have always been

623
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,740
a man of your word.

624
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,740
You treated the patient

625
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,740
with care.

626
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,740
I didn't expect

627
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,740
Xiao Bailing to help you.

628
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,740
When you saw him

629
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,740
at the class reunion,

630
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,740
I saw him.

631
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,740
He was still like that.

632
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,740
He didn't complain about me.

633
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,740
Didn't you cure him?

634
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,740
I didn't persuade him.

635
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,740
He said he had given up on treatment.

636
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,740
He had adapted to the quiet world.

637
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,740
I'm so sorry for him.

638
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,740
I'm so sorry for him.

639
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,740
Xing Chen,

640
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,740
when we

641
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,740
when we go back from Wuhan,

642
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,740
take me to find him.

643
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,740
I'll persuade him.

644
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,740
I'll cure him, okay?

645
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,740
Okay.

646
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,740
Xing Chen,

647
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,740
you can do it.

648
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,740
You're my good wife.

649
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,740
But I'm still angry.

650
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,740
You're alone.

651
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,740
Such a big thing.

652
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,740
You're alone.

653
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,740
I'm in...

654
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,740
You're in my heart

655
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,740
for half a lifetime.

656
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,740
You don't tell me.

657
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,740
You just don't believe me.

658
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,740
I'm telling you.

659
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,740
You're just a person

660
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,740
who has added more guilt

661
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,740
in this world.

662
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,740
Guilt can't solve any problems.

663
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,740
You just need to learn more

664
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,740
and make yourself better.

665
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,740
Maybe you can change the result.

666
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,740
Xing Chen,

667
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,740
you're so heartless.

668
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,740
You've been hiding many things from me.

669
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,740
Now you know

670
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,740
why I'm so strict with Tianzhen.

671
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,740
Others praise her,

672
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,740
but I scold her.

673
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,740
I just hope

674
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,740
she can't be like me,

675
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,740
a little bit of

676
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,740
regret and opportunities

677
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,740
that she missed.

678
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,740
She's forgotten

679
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,740
the life.

680
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,740
I don't want her to make the same mistake

681
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,740
and regret it for the rest of her life.

682
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,740
She won't.

683
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,740
Our son won't.

684
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,740
He's really

685
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,740
a very righteous man now.

686
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,740
He's a good man.

687
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,740
Yes.

688
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,740
I've seen it through this epidemic.

689
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,740
This kid

690
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,740
is a good man.

691
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,740
His heart is full of love.

692
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,740
It deserves his name.

693
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,740
Tianzhen.

694
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,740
Right?

695
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,740
I want to ask you.

696
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,740
Do you

697
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,740
like

698
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,740
Xiaobai Ling?

699
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,740
The kind of love

700
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,740
that you have.

701
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,740
Dad said

702
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,740
you two are the same in the past.

703
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,740
He's not even as good as you.

704
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,740
You think you're better than him?

705
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,740
I'm not.

706
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,740
Love.

707
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,740
You think there's only love

708
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,740
between men and women?

709
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,740
There's another kind of love.

710
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,740
Love that's like a star.

711
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,740
You're crazy.

712
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,740
Love is love.

713
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,740
What's love?

714
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,740
I'm thinking.

715
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,740
If I didn't

716
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,740
have my heart

717
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,740
in the first place,

718
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,740
I wouldn't have been able to

719
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,740
be who I am now.

720
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,740
I should

721
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,740
marry him.

722
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,740
I don't think

723
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,740
he's the only one

724
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,740
I love.

725
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,740
Lin Xinzheng.

726
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,740
Tell me the truth.

727
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,740
How many people

728
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,740
do you love?

729
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,740
Who else do you like?

730
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,740
I don't dare to say it.

731
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,740
Say it.

732
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,740
Say it.

733
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,740
Say it.

734
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,740
Don't be cold.

735
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,740
You're scaring me.

736
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,740
Drink some water.

737
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,740
Do you remember

738
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,740
where we first met?

739
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,740
Of course I do.

740
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,740
You always forget.

741
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,740
It was when we were in college.

742
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,740
Actually, I've noticed you a long time ago.

743
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,740
When you were in grade two,

744
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,740
you came to my house to see my dad

745
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,740
and told him about your thesis.

746
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,740
It was on the rooftop of the old house.

747
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,740
I was in high school at that time.

748
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,740
You said we met

749
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,740
at the school's

750
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,740
library.

751
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,740
You said we met

752
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,740
at the school's

753
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,740
library.

754
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,740
It wasn't when you were in college.

755
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,740
It was when I was in college.

756
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,740
I thought

757
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,740
you should have

758
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,740
worn a blue dress

759
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,740
in high school.

760
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,740
Let me go.

761
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,740
Let me go.

762
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,740
What's wrong?

763
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,740
Let me go.

764
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,740
Slow down.

765
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,740
Let me go.

766
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,740
Slow down.

767
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,740
Where's Lin?

768
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,740
Where's Lin?

769
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,740
Let me go.

770
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,740
Lin.

771
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,740
Let me go.

772
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,740
Why is he so fast?

773
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,740
Let me go.

774
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,740
Let me go.

775
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,740
Luo Xi.

776
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,740
The soul of the past

777
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,740
burns with a strong passion

778
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,740
to guide us

779
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,740
to the end of the world.

780
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,740
Why didn't I see you

781
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,740
wearing a blue dress later?

782
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,740
Right.

783
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,740
Where did the blue dress go?

784
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,740
Why can't I find it later?

785
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,740
Why are you talking about this now?

786
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,740
Are you going to keep me busy for the rest of my life?

787
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,740
People need to use their hands

788
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,740
at critical moments.

789
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,740
You're just too deep in your heart.

790
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,740
What's wrong with being deep in my heart?

791
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,740
Unlike you,

792
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,740
you put your heart

793
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,740
on the road of being a mother.

794
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,740
Now you know why your father

795
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,740
passed the throne to me.

796
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,740
He won't pass it to you, will he?

797
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,740
You women

798
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,740
will always ask men

799
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,740
if they love you or not.

800
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,740
Do you love me or not?

801
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,740
Tell me. Tell me.

802
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,740
Tell me. Tell me.

803
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,740
Actually, I'm going to

804
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,740
confess to you for the rest of my life.

805
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,740
You know now, right?

806
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,740
You're not jealous anymore, right?

807
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,740
Am I really jealous?

808
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,740
I am.

809
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,740
I'm going to remind you

810
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,740
of another thing

811
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,740
that you may be unhappy about.

812
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,740
How can you be unhappy in your life?

813
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,740
You're always happy.

814
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,740
Happy.

815
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,740
God is always hitting your face

816
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,740
to let you know

817
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,740
how emotional you are.

818
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,740
Let him hit me. Let him hit me.

819
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,740
I have you.

820
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,740
I have you.

821
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,740
I have a golden bell.

822
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,740
Right?

823
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,740
The standard of life

824
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,740
is to be happy

825
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,740
and happy.

826
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,740
When you receive a good news,

827
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,740
there must be

828
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,740
a sad world waiting for you.

829
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,740
So many sorrows.

830
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,740
It's a good news

831
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,740
to have someone in your heart.

832
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,740
You don't doubt

833
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,740
that Toudou is my daughter now.

834
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,740
But Toudou may be

835
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,740
our daughter-in-law.

836
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:05,740
There will always be some youth

837
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,740
that has nothing to do with hatred.

838
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:15,740
There will always be some people

839
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,740
like the stars in the long night.

840
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,740
Time is silent

841
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:28,740
and the memories are remembered.

842
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:34,740
The food and the beauty of memories

843
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,740
are both warm and equal.

844
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:41,740
If there is no pain in life,

845
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,740
I will light a city for you.

846
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,740
The people in the light

847
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,740
are just ordinary people.

848
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,740
Light ordinary people

849
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,740
with ordinary bodies.

850
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,740
The soul of the burning people

851
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,740
burns with a strong passion.

852
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,740

to heal the people in this world.

854

It's not just ordinary identity.

855

Use ordinary bodies

856
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,740
