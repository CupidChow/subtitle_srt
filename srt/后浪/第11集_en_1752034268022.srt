The Untamed

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,600
Kids have a cold and fever.

4
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,700
It's a common disease.

5
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,500
It's a subject that we, the Chinese medicine, have been studying for thousands of years.

6
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Let me recommend someone to you.

7
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,700
Mr. Ren is naive. He's been a doctor since he was young.

8
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,600
This kind of little disease came to him.

9
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,000
And he's the two successors of Zhong Zhen and Tang Yao.

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So, Mr. Zheng, you don't have to worry.

11
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,400
Doctor, I'm a pediatrician. Let me go.

12
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,100
This is a Chinese medicine field. You don't have to go.

13
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,200
This kid is sick.

14
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,200
Doctor, I'll go.

15
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,200
Li Chuan can go. He and Tian Zhen are both Professor Ren's students.

16
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,400
We need to see how the teaching goes.

17
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
Yes.

18
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,000
Professor Ren, Headmaster Wu,

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,600
I'm very much in favor of your education.

20
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,400
But I'm an old man with a daughter.

21
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,400
I've been sick since I was young. My body is weak.

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,100
The fever looks like a small problem.

23
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,400
Last year, because of the fever, I had pneumonia.

24
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,200
I had to buy a chicken soup. Although I didn't develop into this school meal,

25
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,940
I still have this little

26
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,540
little chicken soup.

27
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,940
That...

28
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,540
It's okay.

29
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,440
I want to let Toto go.

30
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,540
How can Toto go? How long will he learn Chinese medicine?

31
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,640
Let Li Chuan and Tian Zhen go. Don't beat him.

32
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,740
Mr. Zheng, let me tell you this.

33
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,140
My junior,

34
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,040
Jiang's Zhen Sect, is inherited.

35
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,340
His blood is here.

36
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,540
Junior, come with me.

37
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,540
This is not appropriate. How can we bother the inherited

38
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,540
to make such a high position?

39
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,540
Look, he still doesn't believe in this inherited person.

40
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,340
You're afraid to bother him, but you're not afraid to bother me?

41
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,140
It's okay. We've been friends for many years.

42
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,340
I'll go with him.

43
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,340
Yan Shi,

44
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,540
are you really letting him go?

45
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,140
Wait, wait.

46
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,540
The little girl is afraid of needles. I'm afraid that she'll cry and make a scene.

47
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,340
It's hard to control.

48
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,340
Can you drink the medicine with sugar?

49
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,540
I can't drink the medicine with sugar either.

50
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,140
When I was young, I didn't try it.

51
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,540
I just can't get used to it.

52
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,540
You don't need to drink medicine or use needles.

53
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,340
You're the one who's afraid of needles.

54
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,340
Where's your kitchen?

55
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,340
Kitchen?

56
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,340
So much?

57
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,340
I'm fine.

58
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,140
Okay.

59
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,140
Get in the car.

60
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,740
The kitchen is here. Take this and drink it while it's hot.

61
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,340
Huh?

62
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,740
Huh?

63
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,140
He likes Diego.

64
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,340
He likes Questo much.

65
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,740
Uh-ub, a little 24-year-old boy.

66
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,340
...

67
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,340
I...

68
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,140
You can't.

69
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,700
Egg yolk oil is not a cold.

70
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,700
I know.

71
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,100
Don't make a fuss.

72
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,100
I'm not making a fuss.

73
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,300
I'm waiting outside.

74
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,180
Okay.

75
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,020
It's done.

76
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,020
Let's go.

77
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,660
Have you drunk the soup?

78
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,980
I did.

79
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,980
What do you mean?

80
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,740
And then?

81
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,900
Tangtang said it's a soup for instant noodles.

82
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,420
Is it useful?

83
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,340
It's not a soup for instant noodles.

84
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,860
It's a sour soup with a special taste.

85
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,860
It tastes like it.

86
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,620
Well...

87
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,380
I'm sweating.

88
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,020
This should be the paper from the book.

89
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:49,980
Okay.

90
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,460
I saw that

91
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,460
there's a hole here.

92
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,460
What's going on?

93
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,100
I don't know.

94
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,260
Four months ago,

95
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,300
after reading the script and reading the script,

96
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,860
I got a red spot.

97
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,420
The bigger the scratch,

98
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,860
the more it's rotten.

99
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,860
I finally got home and I got a scar.

100
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,860
My son is very drunk.

101
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,820
He's been using a lot of ointment.

102
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,260
It's not good.

103
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,420
When the time comes,

104
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,180
put this oil in a small bottle

105
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,740
and apply it to the child every day.

106
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,060
About three or five days.

107
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,540
As long as you don't break it,

108
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,580
it should be fine.

109
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,820
It won't be raised after applying it.

110
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,100
What kind of oil is this?

111
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,180
I'll put it here for you.

112
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,180
This is egg.

113
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,540
I can't remember the name.

114
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,500
This is the holy oil that Master treasured.

115
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,780
What is it?

116
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,700
I don't remember the name.

117
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,340
The holy oil is very precious.

118
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,780
Because it's non-oxidant,

119
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,780
non-adherent.

120
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,300
It's good for children.

121
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,540
It's very precious.

122
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,420
This oil is specially made for various skin treatments.

123
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,180
I've seen Tangtang's current situation.

124
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,940
It should be able to be reduced in half an hour.

125
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,980
Don't worry too much.

126
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,300
Thank you.

127
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:08,820
It's okay.

128
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,540
If it doesn't reduce in half an hour,

129
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,980
I'll go to Master again.

130
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,140
Impossible.

131
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,100
Okay.

132
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,420
Here.

133
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,660
I can pick it up.

134
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,860
You are so honest.

135
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,940
The egg oil is in your mouth.

136
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,100
It becomes the holy oil that Master treasures.

137
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,500
If he knows it's so cheap and easy to get,

138
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,580
and I made it,

139
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,740
do you think he will use it?

140
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,940
His home is so big.

141
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,220
Will he believe it?

142
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,020
I'll ask you.

143
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,020
How's your pulse check?

144
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,180
It's fine. It's not a big deal.

145
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:53,940
Okay.

146
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,060
How do you know Tangtang has a vision?

147
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,140
It's a pulse check.

148
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,740
Can you not be so sure about the race car?

149
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,020
If you can feel the vision,

150
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,220
I can call you master.

151
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,300
I'm leaving.

152
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,100
How about I go and have a look?

153
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:30,940
You go.

154
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,140
It's too late.

155
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,740
I'm just kidding.

156
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,940
I mean,

157
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,500
if Shan Dao goes,

158
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,500
the child will be cured.

159
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,540
Senior,

160
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,540
we are not good at

161
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,620
competing with each other.

162
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,820
I'm not as good as you

163
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,220
when it comes to bragging.

164
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,220
So I'm wondering

165
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,020
why my reputation in the martial arts world

166
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,340
is inferior to yours

167
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,820
in terms of bragging.

168
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,620
Junior,

169
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,220
how's the situation?

170
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,220
Don't worry, Senior.

171
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,020
Brother Tou,

172
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,620
you're amazing.

173
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,900
You cured such a serious disease.

174
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,420
Tangtang wrote that she won't burn it.

175
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,100
She said she wanted to eat fried chicken.

176
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,500
Don't give her anything.

177
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,300
She still wants to burn it.

178
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,900
She usually burns it for a week

179
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,900
before it becomes a big deal.

180
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,700
How about this?

181
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,620
Let's make some porridge for her.

182
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,900
It's the kind of rice porridge.

183
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,300
Let her have some appetite.

184
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,900
Tou Tou,

185
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,700
what medicine did you give the child just now?

186
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,900
Hot pot soup.

187
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,700
Hot pot soup?

188
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,900
Great.

189
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,780
The successor of Jiang's Zhenkai

190
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,900
has really

191
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,380
understood Shang Han Lun's background.

192
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,380
Mr. Zheng,

193
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,580
don't worry.

194
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,980
With his idea,

195
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,380
Lin Qianjin will be fine.

196
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,580
Look.

197
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,580
The child has been burning for a week.

198
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,780
Usually, he eats

199
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,980
the medicine to reduce the fever.

200
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,580
He's sweating.

201
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,380
Although he has removed the watch,

202
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,180
he has also removed the正 qi.

203
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,380
His body is weak.

204
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,580
The evil qi will enter his body.

205
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,460
Lin Qianjin

206
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,260
drank the hot pot soup he made.

207
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,460
He's sweating.

208
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,260
His正 qi is strong.

209
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,060
He'll be fine in a few days.

210
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,460
Xin Zheng,

211
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,860
you've taught your disciple well.

212
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,260
Don't be so cocky.

213
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,460
He's your first patient.

214
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,860
I'm not.

215
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,660
I just think

216
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,260
your father didn't lie to me.

217
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,060
It's true that the old and the new

218
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,460
are much better than the fake ones.

219
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,460
There's a different kind of arrogance.

220
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,060
How is it?

221
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,060
You won again.

222
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,260
Professor Zeng,

223
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,660
thank you so much.

224
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,260
You and Shen Dayou

225
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,660
are really special.

226
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,860
You're really a loyal family.

227
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,060
I just don't know

228
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,060
where we can buy

229
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,460
such an expensive oil next time.

230
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,860
It's not easy to buy.

231
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,660
How about this?

232
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,660
I'll bring it back

233
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,460
if I need it next time.

234
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,660
Thank you so much.

235
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,660
You're welcome.

236
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,060
Go back and have a good rest.

237
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:23,860
Goodbye.

238
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:24,860
Goodbye.

239
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,660
Thank you, sister.

240
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,860
Thank you, uncle.

241
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,460
What's wrong?

242
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,060
What oil are you using?

243
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,860
Egg yolk oil.

244
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,460
Didn't you teach it in class?

245
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,860
You said that

246
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,260
Li Shizhen said that

247
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,260
skin is itchy, red, and has wrinkles.

248
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,460
Is it true that you use egg yolk oil?

249
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,860
You're so cocky.

250
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,060
We all taught together.

251
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,660
Why didn't I expect that?

252
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,660
You're good at learning.

253
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,460
I'm good at learning.

254
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,660
I'm good at learning.

255
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,940
You're good at learning.

256
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,140
I just have good memory.

257
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,740
I just need to learn.

258
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,540
Chinese people pay attention to

259
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,140
learning and use.

260
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,740
In Western culture,

261
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,340
they pay attention to

262
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,940
knowledge for knowledge.

263
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,140
In fact, some knowledge

264
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,140
is not useless.

265
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,940
Learning knowledge

266
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,340
makes you happy.

267
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,740
Mr. Zheng,

268
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,140
please wait.

269
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,540
Just send it here.

270
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,340
Mr. Zhang, I prepared a gift for you.

271
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,340
This is Pu'er tea.

272
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,540
It's five years old.

273
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,540
Mr. Zheng's gifts

274
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,140
are very precious.

275
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,940
But people like me

276
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,740
are in the middle of the mountain.

277
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,540
I'm afraid that

278
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,340
I can't keep any good stuff.

279
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,140
All right.

280
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,540
I'll give this precious gift

281
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,940
to my junior.

282
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,540
Tongtong.

283
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,620
Here.

284
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,220
Tongtong.

285
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,420
Take it.

286
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,820
I'm borrowing flowers from my mother-in-law.

287
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:20,820
Thank you.

288
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,620
All right.

289
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,620
It's a pity.

290
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,420
I met my junior.

291
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,220
I know what it means to be a good student.

292
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,620
You have to learn it from your master.

293
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,220
The spirit of Chinese civilization

294
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,220
is to rely on you young people

295
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,820
to grow up.

296
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,020
All right. I'm leaving.

297
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,620
All right. See you.

298
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,220
All right.

299
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,020
Bye, uncle.

300
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,820
See you, uncle.

301
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,420
Sir,

302
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,420
I'll keep it.

303
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,220
Five years.

304
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,420
Professor Ren,

305
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,420
I have to thank you.

306
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,020
I listened to your emotional class that day.

307
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,820
I was so impressed.

308
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,420
I suddenly became open-minded.

309
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,420
It's more useful than eating any kind of medicine.

310
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,220
Tell me.

311
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,820
How did you suddenly become open-minded?

312
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,020
I divorced.

313
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,220
I didn't tell you to divorce, did I?

314
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,420
Yes, you didn't tell me.

315
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,420
But what you said in the class

316
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,420
is to make all of it

317
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,220
a sad story for you.

318
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,020
You can throw it into the trash

319
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,620
like throwing garbage

320
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,020
in the trash can.

321
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,820
This way, you can make that new

322
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,220
positive emotion

323
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,340
come out of the space

324
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,420
and come back to our body.

325
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,020
Yes. Yes. Yes.

326
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,020
You know an old saying.

327
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,180
If you don't get married

328
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,420
how much responsibility do I have?

329
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,420
No. No. No.

330
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,620
It has nothing to do with you.

331
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,220
You did a great thing.

332
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,820
I listened to your class.

333
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,020
I was very impressed.

334
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,020
Now,

335
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,700
I put all of those things down.

336
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,500
I suddenly realized a problem.

337
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,500
It's that what I wanted in my heart

338
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,300
was completely opposite and not compatible.

339
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,100
If I keep going on,

340
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,100
it will be my dream.

341
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,500
What do you want

342
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,900
in your heart?

343
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,100
I just wanted to make

344
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,900
a person who didn't love me love me.

345
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,300
But now,

346
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,900
all these dreams are gone.

347
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,780
Professor Jiang,

348
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,180
it would be great if you

349
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,780
had a online class.

350
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,380
Although you had this class

351
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,580
for your students

352
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,980
who are studying Chinese medicine,

353
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:12,980
but you see,

354
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:13,780
a person like me

355
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,980
who has no foundation

356
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,580
and has heard that class by chance

357
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,780
is also very rich.

358
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,180
If you put this class

359
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,180
on the Internet,

360
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,780
how many people will be blessed?

361
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,180
Let your Chinese medicine club

362
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,180
make you

363
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,980
a very popular female Internet celebrity.

364
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,060
A male celebrity.

365
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,060
Male.

366
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,860
Not male.

367
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,860
It's really male.

368
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,060
No matter how I make it,

369
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,060
it's not a female celebrity.

370
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,860
Yes, yes, yes.

371
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,660
Come on.

372
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,660
Come on.

373
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,460
Look.

374
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,860
It's good that

375
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,260
the two kids are together.

376
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,660
So,

377
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,260
the kids have to be put together

378
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,460
to raise them well.

379
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,780
Our Jianxi

380
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,660
has been in a good mood recently.

381
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,860
She is looking forward to

382
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,260
taking me to the clinic.

383
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,060
The doctors in our clinic

384
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,460
are very kind.

385
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,140
It's good for us.

386
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,140
Look.

387
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:31,740
There's also a kid

388
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,740
who is about the same age as her.

389
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,940
Mengmeng plays with her.

390
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,740
Looking at them,

391
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,940
I feel that everything is fine.

392
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,940
I want to take a leave next week.

393
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,340
What's the matter?

394
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,460
I have to thank

395
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,660
Professor Ren

396
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,460
for helping me forward

397
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,260
the search for the Internet.

398
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,140
There is a lot of traffic.

399
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,540
There are two messages

400
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,740
that are quite comprehensive.

401
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,060
I want to find it.

402
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,460
Okay.

403
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,060
I hope I can find it this time.

404
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,660
Don't worry.

405
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,740
Even if I can't find it this time,

406
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,140
I won't give up.

407
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,940
It means that I will find it next time.

408
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,740
Yes.

409
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,460
Nothing is impossible.

410
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,140
As long as we are confident.

411
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:09,860
Yes.

412
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,660
How long

413
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,740
are you going to stay?

414
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,740
This time, this place is far away.

415
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,940
I'm out of the province.

416
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,660
I have to stay for a week.

417
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,060
What about Jianxi?

418
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,260
This is what I'm worried about now.

419
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,140
What?

420
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:32,780
That...

421
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,900
How about

422
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,820
Jianxi stay in our house?

423
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,140
I can take care of her.

424
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,460
Sister,

425
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,260
when you go to find a house,

426
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,060
let Jianxi stay in our house.

427
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,940
I will take her to the clinic

428
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,180
every morning

429
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,060
and pick her up at night.

430
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,140
Do you think it's okay?

431
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,740
Don't worry.

432
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,940
How can I be at ease?

433
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,740
You are also

434
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,940
someone who will get sick anytime.

435
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,940
What if you lose control

436
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,860
What's the matter?

437
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,940
You've already

438
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,220
hurt our Jianxi.

439
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,380
I don't dare to do that.

440
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,060
I've divorced her.

441
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,260
I've got over my negative emotions.

442
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,780
I plan to start a new life.

443
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,020
I've caused Jianxi to be like this.

444
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,020
I'll be responsible for her.

445
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,860
I have a card here.

446
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,380
It's got

447
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,660
all the assets I had

448
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,860
when I divorced.

449
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,340
I didn't touch any of them.

450
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,380
I'll give them all to you.

451
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,460
You can take them to Jianxi.

452
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,780
What about you and your son?

453
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,820
My son has me.

454
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,460
I can support him

455
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,540
by working for him.

456
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,620
You need the money more than I do.

457
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,620
Take it.

458
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,260
Zhu Xia.

459
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,780
Take it.

460
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,820
You can entrust Jianxi to him.

461
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,540
Then you can

462
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,540
go to me in peace.

463
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,300
Yes.

464
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,020
Jianxi,

465
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,300
I wish you success.

466
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,860
Jianxi needs to take medicine every day.

467
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,620
I happen to

468
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,460
take medicine myself.

469
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,820
We'll be together.

470
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,380
What do you think?

471
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:27,940
Wait.

472
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,780
Don't make

473
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,380
another explosion case.

474
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,260
I know.

475
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,620
Don't worry.

476
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,860
I won't drink

477
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,540
or sleep.

478
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,540
I promise to cure Mengmeng.

479
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,460
By the way,

480
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,860
have you finished the first chapter?

481
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,260
You need to do well this month.

482
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,140
Your master will check the homework tomorrow.

483
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,140
Wait.

484
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,820
Check?

485
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,020
What do you mean?

486
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,340
Why do you need to check

487
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,780
after you finish?

488
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,500
You need to study

489
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,700
if you have a teacher.

490
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:03,740
Wait.

491
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,020
This...

492
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,740
He...

493
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:07,660
He copied it.

494
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,420
What's wrong?

495
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,060
He copied it.

496
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,740
You didn't copy it?

497
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,500
I...

498
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,700
He copied it.

499
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,380
He must have found it

500
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,540
if he went through all the books.

501
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,380
How do you know?

502
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,580
Okay.

503
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,700
Help me.

504
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,620
Help me.

505
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,060
Xu Xie Fan.

506
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,860
Tianzhen, what did you say?

507
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,460
Go.

508
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,900
Xu Xie Fan, help me.

509
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,900
Tianzhen, what did you say?

510
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,420
Help me. Help me.

511
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,300
Help me.

512
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,540
No.

513
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,780
Help me.

514
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,340
Come on.

515
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,780
Come on.

516
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,820
Professor Lin's wish is very big.

517
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:58,900
Don't worry.

518
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,580
We are all your right-hand men.

519
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:02,860
Yes.

520
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,380
We will protect you.

521
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,860
Protect you.

522
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,140
Recently, many policies have been issued

523
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,020
to develop the Chinese medicine industry.

524
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,020
We happen to

525
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,220
take advantage of this opportunity

526
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,540
and go straight to the top.

527
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,780
Mr. Liu, you are in charge of the stage.

528
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,060
Professor Lin,

529
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,740
you will be the director.

530
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,020
We will

531
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,020
be at the backstage

532
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,420
and do our job.

533
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,660
Yes.

534
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,500
We will

535
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,340
be responsible for

536
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,860
the big stage and the big stage.

537
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,940
We must do that.

538
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,700
Good wine is also afraid of the gods.

539
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,060
Look at the wine.

540
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,900
This wine

541
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,980
is known to be pure grain.

542
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,980
But we don't look at the brand.

543
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,740
You don't drink it. I don't say it.

544
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,340
Do you know what kind of wine it is?

545
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,900
I just smelled it.

546
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,700
It smells like dragon.

547
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,060
Awesome.

548
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,540
Professor Lin is awesome.

549
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,140
Awesome.

550
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,140
Did you see that?

551
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,740
Professor Lin,

552
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,940
you are really talented in knowledge.

553
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,100
You are really talented in knowledge.

554
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,940
We all know that.

555
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,180
But others don't know.

556
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,220
Right?

557
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,460
Look.

558
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,940
There are many liars out there.

559
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,620
They are all loyal to the Chinese medicine.

560
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,060
They eat mung beans and flowers.

561
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,980
How much money did they make?

562
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,140
But what about you?

563
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,420
You didn't get anything.

564
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,220
I'm all for you.

565
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,060
Yes.

566
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,220
I think so, too.

567
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,100
Professor Lin,

568
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,420
I think there is a problem with your thinking.

569
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,860
You can interfere with the raw egg and rice.

570
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,900
But have you ever thought about inheritance?

571
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,460
Have you ever thought about

572
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,420
for your students?

573
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,300
Why are there so many talented young people

574
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,940
who invest with him in Bafet?

575
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,580
Because he is rich.

576
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,500
Rich is the most obvious advantage

577
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,180
that ordinary people can see.

578
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,180
So there are so many talented young people

579
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,620
who are willing to pursue him.

580
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,460
What about Bafet?

581
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,500
I don't think so.

582
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,340
His house is 50,000 yuan per house.

583
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,220
His favorite hamburger is 8 yuan per piece.

584
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,180
So,

585
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,060
Professor Lin,

586
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,300
you can donate your money.

587
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,180
But you can't have no money.

588
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,740
If you have no money,

589
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,660
who will learn from you?

590
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,220
That's so reasonable.

591
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,420
You are the flag of the Chinese medicine industry.

592
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,740
You are the symbol.

593
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,780
With you,

594
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,700
the Chinese medicine will be prosperous.

595
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,140
We just started.

596
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,620
Our Chinese medicine industry

597
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,020
is like a piece of land.

598
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,340
Shicheng class is a seed.

599
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,020
Our professor is the sun and the rain.

600
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:37,220
You are responsible for the fertilizer.

601
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,260
When the time comes,

602
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,980
we can share the fruits

603
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,580
that are in the tree.

604
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,020
Great.

605
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,740
Mr. Liu, you are right.

606
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,780
I wish you a good growth

607
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,300
and growth.

608
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,100
Come on.

609
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,700
Let's drink.

610
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,620
Come on.

611
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,460
Come on.

612
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,260
Mr. Liu, you can drink.

613
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,340
Come on.

614
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,500
Well,

615
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,660
I'm really touched

616
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,780
by your love and support.

617
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,140
Before I drink this,

618
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,500
I want to make it clear to you.

619
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,220
I'm sorry

620
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,060
for your wine.

621
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,060
I'm a man of my word.

622
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,380
I'm a man of my word.

623
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,700
I'm...

624
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,100
Actually,

625
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,420
we don't work for ourselves.

626
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,940
Let's not talk about

627
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,700
promoting or anything.

628
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,980
It's a big deal.

629
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,460
First, we need to confirm

630
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,460
the definition of wealth.

631
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,980
What is wealth?

632
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,100
It doesn't mean

633
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,100
how much money you have.

634
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,700
If the money

635
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,020
is not used in a useful place,

636
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,580
you will die.

637
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,620
For example,

638
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,540
you bought a house of 1,000 square meters.

639
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,540
You are the slave of this house.

640
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,740
You bought a car of 10 million.

641
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,700
The insurance company

642
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,500
may not give you insurance.

643
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,060
I want to ask you what insurance is.

644
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,780
Insurance is the old god.

645
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,940
The account books are in the hands of the old god.

646
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,900
If it's the right way,

647
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,860
you can do it openly.

648
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,740
If it's not the right way,

649
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,900
the old god can see it.

650
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,580
The old god can see it.

651
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,020
You have faith and self-confidence.

652
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,980
So, the profession

653
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,860
is different from other professions.

654
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:03,140
If the doctor wants to make a fortune,

655
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,460
the old god will punish us.

656
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,900
Actually,

657
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,140
if I want to run this city class,

658
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,620
maybe this city class

659
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,820
is a very long

660
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,540
but without a result.

661
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,460
Maybe there is a result.

662
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,740
Maybe it's the result

663
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,340
we can't see in our life.

664
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:26,980
Right.

665
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,220
It can't be certain.

666
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:49,260
Only if you

667
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,820
congratulate us halfway,

668
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,540
I don't want to eat.

669
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,980
I really don't want to eat.

670
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,540
Come on, everyone.

671
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,660
Good wine.

672
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,020
Yes.

673
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,420
I thought you were your father and called.

674
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,300
You don't give la plates lessons tomorrow?

675
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,340
That's a lot.

676
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,820
Just a thought.

677
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,220
I can't finish it anyway.

678
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,060
Just tell you father to hit me once.

679
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,820
If he takes advantage of it, I'll take it too.

680
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,780
My father never hits anyone.

681
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:52,940
What?

682
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,540
Really?

683
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,300
It will drive you away.

684
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,660
Yes.

685
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,180
It will drive you away.

686
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,660
There are so many.

687
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,540
How can I write them?

688
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:14,980
So many.

689
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:16,900
Give it to me.

690
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,020
What?

691
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,620
Go over there.

692
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,420
No.

693
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:21,980
I'm sorry.

694
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,940
What do you mean?

695
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,620
Are you going to help me?

696
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,860
To be honest,

697
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,260
it's hard for me to write

698
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,700
something as ugly as you.

699
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,700
I'll leave you some space.

700
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,580
I'll leave you some space.

701
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,540
Just fill it up.

702
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,380
I see.

703
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,420
I'll go.

704
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,060
Left hand.

705
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,300
Can you do it?

706
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,340
I can do it better than you.

707
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,460
Try it with your feet.

708
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:12,660
Use your feet.

709
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,660
Use your big finger.

710
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,060
Hold it like this.

711
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,820
Hold it like this.

712
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,660
Write it like this.

713
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:17,740
Okay?

714
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,020
You can write with your other hand.

715
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:20,660
Like this.

716
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,460
Like this.

717
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,100
Like this.

718
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,180
Write it like this.

719
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,060
Like this.

720
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:28,940
Like this.

721
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:30,860
Like this.

722
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,660
Like this.

723
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:33,940
It's cool.

724
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,620
It's cool.

725
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,220
Like this.

726
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,020
Lift your legs.

727
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,860
Like this, okay?

728
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:48,940
It's cold now.

729
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,700
But stop.

730
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,380
Stop.

731
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,300
Just stop.

732
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,060
Yang indecent.

733
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,460
Look at this.

734
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,620
I can read it.

735
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,660
But I just don't understand.

736
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,500
Why did you just

737
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,380
write it down and recite it?

738
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,260
So you will understand it if you write too much.

739
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,340
It's a process of Olá.

740
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,300
Maybe one day you will be Liver throat flu.

741
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,180
You know I've been repeating that being Timov.

742
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,540
Will you be liver throat flu?

743
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,860
Is it the harvest holiday?

744
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,500
Is it that difficult?

745
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,660
Harvest holiday

746
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,420
Harvest holiday

747
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,300
What are you doing?

748
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,500
Over a roller

749
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,460
Naughty

750
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,420
Prepare us for the harvest

751
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,540
Tired little brother

752
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,500
I'm back

753
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,900
It's too late, what are you doing?

754
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,180
So, I'm learning Cantonese

755
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,700
What's up?

756
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,060
What are you doing?

757
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,020
Don't you want me to copy it?

758
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,660
Tomorrow's inspection.

759
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,020
Who?

760
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,380
Don't play tricks.

761
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,700
Got it.

762
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,420
You're back.

763
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,540
You're back.

764
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,220
You're drunk?

765
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,100
I'm not.

766
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,340
A glass of wine is a good wine.

767
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:39,860
What a pity.

768
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,340
Who did you offend?

769
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,260
No, no.

770
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,140
Who offended you?

771
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,580
I offended you.

772
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,100
It's called

773
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,260
a broken relationship.

774
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,740
Then we're also broken.

775
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,380
You're old.

776
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,180
Drunk with a glass of wine.

777
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,500
Nonsense.

778
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,740
Did you see Tao Tao when you went upstairs?

779
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,060
She's doing her homework.

780
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,100
She did it.

781
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,700
Your son did it for her.

782
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,700
No wonder the room is so quiet today.

783
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,820
Tianzhen never looks at her.

784
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,580
Why did she do her homework for her?

785
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,660
Your son is doing his homework.

786
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,820
But she's a good girl.

787
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,180
She knows she's wrong.

788
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,740
Are you a drunk?

789
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,220
No.

790
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,260
I'll be even more drunk later.

791
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,540
I want you to read it.

792
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,060
Done.

793
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,420
Mother-in-law's task has been finished.

794
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,060
I'm not.

795
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,820
Turn it over.

796
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,740
I was just an accident.

797
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,220
I won't turn it over next time.

798
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:19,820
I mean it.

799
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,860
I'm good at drinking.

800
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,020
Okay.

801
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,220
Let's continue.

802
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,500
Let's continue drinking.

803
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,980
Write a letter?

804
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,540
What...

805
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,700
What do you mean?

806
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,540
Why?

807
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,980
Didn't you say you'd turn it over?

808
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,300
Why did you write it?

809
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,460
This is a month's punishment.

810
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,740
It's a free pass.

811
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,100
But...

812
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,300
I can memorize it.

813
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,220
I can memorize the letter and the point.

814
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,140
Can you stop writing?

815
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,740
Why do you have to write it?

816
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,060
Why?

817
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,100
Just write it.

818
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,060
You'll understand when you're done.

819
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,380
I don't want to do it in a mess.

820
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,340
It's a waste of time.

821
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,060
Besides,

822
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,420
you don't know

823
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,700
if it's because...

824
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,300
if it's because

825
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,300
your master taught you that.

826
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,220
So you're just

827
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,180
teaching me like this.

828
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:14,860
Is it because

829
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,060
this is your legacy?

830
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,900
And...

831
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,020
You have to learn it.

832
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,740
When I was young,

833
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,980
I did whatever my master taught me.

834
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,420
Unlike you, I didn't do it.

835
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,020
Why?

836
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,060
Why?

837
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:28,540
No.

838
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,540
Times are different.

839
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,260
And things are different.

840
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,580
If you didn't learn well when you were young,

841
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,220
and you didn't listen,

842
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,940
my master wouldn't take you in.

843
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,380
We're different.

844
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,300
We're...

845
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,860
You let me learn.

846
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,100
If you don't listen,

847
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,420
if I don't learn,

848
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,580
there's no legacy.

849
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,420
Your master will be rude to you.

850
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,020
Right?

851
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,780
Hao Tuo.

852
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,660
You have to learn

853
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,740
to learn from nothing.

854
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,100
What do you mean?

855
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,020
Learn slowly.

856
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,940
Try to be patient.

857
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,660
You'll suddenly

858
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,820
open up.

859
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,540
Ji Yin is really strong.

860
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,540
You and Fu Zi

861
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,980
are the same.

862
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,220
You suddenly open up

863
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,300
when you don't understand.

864
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:17,160
You're like a

865
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,300
If you don't accept it,

866
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,100
I don't accept it.

867
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,020
Do you have a reward?

868
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:20,540
Yes.

869
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,700
Reward?

870
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,260
Reward?

871
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,140
Reward me?

872
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,260
Why?

873
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,380
Is it a reward?

874
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,100
Is it a reward

875
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,220
for your job this month?

876
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,420
You've done nothing wrong

877
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,940
for Mengmeng.

878
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,460
What reward do you want?

879
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,500
You caught a rat.

880
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,580
Did you catch a rat?

881
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,340
You'll know it then.

882
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,460
How long will it take?

883
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,620
Reward?

884
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,220
I'll wait here.

885
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,060
You stay here.

886
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,980
I'll stay here.

887
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,660
You're leaving?

888
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,300
Reward?

889
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,980
Reward?

890
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,620
Reward?

891
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,540
You've waited for a day

892
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,980
but you didn't get a reward?

893
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,340
What does it mean?

894
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,540
You drink when you get a reward.

895
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,060
I'll teach you how to drink.

896
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,100
Do I have to teach you how to drink?

897
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:58,980
Drinking?

898
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,940
The character of the Chinese character is

899
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,580
half of the word.

900
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,740
Where does it come from?

901
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,900
The body.

902
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:15,940
I know this.

903
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,900
It's written like this.

904
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,860
That one.

905
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,860
So, wine is also a medicine.

906
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,380
You have to get used to the weather

907
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,020
when you take medicine.

908
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,580
The best time to drink

909
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,980
should be at 10 p.m.

910
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,100
At 10 p.m.?

911
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,340
It's from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.

912
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,940
Remember, it's from 10 p.m.

913
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,100
No wonder you started eating

914
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,460
at 5 p.m. today.

915
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,860
So, drinking at this time

916
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,900
is not good for your health.

917
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,900
The best time to drink

918
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,140
should be from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.

919
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,020
And with pig ears.

920
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,220
Peanuts are the best for health.

921
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,140
So, you have to do everything

922
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,900
because of the land and the food.

923
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,860
Master, I think you

924
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,140
have too many rules.

925
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,140
Too many things.

926
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,740
You are like this when you drink.

927
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,940
You feel good when you drink.

928
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,100
Remember,

929
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,540
wine can hurt people.

930
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,340
You have to think about it.

931
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,140
You have to drink it all the time.

932
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,980
You have to follow the rules.

933
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,100
I know.

934
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,780
Knowing is following the rules.

935
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,860
We usually drink

936
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,860
the best wine.

937
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,780
We usually know

938
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,780
but we don't know.

939
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,780
Cheers.

940
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,780
That's great.

941
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,780
Right?

942
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,780
You can't drink it all the time.

943
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,780
Feel it.

944
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,780
Drink it all the time.

945
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,340
The strong wine

946
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,140
will spread in your mouth.

947
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,940
Feel the wine

948
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,940
enter your body.

949
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,940
It will be the end of your action.

950
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,020
Is it good?

951
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,020
Yes.

952
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,020
Can I stop?

953
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,020
I want to drink it all the time.

954
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,020
How do you feel?

955
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,020
It's really good.

956
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,020
It's warm.

957
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,020
It's warm.

958
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,020
There's an old saying.

959
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,020
Wine can make you bold.

960
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,020
When you drink it,

961
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,020
you will be bold.

962
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,020
Bold.

963
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,020
You will be bold.

964
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,020
You said it here.

965
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,020
Here.

966
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,020
You said it here.

967
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,020
You said it here.

968
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,100
Here.

969
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,100
Here.

970
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,100
This is the route of Yang Mingjing.

971
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,100
Yang Mingjing.

972
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,100
So you feel warm.

973
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,100
Very considerate.

974
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,100
You are really a good girl.

975
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,100
You know all these.

976
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,100
All of them.

977
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,100
Cheers.

978
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,100
What do you mean?

979
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,100
You have a tongue.

980
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,100
I mean you are good.

981
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,100
No problem.

982
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,100
Tell me something.

983
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,100
You buy me a drink today.

984
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,100
This wine is not enough.

985
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,100
Don't take more.

986
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,100
I have made it clear.

987
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,180
Drinking too much.

988
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,180
It's bad for your health.

989
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,180
It's bad for your health.

990
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,180
The right diet.

991
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,180
It's my reward for you.

992
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,180
Here.

993
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,180
Okay.

994
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,180
I'll drink this.

995
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,180
I don't want to share it with you.

996
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,180
I'll pour more.

997
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,180
You just said it.

998
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,180
Come on.

999
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,180
More.

1000
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,180
More.

1001
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,180
Don't let you eat some.

1002
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,180
More.

1003
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,180
Don't let the table

1004
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,180
have your dishes.

1005
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,260
I'll wipe your hands.

1006
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,260
I'm drinking now.

1007
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,260
What are you doing?

1008
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,260
Say it.

1009
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,260
Just a little.

1010
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,260
Little.

1011
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,260
I'm sorry.

1012
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,260
I'm sorry.

1013
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,260
I'm sorry.

1014
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,260
I'm sorry.

1015
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,260

I'm sorry.

1021
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,260
I'm sorry.

00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,260
I'm sorry.

00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,260
I'm sorry.

1036
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,260
I'm sorry.

1037
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,260
I'm sorry.

1038
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,260
I'm sorry.

1039
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,260
I'm sorry.

1040
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,340
I'm sorry.

1041
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,340

00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,340
I'm sorry.

1059
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,340
I'm sorry.

1060
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,340
I'm sorry.

1061
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,340
I'm sorry.

1062
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,340
I'm sorry.

1063
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,340
I'm sorry.

1064
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,340

00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,340
I'm sorry.

1069
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:58,260
I was afraid that I might appear into ink.

1070
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,920
I could have agreed with you.

1071
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,300
But we have easily lost each other before.

1072
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,180
I'm afraid that will be the end.

1073
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,980
I'm sorry.

1074
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:08,980
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

1077
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,140
Please tear up

1078
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,580
God, please come out.

1079
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,300
Look at yourself.

1080
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:19,420
Look at that.

1081
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,900
I can read your是啊.

1082
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,540
A wall of passion

1083
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,300
We use one sentence

1084
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:30,700
To cure the coldness of this world

1085
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,980
It's just an ordinary identity

1086
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,700
Use ordinary body

1087
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,500
To light up ordinary people

1088
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,100
Burn their souls

1089
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,380
Burn a wall of passion

1090
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,100
We use one sentence

1091
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:49,100
To cure the coldness of this world

1092
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:57,900
The Long Ballad

1093
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:02,900
The Long Ballad

1094
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:07,900
The Long Ballad

1095
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,900
The Long Ballad

1096
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:17,900
The Long Ballad
