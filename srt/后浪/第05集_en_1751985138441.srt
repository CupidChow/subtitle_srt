The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,000
That girl is dead?

4
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,880
No, no, no.

5
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,800
She's just a crow's mouth.

6
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
She's back.

7
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,680
I'm scared to death.

8
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,920
What are you doing?

9
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,440
Half of the bookshelves

10
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,440
of that girl were cut off.

11
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,840
How many people are there in the bookshelves?

12
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,920
Two.

13
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,280
Isn't there one left?

14
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,280
What's this?

15
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,240
Stop writing.

16
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,040
What's wrong with him?

17
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,480
I saw what explanation a young man would mention

18
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,600
as he was brake this dating letter.

19
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,280
He has the uterus' to the Factory.

20
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,400
Has the uterus?

21
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,360
Is that what he thinks?

22
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,280
He looks like...

23
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,840
Like a fool strain his brain a little.

24
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,480
Toto,

25
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,920
if you're serious,

26
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,280
I only believe you.

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,480
Why are you three so nervous?

28
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,120
It's not like you're pregnant.

29
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,600
There's a head and a head.

30
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,840
In the subjective sense,

31
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,480
you've done a good thing.

32
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,040
You've done a good thing, you know?

33
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,760
A good thing.

34
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,200
You're relieved?

35
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,720
Then we'll meet again.

36
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,200
Will you save me or not?

37
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,280
I guess you're naive.

38
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
You're blinded by your own idea.

39
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,400
It's not a big deal.

40
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,720
Sun.

41
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,400
Listen to me.

42
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,280
I think in this life,

43
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,400
as long as you don't harm others on purpose,

44
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,280
you deserve to be forgiven.

45
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,760
Just like me.

46
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,120
I've broken my bones.

47
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,520
But I'm brave.

48
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,640
I can't write it down

49
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,880
in my personal dark history.

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,320
Everything

51
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,840
should be seen from a bright angle.

52
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,400
Don't blame yourself.

53
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,080
We'll meet again

54
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,680
in the future.

55
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,440
We'll still

56
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,000
have to

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,960
have a birthday party

58
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,720
when it's time to.

59
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,640
We'll have a party

60
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,480
and celebrate.

61
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,280
We'll celebrate.

62
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,320
We'll celebrate.

63
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
We'll celebrate.

64
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:38,880
Tao Tao.

65
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,720
Don't learn Chinese medicine.

66
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,760
Really.

67
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,720
You're good at cooking.

68
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,120
You should cook for others.

69
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,640
I came here

70
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,600
because I'm good at cooking.

71
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,480
Look.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,720
What do you want to eat?

73
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,840
Oh, my.

74
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,920
It's a big world.

75
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,080
Food is the most important.

76
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,120
Sun.

77
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,400
You said that

78
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,600
there are two abalones.

79
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,640
What are they?

80
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,320
What are they?

81
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,600
They're twin abalones.

82
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,240
Twin abalones.

83
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,760
Twin abalones.

84
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,640
It means

85
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,480
there are two heads

86
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,240
on one abalone.

87
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,280
Yun.

88
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,200
You lied to me.

89
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:17,800
You lied to me.

90
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,560
I've never had abalones.

91
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,120
I've never had them.

92
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,000
Where can I buy twin abalones?

93
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,280
I'll buy them for you.

94
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,240

133
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,240
I'll buy them for you.

134
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,240

I'll buy them for you.

140
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
I'll buy them for you.

141
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,240
Let's not go anywhere.

142
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,240
I'll go.

143
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,480
Fine.

144
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,240
Sun Tao Tao.

145
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Sun Tao Tao?

146
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,240
Reverie,

147
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
You really got up Ladies first time.

148
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,280
I didn't see it.

149
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,600
Wait.

150
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,720
Can you lend me your clothes?

151
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,800
I studied last night.

152
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,160
Can you lend me your clothes?

153
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,280
You can use your own things

154
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,080
when you study.

155
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
But if you don't get permission from others

156
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,120
and take others' things without permission,

157
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,560
it's called stealing.

158
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,280
What?

159
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,080
What do you mean stealing?

160
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,360
You're talking too seriously.

161
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,560
We're like roommates.

162
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,560
You're always yours and mine.

163
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,680
It's narrow-minded.

164
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,880
You should know how to share.

165
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,240
I...

166
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,440
I want to ride alone, you know?

167
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,040
Will you care about the next person?

168
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,560
No, you won't.

169
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,760
You'll leave after you finish riding.

170
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,680
If you're really unhappy,

171
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,520
I'll give it back to you.

172
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,200
No need.

173
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,160
Go away.

174
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,560
Ruocha.

175
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,840
Ruocha.

176
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
What do you mean?

177
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,240
You don't want it?

178
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,960
If you don't want it, then leave it to me.

179
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,520
I'll buy it.

180
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,360
I just wiped it.

181
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,720
Thank you.

182
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,760
Monitor.

183
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,360
I want to tell you something.

184
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,240
It's about the things he stole from me.

185
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,120
Steal?

186
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:18,680
What did he steal?

187
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
It's not stealing.

188
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
It's taking.

189
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,080
Taking.

190
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,640
If you don't get permission from others,

191
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,280
you'll steal things from others.

192
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,760
You can steal a lot of things.

193
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,520
A coat costs tens of thousands.

194
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,320
Tell me.

195
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,480
What did he steal from you?

196
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,040
This.

197
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,720
This?

198
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,520
This.

199
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,400
I thought it was something else.

200
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,240
It's just a human model.

201
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,600
Don't be too petty.

202
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
You two can use it together.

203
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,400
I think so too.

204
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
We can use it together.

205
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,840
First of all,

206
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,040
I don't like things that others touch.

207
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:52,960
Second,

208
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,240
I don't like Sun Tao.

209
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,280
So I'm going to apply for a new dorm.

210
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,560
I'm sorry.

211
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,200
There's no empty room.

212
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,920
Then we need to make three agreements.

213
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,600
From now on,

214
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,200
you can't touch my things.

215
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,200
Anything.

216
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,080
Do you remember?

217
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,080
Tao, what do you think?

218
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,400
I'm generous.

219
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,560
He can touch my things anyway.

220
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,400
And I think...

221
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,320
Move your butt.

222
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,840
He has a fair rule.

223
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,560
Don't worry.

224
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,400
I won't touch anything.

225
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,480
So please don't touch my things.

226
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,800
No.

227
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,400
It's a two-sided relationship.

228
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,280
You can't decide it alone.

229
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,800
I allow you to take my things.

230
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,040
You should allow me to take your things.

231
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Is that right?

232
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,440
Right?

233
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,840
Is that right?

234
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,800
Good morning, Mr. Ren.

235
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,160
Good morning, Mr. Zheng.

236
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,400
Mr. Ren.

237
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,720
I'm sorry.

238
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,800
I don't want to live in the same room with Mr. Sun.

239
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,400
How about this?

240
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,880
I'll go home every night.

241
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,640
I promise I won't be late every morning.

242
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,040
Why?

243
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,320
I...

244
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,560
Ren Xu.

245
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,840
I want to go home and sleep too.

246
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,440
Any other students

247
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,960
want to go home and sleep?

248
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,640
Yes, sir.

249
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,360
I'll go to wake up Boss Cui.

250
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,760
Bye.

251
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,800
Mr. Yang.

252
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,960
Since we're in the first postrec migrant class,

253
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,800
Who wrote it?

254
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,600
I did.

255
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,800
You say it.

256
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,120
If you want to learn,

257
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,200
you can't go home and sleep.

258
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,800
No.

259
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,440
You can't go home and sleep.

260
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,000
What Sun Toto said

261
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,640
is true.

262
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,960
If we don't live together,

263
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,160
the shortcomings we have

264
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,200
are biased in Chinese medicine.

265
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,160
We don't have a middle-class disease.

266
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,360
Chinese medicine is different from Western medicine.

267
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,120
Western medicine is based on machines.

268
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,680
Once the data is out,

269
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,760
where are you biased?

270
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,000
Machine medicine.

271
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,840
Chinese medicine is different.

272
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,680
Chinese medicine is based on pulse.

273
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,640
The first level of pulse is liver.

274
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Liver is a word.

275
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,200
In Chinese culture,

276
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,640
it's very advanced.

277
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,000
I want to ask

278
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,040
a quote from

279
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,560
the Big Diction of Yin and Yang.

280
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,640
In my opinion,

281
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,920
in the opinion of the audience,

282
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,080
in the opinion of the audience,

283
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,560
how can I know

284
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,840
you are sick

285
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,920
by using your pulse?

286
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,600
The word is

287
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,160
the word for the word.

288
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,840
Everyone knows that

289
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,560
we are usually mischievous.

290
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,520
We measure things with the word.

291
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,760
How can I know

292
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,120
I'm biased?

293
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,640
Who will tell me

294
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,200
I'm right?

295
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,360
Your roommate,

296
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,240
your classmate,

297
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,320
your teacher,

298
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,120
after living together for 24 hours,

299
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,560
they know what your shortcomings are.

300
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,400
They will bring it up to you

301
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,240
and let you correct it.

302
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,720
In the end,

303
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,640
our class

304
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,320
has been living together

305
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,240
for 24 hours

306
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,600
for three months.

307
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,200
The purpose is to

308
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,840
find the mirror.

309
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:08,960
Usually,

310
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:19,540
we forget to take מע calmly

311
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,600
to try different ways

312
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,360
to help him接下來.

313
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,760
So,

314
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,600
if his reading doesn't go well,

315
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,600
he may stay awake

316
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,200
and read book all day.

317
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,800
This is also

318
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,520
my comeback,

319
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,440
to be with your classmates for a while.

320
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,440
It's not about 75 yuan.

321
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,920
If you want to be a good student,

322
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,440
it's not about 75 yuan.

323
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,520
If you're fierce and threaten others,

324
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,320
it's not about 75 yuan.

325
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,760
It's not about 75 yuan.

326
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,120
Tongtong,

327
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,360
why does the teacher always stand by your side?

328
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,800
My nephew is a good student.

329
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,440
He always helps me

330
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,840
no matter he's an old man or a friend.

331
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,800
Right?

332
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,640
You look happy and energetic.

333
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,880
Mr. Zheng, you look so happy.

334
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,120
It seems that Hefeng Hall

335
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,680
is in the top ten this year.

336
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,480
I heard that

337
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,960
your company's health products are very popular.

338
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,920
To be honest,

339
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,800
our company used to focus on

340
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,160
medicines and injections.

341
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,400
But this area

342
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,560
is very competitive.

343
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,240
Right.

344
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,000
Compared with those

345
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,360
hundred-million-dollar medicine factories,

346
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,000
we have no competitive advantage.

347
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,320
The year before last,

348
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,440
the principal came to teach us.

349
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,520
I was stunned by it.

350
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,240
In the past two years,

351
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,120
we have been working hard to develop

352
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
health products and health care products.

353
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,840
He also helped us

354
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,040
improve the drink recipe.

355
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,320
If we can get it,

356
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,720
the principal is the biggest achievement.

357
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,480
Today, I came here

358
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,840
to thank the principal in person.

359
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,320
Is he in the door?

360
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,280
Don't you know?

361
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,360
The principal has resigned.

362
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,520
He has run a

363
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,560
Chinese medicine ten-year-old class outside the school.

364
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,880
He has resigned?

365
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,200
That's a good thing.

366
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,600
Our company is planning to add

367
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,040
the school-age subsidy

368
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,040
for the poor students

369
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,840
of our Chinese medicine university this year.

370
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,480
It can be used to support the ten-year-old class.

371
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,040
No.

372
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,000
Mr. Zheng.

373
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,560
Mr. Zheng.

374
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,960
What do you mean?

375
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,000
You know that

376
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,320
our company takes 1.5 million yuan every year

377
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,240
to help us

378
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,760
to make the school-age subsidy.

379
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,600
I know that.

380
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,560
The corresponding school-age subsidy

381
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,880
takes half a month's time

382
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,920
to come to our company

383
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,840
to give free lectures and medical certificates.

384
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
Okay, Mr. Zheng.

385
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,040
If you are worried about the lecture,

386
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,040
you don't have to do it.

387
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,280
I have been a friend of Professor Ren for 30 years.

388
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,560
I can guarantee that

389
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,120
I can teach him

390
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,200
the lecture and medical certificates.

391
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,520
You can ask me for anything.

392
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,840
Our school will be your strong support.

393
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,520
Of course I believe in Professor Wu's level.

394
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,160
But Professor Ren

395
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,160
is our chief consultant expert.

396
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,440
When he started,

397
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,800
he helped me a lot.

398
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,120
If I don't give him the scholarship

399
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,920
because he left,

400
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,800
it's not enough.

401
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,560
Am I right?

402
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,360
My senior

403
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,160
is a man of personal merit.

404
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,080
His good deeds are for personal use.

405
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,960
You have been in the class for a day.

406
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,320
Are you tired?

407
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,600
Well,

408
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,880
at the end of the class,

409
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,440
let's play a game together.

410
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,360
No, no, Mr. Zheng.

411
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,400
I'll take part in it.

412
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,320
Okay.

413
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,960
What game?

414
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,880
Guessing the language.

415
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,360
The smell of the sound and the sound of the sheep.

416
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,560
The one who knows is kind.

417
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,920
The one who knows is lucky.

418
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,000
The one who knows is wise.

419
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,840
The people use it for a day.

420
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:15,800
That's it.

421
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,760
I don't understand it.

422
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,680
What's this?

423
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,360
I don't understand it.

424
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:19,800
It's a coat.

425
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,320
Yes.

426
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,880
Is it an object?

427
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,280
Yes.

428
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,520
How do you know it's an object?

429
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,320
Prepare the card.

430
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,360
Is it hanging on the wall?

431
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,440
Is it edible?

432
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,360
It's said to be a daily item.

433
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,880
Really?

434
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,560
I know it.

435
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,320
Say it.

436
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,000
Wash the leaves, wash the hair,

437
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,920
brush the teeth, rub the feet,

438
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,480
and wash the dishes.

439
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:39,920
Almost.

440
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,960
One is always right.

441
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,480
Thank you.

442
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,640
They're all wrong.

443
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,800
They're all wrong.

444
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,400
Listen carefully.

445
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,520
The sound and the sound of the sheep are the same.

446
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,320
Think about it.

447
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,800
Think about it.

448
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,120
It's chopsticks.

449
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,240
Yes.

450
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,240
It's chopsticks.

451
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,480
Tell us why it's chopsticks.

452
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
The sound and the sound of the sheep are a group.

453
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,160
But gloves are a group.

454
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,480
You wear gloves in summer?

455
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
People use it for a day but they don't know it.

456
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,120
It's a frequency.

457
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,440
It's a habit.

458
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,160
I remember I read an article

459
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,360
in high school.

460
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,520
It's chopsticks.

461
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,320
Chopsticks are the culture of China.

462
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,160
Yes.

463
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,320
You're right.

464
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,640
Chopsticks.

465
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,800
Who can tell me

466
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,120
which side of the chopsticks

467
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,640
are the sound and the sound of the sheep?

468
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,800
The upper side is the sound.

469
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,600
The lower side is the sound.

470
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,880
The hand is the middle.

471
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,240
So let's be honest.

472
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,320
If you hold the chopsticks well,

473
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,080
you can hold anything.

474
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,760
Thank you.

475
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,520
Why are we having fun today?

476
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,920
It's for the theme of the next class.

477
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,840
The Chinese medicine.

478
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,800
Why is it called Chinese medicine?

479
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,080
Is it the Chinese medicine of the Central?

480
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,200
The Chinese medicine in the middle.

481
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,880
Listen to the next section.

482
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,600
By the way,

483
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,840
Qingming is coming soon.

484
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,520
The students have to make some offerings.

485
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,120
Ms. Song will teach you.

486
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,040
You'll win today.

487
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,200
You'll arrange the time at night.

488
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,320
Okay, everybody.

489
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,520
Class is over.

490
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,520
I'm really impressed

491
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,120
with Mr. Ren.

492
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,680
He always told me

493
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,600
as long as you're firm,

494
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,200
and when you really need it,

495
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,880
money will come to you.

496
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,600
Look,

497
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,080
your godfather

498
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,000
is here today.

499
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,560
Our class

500
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,080
needs money everywhere.

501
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,160
These 2 million

502
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,600
really solve our problem.

503
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,880
Support each other.

504
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,840
Professor Ren is popular.

505
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,240
He needs us.

506
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,560
We deserve

507
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,800
Professor Ren's return.

508
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,120
It was so difficult to start a business.

509
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,760
I had no direction.

510
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,360
Professor Ren instructed me

511
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,560
to plant love in Qichun,

512
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,480
to grow oil, cover the land, and raise the rich.

513
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,160
When I save enough money,

514
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,800
Professor Ren helped me

515
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,880
develop Chinese medicine.

516
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,280
In the end,

517
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,920
my money is Professor Ren's.

518
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,280
I can't afford to lose money.

519
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,040
As long as he needs it,

520
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,480
I can open the door at any time.

521
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,320
It's getting late.

522
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,680
Let's go first.

523
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,520
We won't bother you.

524
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,280
You've come a long way.

525
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,920
You're leaving without seeing

526
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,840
the real person?

527
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,040
I think it's time for you to come back.

528
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,080
Have some tea.

529
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,880
Come on.

530
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,600
Have some tea.

531
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,520
You two,

532
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,240
why are you

533
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,560
coming to my temple today?

534
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,000
Let's go.

535
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,840
Xing Chen

536
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,280
sent us money.

537
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,640
He gave us the scholarship

538
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,920
for the school.

539
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,640
The school doesn't need money,

540
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,160
but we need it for our school.

541
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,280
I can't take this scholarship.

542
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,720
Why not?

543
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,720
Look.

544
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,840
The scholarship is for the school.

545
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,840
I've resigned.

546
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,200
Look, I've resigned.

547
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,960
I can't take the money away.

548
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,960
Right?

549
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,680
I know.

550
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,280
You should thank me.

551
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,400
Actually, I should

552
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,920
do all these

553
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,000
when I was in school.

554
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,160
I should thank the school

555
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,920
for the help and support

556
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,560
to me.

557
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,000
So the scholarship

558
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,040
is for the school.

559
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,000
Well...

560
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,520
You're not qualified to study.

561
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,360
The elder sister said

562
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,040
you should be careful.

563
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,960
How about this?

564
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,280
I'll give 1.5 million to the school.

565
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,160
How about I leave the rest to you?

566
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,760
It's a big deal

567
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,560
to let poor students

568
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,120
finish their studies.

569
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,760
Right.

570
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,680
Mr. Ling is right.

571
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,960
We don't need it.

572
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,960
What about the lecture?

573
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,440
My employees and clients

574
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,840
all recognize you.

575
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,920
I can tell the teacher.

576
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,720
The way is good.

577
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,120
The lecture is good

578
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,440
for the patients.

579
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,640
The lecture

580
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,880
is a must.

581
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,840
Professor Ren,

582
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,680
I believe you.

583
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,400
Mr. Wu,

584
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,800
I don't mean to offend you.

585
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,120
You're a good student.

586
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,680
You're not qualified to study in Jiangzhou.

587
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,280
But, Professor Ren,

588
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,680
the important clients

589
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,080
are all for you.

590
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,280
You're not qualified to study.

591
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,920
I'll go to the lecture.

592
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,360
I'm not qualified to study,

593
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,120
but I still want to go to the university.

594
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,200
Don't worry.

595
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,640
But I have a condition.

596
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,400
Shandong,

597
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,440
is it okay?

598
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,960
If we have the lecture,

599
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,320
we'll be half of the students.

600
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,560
What do you think?

601
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,400
No problem.

602
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,840
It's a great deal

603
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,920
to have Shandong.

604
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,080
What time is it?

605
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,120
Why hasn't the teacher

606
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,200
invited us to dinner?

607
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,520
I've told the students

608
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,320
that the teacher will be on duty tonight.

609
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,280
They won't have dinner.

610
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,800
We've been in the class for a day.

611
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,240
They won't even let us eat.

612
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,600
No money?

613
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,640
I can give you one month.

614
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:47,700
My agency's

615
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,320
이트 withdraws over Labor Day.

616
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,520
I'll take care of the pain.

617
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,600
It's not the time

618
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,040
to start a fire yet.

619
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,880
If you can,

620
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,600
don't spend my parents' money.

621
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,080
If you can,

622
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,600
don't spend the money of the hospital.

623
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,720
I'm just in love with Master.

624
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,440
If I don't love Master,

625
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,120
I won't marry you.

626
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,920
Master is so fierce.

627
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,760
How can you not know it?

628
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,920
What's up?

629
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,880
I want to ask you

630
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,440
if you'll bring us

631
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,520
the treasure of Zhiyuan tonight.

632
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,880
Yes.

633
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,600
Zhe,

634
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,960
get ready first.

635
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,200
I'm going.

636
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,280
Yes, sir.

637
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,120
Aren't we due yet?

638
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,320
They also store well hones.

639
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,120
No poison.

640
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,020
You could have told me earlier.

641
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:37,860
The poison is about to come.

642
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,800
I'll be done soon.

643
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,560
Division commander,

644
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,000
I searched the internet.

645
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,560
Youais have to buy1,000 of these

646
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,080
for 30 yuan on the drinks.

647
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,080
But you pay.

648
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,120
I don't.

649
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,040
I have no money.

650
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:52,960
Toto,

651
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,440
this is our gratitude.

652
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,760
This is our respect and yearning for the immortals.

653
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,760
Now,

654
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,120
technology has developed.

655
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,920
If you want to contact someone,

656
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,400
you can not only hear the voice on the phone,

657
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,000
but also watch the video.

658
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,240
Seeing the people on the phone,

659
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,360
unlike the old days,

660
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,680
a letter from a family,

661
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,040
a year back and forth.

662
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,160
People's lifestyle has changed.

663
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,320
But there are still things that haven't changed.

664
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,560
Just like what Mr. Ren said today.

665
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,320
There is a long way to go.

666
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,920
If there is a change, there must be a change.

667
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,160
When you see it clearly,

668
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,320
you will be able to see it clearly.

669
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,120
What's not changed?

670
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,280
I used to think that my salary would not change.

671
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,080
Now even my salary has increased.

672
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,600
What hasn't changed is the human emotion.

673
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,280
Thousands of years ago,

674
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,800
parents passed away.

675
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,120
The child will cry.

676
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,080
Today after thousands of years,

677
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,800
it's still the same.

678
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,560
But if Dad always dries the money,

679
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,240
would you still near him,

680
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,000
put out the money?

681
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,040
Not to us.

682
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,560
So because of this,

683
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,280
my family is well senior.

684
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,280
But now I am still with two children,

685
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,200
who gave up their life and wanted to live,

686
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,680
be weak,

687
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,560
and live a lonely life.

688
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,040
impress

689
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,140
Rebecca

690
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,020
what is that?

691
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,420
This is the first time

692
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,420
that I have been cleaning the tomb for you.

693
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,980
I hope that every classmate

694
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,540
will have the same experience, okay?

695
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,180
Actually,

696
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,260
I just want to clean the tomb for my mother.

697
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,140
Okay.

698
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,860
I will tell Mr. Ren

699
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,260
to give you a holiday after cleaning the tomb.

700
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,900
You are so smart.

701
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,260
It won't affect you if you miss a class.

702
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,060
Thank you, Ms. Song.

703
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,420
What does that mean?

704
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,020
If Rebecca is smart,

705
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,940
I am not smart.

706
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,340
I won't be able to do it if I miss a class.

707
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,660
That's not what I mean.

708
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,060
Ms. Song means

709
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,660
no matter how many classes you miss,

710
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,660
it won't affect you.

711
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,620
No matter how many classes you miss,

712
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,260
I thought you were praising me.

713
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,700
I was just thinking about it.

714
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,300
Tongtong.

715
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,180
Sit here.

716
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,860
Let me see what you have.

717
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,540
You are talking back to me.

718
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,860
If I keep talking back to you,

719
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,660
you will clean the tomb for me tomorrow.

720
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,660
Then you should have more.

721
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,020
Naive.

722
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,580
Naive.

723
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,260
Sit down.

724
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,100
Is that you today?

725
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,180
Yongchun.

726
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,500
Ye Wen.

727
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,340
Don't be hard on me.

728
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,100
I know it.

729
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:31,600
No.

730
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,300
She abused me.

731
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,260
Tongtong,

732
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,680
your legs

733
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,640
areそうですね,

734
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,300
graceful,

735
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:54,780
and graceful.

736
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,160
I instantly

737
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,780
concede to your magazine pech42.

738
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,120
Really?

739
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,480
Because of you, manicure-de Kern is no longer as easy as itu hiking

740
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,800
Have you eaten

741
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,840
This one

742
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,720
And how about Ou Yue's profile

743
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,080
what

744
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,120
This face

745
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,120
Let go of me!

746
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,120
Stop!

747
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,120
What are you doing?

748
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,120
Are you okay?

749
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,120
Are you hurt?

750
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,120
You are still so excited.

751
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,120
How about this?

752
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,120
You two keep this posture.

753
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,120
Don't move. Don't let go of it for an hour.

754
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,120
This is not fair.

755
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,120
I am bending my waist.

756
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,120
He is sitting.

757
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,120
After an hour, I will be more tired.

758
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,120
Yanzhen, let go of it first.

759
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,120
You two, go to the front.

760
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,120
You know how to lie to your son.

761
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,120
Take your legs off.

762
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,120
Get up.

763
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,120
I know my son.

764
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,120
If you don't bother him,

765
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,120
he won't fight with you.

766
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,120
He has been a martial arts coach since he was a child.

767
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,120
He is the champion of the country.

768
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,120
You can beat him.

769
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,120
If he wants to fight with you, you would have been dead.

770
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,120
It's your son.

771
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,120
First, he looks like a man.

772
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,120
Are all the clothes suitable?

773
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,120
Yes.

774
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,120
No.

775
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,120
Why not?

776
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,120
I...

777
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,120
I don't want to wear a dress.

778
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,120
I designed it wrong.

779
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,120
I want to wear pants like them.

780
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,120
Why?

781
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,120
I don't like this suit.

782
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,120
The dress must be

783
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,120
a little smaller than the long dress we usually wear.

784
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,120
But on holidays,

785
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,120
we must wear the dress.

786
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,120
This is called etiquette.

787
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,120
You don't feel good wearing it.

788
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,120
You don't live in etiquette.

789
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,120
Look at which girl

790
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,120
is like you, with a bad temper.

791
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,120
If you sit on the chair,

792
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,120
you won't feel uncomfortable.

793
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,120
Why don't you tie me up?

794
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,120
I'll be honest.

795
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,120
Mr. Song, I have a rope.

796
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,120
I can't tie you up.

797
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,120
You are really a monitor.

798
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,120
You are a monitor.

799
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,120
You are a monitor.

800
00:31:52,120 --> 00:32:04,820
Don't go to the

801
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,120
It looks like you didn't wear it.

802
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
This is the eighth great miracle of mankind.

803
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,120
You wore it all.

804
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,120
Enough.

805
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,120
I'll buy you one.

806
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,120
My nephew loves me.

807
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,120
If there is no problem with your clothes,

808
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,120
wash it quickly

809
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,120
in the next two days.

810
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,120
We will wear this.

811
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,120
Okay.

812
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,120
Okay, let's go.

813
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,120
Our Qingming Ji group

814
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,120
needs to cook

815
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,120
the dishes themselves,

816
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,120
including the Qingtuan.

817
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
So these two days,

818
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,120
prepare the ingredients you need.

819
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,120
No.

820
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,120
If I know that it's going to be a festival,

821
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,120
I won't celebrate it.

822
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,120
Mom, I'm too tight.

823
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,120
It's too tight.

824
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,120
What's wrong?

825
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,120
Look.

826
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,120
Isn't this good?

827
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,120
Little idiot.

828
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,120
Okay, get in the car.

829
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,120
Okay.

830
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,120
Good morning, Mr. Song.

831
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,120
Good morning.

832
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,120
Hao Zong.

833
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
Hao Zong, where are you going?

834
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,120
Slow down. Don't fall.

835
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,120
I'm going to see the thing.

836
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,120
Go.

837
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,120
I bought you a pair of underwear.

838
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
Why didn't you wear it?

839
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,120
That one.

840
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,120
My sister's.

841
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
It's too tight.

842
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
I can't wear it.

843
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,120
Slow down.

844
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,120
You two saw it.

845
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,120
I can't wear this little girl.

846
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,120
Shengda, I'll leave it to you.

847
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,120
How dare I say she?

848
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,120
She's my uncle.

849
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,120
No hurry.

850
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,120
We're not in a hurry.

851
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
Five hundred years.

852
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,120
We can definitely get it.

853
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,120
Five hundred years?

854
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
I'm not going to live like an old witch.

855
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,120
Tang Zeng became a monkey

856
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,120
and became a prisoner.

857
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,120
We just put a fake kid

858
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,120
back in the palace.

859
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,120
It's much simpler.

860
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,120
Let me ask Mr. Ren.

861
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,120
You used to be so strict with students.

862
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,120
Students are afraid of you.

863
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,120
Why are you so partial to Toto?

864
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,120
You have no principles, right?

865
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,120
Mr. Ren,

866
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,120
I'm asking you the same question.

867
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,120
Is that true?

868
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,120
Yes.

869
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,120
Tell me.

870
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
You caught a cold?

871
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Go and drink some soup.

872
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,120
I felt a little heavy

873
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
when I touched your pulse today.

874
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
I'll take it.

875
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,120
I'll put it in the car later.

876
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,120
No, no, no.

877
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,120
Go.

878
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,120
Go.

879
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,120
Mr. Ren.

880
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,120
Uncle.

881
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
Uncle.

882
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
Your wife.

883
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,120
Every tree behind your wife

884
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,120
is like a red thread.

885
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,120
What kind of ritual is this?

886
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,120
This is to bring back

887
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
all the ghosts in the mountains.

888
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,120
I don't feel good about it.

889
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,120
Students, listen.

890
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,120
There are many

891
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,120
different paths in this mountain.

892
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,120
If you get lost

893
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,120
in the night when you go down the mountain,

894
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,120
you can't go wrong

895
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,120
if you go down

896
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,120
along that sign.

897
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,120
Please don't fall behind.

898
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,120
Because there are wolves,

899
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,120
bears and wild boars in this mountain.

900
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,120
You must pay attention.

901
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,120
Okay.

902
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,120
You're lying to me.

903
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,120
There are so many people

904
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,120
walking along this road.

905
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,120
How can there be wolves,

906
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,120
wild boars and beasts?

907
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,120
How can it be possible?

908
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,120
There was no wolves before.

909
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,120
Now,

910
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,120
after more than 20 years,

911
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,120
young people in the local area

912
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,120
have gone to work in the city.

913
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,120
Some of their parents

914
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,120
are old.

915
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,120
Some of them have passed away.

916
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,120
So,

917
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,120
some houses are abandoned.

918
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,120
The forest

919
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,120
is slowly growing.

920
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,120
Wild beasts

921
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,120
can also be seen here.

922
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,120
Come on.

923
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,120
Let's go.

924
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,120
You're here.

925
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,120
Yes.

926
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120
Isn't the wild boar

927
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,120
natural fertilizer?

928
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
Why do you pick it up?

929
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,120
It's a medicine.

930
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,120
Medicine?

931
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,120
Guys,

932
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,120
have you ever

933
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,120
done a medicine experiment?

934
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,120
When I was in college,

935
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,120
I learned

936
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,120
the basic theory of winter.

937
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,120
I knew

938
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,120
that bats and snakes

939
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,120
are not the same.

940
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,120
I knew that

941
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,120
bats and snakes

942
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,120
are not the same.

943
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,120
I knew that

944
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,120
bats and snakes are the same.

945
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,120
It's also called the same.

946
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,120
But I was confused.

947
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,120
Bats eat different things

948
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,120
every day.

949
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,120
They can't pull out the same things.

950
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,120
How do you know

951
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,120
which bats can pull out

952
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,120
the same things?

953
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
How to say?

954
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,120
You can pick one up

955
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,120
and give it to the patients.

956
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,120
It's irresponsible.

957
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,120
Do you like

958
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,120
cat's poop coffee?

959
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,120
Are the standards

960
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,120
you have checked

961
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,120
the same?

962
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,120
They're different, aren't they?

963
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,120
Eating poop is not just a medicine.

964
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,120
Don't underestimate

965
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,120
the poop.

966
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,120
In this world,

967
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,120
any existence

968
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,120
has its own meaning.

969
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,120
Some animals' poop

970
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,120
is more expensive than gold.

971
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,120
You can check it online.

972
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,120
At this moment,

973
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,120
it should be

974
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,120
eight thousand to ten thousand.

975
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,120
What animal?

976
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,120
What animal?

977
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,120
It's so expensive.

978
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,120
It's so expensive.

979
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,120
Then tell me.

980
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,120
I'll go back and raise one.

981
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,120
Then I'll send it to pull it every day.

982
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,120
I'll change the money when it pulls it.

983
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,120
The name of this animal

984
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,120
is Mo Xiang Jing.

985
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,120
A head of Mo Xiang Jing

986
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,120
weighs about

987
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,120
50 tons.

988
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,120
You can raise it.

989
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,120
It's amazing.

990
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,120
The poop that Mo Xiang Jing

991
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,120
pulls out

992
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,120
is called Long Xian Xiang.

993
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,120
For example,

994
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,120
we burn incense

995
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,120
and use perfume.

996
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,120
It's amazing

997
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,120
to have it in it.

998
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,120
So,

999
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,120
don't underestimate the poop.

1000
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,120
The poop forweigh

1001
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,120
Shi Ji wages,

1002
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,120
in wholeovy dried plants,

1003
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,120
it becomes more expensive

1004
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,120
if we should use

1005
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,120
the poop during the Up upset?

1006
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,120
You can get the definition

1007
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,120
from Wu Ling Zhi.

1008
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,120
Up upset is still being used at present.

1009
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,120
So what's the spot

1010
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,120
of Similarity between the Japanese medicine

1011
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,120
and Western medicine?

1012
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,120
It's hope that

1013
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,120
one can stay healthy for a long time.

1014
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,120
If one is unhealthy,

1015
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,120
each day one can use medicine

1016
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,120
and everything to maintain a healthy life.

1017
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,120
That's not the protox landmark for bake have weight gain.

1018
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,120
It's

1019
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,120
It's hard to live with them.

1020
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,120
Uncle, where is the animal?

1021
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,120
Where can we find it?

1022
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,120
In the sea.

1023
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,120
Let's go.

1024
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,120
How much can the horse we just picked be worth?

1025
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:39,120
There will always be some youth

1026
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:44,120
Like a rain without a trace

1027
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:49,120
There will always be some people

1028
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,120
Like the stars in the long night

1029
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:58,120
Time is silent

1030
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,120
Don't say that

1031
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,120
The one who is in the wilderness has really been here.

1032
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,120
The fruits are fresh.

1033
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,120
Right?

1034
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,120
This teacher Huang Mei is very famous.

1035
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,120
She died for decades.

1036
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,120
Still, someone came to pay her respects.

1037
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,120
What?

1038
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,120
Come here.

1039
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,120
What?

1040
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,120
The ceremony is about to start.

1041
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,120
The doctor is going to treat you.

1042
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,120
Come here.

1043
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,120
Come here.

1044
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,120
The doctor is quite accurate.

1045
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,120
I sometimes wear more pants than they do.

1046
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,120
Tie the cord.

1047
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,120
Tuo Tuo, you have to look carefully.

1048
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,120
You are the successor of Jiang's Zhen Sect.

1049
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,120
After Jiang's Zhen Sect,

1050
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,120
you will lead the juniors

1051
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,120
to the ancestors.

1052
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,120
Members, today is still Qingming Festival.

1053
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,120
Then we will take a vacation.

1054
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,120
Qingming Festival is one of the 24 festivals.

1055
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,120
The emperor's inner spirit says that

1056
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,120
people are in line with the heaven and earth.

1057
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,120
Then the sick people

1058
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,120
are in line with the heaven and earth.

1059
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,120
Then what does the Chinese doctor see as a disease?

1060
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,120
He sees the sick people

1061
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,120
instead of the disease of life.

1062
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,120
If you are in line with the heaven and earth

1063
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,120
and let him feel the changes of the four seasons,

1064
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,120
and act according to the rules,

1065
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,120
then you are not far from loyalty and justice.

1066
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,120
Secondly,

1067
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,120
Qingming is still an important event

1068
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,120
for the ancestors of the four seasons.

1069
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,120
I hope that everyone will be sincere

1070
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:52,120
and pay respects to our holy ancestors.

1071
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,120
Qingming Festival

1072
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,120
Tao, your luggage.

1073
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,120
I don't know anyone.

1074
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,120
I'm not a young girl.

1075
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,120
I think it's too much.

1076
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,120
Suddenly.

1077
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,120
It's strange.

1078
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,120
Let us read the Great One Book of the Capital

1079
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,120
before Mr. Huang's tomb.

1080
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,120
To the ancestors.

1081
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,120
There is someone in the future.

1082
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,120
The original intention is not changed.

1083
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,120
The old dead is injured.

1084
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,120
It's the wisdom of the five branches.

1085
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,120
Great One Book of the Capital

1086
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,120
Can he hear you reading it?

1087
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:38,120
Can he hear you reading it?

1088
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,120
He can't hear you.

1089
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,120
He can't hear you.

1090
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,120
He can't.

1091
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:19,120
There will be some youth

1092
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:23,120
that has nothing to do with hatred

1093
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,120
There will be some people

1094
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,120
like the stars in the long night

1095
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:38,120
Time is silent

1096
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,120
Memories are hard to memorize

1097
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:49,120
The food and drinks in memories

1098
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,120
are warm and equal

1099
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,120
If there is no pain in life

1100
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,120
I will light a lamp for you

1101
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,120
The people in the light

1102
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,120
are just ordinary identities

1103
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,120
Light ordinary people's souls

1104
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:13,120
with ordinary bodies

1105
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,120
The people in the light

1106
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:19,120
are just ordinary identities

1107
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,120
Light ordinary people's souls

1108
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:26,120
with ordinary bodies

1109
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,120
The people in the light

1110
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:33,120

Light ordinary people's souls

1112
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,120

1113
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,120
The people in the light

1114
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,120
are just ordinary identities

1115
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,120
Light ordinary people's souls

1116
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,120
with ordinary bodies

1117
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,120
Light ordinary people's souls

1118
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,120
with ordinary bodies

1119
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,120
With a sentence

1120
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:00,120
We cure the coldness of this world

1121
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,120
The people in the light

1122
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,120
are just ordinary identities

1123
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,120
Light ordinary people's souls

1124
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,120
with ordinary bodies

1125
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,120
The people in the light

1126
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,120
are just ordinary identities

1127
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,120
Light ordinary people's souls

1128
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,120
with ordinary bodies

1129
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,120
The people in the light

1130
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,120
are just ordinary identities

1131
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,120
Light ordinary people's souls

1132
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,120
with ordinary bodies

1133
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,120
The people in the light

1134
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,120
are just ordinary identities

1135
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,120
Light ordinary people's souls
