The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,600
You have such a big family to inherit.

4
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,600
You don't care about the elderly?

5
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,800
No.

6
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,200
You don't know my mom.

7
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,000
She won't turn against me.

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,400
After a while, this problem will be solved.

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Did your mom fall in love with Mengmeng?

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

11
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I think you and your dad don't love my niece.

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's her who loves you.

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You two are both blind.

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Don't try to make me understand.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Why don't I love my mom?

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm not trying to make you understand.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I don't have a mom.

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If I had a mom,

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I wouldn't be sad because of others.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If I were my niece,

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I would have given you a hard time.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm just telling you.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You really don't know.

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The person my mom loves the most

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
is my son.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I know.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Wait.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What should I do if you leave?

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What does it have to do with you?

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
If you leave,

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
there will be four elderly people in the house

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and eight eyes.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm the only one.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Can I be free?

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Then you should cherish it.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I can help you

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
to share your energy.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's been a few days.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
No, don't go.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's none of your business.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
White-eyed wolf.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Shen Tianzhen, you are a white-eyed wolf.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Really.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You big white-eyed wolf.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Mom is here.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Ren Tianzhen,

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm your mom.

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Are you really going to do this

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
for Mengmeng?

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm your son,

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
but Mengmeng is also my patient.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You are an adult with a strong mind.

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He is not.

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Now the situation is two-in-one.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I must choose him.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Because he is a patient,

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
you can't have a private relationship

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
with him

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
in any way.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This is the rule.

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If I really get along with him,

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I can't wait for my parents to be happy.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I wish I could get rid of this burden quickly.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll take care of it.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You said you've been

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
suffering from mom's grievance

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
since you were born.

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Did I give you

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
all the freedom you want?

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You must listen to me

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
when it comes to choosing a girlfriend.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Mom, don't forget.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Your power range

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
will stop

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
when you come to my dad.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Don't be too strict.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I know.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I know.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I know.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I know.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I know.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I know.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I know.

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I know.

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I know.

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I know.

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You must be in my power range.

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Mengmeng can stay.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes.

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Of course.

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You can only rest easy

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
under my nose.

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Mom,

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
you should take care of the family.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Go ahead.

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Bye.

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Hello.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm calling

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
for the rent.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't need it now.

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Thank you for your time.

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Sorry for the trouble.

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
OK.

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
OK.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,280
Grth crate

106
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,140
Mom

107
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,740
Come here.

108
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,740
What is he doing there?

109
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,140
Master.

110
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,540
Aren't we going to the clinic? Why are we going into the mountains again?

111
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,540
The father and son are getting vaccinated before the snow falls.

112
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,340
So we have to go and see if the father and son are getting vaccinated first.

113
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,140
Then we'll go to the clinic.

114
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,940
The earthquake has a huge impact on the father and son's recovery.

115
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,140
So we've been coming here every year when the child is in the pregnancy.

116
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,740
It's not too bad now.

117
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,740
The father and son who are sent to the clinic this year are getting more and more intelligent.

118
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,740
You don't feel well?

119
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,340
Sun, drive slowly.

120
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,540
If you keep going like that, the mother will throw up.

121
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,140
I don't want to either, but we have to climb the mountain today.

122
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,140
If we don't drive faster, we won't be able to get there before it gets dark.

123
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,140
No!

124
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,940
I'll sit next to her and she'll throw up on me.

125
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,340
There's a plastic bag over there.

126
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,940
Mom, hold on a little longer.

127
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,340
The river is really old.

128
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,340
Look at my master and my mother.

129
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,140
They're not hurt at all.

130
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,140
Look at my mother. She's closing her eyes. She's feeling comfortable.

131
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,940
What is this?

132
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,140
I've followed your master all my life.

133
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,140
I've been to the north and south, but I've never done anything wrong.

134
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,140
I even had a month without a bath.

135
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,140
What is this?

136
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,140
What is this?

137
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,140
These are department stores.

138
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:55,380
The

139
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,900
Good

140
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,020
Do not

141
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,340
Don't

142
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:08,540
Don't

143
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:08,940
Don't

144
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,660
Don't

145
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:09,980
A

146
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,940
This way, please.

147
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,840
Thank you, King.

148
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,280
Everyone!

149
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,100
There was something really wrong with Yiusi that day.

150
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,580
There wasき般を使えば 落ち着いた

151
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,640
If Yiusi is a man,

152
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,340
we can then bring YShould.

153
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,540
People aren't supposed to everyone be alone.

154
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,540
I'm tired.

155
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,540
I'll take a break.

156
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,540
Okay.

157
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,540
Why did you choose that song?

158
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,540
It's not your style.

159
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,540
When I was in the nursing home,

160
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,540
I was so tired that I didn't want to sleep.

161
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,540
Then,

162
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,540
I asked my aunt to hold me.

163
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,540
I was looking at her shoulder.

164
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,540
She was singing.

165
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,540
I was so tired.

166
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,540
I was so tired.

167
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,540
I was so tired.

168
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,540
I was so tired.

169
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,540
I was so tired.

170
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,540
She was singing.

171
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,540
I didn't fall asleep when I was walking in the yard.

172
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,540
I'm a child of the flood.

173
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,540
I don't remember my mom.

174
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,540
But

175
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,540
I can remember every time I hear this song.

176
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,540
I feel like I'm leaning on her shoulder.

177
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,540
That's the only impression I have of my mom.

178
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,540
The sky is full of stars.

179
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,540
I look for a chance to light up the fire.

180
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,540
The sky is full of stars.

181
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,540
You're still singing.

182
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,540
You're not singing.

183
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,540
The song is over.

184
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,540
I just sang it.

185
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,540
Hurry up.

186
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,540
When will the night sky be clear?

187
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,540
The sky is full of stars.

188
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,540
The snow is falling.

189
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,540
You will be in the sky.

190
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,540
The sky is full of stars.

191
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,540
I look for a chance to light up the fire.

192
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,540
It's okay.

193
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,540
How far is it from the sky?

194
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,540
Not far.

195
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,540
The sound of the three-way road is loud.

196
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,540
It's so close.

197
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,540
It's still a long way.

198
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,540
Go.

199
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,540
Slow down.

200
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,540
Go.

201
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,540
Follow me.

202
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,540
Four hours have passed.

203
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,540
It's been more than five hours since you got off the car

204
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,540
and started cooking when you climbed the mountain.

205
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,540
It's definitely not out of fire.

206
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,540
It's not out of fire.

207
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,540
Let's eat.

208
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,540
Let's eat.

209
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,540
What's the most important thing in this dish?

210
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,540
The most important thing is the taste.

211
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,540
The most important thing is the taste.

212
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,540
What's the most important thing in this dish?

213
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,540
Do you know?

214
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,540
The most important thing in this dish is

215
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,540
it must be cooked for more than four hours.

216
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,540
And it can't be out of fire.

217
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,540
You're talking about the chicken soup.

218
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,540
Yes.

219
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,540
There are father and son in this soup.

220
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,540
Father and son have five heads and five tails.

221
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,540
Five heads and tails are toxic.

222
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,540
We have to get rid of this toxicity.

223
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,540
Father and son can only play their part.

224
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,540
Uncle, can you say it earlier?

225
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,540
The chicken feet are all eaten up.

226
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,540
Isn't it a little late to say it now?

227
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,540
What if you get poisoned and die?

228
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,540
I ate it all.

229
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,540
Everyone ate it.

230
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,540
What are you afraid of eating?

231
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,540
Is your life more precious than everyone else's?

232
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,540
No, we are both descendants.

233
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,540
There are heavy burdens on our shoulders.

234
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,540
I can't live for myself.

235
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,540
Many people are waiting for us to make a contribution.

236
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,540
I don't drink anymore.

237
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,540
Here, I'll drink it.

238
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,540
Don't worry, Toto.

239
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,540
You don't drink anymore?

240
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,540
This soup is cooked by your master.

241
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,540
Don't worry.

242
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,540
Professor Ren is a kind person.

243
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,540
Our family has invited him personally.

244
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,540
He helped us to measure the sky and earth.

245
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,540
He helped us to grow the land.

246
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,540
Father, son, horse, and gold.

247
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,540
Our village has seen it.

248
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,540
The chicken feet are not eggs and dogs are not poop.

249
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,540
It's not convenient to go in and out.

250
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,540
Now, Professor Ren is here.

251
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,540
He takes care of the people.

252
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,540
We have become people who take care of our salary.

253
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,540
This father and son are poisonous.

254
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,540
We must treat it as a common thing.

255
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,540
It should be promoted for a long time.

256
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,540
We will grow it big.

257
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,540
No pesticide.

258
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,540
The food has chicken and fat.

259
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,540
This medicine can be good.

260
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,540
If the Chinese medicine is not good,

261
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,540
the Chinese medicine will be over.

262
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,540
Don't worry, Professor Ren.

263
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,540
We are all acting according to your guidance.

264
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,540
We dare not to be lazy.

265
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,540
What do you mean?

266
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,540
Just a few feet of chicken feet

267
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,540
can still have electric shock in the wound.

268
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,540
We should thank Professor Ren.

269
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,540
After Professor Ren came,

270
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,540
he found that we are suitable for the father and son.

271
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,540
He helped us to choose the land.

272
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,540
He helped us to develop the cultivation technology.

273
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,540
He also helped us to contact the e-commerce.

274
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,540
He helped us to advertise.

275
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,540
I told you that you might not believe it.

276
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:07,540
Now, many foreigners come to us to collect medicinal materials.

277
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,540
We will be serious and serious.

278
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,540
As long as we guarantee the quality of the medicine,

279
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,540
you will be able to help us.

280
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,540
We are very grateful to Professor Ren.

281
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,540
Since we developed the medicine,

282
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,540
we have done many things and made many money.

283
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,540
In the past, the village was full of children and old people.

284
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,540
Young people went to work in the city.

285
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,540
Now, the income in the village is good.

286
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,540
Young people are back.

287
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,540
The children have their parents' company.

288
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,540
This is like what Professor Ren said.

289
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,540
What is fishing?

290
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,540
How to say it?

291
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,540
Young people are back.

292
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,540
Young people are back.

293
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,540
Yes, that's what I mean.

294
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,540
Professor Ren will help us to develop the cultivation technology.

295
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,540
Come on.

296
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,540
Let's have a bowl of chicken soup.

297
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,540
Thank you.

298
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,540
Thank you.

299
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,540
The village is now a big city.

300
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,540
The old and the new.

301
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,540
The village is now a big city.

302
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,540
Thank you.

303
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,540
Thank you.

304
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,540
You are welcome.

305
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,540
Thank you.

306
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,540
Thank you.

307
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,540
You are welcome.

308
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,540
Thank you.

309
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,540
Hello.

310
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,540
Hello.

311
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,780
to train us for free,

312
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,180
to treat us for free,

313
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,300
and to donate money.

314
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,020
It should be you who should be grateful.

315
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,420
It's what we should do.

316
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,620
Is the assistant coach

317
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,620
still the village doctor

318
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,780
who trained you last time?

319
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,700
Not only them,

320
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,340
but also many village doctors

321
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,780
want to come and join the training.

322
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,620
We thought that

323
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,900
the professors were too hard

324
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,740
and didn't agree.

325
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,780
It's okay.

326
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:03,700
They all come.

327
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,140
The more people, the better.

328
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,420
Professor Ren,

329
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,620
you don't know that

330
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,780
the village doctors who trained us last time

331
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,420
have become

332
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,900
famous doctors in our local area.

333
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,660
They are all busy and can't be taught.

334
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,060
We still have to

335
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,100
continue with the training.

336
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,900
The more village doctors,

337
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,900
the better the patients will be.

338
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,820
Okay.

339
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,820
Please teach us.

340
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,580
Okay.

341
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,260
Okay.

342
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,580
Come on.

343
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,900
Give me your ID cards.

344
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,900
Chen Jian, your ID card.

345
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,300
Come on.

346
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,420
Brother Rui, your ID card.

347
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,180
No, I can do it myself later.

348
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,980
You're hiding it so well.

349
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,380
What's your ID card?

350
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,020
Are you a fugitive?

351
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,700
You're so smart.

352
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,420
Here you are.

353
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,820
Hello, I want to be the assistant coach.

354
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,260
Wait over there.

355
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,740
We have a lot of people today.

356
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,820
Isn't it faster

357
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,100
if you two work together?

358
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,620
Actually, you're the only assistant coach.

359
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,780
Why are you so anxious?

360
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,380
Here, take your ID card.

361
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,020
One room, one card.

362
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,140
Look at the floor.

363
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,140
Excuse me.

364
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,220
There's only one card

365
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,420
in each room.

366
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,220
Do you need a card?

367
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,260
Yes.

368
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,500
No, I need two.

369
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,780
Here's the thing.

370
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,380
We're like this.

371
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,700
And then,

372
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,260
if you pay another card,

373
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,780
you have to pay 1,000 yuan.

374
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,380
That's unreasonable.

375
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,380
Rui.

376
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,380
Here, you live in this room.

377
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,060
You plug in your SIM card

378
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,340
and you can use it.

379
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,620
Hello.

380
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,820
Please change this ID card

381
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,580
to his.

382
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,420
Here you are.

383
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,700
No need.

384
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,620
It's all set.

385
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,460
You can change it

386
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,660
if you want.

387
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:18,020
There will always be some youth

388
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,220
that has nothing to do with hatred.

389
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:27,660
There will always be some people

390
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,660
that are like the stars in the long night.

391
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,780
Time is fast but there is no injury.

392
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,020
What a beautiful memory.

393
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,220
What are you looking at?

394
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:15,780
What are you looking at?

395
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,820
You have to go your real life.

396
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:29,260
I left

397
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,620
these on you.

398
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,340
I used them everywhere.

399
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,940
I know sun is out,

400
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,380
sun is up.

401
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,900
But these are Hey friendships cards.

402
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,700
Yes, I know about this.

403
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,220
Do you want to sit down?

404
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,340
No, I can't sit down.

405
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:43,940
Okay.

406
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,460
No one changed it for me in the water pool.

407
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,540
Do you hear me?

408
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,540
I want to change the towel.

409
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,980
We changed it at once.

410
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,660
If I live here for 15 days

411
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,460
and half a month,

412
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,180
will you not change it for me?

413
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,740
Look, the towel is wet.

414
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,020
It can't be used.

415
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,340
It's not a big deal.

416
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,460
What do you mean?

417
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,220
It's not your problem.

418
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,260
But it's my problem.

419
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:07,980
I want to change the towel.

420
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,900
Do you hear me?

421
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,820
Hello, what's up?

422
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,180
Listen.

423
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,340
My sister-in-law

424
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,260
works at home.

425
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,660
It's not her problem.

426
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,020
I didn't change it the other day.

427
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,980
Do you know that?

428
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,260
I didn't change it the other day.

429
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:19,780
I didn't change it the other day.

430
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,780
Stop!

431
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,500
Change the towel!

432
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,820
How about this?

433
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,380
Give it to me.

434
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,740
I'll change it for you.

435
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,620
No.

436
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,860
We always change it at once.

437
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,700
How about this?

438
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,540
I'll leave the room now.

439
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,500
Then I'll check in again.

440
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,300
Is that okay?

441
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:36,980
Can you

442
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,780
change the towel for me?

443
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,220
I don't know you.

444
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,460
If you leave the room again,

445
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,340
your face will not change.

446
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,180
Alright.

447
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,100
Stop it.

448
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,020
Do you have a washing machine?

449
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,820
I'll wash it myself.

450
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,700
Is that okay?

451
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,820
We don't have a washing machine.

452
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,060
No.

453
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:52,900
We have one.

454
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,540
But we can't use it now.

455
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,340
Sister.

456
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:57,980
What's wrong?

457
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,900
Why are you here?

458
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,740
The washing machine

459
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,980
can't be used at all.

460
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,060
It's full of

461
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:02,860
sweet potatoes,

462
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,460
potatoes,

463
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,740
and other stuff.

464
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,220
We can't wash our clothes.

465
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:06,900
That one.

466
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,380
No one can use our washing machine.

467
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,380
It's not easy to

468
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,180
have a washing machine

469
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,540
and not use it.

470
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,020
Okay?

471
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,180
You said you had a washing machine.

472
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,060
But you said you didn't.

473
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,020
You're lying.

474
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,380
You know?

475
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,340
There are too many problems.

476
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,060
Who said that?

477
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,860
You have one, right?

478
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,860
Yes.

479
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,860
Then you can

480
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,860
help me

481
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,620
clean the sweet potatoes

482
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,300
and potatoes.

483
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:24,580
Okay.

484
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,300
I'll check it

485
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,300
to see if it's broken.

486
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,340
Can you use it?

487
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:27,820
No problem.

488
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,140
I'll clean it now.

489
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,580
Thank you.

490
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,340
Don't worry.

491
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,020
Thank you.

492
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,940
Don't bother about them.

493
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,620
They're so cautious.

494
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,100
Alright.

495
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,740
Go and check it.

496
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,340
Thank you.

497
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,220
It's okay.

498
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:38,820
Go.

499
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,340
Hurry up.

500
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,140
Okay.

501
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,060
Mr. Zhang.

502
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,940
Have some tea.

503
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,340
Mr. Zhang.

504
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,220
I have something to ask you.

505
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,260
Go ahead.

506
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:57,900
I don't understand

507
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,380
why you come here every year.

508
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,340
Do they deserve it?

509
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,620
What's wrong?

510
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,860
I've never seen

511
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,460
anyone so lazy in this world.

512
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,340
The country

513
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,020
sent them to the door

514
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,700
and sent them

515
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,900
the fish.

516
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,180
They almost opened their mouths

517
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,340
and fed them.

518
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,140
But what do they do every day?

519
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,500
They do nothing

520
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,700
and just enjoy themselves.

521
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,900
They only talk about

522
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,460
something boring

523
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,220
and meaningless

524
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,580
except for phone calls.

525
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,300
I don't understand

526
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,580
what's the meaning

527
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,580
and value of our poverty.

528
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,820
Actually,

529
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,740
it's not all

530
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,460
what you said.

531
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,380
There are many people

532
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,820
working hard

533
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,380
and living seriously.

534
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,820
Anyway, I've been here for so many days.

535
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,540
I've seen

536
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,700
at least half of the people

537
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,380
are lazy.

538
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,020
Isn't it

539
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,100
too high?

540
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,500
Yang,

541
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,420
there are many people

542
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,500
who are lazy.

543
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,380
You're so rich.

544
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,180
You can't ask everyone

545
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,500
to be like you.

546
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,460
Am I right?

547
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,180
Uncle.

548
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,700
Do you want to wash your clothes?

549
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,180
I'll help you.

550
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,100
No.

551
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,060
It's been days.

552
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,780
Master,

553
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,060
we're here to help the poor.

554
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,780
We're not here to raise the lazy.

555
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,900
We're here to help them.

556
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,860
At least, they have to go by themselves.

557
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,580
We can't help them.

558
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,540
What do you think, Toto?

559
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,100
What do I think?

560
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,940
I don't think about anything.

561
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,060
I just want to ask

562
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,380
if you want to wash your clothes.

563
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,940
Because you've been working so hard.

564
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,660
If you don't wash your clothes,

565
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,660
you can't change your clothes.

566
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,300
If some people are particularly lazy

567
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,500
and don't do anything,

568
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,340
will you be anxious?

569
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,300
It's the same.

570
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,380
Why should I be anxious?

571
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,460
I'm just anxious about my clothes.

572
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,660
It might rain today.

573
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,900
I'm afraid it won't dry.

574
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,420
Will you wash your clothes?

575
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,340
No.

576
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,580
By the way,

577
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,220
Uncle,

578
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,540
I just went back to see my bag.

579
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,900
There's a new towel in it.

580
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,380
If you want it, I'll get it for you.

581
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,260
I'm so tired.

582
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:03,900
You...

583
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,060
Yang,

584
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,980
sometimes,

585
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,220
you should learn from Toto.

586
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,380
Empty talk,

587
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,340
empty words.

588
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,500
In fact, everyone of us

589
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,860
who comes to this world

590
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,500
has his own mission.

591
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,260
Some people have found it,

592
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,820
some people haven't.

593
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,660
If you've found it,

594
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,060
you should help

595
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,100
those who haven't found it.

596
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,260
There's a human scientist

597
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,460
named Markleet Meade.

598
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,700
He once said

599
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,100
the original symbol of human civilization

600
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,700
is not fire

601
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,140
or tools.

602
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,820
But he found

603
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,300
a broken and interweaving

604
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,060
ancient thing.

605
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,500
What does it mean?

606
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,740
It means human beings have feelings.

607
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,220
We should help the weak.

608
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,020
In fact, you've read a lot of books.

609
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,140
You have independent thinking ability.

610
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,940
You're very rational.

611
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,300
You just lack a little bit.

612
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,980
Toto, what should I say?

613
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,900
Calm down.

614
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,460
Human feelings.

615
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,260
But I don't think

616
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,100
I lack human feelings.

617
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,740
I just think we should help

618
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,220
those who deserve it.

619
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,020
The ancient and pre-existing immortals you mentioned

620
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,580
are not relying on physical strength.

621
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,140
They're just wise.

622
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,260
So they can't find the direction

623
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,820
even if they leave.

624
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,060
Think about it.

625
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,180
They may not come.

626
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,180
They're just the weak.

627
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,900
Didn't Master say

628
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,340
that those who want to lie down

629
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,180
and do nothing

630
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,620
and don't want to work

631
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,260
may be in a bad mood, right?

632
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,740
They just don't want to move.

633
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,820
It's a disease.

634
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,780
We should treat them.

635
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,540
We're here to treat them.

636
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,140
I think I'm sick, too.

637
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,420
I'll take a break.

638
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,900
You need to rest.

639
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,900
Do you want to wash it?

640
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,740
No.

641
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,420
You're so annoying.

642
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,060
You're so ungrateful.

643
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,140
You haven't washed it for days.

644
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,820
Sister.

645
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,660
I've written down

646
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,060
the steps of washing machine

647
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,700
for you.

648
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,700
You can use this washing machine

649
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,340
to wash it.

650
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,340
You can put it on the front desk.

651
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,340
You can watch it every day.

652
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,260
I can learn it.

653
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,940
What can't you learn?

654
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,500
You can learn it in ten characters.

655
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,100
You've written it down so clearly.

656
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,100
Isn't it clear?

657
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,820
Little girl.

658
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,020
Let me tell you the truth.

659
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,460
I do this job

660
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,660
to save money.

661
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,660
I've used washing machine.

662
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,500
I have to be responsible for it.

663
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,340
It's so troublesome.

664
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,660
Last time, I was looking for something

665
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,900
to climb the ladder and wipe the door.

666
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,340
I fell down

667
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,260
when I stepped on it.

668
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,860
My leg was broken.

669
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,380
After I got it,

670
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,580
I thought

671
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,180
whether I should wipe the glass.

672
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,500
I didn't care.

673
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,540
My leg was broken.

674
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,740
It's mine.

675
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,420
Yes.

676
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,260
Yes.

677
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,060
It makes sense.

678
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,540
Are you PUA me?

679
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,540
What's PUA?

680
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,540
Wash clothes.

681
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,540
What are you doing?

682
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,540
This...

683
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,940
Is it working?

684
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,940
This is amazing.

685
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,940
This is good.

686
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,940
This is useful.

687
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,940
You can reach it no matter how high it is.

688
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,540
Right?

689
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,540
And when you take it down,

690
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,540
it's convenient to wash it with a new towel.

691
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,540
Right?

692
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,540
It's so clean.

693
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,540
It's so clean.

694
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,540
Is it working?

695
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,540
Yes.

696
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,540
It's so useful.

697
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,540
It's convenient to use.

698
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,540
Yes.

699
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,540
Look at the angle.

700
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,540
It's good.

701
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,540
It's good.

702
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,540
It's so convenient.

703
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,540
It's a new one.

704
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,540
I'm treating

705
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,540
two ladies with cervical cancer.

706
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,540
I told them

707
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,540
that it would be cured

708
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,540
in half an hour.

709
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,540
You're right.

710
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,540
If you persist

711
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,540
for half an hour

712
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,540
or an hour every day,

713
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,540
cervical cancer will be cured soon.

714
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,540
Yang,

715
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,540
you're good at finding problems.

716
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,540
This is amazing.

717
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,540
But what's more amazing

718
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,540
is how to solve the problem.

719
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,540
The method you used

720
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,540
is to ignore them,

721
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,540
starve them

722
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,540
and punish them.

723
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,540
If you do that,

724
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,540
they will be slower

725
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,540
and more passive.

726
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,540
No matter which one

727
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,540
takes the first step,

728
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,540
the game will change.

729
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,540
The game will change.

730
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,540
This is not good.

731
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,540
Slow down.

732
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,540
It's still too hard.

733
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,540
It's like this at the beginning.

734
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,540
It's so hard.

735
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,540
You're just

736
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,540
so angry.

737
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,540
After doing it several times,

738
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,540
you'll be clear.

739
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,540
I'll do it.

740
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,540
Thank you.

741
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,540
Take a rest.

742
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,540
Come on.

743
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,540
I'm sorry.

744
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,540
I'm sorry.

745
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,540
Who planted this?

746
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,540
It's so good.

747
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,540
Don't plant it again.

748
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,540
If you plant it again,

749
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,540
my medicine will die.

750
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,540
Don't worry.

751
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,540
I'll take care of it.

752
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,540
I won't cause you any trouble.

753
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,540
You cut so much.

754
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,540
It's so beautiful.

755
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,540
Look.

756
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,540
This is the part you wanted.

757
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,540
Here.

758
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,540
This part.

759
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,540
Yes.

760
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,540
Is it beautiful?

761
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,540
It's good.

762
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,540
This is a credit to you.

763
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,540
How do you know?

764
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,540
What do you want?

765
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,540
You're so naughty.

766
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,540
I'm not.

767
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,540
I'm just a little naughty.

768
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,540
I'm just a little naughty.

769
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,540
I'm just a little naughty.

770
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,540
Did you see it that day?

771
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,540
I don't know what you did.

772
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,540
You're monitoring.

773
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,540
Can I try one?

774
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,540
No.

775
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,540
There's a rotten one.

776
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,540
It's rotten. Take it off.

777
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,540
Mengmeng, do you want to tie one?

778
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,540
Come on.

779
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,540
Come on.

780
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,540
Yes.

781
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,540
Tie it here.

782
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,540
Pass it over.

783
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,540
Come on.

784
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,540
Yes.

785
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,540
Come on.

786
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,540
Later, the professor will come.

787
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,540
He'll be the organizer.

788
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,540
You're really...

789
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,540
Professor.

790
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,540
Professor.

791
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,540
Sorry to bother you again.

792
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,540
It's been a long time.

793
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,540
It's been a long time.

794
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,540
You're good.

795
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,540
I'm in good health now.

796
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,540
You're really...

797
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,540
I'm in good health now.

798
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,540
I'm in good health now.

799
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,540
I need to go to bed now.

800
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,540
I need to go to bed now.

801
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,540
Go to bed.

802
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,540
Go to bed.

803
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,540
Go to bed.

804
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,540
Go to bed.

805
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,540
It's been a long time.

806
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,140
Yes.

807
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,540
I'm here to ask you for help.

808
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,340
What's up?

809
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,340
Well,

810
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,540
my son.

811
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,140
Hello, uncle.

812
00:34:59,140 --> 00:34:59,740
My son.

813
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,140
You're so old.

814
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,940
Hello, uncle Wen.

815
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,540
Uncle Wen.

816
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,140
Liu.

817
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,340
You're older than me.

818
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,540
Just call me uncle.

819
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,740
Hello, uncle.

820
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,340
Hello.

821
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,140
What's up?

822
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,940
He has something to do.

823
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,140
I want to ask you

824
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,140
to help him

825
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,540
with depression.

826
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,540
Depression?

827
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,340
I'm not sick.

828
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,140
Liu,

829
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,540
what's wrong?

830
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,140
Don't get me wrong.

831
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,540
It's not depression.

832
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,740
It's like this.

833
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,340
It's okay for him to learn some sense of achievement.

834
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,140
He doesn't dare to take the exam of Harvard or Stanford.

835
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,740
But he can take the top 30

836
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,740
of the world.

837
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,740
He'll take the college entrance exam tomorrow.

838
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,140
He told me he didn't want to study today.

839
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,540
He can be

840
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,340
a...

841
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,140
a...

842
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,140
a what?

843
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,140
A trainee.

844
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,140
A debutant.

845
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:48,740
Look.

846
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,340
A trainee?

847
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,140
Your son?

848
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:54,540
He...

849
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,340
Are you going to take part in the contest?

850
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,740
The potential is the stock.

851
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,540
It's a good thing to be in the stock.

852
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,740
Look.

853
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,940
Look at what you said.

854
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,940
You're like a chicken's blood.

855
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,340
I started to dance in middle school.

856
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,340
You didn't know.

857
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,540
What's wrong with him?

858
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,740
He wants me to give them

859
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,740
a medical certificate.

860
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,740
You're so annoying.

861
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,340
You're so annoying.

862
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:14,940
Uncle Wen.

863
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,340
Uncle Wen.

864
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:16,940
He...

865
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,940
He can't even go to school now.

866
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,340
I'm just trying to

867
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,340
give him a long-term

868
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,540
medical certificate for school.

869
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,140
Right?

870
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,540
He'll be a student in three minutes.

871
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,140
He'll have a student when he comes back.

872
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,540
Or he'll be fired.

873
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:30,940
Can you bear to

874
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,140
let him

875
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,140
have no high school graduation certificate?

876
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,740
It's a good thing.

877
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,340
Come on.

878
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,340
Can you stop playing?

879
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,140
Sit down.

880
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,940
Liu, don't be anxious.

881
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,340
No.

882
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,140
Sit down.

883
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,340
Help me open it.

884
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:43,740
No.

885
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:44,940
I...

886
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,340
I'll ask the kid first.

887
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,140
Don't talk to him.

888
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,140
Why do you pick grass?

889
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,340
Do you need a ear?

890
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:52,940
Well,

891
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,740
my nephew.

892
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,340
Come on.

893
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,940
What's your name?

894
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,940
My name is Liu Zihong.

895
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,540
What a nice name.

896
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,940
I want to ask you.

897
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,340
You've decided

898
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,740
to go to the acting school.

899
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,340
Yes.

900
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,140
Have you thought about it?

901
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,540
If you

902
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,540
fail the exam or you fail the exam,

903
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,340
and you lose the competition,

904
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,740
what will you do in the future?

905
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,940
I'll choose first.

906
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:28,940
If I don't go,

907
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,340
there's no possibility.

908
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,540
If I go,

909
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,540
if I fail,

910
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,540
I'll choose tomorrow.

911
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,340
Give it to me.

912
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,340
Look.

913
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,140
Liu.

914
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:42,940
I know

915
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,940
you've helped me a lot.

916
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,140
This is the only thing

917
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,740
I can help you with.

918
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,940
I know you're good for the kid.

919
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,940
But I really

920
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,140
can't help you with this.

921
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,540
Do you think

922
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,940
I'm lying to you?

923
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,540
No.

924
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,940
It's abnormal

925
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,140
for a kid to think like that.

926
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,540
If it goes on like this,

927
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,340
I'll be depressed if he doesn't.

928
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,340
Liu.

929
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,740
This...

930
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,740
Street dance,

931
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,940
or show-testing,

932
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,140
I've never studied it.

933
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,540
How about this?

934
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,340
Toto.

935
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,740
Toto is right.

936
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,140
Toto thinks so.

937
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,140
That's good.

938
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:24,940
Me?

939
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,140
You're a successor.

940
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,140
Master.

941
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,140
Yes.

942
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:30,940
I'll listen to him.

943
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,140
He...

944
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,540
This is a big thing for my son.

945
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,340
Professor.

946
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,940
Let a kid be the master.

947
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,740
You're too much.

948
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,140
Life is for young people.

949
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,540
We can't always

950
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,140
treat them as children.

951
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,540
We're here

952
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,940
to supervise them

953
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,540
and let them have their thoughts.

954
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,940
Isn't it a good thing?

955
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,740
Toto.

956
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,340
Tell me your attitude.

957
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,340
You really want to pick me?

958
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,140
Of course.

959
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,740
I've been playing the prince since I was a kid.

960
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,140
I've always been the center of the stage.

961
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,340
And I'm going to the most

962
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,540
popular show in the world.

963
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,140
I'm going to the C-Side.

964
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:14,940
I'm going to break my legs.

965
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,140
I'll break your legs now.

966
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:16,940
Mr. Liu.

967
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,140
We know

968
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,340
that you've helped us a lot.

969
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,540
You're good to us.

970
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,340
But we may have other ways

971
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,740
to treat you.

972
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,540
For example,

973
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,540
we can take care of you

974
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,340
when you're old.

975
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,540
But I don't think

976
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,140
you can prove it.

977
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,140
Why not?

978
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:36,740
I think

979
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,140
he can't predict

980
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,740
if you're old.

981
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,740
You can prove it.

982
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,740
But you have to deal with it for a year.

983
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,540
What if your son

984
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,540
goes back to school and studies after a year?

985
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,540
He goes to Tsinghua Peking University.

986
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,940
If you have this proof,

987
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,740
will it affect you?

988
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,140
What if he's too hard-working

989
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,940
and wants to go to the civil service?

990
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,140
This proof

991
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,540
may really affect you.

992
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,340
What do you think?

993
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,740
Dad, listen to me.

994
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,940
I think you

995
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,740
are not suitable to pick me.

996
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,540
Go on.

997
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,340
I mean

998
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,140
you're not suitable to be in this stage.

999
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,140
You have one year to go to college.

1000
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,940
You don't have to be anxious.

1001
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,940
After you go to college,

1002
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,940
you can choose

1003
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,940
a university

1004
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,140
that you like.

1005
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:24,940
After you go to college,

1006
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,140
you can do

1007
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,540
whatever you want.

1008
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,940
I can't make it this year.

1009
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,940
You don't care about this year?

1010
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,740
Yes.

1011
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,940
I'm just one year away.

1012
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,940
I'm going to debut this year.

1013
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,940
Look.

1014
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,140
You're

1015
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,740
so happy now.

1016
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,740
I'm a little bit annoyed.

1017
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,940
I think you're a kid.

1018
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,340
I don't suggest you

1019
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,340
go this year.

1020
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,940
How do you

1021
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,340
fight against the case?

1022
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,340
You have to adjust your attitude

1023
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,740
and put the foundation in jail.

1024
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:51,740
You have to be

1025
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:52,740
good at

1026
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,140
your body and spirit.

1027
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:54,940
If you go again,

1028
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,540
you will win and lose.

1029
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,140
Did you hear that?

1030
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,940
The professor is right.

1031
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,740
At this time next year,

1032
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,340
you may not like to dance.

1033
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,140
You can change your financial management.

1034
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:06,740
Right?

1035
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,740
Don't be so ambitious.

1036
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,940
I will never

1037
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,340
live my own life

1038
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,540
as you planned.

1039
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,740
You're capable.

1040
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,740
Don't waste my money.

1041
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,740
I won't.

1042
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,540
You go.

1043
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,140
Sir.

1044
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:18,740
Sir.

1045
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,940
I heard you say

1046
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,340
the word destiny.

1047
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,140
Mr. Liu.

1048
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,140
Your son is really nice.

1049
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,140
He found his destiny

1050
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,940
at a young age.

1051
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,340
Well.

1052
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,940
He loves this thing

1053
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,740
and works hard to do it.

1054
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,740
I have a suggestion.

1055
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,940
Take a leave from school

1056
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,140
and keep studying and chasing your dream.

1057
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,340
Mr. Liu.

1058
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,940
You have to open your mind.

1059
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,140
It's normal for young people

1060
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,140
to chase their dreams.

1061
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,540
It's a positive thing.

1062
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,340
You dance hard now.

1063
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,940
It's possible that you win the prize

1064
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,940
and you can be famous.

1065
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,540
When the time comes,

1066
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,540
you can turn this thing over

1067
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,940
and stare at it

1068
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,940
with your eyes.

1069
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,740
You won't regret it.

1070
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,540
It's called

1071
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,740
falling down.

1072
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,740
It's very serious.

1073
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,340
Liu.

1074
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,740
What Toto said is right.

1075
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,140
Toto.

1076
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,740
I'm impressed by you.

1077
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,140
Liu, sit down.

1078
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,340
Let's do it

1079
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,740
as Toto said.

1080
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,340
Sometimes I look shaping

1081
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,540
and I have a thought.

1082
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,740
I used to have many high scores.

1083
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,140
But no matter how high I am at the time,

1084
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,740
I can't reach my high scores.

1085
00:42:44,940 --> 00:43:02,160
I wish I could reach my

1086
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,160
It's not about hatred

1087
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:12,160
There will always be some people

1088
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,160
Like the stars in the long night

1089
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,160
Time is silent

1090
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,160
Memories are all over the years

1091
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,160
The only thing I remember is the beautiful scenery

1092
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,160
All warm and equal

1093
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,160
Life is short if there is no pain

1094
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,160
I light a city for you

1095
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,160
People in the light are just ordinary identities

1096
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,160
Use ordinary body to illuminate ordinary people's souls

1097
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,160
Burn a wall of enthusiasm

1098
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:05,160
Use ordinary body to illuminate ordinary people's souls

1099
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,160
Burn a wall of enthusiasm

1100
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:17,160
Use ordinary body to illuminate ordinary people's souls

1101
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:24,160
Use ordinary body to illuminate ordinary people's souls

1102
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,320
is just an ordinary identity

1103
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,920
Light ordinary people with ordinary bodies

1104
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,400
Burn their souls

1105
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,800
Burn the passion that has been set on fire

1106
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,480
Use one sentence

1107
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,480
We only wish for the coldness of this world
