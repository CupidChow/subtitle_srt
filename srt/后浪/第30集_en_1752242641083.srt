1
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,800
Five hours later

2
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,440
kill

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You have to face all kinds of difficulties

4
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,440
and find a solution yourself.

5
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,120
You'll be able to get a job soon.

6
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,880
Do you remember when we were young,

7
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,840
we didn't care about anything.

8
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,160
We carried our luggage and went to the countryside.

9
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,360
We climbed mountains,

10
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,080
and we were in the middle of nowhere.

11
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,880
Right?

12
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,680
And then...

13
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,840
we had a couple, but we didn't have a couple.

14
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,960
Do you remember?

15
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,360
We didn't take a shower for two months.

16
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,080
It was so bitter.

17
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,200
Right?

18
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,080
We used to say it was bitter.

19
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,480
How can we feel it now?

20
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,840
Think about how many people we saved in those years.

21
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,640
But no one called me a miracle doctor.

22
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,880
You've always been a miracle doctor in my heart.

23
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,800
I'm content.

24
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,880
You're so cute.

25
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,360
This is the speciality that Auntie Niu brought over.

26
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,600
It's pure natural.

27
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,680
It's a natural ingredient.

28
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,200
I ate crab in her house.

29
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,640
But I didn't add anything.

30
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,480
Really?

31
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,000
Here.

32
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,040
The sweet potato is so sweet.

33
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,480
No, Jiajie.

34
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,480
You can actually let Jianqi eat more of this.

35
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,040
Rui Weikao.

36
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,480
Do you want some sweet potato?

37
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,960
It's so delicious.

38
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,800
What?

39
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,720
It's so sweet.

40
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,400
Thank you.

41
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,120
Put some in.

42
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,920
I'll eat it later.

43
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,720
What are you doing?

44
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,280
I'm cleaning my trash.

45
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,640
Cleaning your trash?

46
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,400
Why?

47
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,240
I don't know.

48
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,320
I'll clean it later.

49
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
I'll clean it later.

50
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,560
I'll clean it later.

51
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,240
You know the time of the environment?

52
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,200
Is it the time of the environmental crisis, Sister Hong?

53
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,600
Tell me about it.

54
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,440
You should have heard of another name.

55
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,240
It's called the end of the world.

56
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,640
What kind of end?

57
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,680
It was founded in 1945 by a dozen Nobel Prize winners.

58
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,440
According to more than 90 countries,

59
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,800
it will evaluate the ecosystem every year.

60
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,720
And it will publish once a year

61
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,280
to warn the world of the harm it has caused to the Earth.

62
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,400
If it reaches midnight at this time,

63
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,280
it will be the end of the Earth.

64
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,560
Look at the number of people who are picking up.

65
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,640
What does this have to do with cleaning trash?

66
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,280
Keeping trash in a trash can

67
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,040
is like polluting the environment.

68
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,760
Each of our boxes is an account.

69
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,880
The information of these accounts

70
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,080
will be sent to countless stations.

71
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,800
The more data accumulated,

72
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,000
the more heat generated.

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,080
Just like we often play with our phones and computers.

74
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,160
Will the computer heat up after a long time?

75
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,880
The temperature of the CPU will rise.

76
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,760
It needs a heat dissipator.

77
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,440
Each extra G of content

78
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,560
needs to consume 3200 watts of electricity.

79
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,080
If everyone in the world can delete 50 trash emails

80
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,560
for 23 billion e-mail users,

81
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,480
we can save 8.62 million...

82
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,560
5000G of space,

83
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,600
which saves 2.07 million watts of electricity.

84
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,840
In other words,

85
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,560
if we move our fingers

86
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,360
and spend a few minutes,

87
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,880
we can save an hour's electricity

88
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,880
equivalent to 2.7 billion white-winged lanterns.

89
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,280
Xiao Hong, you're amazing.

90
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,520
What a smart girl.

91
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,800
I'm doing this

92
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,000
for the sake of our descendants.

93
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,320
What's wrong?

94
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,720
Sister, let's do it too.

95
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,840
Which one?

96
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,240
This one.

97
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,840
Yes, delete it.

98
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,240
I'll go back and delete all my trash emails.

99
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,400
Hello, Toto.

100
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,240
I wonder if I'm still here

101
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,040
when you're watching this video.

102
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,560
I don't have the ability to save myself.

103
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,000
I can only hope for you.

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,560
I'm still too weak.

106
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,560
But I really do have hope.

107
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,560
I'm not afraid of anything.

108
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,560
I'm not afraid of anything.

109
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,560
I'm not afraid of anything.

110
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,560
I'm not afraid of anything.

111
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,560
But I still want to try again.

112
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,560
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,560
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,560
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,560
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,560
I'm sorry.

124
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
We won the prize

127
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
for saving theé–“

128
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,560
in which Ken Mo was a red corresponding to Ple spent his name for the sect

129
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,560
and was fully used to sing this song for his sect.

130
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,560
We're used

131
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,560
to intestinal pills in some parts of society.

132
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
Let me be closer.

134
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
Stop it.

135
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
I really have something to tell you.

136
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
The clinic is not good.

137
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:30,140
The

138
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:47,600
a

139
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,740
will become what it is now.

140
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,300
Since I was a kid,

141
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,420
all the stars,

142
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,380
professors,

143
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,540
and painters

144
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,100
that I could see in magazines and TV

145
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,260
were my family's regular guests.

146
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,300
I traveled with my parents

147
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,140
to all over the world.

148
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,420
I even had my own little stable.

149
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,020
I thought

150
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,380
I was very happy.

151
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:30,700
Mom,

152
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,380
good morning.

153
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:32,780
Sit down.

154
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,380
Hurry up.

155
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,580
Come and have breakfast.

156
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:40,980
Xue,

157
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,860
I'm going on a business trip today.

158
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,140
Take Mom to school.

159
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,140
No.

160
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,340
I have to make an appointment with the publisher.

161
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,460
I'm busy.

162
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,340
I'll take my husband.

163
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,060
I'll go by myself.

164
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,580
Okay.

165
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,020
Let's go back for dinner today.

166
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,540
I'll be back in three days.

167
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,540
Mom,

168
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,700
I can go by myself.

169
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,620
Mom,

170
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,140
I can take the school bus.

171
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,660
How can you?

172
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,380
It's a small street.

173
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,260
It's a waste of time.

174
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:05,980
I can.

175
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,220
Mengmeng,

176
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,100
why are you still wearing school uniforms?

177
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,580
Isn't it a free day today?

178
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,940
I bought you so many nice clothes.

179
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,900
Go and change.

180
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:16,860
I'm leaving.

181
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,980
I'll bring you something delicious.

182
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,020
Bye, Mom.

183
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,100
Mengmeng,

184
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,380
I'm running out of time.

185
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,220
I'll pick you up tonight.

186
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,380
I'll go to dinner with Chen Mengmeng.

187
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,180
Bye.

188
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,700
Bye, Dad.

189
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,620
Mengmeng,

190
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,980
happy birthday.

191
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,900
You must eat noodles with tea.

192
00:10:59,220 --> 00:10:59,860
Come on.

193
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:02,860
Wait for me.

194
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,580
Hurry up.

195
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,660
But actually,

196
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,300
I'm also very envious of my classmates

197
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,740
who can go to the cafe and write their homework,

198
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,140
and go to the starship together during the holidays.

199
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,420
I'm envious of you the most

200
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,900
after I met you.

201
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,700
I also want to be free like you.

202
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:42,900
No.

203
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,180
My parents are so nice to me.

204
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,020
I'm already very happy.

205
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,860
I shouldn't have so many greedy thoughts.

206
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,940
But even though they've been by my side,

207
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,780
they never know

208
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,300
what I'm thinking or what I want.

209
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,980
In my heart,

210
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,780
there's a monster.

211
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,660
I'm starting to be afraid of the dark night

212
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,780
and sleep.

213
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,580
Because that monster

214
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,500
will always run out at night

215
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,860
and even in my dreams.

216
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,260
I feel like I can't control it anymore.

217
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,100
I'm afraid

218
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,260
and I can't help it.

219
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,900
I don't know what to do.

220
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,700
Do you know, Teng Teng?

221
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,140
When my mom found out that day,

222
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,740
I was very scared.

223
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,260
But actually,

224
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,020
I felt relieved and relaxed.

225
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,380
She finally knew.

226
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,540
I thought

227
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,940
she would teach me how to drive her away.

228
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,100
But she didn't.

229
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,540
What are you doing?

230
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,620
That was the first time I saw my mom so angry.

231
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,220
She was so ashamed of me.

232
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,100
She thought I was a dirty thing.

233
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,540
My dad seemed to have become a lot of smoke that day.

234
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,460
When he hosted national projects,

235
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,620
he wasn't so anxious.

236
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,060
I felt ashamed.

237
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,380
I was a sinner.

238
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,380
They said I had to change.

239
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,780
I know.

240
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,300
I want to be better.

241
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,020
I will be better.

242
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,620
I can be better.

243
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,860
I really tried.

244
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,900
Mengmeng,

245
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,300
I'm sorry.

246
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,660
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,020
I'm sorry.

248
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,660
Mengmeng,

249
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,900
your parents are doing this for your own good.

250
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,620
We'll supervise you

251
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,020
and help you correct your mistakes.

252
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,420
Okay.

253
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,700
Okay.

254
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,940
No more dead ends.

255
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,980
But it's too hard.

256
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,780
It's too hard.

257
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,020
Mengmeng,

258
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,020
now I can rest assured.

259
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,740
Once you put your head on the camera,

260
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,220
no matter what happens,

261
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,020
I will be there as soon as possible.

262
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,420
Just sleep well.

263
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,020
Mengmeng,

264
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,620
put your hand out and sleep.

265
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,620
Good girl.

266
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,820
That's right.

267
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,220
Okay.

268
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,420
Good night.

269
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,620
I'll be watching you.

270
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,420
I'm leaving. Good night.

271
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,220
It's a shame to have such parents.

272
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,420
It's my fault.

273
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,420
I've lived with Mengmeng for so long

274
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,820
and I didn't realize

275
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,420
that she's not a normal

276
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,620
teenager.

277
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,220
She's probably a new patient.

278
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,220
New patient?

279
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,220
Like Wang Ying?

280
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,020
Yes.

281
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,220
She has a strong need

282
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,020
for cleanliness and behavior.

283
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,420
It's a disease.

284
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,020
Parents shouldn't be so hasty

285
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,020
to judge it as a matter of being a father.

286
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,620
With parents like her,

287
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,220
they'll be forced to be sick even if they're not sick.

288
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,420
She has psychological and psychological

289
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,420
and psychological problems.

290
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,420
My grandpa had a patient like that before.

291
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,220
She had a tumor in her brain

292
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,820
that affected her brain.

293
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,620
It's a pity that she can't be tested now.

294
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,820
I'm so confused.

295
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,020
Is it her parents or Gao Zhi?

296
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,820
Her behavior as a child

297
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,820
is sick.

298
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,020
I can't even feel it.

299
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,420
Gao Zhi is just a mother.

300
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,620
Gao Zhi is just a certain field,

301
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,020
not a full-time doctor.

302
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,620
If I hadn't met Mengmeng,

303
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,820
I wouldn't know.

304
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,820
You and Mengmeng

305
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,420
are so close.

306
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,020
Did you notice?

307
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,420
When I was in a volunteer activity,

308
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,420
I met Nan Ge.

309
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,620
She praised my drawing.

310
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,420
The puppy is cute.

311
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,220
She said

312
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,220
I could help the center

313
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,220
as a surrounding.

314
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,020
She said

315
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,420
I just need to make the puppy's expression

316
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,020
look happier.

317
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,220
Hello, we are from

318
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,620
the University of Public Security.

319
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,020
This is our activity,

320
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,020
Animal Rescue.

321
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,020
You can take a look.

322
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,020
You can take a look.

323
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,220
You can take a look.

324
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,220
There are QR codes on it.

325
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,220
You can scan it.

326
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,020
Please follow us.

327
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,020
Thank you.

328
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,020
Hello, we are from

329
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,020
the University of Public Security.

330
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,020
This is our activity,

331
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,220
Animal Rescue.

332
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,020
You can scan it.

333
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,220
She is so cute.

334
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,620
Here.

335
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,420
I'll add two more.

336
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,020
She won't be happier.

337
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,820
Good drawing.

338
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,420
She always calls me a kid.

339
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,620
She always

340
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,220
rubs my hair

341
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,220
and says

342
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,220
my eyes are like a puppy.

343
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,420
Actually, I want to tell her

344
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,620
I'm that stray dog.

345
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,020
I want you

346
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,420
to take me back.

347
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,620
I secretly skipped the drawing class.

348
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,420
I even lied to my parents

349
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,020
and went out looking for an excuse.

350
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,020
But I'm so happy.

351
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,020
I don't know

352
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,420
how I can be better to her.

353
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,220
So I gave her

354
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,820
everything she wanted.

355
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,620
I want to show her

356
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,020
how I feel.

357
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,220
But I forgot

358
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,820
that

359
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,420
there is a monster

360
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,220
in my heart.

361
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,620
I'm sorry.

362
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,620
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,620
I'm sorry.

364
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,620
I'm sorry.

365
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,620
I'm sorry.

366
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,620
I'm sorry.

367
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,620
I'm sorry.

368
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,620
I'm sorry.

369
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,620
I'm sorry.

370
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,620
I'm sorry.

371
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,620
I'm sorry.

372
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,820
I'm sorry.

373
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,020
I'm sorry.

374
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,220
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,420
I'm sorry.

376
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,620
I'm sorry.

377
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,820
I'm sorry.

378
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,020
I'm sorry.

379
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,220
I'm sorry.

380
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,420
I'm sorry.

381
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,620
I'm sorry.

382
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,820
I'm sorry.

383
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,020
I'm sorry.

384
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,220
I'm sorry.

385
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,420
I'm sorry.

386
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,620
I'm sorry.

387
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,620
I'm sorry.

388
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,820
I'm sorry.

389
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,020
I'm sorry.

390
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,220
I'm sorry.

391
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,420
I'm sorry.

392
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,620
I'm sorry.

393
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,820
I'm sorry.

394
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,020
I'm sorry.

395
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,220
I'm sorry.

396
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,420
I'm sorry.

397
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,620
I'm sorry.

398
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,820
I'm sorry.

399
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,020
I'm sorry.

400
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,220
I'm sorry.

401
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,420
I'm sorry.

402
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,620
I'm sorry.

403
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,820
I'm sorry.

404
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,020
I'm sorry.

405
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,220
I'm sorry.

406
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,420
I'm sorry.

407
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,620
I'm sorry.

408
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,820
I'm sorry.

409
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,020
I'm sorry.

410
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,220
I'm sorry.

411
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,420
I'm sorry.

412
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,620
I'm sorry.

413
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,820
I'm sorry.

414
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,020
I'm sorry.

415
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,220
I want him to forgive me, no matter what I do.

416
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,220
He is the key to my heart.

417
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,420
I don't want to disappoint him.

418
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,620
I know what I should do.

419
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,620
As long as I'm obedient,

420
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,220
he will smile at me.

421
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,620
But...

422
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,220
it's really hard to make an appointment.

423
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,420
Xu Meng,

424
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,620
we will remove the left-hand side of the circuit.

425
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,620
I'm sorry.

426
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,820
I'm sorry.

427
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,020
I'm sorry.

428
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,220
I'm sorry.

429
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,420
I'm sorry.

430
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,620
I'm sorry.

431
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,820
I'm sorry.

432
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,020
I'm sorry.

433
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,220
I'm sorry.

434
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,420
I'm sorry.

435
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,620
I'm sorry.

436
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,820
I'm sorry.

437
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,020
I'm sorry.

438
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,220
I'm sorry.

439
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,420
I'm sorry.

440
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,620
I'm sorry.

441
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,820
I'm sorry.

442
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,020
I'm sorry.

443
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,220
I'm sorry.

444
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,420
I'm sorry.

445
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,620
I'm sorry.

446
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,820
I'm sorry.

447
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,020
I'm sorry.

448
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,220
I'm sorry.

449
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,420
I'm sorry.

450
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,620
I'm sorry.

451
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,820
I'm sorry.

452
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,020
I'm sorry.

453
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,220
I'm sorry.

454
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,420
I'm sorry.

455
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,620
I'm sorry.

456
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,820
I'm sorry.

457
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,020
I'm sorry.

458
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,220
I'm sorry.

459
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,420
I'm sorry.

460
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,620
I'm sorry.

461
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,820
I'm sorry.

462
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,020
I'm sorry.

463
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,220
I'm sorry.

464
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,420
I'm sorry.

465
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,620
I'm sorry.

466
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,820
I'm sorry.

467
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,020
I'm sorry.

468
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,220
I'm sorry.

469
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,420
I'm sorry.

470
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,620
I'm sorry.

471
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,820
I'm sorry.

472
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,020
I'm sorry.

473
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,220
I'm sorry.

474
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,420
I'm sorry.

475
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,620
I'm sorry.

476
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,820
I'm sorry.

477
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,020
I'm sorry.

478
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,220
I'm sorry.

479
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,420
I'm sorry.

480
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,620
I'm sorry.

481
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,820
I'm sorry.

482
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,020
I'm sorry.

483
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,220
I'm sorry.

484
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,420
I'm sorry.

485
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,220
I've always been tired of having to worry.

486
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,020
My eardrums hurt constantly.

487
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,620
I think that also has nothing to do with sports.

488
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,620
I don't usually get weak from that.

489
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,660
achi

490
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,020
You can't sit up.

491
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,220
You can't.

492
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,420
I can't because it's hard to round you up.

493
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,420
Meeting you guys

494
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,420
is probably the luckiest thing in my life.

495
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,420
For the past year,

496
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,920
I've been living a life of ease.

497
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,920
I like the medicine box in the clinic,

498
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,920
I like everyone in the city.

499
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,920
I also like Jansy very much.

500
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,420
Because when I see her,

501
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,420
I know that we are connected.

502
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,920
Her body is disabled,

503
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,420
my heart is disabled.

504
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,420
I'm too bad.

505
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,420
I'm not worthy of your kindness to me.

506
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,420
I feel very painful every time I see the innocent.

507
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,920
Why am I so shameless?

508
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,420
I'm still not even a little bit of an adult.

509
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,420
I was born a sinner.

510
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,420
Brother Zeyi is looking for me,

511
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,920
he can't forget me.

512
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,420
Toto, I still have a lot of bad records in his hands.

513
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,420
I can't escape.

514
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,420
If he goes out of the palace,

515
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
my parents will be in danger.

516
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,420
Can you help me?

517
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,420
Please, Toto, please.

518
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,420
Who are you calling?

519
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,420
What are you doing?

520
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,420
Give me your phone.

521
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,420
Give it to me.

522
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:01,920
Give it to me.

523
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,420
Is it that man again?

524
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,420
Why are you so mean?

525
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,920
Can't you live without a man?

526
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,920
Are you still our daughter?

527
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,420
I'm sorry, I'm late.

528
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,420
I'm sorry.

529
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
I'm sorry.

530
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,420
I'm sorry.

531
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,920
I'm sorry.

532
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,420
I'm sorry.

533
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,920
I'm sorry.

534
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,420
I'm sorry.

535
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,920
I'm sorry.

536
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,420
I'm sorry.

537
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
I'm sorry.

538
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,420
I'm sorry.

539
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
I'm sorry.

540
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,420
I'm sorry.

541
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
I'm sorry.

542
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,420
I'm sorry.

543
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
I'm sorry.

544
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,420
I'm sorry.

545
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,920
I'm sorry.

546
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
I'm sorry.

547
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,420
I'm sorry.

548
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,920
I'm sorry.

549
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,420
I'm sorry.

550
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
I'm sorry.

551
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,420
I'm sorry.

552
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
I'm sorry.

553
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,420
I'm sorry.

554
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
I'm sorry.

555
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,420
I'm sorry.

556
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,920
I'm sorry.

557
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:26,920
I'm sorry.

558
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,420
I'm sorry.

559
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
I'm sorry.

560
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,420
I'm sorry.

561
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,920
I'm sorry.

562
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,420
I'm sorry.

563
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,920
I'm sorry.

564
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,560
I'll surprise him.

565
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,360
Do you know POA?

566
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,600
Meng wasenergetic by him.

567
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,520
He caused him to die.

568
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,480
We've been together

569
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,120
T m

570
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,480
We have the evidence.

571
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
We can...

572
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,480
We can let him be punished for the crime.

573
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,480
I...

574
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,480
I...

575
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
Did you like me so much?

576
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,480
I knew it.

577
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,480
If it's the end of the world,

578
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,480
I'll punish you.

579
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,480
What?

580
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
You want me to leave?

581
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,480
Come on.

582
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,480
I have an idea.

583
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,480
I have an idea.

584
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,480
Our son...

585
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,480
He's a very long-term child.

586
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,480
He's like a weapon in front of us.

587
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,480
But he still can't let go of Momo.

588
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
How do you know?

589
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,480
When I was upstairs,

590
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,480
I heard Toto talking to him.

591
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,480
It's good that they're together.

592
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,480
When a person feels emotional,

593
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,480
there's a partner who can help him.

594
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Look.

595
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,480
Only Toto knows where Tianzhen is going.

596
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
Tianzhen is healing.

597
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
Toto is helping him.

598
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,480
You always say that

599
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,480
I don't contribute to the family.

600
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
Look at me now.

601
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,480
Tianzhen has a problem.

602
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,480
Toto can help him.

603
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,480
This is the great contribution I made to the family.

604
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,480
Okay.

605
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,480
You're the only one who can do this.

606
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,480
I'm a great contribution.

607
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,480
I don't know when my son will come out.

608
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,480
Finally, I want to thank the school and the committee

609
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,480
for giving me this opportunity to participate in this teaching event.

610
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
I can really learn from the past

611
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
and help more people in need.

612
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,480
I will continue to live up to the trust of the teachers and classmates.

613
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,480
I will continue to work hard in my studies

614
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
and help more people in need.

615
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,480
Thank you.

616
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,480
Okay. Thank you.

617
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,480
We're going to have a speech.

618
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,480
The school leaders will take a group photo.

619
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,480
We'll take a picture of the individual first.

620
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
Okay.

621
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,480
Mr. Fujian, you have to control the time.

622
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,480
The teacher who is going to give the speech should be in the front.

623
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
Okay.

624
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,480
When the teachers are done,

625
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,480
the host will report to the next speaker.

626
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
The host will read the lines.

627
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,480
The next speaker is here.

628
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,480
Hello, everyone. My name is Yu Guorong.

629
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,480
First of all, I'm very grateful that the school can give me this opportunity.

630
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,480
Next, I will...

631
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,480
Who are you?

632
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,480
We know who you are.

633
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,480
What am I doing?

634
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
We are in a normal relationship.

635
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,480
And he is an adult.

636
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,480
You must not know.

637
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,480
Before he died, he sent us all the chat records.

638
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,480
I didn't do anything.

639
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,480
Yes, you said if he spent money on me.

640
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,480
Yes, he did give me a lot of gifts.

641
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,480
But I gave him a gift too.

642
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,480
Isn't it normal for couples to give each other gifts?

643
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,480
Is it normal?

644
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,480
He is an adult.

645
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,480
You seduce and seduce a girl who is not an adult.

646
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,480
You insult and control her.

647
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,480
Is it normal?

648
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,480
Please pay attention to your words.

649
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,480
I know he is not an adult.

650
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,480
But I didn't force him.

651
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,480
We are in a normal relationship.

652
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,480
As for what you said, I'm sorry.

653
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,480
I didn't.

654
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,480
You didn't.

655
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,480
You didn't.

656
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,480
It's because you are a blackmailer.

657
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,480
It's because you did these things.

658
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,480
That's why Meng Meng committed suicide.

659
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,480
That's why Meng Meng died.

660
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,480
You know it very well.

661
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,480
I'm sorry for her death.

662
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,480
But it has nothing to do with me.

663
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,480
We broke up.

664
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,480
I didn't say the law would punish blackmailers.

665
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,480
You abused her mentally.

666
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,480
She abused me too.

667
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,480
I don't know how to explain the relationship between Meng Meng and me.

668
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,480
You love a man and a woman. I love you.

669
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,480
I love you.

670
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,480
You love a man and a woman. I love you.

671
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
Maybe she is a little deeper now.

672
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,480
But I have struggled too.

673
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,480
Besides,

674
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,480
people can't explain the relationship.

675
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,480
Okay.

676
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,480
Then you threatened her with a close photo and video.

677
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,480
Why?

678
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,480
Do you have evidence?

679
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
I tell you.

680
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
You have to be responsible for spreading rumors.

681
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,480
Do you have a heart?

682
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
A girl committed suicide because of you.

683
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,480
And you are so unimportant?

684
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,480
Do you know her?

685
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,480
Do you know what kind of girl she is?

686
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,480
Do you know how much she loves Meng Meng?

687
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,480
Do you know why she loves me?

688
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
Hold on.

689
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
Hold on. There is a camera.

690
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,480
This is the school.

691
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,480
I tell you two.

692
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,480
Don't harass me anymore.

693
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,480
I have a bad mood.

694
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,480
If I am really stimulated,

695
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,480
and leave something good in someone's heart,

696
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,480
it would be a pity.

697
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,480
Let's go.

698
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,480
Camera.

699
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,480
This is a white record.

700
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,480
It doesn't say anything useful.

701
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,480
What kind of person is she?

702
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
Such a person is so good at learning.

703
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
It's so bad.

704
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
You shouldn't have stopped me.

705
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,480
I should have hit her.

706
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,480
Hit her?

707
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,480
I don't know.

708
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,480
It's a good thing to hit her.

709
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,480
I am also angry.

710
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,480
But hit her,

711
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,480
do you have any result?

712
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,480
Can you solve the problem?

713
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,480
What do you think?

714
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,480
I am not angry.

715
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,480
I am just worried.

716
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,480
I am just worried.

717
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,480
Let's find someone

718
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,480
smarter than us.

719
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,480
Don't you have a brain?

720
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,880
Is it useful to fight against this scumbag?

721
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,560
I thought he was afraid that others would know.

722
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,720
Brother Tou, you're inexperienced.

723
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,520
People like him who are P.O.A.

724
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,320
are typical of the post-mortem personality.

725
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,960
This kind of person can't find

726
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,680
the right to love, control, or superiority

727
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,960
by being in the human organ.

728
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,200
And then he loses himself.

729
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,760
The biggest characteristic of this kind of person is that he is extremely narcissistic

730
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,160
and always thinks that he is standing on the peak of morality.

731
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,080
So how could he be afraid? You know that.

732
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,040
There is a study called

733
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,120
narcissistic personality disorder.

734
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,720
It's a self-trained personality disorder.

735
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,240
Peng Shiyan, you seem to have quite a lot of experience.

736
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,360
No, no, no.

737
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,480
Although I'm a straight guy, I'm not short.

738
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,160
I respect women.

739
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,160
Well, Meikai,

740
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,840
can the chat record be used as evidence?

741
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,400
Although we all know that this guy is a scumbag,

742
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,280
he's right.

743
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,600
He and Mengmeng

744
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,440
did have a relationship that was between you and me.

745
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,800
It's just that in this relationship,

746
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,560
he has been mentally controlled by Mengmeng.

747
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,480
And your conversations

748
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,400
can only prove that

749
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,840
Mengmeng was very passive

750
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,960
in this relationship.

751
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,080
But you can't use it as evidence to accuse him.

752
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,120
I should have beaten him just now.

753
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,000
I have a tip for you.

754
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,320
It's a crime to deliberately hurt people.

755
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,400
You have to be sentenced.

756
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,360
You're so annoying.

757
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,080
You know that the worst is him.

758
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,440
But there's nothing you can do about him.

759
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,240
It's so painful for me.

760
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,440
But this big brother

761
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,680
should be protected.

762
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,880
He should be rewarded.

763
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,400
It's ridiculous.

764
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,560
Meikai, help me check it.

765
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,320
How long does it take to beat him?

766
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,760
But you don't have to take this risk.

767
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,720
It's not impossible to pay him a price.

768
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,800
What's the price?

769
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,600
In addition to the law,

770
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,360
there are also rules and procedures.

771
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,400
We will use the way of the seven men

772
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,280
to return the body of the seven men.

773
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,440
The Seven Men

774
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,520
You're afraid of him?

775
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,800
You're so great.

776
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,920
These netizens are so talented.

777
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,880
They're so good at losing people.

778
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,800
That's why I said

779
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,600
we have to beat seven men.

780
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,480
This thing

781
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,800
must be punished first.

782
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,440
You're the strongest.

783
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,960
I think this thing

784
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,160
is too much for him to post

785
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,440
the video and photos online.

786
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,680
If he dares to post it,

787
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,040
the netizens will kill him

788
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,040
with their slaps.

789
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,560
The Internet has memories.

790
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:46,060
He will always be staring at the

791
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,080
Huffenghua.

792
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,240
Let's continue from this.

793
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
But that's all right.

794
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,520
A decade later,

795
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,520
we'll rainy.

796
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,920
What happened?

797
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,440
Why did Zhao Lixuan move out?

798
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,440
You let him leave?

799
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,440
Don't you like him?

800
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,440
Why did you reject him?

801
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,440
You don't feel bad?

802
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,440
Lin Yixing, I'm talking to you.

803
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,440
Listen,

804
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,440
I've been learning from my master for so long.

805
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,440
The most important thing is what is real and what is false.

806
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,440
Once you learn it, it's real.

807
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,440
Money is nothing.

808
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,440
You see, houses and things are all false.

809
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,440
It's meaningless to live or die.

810
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,440
Really.

811
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,440
I've seen two people disappear recently.

812
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,440
Money or not, it doesn't matter.

813
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,440
It doesn't matter.

814
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,440
I'm talking to you.

815
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,440
If you were me, would you choose Zhao Lixuan?

816
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,440
I would.

817
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,440
You weren't like this before.

818
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,440
I was like this before.

819
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,440
You weren't like this.

820
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
I said so.

821
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,440
I'm sorry.

822
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,440
When we lived together, you didn't have money, so did I.

823
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,440
We were happy together.

824
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
That's because we don't have kids.

825
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
Get lost.

826
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
Give me a hand.

827
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,440
Take this away.

828
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,440
Where are you going?

829
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
Give it to me.

830
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,440
Why are you doing this?

831
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
Put it there.

832
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,440
What is this?

833
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,440
Okay, okay.

834
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,440
Dou Dou, I saw you eating tonight.

835
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,440
You didn't eat much.

836
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,440
Let's talk.

837
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,440
What's on your mind?

838
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,440
Didn't you say that when your mind moves, your heart beats?

839
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,440
It's not like that in real life.

840
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,440
For example, dreams and stars.

841
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,440
They don't have a heart.

842
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,440
When your mind moves, your heart beats.

843
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,440
If everyone can do this,

844
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:10,440
wouldn't it be like killing someone who has been poisoned?

845
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,440
That's not a bad person.

846
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,440
I'm talking about good things.

847
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,440
How can I move my heart and make it work like you said?

848
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,440
The heart needs to be original.

849
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,440
The mind needs to be right.

850
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,440
The mind is right.

851
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,440
Right is the right.

852
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,440
What is right?

853
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
It's very clear in the text.

854
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
Right is one.

855
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
What is one?

856
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,440
What is one?

857
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,440
The simpler the belief, the closer it is to the right.

858
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,440
The closer it is to the right.

859
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,440
I don't understand.

860
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,440
Give me an example.

861
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,440
It's the heart.

862
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,440
The belief is not for yourself, but for others.

863
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,440
It's for others and society.

864
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,440
When your mind moves,

865
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,440
it can gather the power to make you a lion.

866
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,440
That's why it's called the heavy-handed.

867
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:25,440
If a person thinks of getting something good from this person,

868
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,440
and something good from that person,

869
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,440
he will be out of his mind.

870
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,440
That's why he can't do good things.

871
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,440
The world is changing.

872
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,440
Missing you is happening.

873
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,440
There are always people

874
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,440
who deserve to cross mountains and rivers.

875
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,440
Let's look back at the years and stars.

876
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,440
I'm sure.

877
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,440
You are that person.

878
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,440
I admit.

879
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:58,440
It's not that pure.

880
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,440
I'm already trapped in your eyes.

881
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:13,440
The fate of the dream is waiting for me.

882
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,440
There are always people

883
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,440
who deserve to cross mountains and rivers.

884
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,440
Let's look back at the years and stars.

885
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,440
I'm sure.

886
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,440
You are that person.

887
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,440
I admit.

888
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,440
It's not that pure.

889
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,440
I'm already trapped in your eyes.

890
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:58,440
The fate of the dream is waiting for me.
