1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Untamed

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm really not angry.

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I just feel

5
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
very disappointed.

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You know, when I...

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
When I went to see him,

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
he took his eyes off me.

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
At that time, I felt

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
that our hearts

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
were so far apart.

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm really disappointed.

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I thought

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
we were like strangers.

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It turned out to be my own wishful thinking.

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm just a joke.

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm just a big joke.

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Li'er,

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
actually,

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I envy you.

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Envy me?

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I became a joke

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
in the public.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You envy me?

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Anyway,

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
you're old.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But for love,

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
for love,

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
you can cry and laugh.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
If your father

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
tells me now

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
that he has a child outside,

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll recognize him immediately.

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I know

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
that you don't understand these things now.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
In fact,

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
everyone in the world

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
has something that belongs to you.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The same for children

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and the same for husbands.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What really belongs to you

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
is your own

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
feeling for life.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
In the end,

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
the one who can accompany you

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
is yourself.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Mom,

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
if

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
this is our own,

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
why should I love him?

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Why should I

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
give up like this?

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Because you can love.

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
If you can love,

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
you have the ability to love,

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
the power of love.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You have to put this love

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
into action.

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Love and hate

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
all need strength.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I have no sorrow and no joy now.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's because of me

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
that I have no strength.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So I said I envy you.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Mom,

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I have no strength now.

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You can't have no strength.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You have to love.

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Why are you here?

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What's wrong?

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What's wrong? Tell me.

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What happened?

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What happened?

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What happened?

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What happened?

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I have a father.

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You have a father?

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's good.

79
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
A naive father is my father.

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I have a father.

81
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I have a father.

82
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I have a father.

83
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I have a father.

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I have a father.

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I have a father.

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I have a father.

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I have a father.

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I have a father.

89
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I have a father.

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I have a father.

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I have a father.

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Why are you sighing?

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I think you are not clean.

94
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Here, let me wipe it for you.

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I don't want it.

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Now,

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
father is not father.

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Girlfriend is not girlfriend.

99
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
How can we face it together?

100
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What does it mean?

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
If this little thing is not solved,

102
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
how can we achieve great things?

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Everything is a small thing in your hand.

104
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Let me tell you,

105
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
this matter is a big thing for everyone.

106
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's not a matter of money or power.

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Look at Sima Qian.

108
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You are here again.

109
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You know Sima Qian.

110
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You are going to say something about public service again, right?

111
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If men are going to do more public service,

112
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
there won't be so much trouble.

113
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Don't say I have no virtue.

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Women have no virtue.

115
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's the man's loss of virtue.

116
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I mean, fire gold.

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It can be controlled by two fingers.

118
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Where are you going?

119
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The bigger the problem, the more the problem is solved.

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The more the problem is solved, the more it is reversed.

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Everything in the world is reincarnated.

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
There are not so many new things.

123
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You just talk about our family.

124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't know how many times

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
the TV series has been edited.

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Give them some time.

127
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I believe they will be rich.

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Then I ask you.

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Is it true that you are involved in the secret?

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The mountain is covered with water.

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
There is no way out.

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
There is only one way to escape the case.

133
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Why are you always not on the same channel with me?

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm talking about philosophy.

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Go away.

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What philosophy?

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You are so annoying.

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm so annoying.

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You lied.

140
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What you said is not true.

141
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Tell me.

142
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Shen Tou Tou is my daughter.

143
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You are lying again.

144
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Why should I lie?

145
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,160
I just can't figure out

146
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,560
you went into a lie.

147
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,480
So you can't let go

148
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,320
of a sister like me?

149
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,320
I don't just want a sister.

150
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,240
Sister Zhen!

151
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,760
You can ask for what you want.

152
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,960
Whatever you ask for,

153
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,360
you should get it.

154
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,480
You took my future away.

155
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,400
I have nothing left!

156
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,240
You're young.

157
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,440
You're lucky to have no future.

158
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,920
There are many excuses for the future.

159
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,000
You should comfort your mother now.

160
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
How can I comfort her?

161
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,480
Let her forgive your mistakes?

162
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,200
Forgive your absurdity?

163
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,240
Forgive your immorality?

164
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,320
I can't say it.

165
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,800
And she always needs you,

166
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,000
not me!

167
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,200
But she forgot

168
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,560
you're the most selfless

169
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,680
and selfish person in the family!

170
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,480
No problem.

171
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,280
In the room,

172
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,480
there's love softening every minute.

173
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
I'm sorry.

174
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,480
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,480
I'm sorry.

178
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,480
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,480
I'm sorry.

180
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,480
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,480
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,480
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,480
I'm sorry.

190
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
I'm sorry.

191
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,480
I'm sorry.

193
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
I'm sorry.

194
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
I'm sorry.

or a boyfriend?

346
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,040
After I met my master,

347
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,920
I found

348
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,600
I could change my fate

349
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,760
by myself.

350
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,500
Doing Magazine

351
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,160
You have to study really hard

352
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
and work hard.

353
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,320
Now, I know

354
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,880
God has Theب hack

355
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,600
Why an stranger

356
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,320

357
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,360
I'm sorry.

358
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,920
I spent money on you.

359
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,360
I spent it on you to study

360
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,760
and teach you skills.

361
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,760
He treated you better than anyone.

362
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,000
So you're his daughter.

363
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,280
I'm sorry.

364
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,600

I'm sorry.

368
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
I'm sorry.

369
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,080
Sun Tou Tou is not

370
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,800
the successor of Jiang's Sect.

371
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,640
But no one

372
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,480
is more qualified to stand here

373
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,280
because she's my daughter.

374
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,520
Say it again.

375
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,600
She's my daughter.

376
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,320
She's my daughter.

377
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,920
Where are you going?

378
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,600
Uncle is still in the hospital.

379
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,640
No one cares about him.

380
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,920
I have to go to the hospital.

381
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,400
Wait a moment.

382
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,400
Master.

383
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,240
What's the plan

384
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,160
Zheng Xu,

385
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,620

with New Challenge.

390
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,120
Technology,

391
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,380
not only for Nothing Mask,

392
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,960
but also for R기는 red,

393
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:26,240
Rulo's

394
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,240
I'm sorry, I'm busy.

395
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
I'll call you later.

396
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,240
I'm sorry, I'm busy.

397
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,240
I'm busy.

398
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,240
I'm busy.

399
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
I'm busy.

400
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
I'm busy.

401
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
I'm busy.

402
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,240
I'm busy.

403
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,240
I'm busy.

404
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,240
I'm busy.

405
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,240
I'm busy.

406
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,240
I'm busy.

407
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,240
I'm busy.

408
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,940
I'm busy.

409
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,520
Why?

410
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,360
Because I have no place to go.

411
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,400
Uncle Yang,

412
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,600
plan B.

413
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,160
We haven't started the fire, have we?

414
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,080
If we haven't started it,

415
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,100
we will finish it right away.

416
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,180
Where is Tianzhen?

417
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,980
Why isn't he having dinner?

418
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,520
You can't go anywhere.

419
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,120
Tianzhen,

420
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,360
that house

421
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,720
is the medicine cabinet of the clinic.

422
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,840
It's full of medicine.

423
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,360
There's no bed.

424
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,280
I'll clean it up myself.

425
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,320
Leave it to me.

426
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,480
The key.

427
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,880
Here.

428
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,520
It's just one.

429
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
Don't lose it.

430
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,560
When you're free,

431
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,680
go and get one.

432
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:35,960
I know.

433
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,600
Let's eat.

434
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,760
Mom, let's eat.

435
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,880
Let's eat.

436
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,880
Who am I?

437
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,960
I don't remember.

438
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,240
Think about it.

439
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,560
Do we know each other?

440
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,440
Dad,

441
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,520
you look good today.

442
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,280
You should eat more.

443
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,680
I don't want to poop on the bed.

444
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,560
You...

445
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,160
You don't want to poop on the bed.

446
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,760
You should eat.

447
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,160
You should eat

448
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,240
if you can.

449
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,520
You'll look bad if you lose weight.

450
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,640
I'll take care of you.

451
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,480
Thank you, Goddess.

452
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,040
Thank you, Goddess.

453
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,160
I'm your Goddess.

454
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,640
I'll always be here to protect you.

455
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,600
Shen Xing.

456
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,360
She's old.

457
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,960
She's your wife.

458
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,360
She's at home

459
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,880
taking care of your mom.

460
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,960
She has high blood pressure recently.

461
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,760
She's not feeling well.

462
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,080
High blood pressure.

463
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,520
She sends her to the clinic every day.

464
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,160
Mr. Dong takes care of her.

465
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,880
Thank you, Goddess.

466
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,560
Thank you, Goddess.

467
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,680
You really don't know me?

468
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,920
You're a living Buddha.

469
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,520
A living Buddha.

470
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,280
Yiquan is here.

471
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,320
Mr. Dong,

472
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,920
let me see Mr. Wu.

473
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,360
Mr. Wu.

474
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,120
Mr. Wu.

475
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,000
Do you still know me?

476
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,760
Do you still know him?

477
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,760
Our Buddha.

478
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,520
Thank you for visiting me.

479
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,120
I'm not a Buddha.

480
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,520
I'm your student.

481
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,760
Everyone who visits you

482
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,080
is a Buddha.

483
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,680
Director Li is happy.

484
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,120
The clinic is open for free.

485
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,920
Bodhisattva.

486
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,120
I haven't been in the toilet for days.

487
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,540
Can you buy me some

488
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,560
Kesalu?

489
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,400
OK.

490
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,400
I'm going to get it now.

491
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,600
I can get it in the afternoon.

492
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,600
I want it now.

493
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,120
OK.

494
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,320
I'll go out and buy it now.

495
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,360
Thank you, Bodhisattva.

496
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,680
Thank you, Bodhisattva.

497
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,360
Goddess.

498
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,040
Goddess.

499
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,760
I want to take a bath.

500
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,040
I'll go get some water.

501
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,080
Thank you, Bodhisattva.

502
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Thank you, Bodhisattva.

503
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,760
Thank you, Bodhisattva.

504
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,400
Both.

505
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,640
Both.

506
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,560
Both.

507
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,660
2 plus 2 is

508
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,640
equal to?

509
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,360
I know.

510
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,040
What do you know?

511
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,960
Do you know who I am?

512
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,400
Do you know who I am?

513
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,440
You're Ren Xingcheng, my senior.

514
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,320
You're also my former

515
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,720
Prime Minister.

516
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,680
You scared me.

517
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,000
Are you okay?

518
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,160
I'm fine.

519
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,680
Then why did you

520
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
make a fool of me?

521
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,240
Let me tell you.

522
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,200
I'm not an accident.

523
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,120
Zhao Lijuan.

524
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,520
I can't be sure

525
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,880
if he was

526
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,400
careless or

527
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,360
sincere to me.

528
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,320
Are you blind?

529
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
I'll close the door.

530
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,040
I'll go.

531
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,000
Do you think

532
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,440
Zhao Lijuan did that

533
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,200
for what?

534
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,840
He asked me to give him

535
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,560
the price of the medicine.

536
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,600
He wanted to make the price of his medicine

537
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,120
more competitive.

538
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,160
He even bribe me

539
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,480
to give me a card.

540
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,520
But I didn't agree.

541
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,280
That must be

542
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,080
the idea of their General Manager Tu.

543
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,400
I thought so, too.

544
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,080
But one night

545
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,200
when I was in a coma,

546
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,560
he came to me

547
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,320
and held a towel in his hand.

548
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,760
Luckily, he found out later

549
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,080
that he was crying

550
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,360
next to my bed.

551
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,600
I felt bad, too.

552
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,000
Excuse me.

553
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:58,920
Excuse me.

554
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,480
Excuse me.

555
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,640
Come.

556
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,840
**The man to offer these workers hand silly videos**

557
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,080
I'm sorry, sir.

558
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,880
I'm too busy.

559
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,200
I'll catch you later.

560
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
I need something to drink.

561
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,040
How much?

562
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,280
¥0. VERXICAL!

563
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,800
Here.

564
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,680
Peru!

565
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,400
Peru?

566
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,160
I'm not sure.

567
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,160
But the money

568
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,160
should still be with him.

569
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
That means

570
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,160
you're in a coma.

571
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
I'm not sure.

572
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
I'm not sure.

573
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,160
I'm not sure.

574
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
I'm not sure.

575
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,160
I'm not sure.

576
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
I'm not sure.

577
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,160
I'm not sure.

578
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,160
That means

579
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,160
when you're in a coma,

580
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,160
your blood will flow

581
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,160
when he's close to you.

582
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,160
You all think I'm in a coma.

583
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,160
Wrong.

584
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,160
Actually, I knew

585
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
very well

586
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
during that time.

587
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,160
I just couldn't talk.

588
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
I didn't have the ability to protect myself.

589
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,160
So I was afraid.

590
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
What do you want to do?

591
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
I just want to

592
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,160
discuss this with you.

593
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,160
If you call the police,

594
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
he'll be dead in this life.

595
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,160
If you don't call the police,

596
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,160
how can you let him

597
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,160
realize his mistake?

598
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,160
This is a crime.

599
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,160
He has to take the money out.

600
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,160
Otherwise,

601
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,160
the consequences are unimaginable.

602
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,160
He's your student.

603
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,160
What do you want to do?

604
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,160
I'll just do what I know.

605
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,160
I just want to ask

606
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,160
if he's your student,

607
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,160
what will you do?

608
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,160
Hurry up.

609
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,160
Come back.

610
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
I'll close the door.

611
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,160
I think

612
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
in this life,

613
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,160
there must be one or two times

614
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
of cheating.

615
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,160
So we need to be honest.

616
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,160
You need to be honest.

617
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,160
You see,

618
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,160
the world is a family.

619
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
This is the world

620
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
for the people who are

621
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,160
the world's family.

622
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,160
It's difficult

623
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
to find this family.

624
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
It's very difficult.

625
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,160
Yes.

626
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,160
So it's not strange

627
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,160
that he has this idea.

628
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,160
Fortunately, he has some conscience.

629
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,160
He didn't hurt you.

630
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,160
So we have to educate him.

631
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,160
We have to punish him.

632
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,160
If he were my student,

633
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,160
I should give him a way out.

634
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,160
If he can realize

635
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,160
his own mistake,

636
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,160
I can forgive him.

637
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,160
But whether God will forgive him

638
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,160
depends on his self-reflection.

639
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,160
Don't worry.

640
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
I'll do it.

641
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
Okay.

642
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,160
We've made a deal.

643
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
Once you have an idea,

644
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,160
I'll execute it.

645
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,160
Half of the responsibility.

646
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,160
Half of the money.

647
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,160
But I have to tell you one thing.

648
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,160
No matter how much I recover,

649
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,160
I don't remember

650
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,160
the past.

651
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,160
You're afraid he'll hurt you again.

652
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,160
If he wants to hurt me again,

653
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
he'll be dead.

654
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,160
I don't remember

655
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,160
it's for the future.

656
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
I have to accompany you.

657
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
I've never felt

658
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,160
you and I are so high.

659
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,160
I've been worried

660
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,160
that you're confused.

661
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,160
Now it seems that

662
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,160
you're not only confused,

663
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,160
but also understand better than before.

664
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,160
I'm confused.

665
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,160
Next,

666
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,160
teach me how to walk.

667
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,160
I don't want to be served.

668
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,160
Especially the girl.

669
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
I don't understand

670
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,160
why you didn't

671
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,160
find me a male nurse.

672
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
Wu Shandao,

673
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,160
you're a little kind.

674
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,160
If Sun Tou Tou

675
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
weren't guarding you

676
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,160
and giving you a male nurse,

677
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,160
you wouldn't know

678
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,160
if you're alive or dead.

679
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,160
I'll tell you something.

680
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,160
I've told everyone

681
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,160
that Sun Tou Tou

682
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,160
is my daughter.

683
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,160
I know that.

684
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,160
But what about Ling Lan?

685
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,160
I've been suspecting

686
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,160
that you're thinking about my wife.

687
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,160
Now it's possible.

688
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,160
Tell me.

689
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,160
Am I right?

690
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,160
Okay.

691
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,160
Today...

692
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,160
Today...

693
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,160
Master, open the door.

694
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,160
Bodhisattva.

695
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,160
Bodhisattva, I'm starving.

696
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,160
Please give me something to eat.

697
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,160
Please forgive me.

698
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
Okay.

699
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,160
Please give me something to eat.

700
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,160
I'm starving.

701
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
Thank you, Bodhisattva.

702
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,500
Please give me a

703
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,200
big success,

704
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,160
不對不過

705
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,160
Thanks, Bodhisattva.

706
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,160
Thanks a lot, Bodhisattva.

707
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,160
Please forgive me.

708
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,160
Thank you, Bodhisattva.

709
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,160
Bodhisattva,

710
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:32,720
Bodhisattva's

711
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,680
I'll take you to the winter

712
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,080
You can't stay for a night

713
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,480
You've packed up there

714
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,200
Yes

715
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,400
You won't have dinner on winter night?

716
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,000
No

717
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,640
Go to send the food to Tao

718
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,160
I don't want her to be alone

719
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,800
She has to eat

720
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,960
Yeah

721
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,000
Eat and go

722
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,600
Grandma.

723
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,640
Grandma.

724
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,000
Grandpa.

725
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,520
Well, I have to go now.

726
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,520
Here are the clothes he asked for.

727
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,720
And the ink and paper.

728
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,080
You should leave the ink in the hospital.

729
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,640
He can write when he's free.

730
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,760
And the shoes.

731
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,640
Tell him to wear them.

732
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,200
You're not going to see him?

733
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,480
Next time.

734
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,480
I don't have the courage now.

735
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,920
If he sees me,

736
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,840
he'll be upset.

737
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,720
The ink is on him.

738
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,480
How holding.

739
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:15,880
Leave.

740
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,400
The meal isn't tasty.

741
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,640
Send everything quickly.

742
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,880
I'm leaving.

743
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,520
Now we tend shielded by powdered asylum,

744
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,000
and write about the erasure for continuing loneliness,

745
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,280
but also his 레 Wah who is眾� guess.

746
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,400
Zhou Zhicheng

747
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,480
You have finally come

748
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,120
Let's go and have it

749
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
He gift it to me

750
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,280
I don't know if he has informed the monk or the Tangs.

751
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,280
It's still Uncle.

752
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,280
I haven't said anything yet.

753
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,280
You are not lonely.

754
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,280
Family, lover,

755
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,280
I will make up for you.

756
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,280
We were blessed in the previous twenty years.

757
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,280
I don't need to be with you.

758
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,280
You are still mine.

759
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,280
What did you say?

760
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,280
I said,

761
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,280
you are the only one in my heart.

762
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,280
I can't tolerate anyone else.

763
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,280
If they are single,

764
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,280
They won't same we.

765
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,280
Bring us happiness.

766
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,280
Div mediocrity.

767
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,280
You can't t t t Cole here.

768
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,280
What about a fight?

769
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,280
Why are you so soft?

770
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,280
No more dumplings.

771
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,480
Say something.

772
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,640
You don't say a word.

773
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:38,800
Eat.

774
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,160
You're so dirty.

775
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:32,840
How was it?

776
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,520
It's used too often.

777
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,720
Mr бат.

778
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,320
You want to see me?

779
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,120
Drink some tea.

780
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,120
I'm not good at it.

781
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,840
Drink some tea.

782
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
You'll be the one to drink it today.

783
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,320
I don't know how to do it.

784
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,800
You can learn it if you don't know how to do it.

785
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,280
Okay.

786
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,040
Mr. Ren,

787
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,600
what happened

788
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,480
to my car?

789
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,200
Nothing.

790
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,540
Tea is ready.

791
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:08,840
In your struggle.

792
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:44,980
so I

793
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,300
there is

794
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:51,780
one

795
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,360
can ship

796
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,960
One thousand of us

797
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,680
Will be defeated

798
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,400
One hundred thousand will not succeed

799
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,120
It's all up to you

800
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:00,360
Missing you is happening

801
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,360
There are always people

802
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:07,360
Who are worth your crossing mountains and rivers

803
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:11,360
To share our life and stars

804
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:15,360
I'm sure

805
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,360
You are that person

806
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,360
I admit

807
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,360
It's not that pure, the heart is so heavy

808
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:28,360
I'm already trapped in your eyes

809
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,360
I feel the same way

810
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,360
The fate that we just had

811
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:39,360
Is waiting for us

812
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,360
There are always people

813
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,360
Who are worth your crossing mountains and rivers

814
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,360
To share our life and stars

815
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,360
I'm sure

816
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,360
You are that person

817
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,360
I admit

818
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:02,360
It's not that pure, the heart is so heavy

819
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:07,360
I'm already trapped in your eyes

820
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,360
I feel the same way

821
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:16,360
The fate that we just had

822
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:22,360
Is waiting for us
