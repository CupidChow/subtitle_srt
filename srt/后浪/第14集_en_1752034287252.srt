00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's amazing.

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's amazing.

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let me tell you.

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,500
Look.

7
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,000
Does it still hurt?

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,500
Look.

9
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,000
It's okay.

10
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,000
I understand.

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Thank you.

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Thank you.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,500
You're welcome.

14
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Can you teach me that?

15
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Because I have many colleagues.

16
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,500
They have problems with their back.

17
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,500
When you teach me,

18
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,500
I'll go back and massage them.

19
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,500
I'm afraid I can't teach you now.

21
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
You're not a student of Shicheng Class.

22
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,500
Besides,

23
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,500
you've missed so many classes.

24
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Dou Dou, you're really a doctor.

25
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,500
Stop it.

26
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,000
No.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,500
Then how can you

28
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
deliver the express delivery?

29
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,500
Teacher Dong is too deep.

30
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,500
You must learn it well.

31
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,500
Learn your skills.

32
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,000
In the future,

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,500
we will

34
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,500
find you if we need help.

35
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Do you want to learn it?

36
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,500
I want to.

37
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
I want to.

38
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,500
But I think

39
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,500
you may

40
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,500
not be able to teach me.

41
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,500
It's his heart

42
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
to teach you.

43
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Whether you want to learn it

44
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,500
or not,

45
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,500
it's your own heart.

46
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Yes.

47
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
You've never been able to

48
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
do what you want.

49
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,500
You

50
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
should go and apologize to him.

51
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Ask him to forgive you.

52
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
You're right.

53
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Go and apologize to your teacher.

54
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Teacher.

55
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Teacher.

56
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Look.

57
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
My waist is better.

58
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Well,

59
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
I tell you,

60
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Dou Dou

61
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
really wants to learn it

62
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,500
and works hard.

63
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
Every time he comes back from the delivery,

64
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
he's full of sweat.

65
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
He can't even wash his face.

66
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
The dormitory is not good.

67
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
The workers are too busy

68
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
and lack of energy.

69
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
He doesn't get affected.

70
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
He's always playing with his nose.

71
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,500
He's always playing with his nose.

72
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
He doesn't care

73
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
how late or how tired he is.

74
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
He doesn't waste time.

75
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
He's very hardworking.

76
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Really.

77
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Go. Go.

78
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Go.

79
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Apologize.

80
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
Hurry up.

81
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Teacher.

82
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Thank you.

83
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Take care.

84
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,500
You're welcome.

85
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Apologize.

86
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,500
You don't understand.

87
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Stop it.

88
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
You little...

89
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
You little...

90
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Mr. Dong.

91
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,500
You've worked hard today.

92
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
And I told the teacher

93
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
that I'll give the money to him.

94
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,500
If there's nothing else,

95
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
we'll leave now.

96
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Okay.

97
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
Thank you, Mr. Dong.

98
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Where's your jacket?

99
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Here.

100
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Mr. Dong.

101
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Thank you.

102
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Thank you.

103
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,500
You're welcome.

104
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Thank you.

105
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
Let's go.

106
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Wait.

107
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
I'll give you another advice.

108
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Okay.

109
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Today's waist is

110
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
for your stomach.

111
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
But the muscles need

112
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,500
some time to recover.

113
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
When you go back,

114
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
if you have time,

115
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
you can follow the muscle

116
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
of the muscles

117
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
and slowly massage it.

118
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
If any muscle is stiff,

119
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
you can use

120
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
the power of massage

121
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
to push it away.

122
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Okay.

123
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
I have a bottle of oil.

124
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,500
You can...

125
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
It's okay.

126
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
Just give him one.

127
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
It's okay.

128
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,500
Take it.

129
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Thank you, Mr. Dong.

130
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Thank you, Mr. Dong.

131
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
You're welcome.

132
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
You're welcome.

133
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
We're leaving.

134
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Okay.

135
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Thank you, Mr. Dong.

136
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
You're welcome.

137
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Goodbye.

138
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Thank you, Mr. Dong.

139
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
You're welcome.

140
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Mom, slow down.

141
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
Slow down.

142
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,500
Slow down.

143
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,500
You're really slow.

144
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Slow down.

145
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Slow down.

146
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
I'll go to get a towel.

147
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
Come on.

148
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
I'll go to get a towel.

149
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
I'll go to get a towel.

150
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Mom,

151
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
I'll accompany you.

152
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
I've used up my air time.

153
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
Next time,

154
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
I'll ask my brother to accompany you.

155
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
Let's finish this round first.

156
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
I don't know

157
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
if we can do it

158
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,500
until next time.

159
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
Mom,

160
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,500
look at what you said.

161
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,780
I don't want to be angry.

162
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,220
I don't want to owe either.

163
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,380
Before I die,

164
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,180
help me pay off my debt.

165
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,740
It's better to pay off the debt.

166
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,140
Let's go.

167
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,740
Go.

168
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,580
1st Day

169
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,300
Get it.

170
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:38,780
Go.

171
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,820
یا

172
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,700
Come on, guys.

173
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:48,780
Yo.

174
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,380
I'm sorry.

175
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,140
Is that how Mr. Dong did it?

176
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,500
That was close.

177
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,020
Mr. Dong is so talented.

178
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,140
He did it in a few seconds.

179
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,380
Where can we find such a good teacher?

180
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,580
I think Mr. Dong wants to hire you.

181
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,420
Go and find him.

182
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,620
He's a good boy.

183
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,540
Learn some skills.

184
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,300
How many people will he recruit in the future?

185
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,580
I believed my master.

186
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,660
My master doesn't hire me.

187
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,580
Mr. Dong and my master are good friends.

188
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,820
My master doesn't hire me.

189
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,980
Mr. Dong doesn't hire me either.

190
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,260
Silly boy.

191
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,420
Go and find your master.

192
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,700
Let him hire you.

193
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,180
So many years,

194
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,660
I've contacted many people who deliver packages.

195
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,580
I know who's kind and who's evil.

196
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,540
Your master

197
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,620
is not as good as you.

198
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,820
But he's a good man.

199
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,980
He asked you to pay me.

200
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,940
But you didn't do it.

201
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,500
I'll pay you back.

202
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,300
Don't worry.

203
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,700
What are you talking about?

204
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,700
Learn from him.

205
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,060
You can pay him back.

206
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,940
It's interesting.

207
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,500
I'm a doctor.

208
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,460
I don't believe it.

209
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,100
I'm not good at it.

210
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:17,940
Don't worry.

211
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,380
It'll be better if you take your time.

212
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,740
Xia is back.

213
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,500
How is it?

214
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,700
Did you find the doll?

215
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,700
Did you find it or not?

216
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,900
The first house

217
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,500
is not 300 years old.

218
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,860
The second house...

219
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,500
How is it?

220
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,980
The house is 350 years old.

221
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,460
The owner can be sure.

222
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,620
Isn't it great?

223
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,500
What about the doll?

224
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,940
But I have a problem.

225
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,980
The house

226
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,740
is 300 years old.

227
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,740
But it's repaired every 10 years.

228
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,780
Does the doll

229
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,140
count as 300 years old?

230
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,020
Well...

231
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,980
It depends on...

232
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,700
Tianzhen.

233
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,660
Come on.

234
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,820
Help me analyze it.

235
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,620
Look.

236
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,860
The house

237
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,260
is 300 years old.

238
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,780
But it's repaired every 10 years.

239
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,260
Does the doll

240
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,340
count as 300 years old?

241
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,740
I knew it.

242
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,260
What's wrong with it?

243
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,580
I'll find it again

244
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,780
if I can't find it.

245
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,580
Right?

246
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,420
It's a big country.

247
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,940
I don't believe I can't find

248
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,060
a 300-year-old doll.

249
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,100
Right.

250
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,580
I'm asking you the same question.

251
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,100
In our old village,

252
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,780
there are

253
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,100
old houses

254
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,180
like the white walls and gray tiles

255
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,260
in the old travel magazines.

256
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,380
I'm asking them

257
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,180
if they have 300-year-old houses.

258
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,180
Does your village

259
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,900
also need to be repaired every 10 years?

260
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,500
In recent years,

261
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,580
tourism and business

262
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,020
have developed rapidly.

263
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,740
I guess so.

264
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,300
But

265
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,260
those houses

266
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,180
with good preservation

267
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,340
were bought by others.

268
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,500
I'll ask them

269
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,580
if they have those houses.

270
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,340
Thank you.

271
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:12,980
Thank you.

272
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,500
You're welcome.

273
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,020
Yuzheng.

274
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,060
What's wrong?

275
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,700
Something happened to Tao Tao.

276
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,340
What happened?

277
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,260
She didn't receive it.

278
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,660
What's wrong with her?

279
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,540
I'm so worried.

280
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,380
I didn't receive it. I didn't see it.

281
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,220
Did she put something

282
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,820
in my hand?

283
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,420
She said she put something

284
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,380
in your door.

285
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:42,940
Maybe

286
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,820
you accidentally took it into your room.

287
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,420
No.

288
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,620
I didn't.

289
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,380
No.

290
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,620
Why are you so annoying?

291
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,980
I'm begging you, Mr. Lai.

292
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,460
I'm begging you.

293
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,420
You should go back

294
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,380
and look for it.

295
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,220
It's the wedding ring.

296
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,340
The wedding ring

297
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:56,780
you found upstairs

298
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,980
is really lost.

299
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,780
You should

300
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,820
look for it.

301
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,420
You're still mad at me, right?

302
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,140
You sent the wrong address.

303
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,780
It's none of my business.

304
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,500
You should go with her.

305
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,300
I didn't see it.

306
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,020
It's not at home.

307
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,460
Dad, you want to see me?

308
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,420
Can you see the video

309
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,620
on your phone?

310
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,220
Yes.

311
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,740
What's wrong with her?

312
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,980
I didn't receive it. I didn't see it.

313
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,660
Did she put something

314
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,180
in my hand?

315
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,820
She said she put something

316
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,820
in your door.

317
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,380
Maybe

318
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,660
you accidentally took it into your room.

319
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,380
How much is it?

320
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:43,820
No.

321
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,820
I didn't.

322
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,940
I'm begging you.

323
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,420
I'm begging you.

324
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,260
You should go back

325
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,180
and look for it.

326
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,620
The heir has gold under his skin.

327
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,900
You don't know it.

328
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,380
He's not even a student now.

329
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,660
Where did he come from?

330
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,620
He may not be my student,

331
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,060
but he's the heir

332
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,500
of the Jiang's faction.

333
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,820
You can't deny it.

334
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,140
How much is it?

335
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,660
It's not expensive.

336
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,860
It's over 30,000 yuan per ring.

337
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,660
It's the wedding ring.

338
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,700
It's too late.

339
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,940
The wedding ring

340
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,940
upstairs

341
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,580
is really not available.

342
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,020
I want you to look for it.

343
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,780
Let's go.

344
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,500
She didn't even send me anything.

345
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,380
It's not her fault.

346
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,580
The address is wrong.

347
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,740
It was 303.

348
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,660
Now it's 303.

349
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,780
She should have sent it to someone.

350
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,420
She sent it to someone.

351
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,020
Why doesn't she recognize it?

352
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,100
Did the garbage collector

353
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,220
take it away?

354
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,140
Go to the garbage stand and check it.

355
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,620
We've seen the video of the entrance.

356
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,020
She didn't come here to collect garbage.

357
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,080
She's a

358
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,900
lightning-prone.

359
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,660
She has a key.

360
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,820
I don't have a key.

361
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,820
How could she

362
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,380
put her stuff

363
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,540
at my doorstep?

364
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,620
It's my fault.

365
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,140
I was on my way home.

366
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,780
I asked her to leave her key

367
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,300
at the door.

368
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:55,940
I didn't expect

369
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,060
she would send it to the wrong floor.

370
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,940
You should have asked the delivery room.

371
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,460
The address is wrong.

372
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,820
But I'll get married tomorrow.

373
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,260
And this.

374
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,300
You shouldn't have

375
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,460
married her.

376
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,700
What's wrong with you?

377
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,700
What are you talking about?

378
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,500
What's wrong with you?

379
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,060
Why are you so rude?

380
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,020
Let's go.

381
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,780
I'm not filming you.

382
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,380
Why are you still filming?

383
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,260
I'm telling you.

384
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,580
Don't film her.

385
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,580
You're a liar.

386
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,860
Stop it.

387
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,460
There should be a camera

388
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,060
in the corridor.

389
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,100
Yes.

390
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:33,820
Meng Meng told me

391
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,060
there was a camera in the corridor.

392
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,620
I'll ask her if she has it.

393
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,780
This way.

394
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,700
This way.

395
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,060
I really don't have it.

396
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,180
I didn't see it.

397
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,300
Why did you give it to me?

398
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,780
What are you doing?

399
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,540
You didn't bring it to my house.

400
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,500
I told you.

401
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,140
I don't have it.

402
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,660
Is there anyone there?

403
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,100
Anyone?

404
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,860
Do you want to help me?

405
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,900
Do you have a camera?

406
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,700
No.

407
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,100
I didn't expect that.

408
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,780
I'll contact the owner of 302.

409
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,980
I'll ask him to come here immediately.

410
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,780
How about this?

411
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,820
Everyone, leave.

412
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,420
Leave.

413
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,420
You're busy, okay?

414
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,180
Everyone, leave.

415
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,580
Miss.

416
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,620
You should go back first.

417
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,500
Okay.

418
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,500
Come on. Get up.

419
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:25,860
Thank you.

420
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,220
Be careful.

421
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,300
How about this?

422
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,420
You go down and wait.

423
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,540
We'll handle it.

424
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,620
Okay. Thank you.

425
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,620
Thank you.

426
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,500
Okay.

427
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,100
Miss.

428
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,900
I just

429
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,420
checked the other person's face.

430
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,060
I'm not sure

431
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,620
if they have a camera.

432
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,700
But if they have it,

433
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,660
after half an hour,

434
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,820
the owner will be honest

435
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,980
when he gets the memory card.

436
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,860
You still have the last time.

437
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,380
Go back to find it.

438
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,660
See if you accidentally

439
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,060
find the evidence.

440
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,820
This is illegal

441
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,020
illegal property.

442
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,940
It's going to be sentenced.

443
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,220
By the way,

444
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,060
the girl said

445
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,140
her ring is 30,000 yuan.

446
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,020
How much is it?

447
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,060
38,000 yuan.

448
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,060
Look.

449
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,860
It's so expensive.

450
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,340
Well,

451
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,220
wait a moment, officer.

452
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,740
I'll go back to find it.

453
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,420
Look at this.

454
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,820
I put it away

455
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,900
as my own.

456
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,340
It's so...

457
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,020
It's so embarrassing.

458
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,540
Miss.

459
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,820
It's settled.

460
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,500
I'm sorry.

461
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,980
There are many things like this.

462
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,780
It's okay.

463
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,220
You can go back, too.

464
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:52,780
Thank you.

465
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,980
Thank you for your hard work.

466
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,780
How about it?

467
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,860
It's time to court a permanent airoro.

468
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,180
A permanent airoro.

469
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,980
arnya.

470
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,220
Can she get the Intern 받ium?

471
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,580
Is she willing to give

472
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,060
her pure-hearted blood and

473
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,260
You're looking for a book?

474
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,020
You saw Tao Tao today?

475
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,300
Yes.

476
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,060
How is she?

477
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,100
Not good.

478
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,020
Who would be in a good mood for a long time?

479
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,620
How is the big brother

480
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,820
Yao with her?

481
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,100
I don't know.

482
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,140
I don't care.

483
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,300
Xing Zheng.

484
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,780
Tao Tao

485
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,740
about this.

486
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,060
I think it's not safe

487
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,460
for a girl to live with

488
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,580
a group of young people.

489
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,020
Besides,

490
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,020
she can be punished for two days.

491
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,860
It's normal for young people to make mistakes.

492
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,020
You let her stay outside for a long time.

493
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,940
She's going wild again.

494
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,780
She finally got her heart back.

495
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,780
What do you think?

496
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:24,900
Tianzhen.

497
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,900
Go and call Tao Tao back.

498
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:27,940
She's in class.

499
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,460
Tell her

500
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,380
to apologize to your father.

501
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,780
She won't make the same mistake again.

502
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,020
Do you hear me?

503
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,660
I'm talking to you.

504
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,020
Why don't you respond?

505
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,860
You're so rude.

506
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,820
I'm giving you an internship opportunity.

507
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,140
You're so bad at it.

508
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,740
I'm willing to contribute to my business.

509
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,980
You suffered today, right?

510
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,980
If I were you,

511
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,260
I would be expensive, too.

512
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,420
How much money

513
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,340
do I have to pay?

514
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,940
It's not because of the money.

515
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,980
It's because of the money.

516
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,220
What's the reason?

517
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,340
You said you have 30,000 yuan.

518
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,380
But you only have 5 yuan.

519
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,060
You don't want to ruin her happiness.

520
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,420
You're willing to kneel for her happiness.

521
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,620
But you're not willing to kneel for your own happiness.

522
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,540
I think you

523
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,140
should kneel in front of your master

524
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,980
like you did today.

525
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,540
If she doesn't agree, you won't get up.

526
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,580
Do you hear me?

527
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,740
Wait.

528
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,060
I don't have time to practice with you today.

529
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,260
Tao Tao.

530
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,100
Grandma said she missed you.

531
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,340
Grandma asked you to apologize to my father.

532
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,380
So you came back.

533
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,340
Study hard.

534
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,700
Say something.

535
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:30,980
Say something.

536
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,140
Say you admit your mistake.

537
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,860
Say something.

538
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,140
Did you hear that?

539
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:41,940
Say it.

540
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,740
I admit...

541
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,540
No.

542
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,340
I know.

543
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,900
I miss them, too.

544
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,500
That's right.

545
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,660
This...

546
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:25,380
European еще

547
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,140
You can't bear to spend money on a new car.

548
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:30,980
That's right.

549
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,060
It's free.

550
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,140
I'll go to the workshop to get the new car.

551
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,140
I'll get the prize.

552
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,060
You get down.

553
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,580
I plan to give it to the boss.

554
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,340
Why don't you give it to us?

555
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,260
I'll get one.

556
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,460
It's not easy for a girl

557
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,780
to work with a man.

558
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,500
Besides,

559
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,460
let her get on the new car

560
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,260
and start a new life.

561
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,020
That's right.

562
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,140
Later,

563
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,140
don't tell everyone.

564
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,500
Tell her to come back and give her a surprise.

565
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:54,900
Okay.

566
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,780
Don't tell everyone.

567
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,420
Okay.

568
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,580
(*Want to be happy all the time?)

569
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,420
(*Meet that girl then.)

570
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,920
I have lost my Suppuh

571
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,340
every day.

572
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,580
I'm sorry.

573
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,780
You don't like Chinese medicine.

574
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,060
What's the use of studying it?

575
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,940
I didn't want to study it before.

576
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,420
But now I don't know

577
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,100
if I can still be a Chinese doctor

578
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,660
if I want to study it.

579
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,420
Master, I know you're a good person.

580
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,780
Although sometimes I can't understand

581
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,060
what you said,

582
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,260
I know

583
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,460
I can learn from what you said.

584
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,300
At least I won't become a bad person.

585
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,380
I still want to follow you in the future.

586
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:26,740
Go.

587
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,220
Go home,

588
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,540
Go back.

589
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,300
Master easy for you.

590
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,060
Master.

591
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,860
You haven't come out for so long.

592
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,100
I'm done.

593
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,060
How is it?

594
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,140
Can you talk?

595
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,020
I'm done.

596
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,700
Go and tell your dad

597
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,460
that it's not a matter of one person.

598
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,940
We're all at fault.

599
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,980
You can't just punish him alone.

600
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,460
Think of something.

601
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,220
Yes.

602
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,140
We're all at fault.

603
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,700
You can't be punished alone.

604
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,740
I'll tell my dad.

605
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,860
He won't believe me.

606
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:35,820
Mengmeng.

607
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,820
Mengmeng.

608
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,820
I'm sorry.

609
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,380
I was just kidding.

610
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,300
I'm not leaving.

611
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,700
Are you asking me to stay?

612
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,140
You just said...

613
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,020
I was just shaking my head.

614
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,380
I didn't say I was leaving.

615
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,220
I'm sorry.

616
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,140
Where are you going?

617
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,940
Didn't you say you were going?

618
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,980
Hurry up and pack up.

619
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,100
Change your clothes.

620
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,380
Get ready for the follow-up.

621
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,460
You've been away for a long time.

622
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,780
Find time to make up for your classmate.

623
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,980
Can I come back?

624
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:33,980
Is there a condition?

625
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:34,860
Yes.

626
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,340
I'm all grown up.

627
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,180
Recite the classic of the night every day.

628
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:39,820
Okay.

629
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,100
I want to check.

630
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:41,860
Okay.

631
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,620
After the renovation of the marketing office,

632
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,620
go to the classroom in advance

633
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,380
and take a bath.

634
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,140
Okay.

635
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,340
Your pants.

636
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,380
You can't wear what you should.

637
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,140
Why...

638
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,620
Why is that?

639
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,740
You can't wear shoes barefoot.

640
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,020
You'll get socks.

641
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,340
Okay.

642
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:10,900
Okay.

643
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,500
Okay.

644
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,340
Go.

645
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,820
Where?

646
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,300
Change your clothes.

647
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,820
You're so lucky.

648
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,700
Are you okay?

649
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,620
Hey.

650
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,220
It works.

651
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,300
You see?

652
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,460
Pretty, right?

653
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,140
Yes.

654
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:18,780
Look.

655
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,100
Is it done?

656
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,060
So beautiful.

657
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,260
So many.

658
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,620
Come on, guys.

659
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,220
Old Tou, come here.

660
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,540
Come here.

661
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,820
Put the stick aside.

662
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,260
Guys,

663
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,780
today we invite

664
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,700
Qiu Shi to give you

665
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,740
a medicine class.

666
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,540
Why are you still

667
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,060
taking classes during the holiday?

668
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,820
Nature

669
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,380
is a natural classroom.

670
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:58,860
Guys,

671
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,300
we shouldn't separate

672
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,220
life and illness.

673
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,260
For example,

674
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,180
there is a saying

675
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,060
in the mountains.

676
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:06,860
It's called

677
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,260
to be bitten by a snake

678
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,420
and to be cured within a hundred steps.

679
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,180
It's very reasonable.

680
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,140
Because

681
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,420
yin and yang are not two things.

682
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,820
They are two sides of one.

683
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:19,980
For example,

684
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,820
one side of the earth

685
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,060
is facing the sun.

686
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,780
But the other side

687
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,260
must be the night.

688
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,740
One lychee has three fires.

689
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,900
Lychee

690
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,740
is a kind of

691
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,060
hot fruit.

692
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,020
There is a saying in the folk.

693
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,580
The heat of the lychee

694
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,460
is the film in the lychee shell.

695
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,220
Peel off the film

696
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,020
and boil water.

697
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,460
Then the heat

698
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,340
will be integrated.

699
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:43,900
Guys,

700
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,780
we sit in the classroom

701
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,740
and learn medicine.

702
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,020
It's like a western doctor

703
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,220
is taking the body

704
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,540
to understand the living.

705
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,500
So,

706
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,900
we learn medicine in nature.

707
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,740
It's the living Chinese medicine.

708
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,220
To be bitten by a snake

709
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,180
and to be cured within a hundred steps.

710
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,020
I know.

711
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,540
This is like

712
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,180
the KFC.

713
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,420
There must be McDonald's nearby.

714
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,420
Right?

715
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,380
There must be a specialty store

716
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,340
near the KFC.

717
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,100
It's the same.

718
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,900
Right?

719
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,020
Nonsense.

720
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,380
What Ou said

721
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:22,860
is really

722
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,660
a good thing.

723
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,820
You know me.

724
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:26,740
Go back.

725
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,380
Guys,

726
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,740
we can have a competition today.

727
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,340
In the past, Li Shizhen

728
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,260
wrote

729
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,700
The Grass and the Wood

730
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,580
is a medicine

731
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,060
of the mountain and the moon.

732
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,980
You know,

733
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,180
the dew

734
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,420
can be used as medicine.

735
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,420
So today,

736
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,380
we

737
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,780
also come here

738
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,260
to climb the mountain and the moon.

739
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,460
We pick the medicine

740
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,540
and practice our footwork.

741
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,980
When he is about to eat,

742
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,180
we will come back to see

743
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,860
who picks more medicine

744
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,580
and who can order more dishes.

745
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,260
How about it?

746
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,260
The Chinese medicine

747
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,460
is about

748
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,420
the same as medicine.

749
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,700
Today, we will

750
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,460
make it more difficult for you.

751
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,180
Guys,

752
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,660
each of you can share a dish.

753
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,380
But

754
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,500
this dish

755
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,660
must be related to

756
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,460
the medicine you picked.

757
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,780
It's too simple.

758
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,700
You are cheating.

759
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,100
Black sesame.

760
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,380
The same as medicine.

761
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,460
I will have dinner

762
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,660
tonight.

763
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,660
You are so smart.

764
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,180
You are out.

765
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:30,980
Right.

766
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,980
Don't do that, master.

767
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,460
You are out.

768
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,260
You can't do that.

769
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,340
I am also cheating.

770
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,940
I am a cook.

771
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:40,500
Right?

772
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,220
When I go up the mountain,

773
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,420
I can cook

774
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,340
any vegetables

775
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:43,980
like soup,

776
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,740
stir-fry,

777
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,180
or minced garlic.

778
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:46,700
Stop.

779
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,620
I haven't finished

780
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,980
my task for you.

781
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,020
You need to pick

782
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,260
the Chinese medicine you can eat.

783
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,460
You must say

784
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,620
a Chinese poem

785
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,900
about the Chinese medicine.

786
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:00,860
How about it?

787
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,420
Any questions?

788
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,580
Any questions?

789
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,020
If you don't want me to eat,

790
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,980
just say it.

791
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,540
The Chinese poem.

792
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,100
You know what I mean.

793
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,860
A rich man is a rich man.

794
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,500
People who can learn Chinese medicine

795
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,140
are all cultured.

796
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,820
As for cultured people,

797
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,340
if you are interested,

798
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,340
you will find

799
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,820
that in Chinese ancient poems,

800
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,540
there are many

801
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,460
that have Chinese medicine elements.

802
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,780
This is not difficult

803
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,140
for you, right?

804
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,500
It's not difficult.

805
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,260
Is it?

806
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,260
Yes.

807
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,180
Yes.

808
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,140
In the city of Li Bai,

809
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,020
Jiang Yu Xing

810
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,060
sings a song on the shore.

811
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,340
The peach blossoms are in the water.

812
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,540
They are in a hurry to send their mother.

813
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,020
The peach blossoms

814
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,300
are Chinese medicine.

815
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,820
Eat peach blossoms and draw a fish.

816
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,380
Draw a peach blossom and open your heart.

817
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,860
So amazing.

818
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:00,780
Qiu Shi,

819
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,140
do you think

820
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,420
we will meet for the first time?

821
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,660
There is a special actor.

822
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,460
Do you think so?

823
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:06,980
How to say it?

824
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,500
I think

825
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,260
today,

826
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,420
you follow me.

827
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,380
We will win.

828
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,700
After I step on the grass,

829
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,060
you will tell me what I have lost.

830
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:14,860
You are Qiu Shi.

831
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,540
You are just a beggar.

832
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,540
You are cheating.

833
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,460
Class,

834
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,420
Yes.

835
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,380
We challenge ourselves.

836
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,700
This challenge

837
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,580
can only be completed by ourselves.

838
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,380
We can also verify

839
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,420
the knowledge we learned before.

840
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:30,980
Okay?

841
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,620
What about you two?

842
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,340
In the opposite village,

843
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,300
you two have a checkup.

844
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,380
Guys, go for your medicine.

845
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:39,940
Come on.

846
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:40,780
Come on, Crafty Boss.

847
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:50,660
�크

848
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,420
Spicy hot pot.

849
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,380
Okay.

850
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,300
to forget him,

851
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,020
and let him stay in the society

852
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,300
forever.

853
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,580
He is annoying.

854
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,620
No one knows

855
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,380
how his parents died.

856
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,300
Stop.

857
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,940
Is that it?

858
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,740
Is that it?

859
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,100
What is that?

860
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,420
Is this it?

861
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,260
What's this?

862
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,260
It's all of them.

863
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,660
I'll take it.

864
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,260
Give it to me.

865
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,260
Give it to me.

866
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,260
Don't. Don't. Don't.

867
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,260
Go over there.

868
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,260
The soul of ordinary people

869
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,260
Burn a wall of enthusiasm

870
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,260
Use one sentence to us

871
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,260
To cure the coldness of this world

872
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,260
These are not

873
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,260
What's wrong?

874
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,260
It's all of them.

875
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:43,260
Time is silent

876
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:47,260
Memories are all over the place

877
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,260
The only thing I remember is the taste of the food

878
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,260
Come on!

879
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,260
What are you doing?

880
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,260
They are all warm and cold

881
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,260
I've seen it all.

882
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,260
There's nothing left.

883
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,260
I'll look over there.

884
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,260
Okay?

885
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,260
Burn a wall of enthusiasm

886
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,260
The light is bright

887
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,260
Burn a wall of enthusiasm

888
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,260
Use one sentence to us

889
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,260
To cure the coldness of this world

890
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,260
I'm back.

891
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,260
I'm back.

892
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,260
It's raining. It's raining.

893
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,260
What's this?

894
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,260
Where did you get this?

895
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,260
This is Puma.

896
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,260
It's the savings account.

897
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,260
It's the ancestor.

898
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,260
It's a name.

899
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,260
Yes.

900
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,260
The heart of the people.

901
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,260
I had a consultation with Qiu.

902
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,260
Some friends in the village

903
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,260
gave it to me on purpose.

904
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,260
Puma has a problem.

905
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,260
He can only put in the money.

906
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,260
He can't get out.

907
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,260
You can't spend it.

908
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,260
This design...

909
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,260
This design...

910
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,260
This is the ancestor's message.

911
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,260
It's a token of his love.

912
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,260
Oh, right.

913
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,260
When Yang Xiao Hong went up the mountain,

914
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,260
he fell down and was sent to the hospital.

915
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,260
But it's nothing serious.

916
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,260
Don't worry.

917
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,260
It's nothing serious.

918
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,260
Went to the hospital?

919
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,260
Yes.

920
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,260
Yes.

921
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,260
Yang Xiao Hong didn't let anyone carry it.

922
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,260
He kept carrying it down the mountain.

923
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,260
You carried it?

924
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,260
I carried it.

925
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,260
I'm a big man.

926
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,260
This is Puma's tender night.

927
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,260
The jade is in the heart of Huang Rui.

928
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,260
The bird flies to the sky.

929
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,260
The rice is coming.

930
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,260
Good.

931
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,260
Good.

932
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,260
Not bad.

933
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,260
This Puma

934
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,260
is not a gong.

935
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,260
It's good for detoxification,

936
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,260
anti-inflammatory,

937
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,260
and detoxification.

938
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,260
It's good for both

939
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,260
the liver, mouth,

940
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,260
and the gut.

941
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,260
Good.

942
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,260
Let me do it.

943
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,260
The flowers in the sea are blooming.

944
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,260
The stone bamboo is on the edge.

945
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,260
The seed is growing.

946
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,260
Good.

947
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,260
Good.

948
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,260
Good.

949
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,260
Pass.

950
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,260
Let me do it.

951
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,260
The bitter north coldness is not yet over.

952
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,260
The snow is cold like a armor.

953
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,260
It's like a winter tree.

954
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,260
The frosty leaves are green and the frost is cold.

955
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,260
Good.

956
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,260
Let me see.

957
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,260
You chose such a cold poem.

958
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,260
It's really hard for you.

959
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,260
Pass.

960
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,260
Pass.

961
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,260
It's your turn.

962
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,260
Slow down.

963
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,260
The lotus seed outside the lake

964
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,260
is

965
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,260
a

966
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,260
cross

967
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,260
between

968
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,260
the green grass and the lotus

969
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,260
in the Qi Mountain.

970
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,260
The water is like the glory of the flowers

971
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,260
and the rock is like the stone.

972
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,260
The shadow is like the sword.

973
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,260
Good.

974
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,260
Two wrong sentences.

975
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,260
Three wrong sentences.

976
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,260
Where did you make three wrong sentences?

977
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,260
Why did you make three wrong sentences?

978
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,260
You are so stingy.

979
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,260
You should have said it earlier.

980
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,260
Master,

981
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,260
I can read it.

982
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,260
I've read it wrong.

983
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,260
You...

984
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,260
You are not good at this.

985
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,260
How about this?

986
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,260
Tell me what the lotus seed is made of.

987
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,260
It's made of

988
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,260
the lotus seed.

989
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,260
That's right.

990
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,260
Speaking of the lotus seed,

991
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,260
it's made of

992
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,260
all kinds of treasures.

993
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,260
For example, the lotus leaf

994
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,260
can remove the heat and moisture

995
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,260
and keep the baby alive.

996
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,260
The lotus seed

997
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,260
can keep the baby alive

998
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,260
and keep the baby dry.

999
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,260
The lotus seed

1000
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,260
can remove the heat and sleep.

1001
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,260
The lotus flower

1002
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,260
can keep the baby alive

1003
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,260
and cure the disease.

1004
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,260
The lotus seed

1005
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,260
can stop the bleeding

1006
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,260
and spread the disease.

1007
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,260
The lotus seed

1008
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,260
can keep the baby alive

1009
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,260
and keep the baby alive.

1010
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,260
It can also stop the hunger.

1011
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,260
Okay.

1012
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,260
Are you hungry?

1013
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,260
We are all done.

1014
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,260
Let's eat.

1015
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,260
Let's eat.

1016
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,260
Let's eat.

1017
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,260
Let's eat.

1018
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,260
Let's eat.

1019
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,260
It's good.

1020
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,260
Drink some.

1021
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,260
Drink some.

1022
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,260
Don't be afraid, Mengmeng.

1023
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,260
The gift you prepared

1024
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,260
for them

1025
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,260
will be liked by them.

1026
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,260
I'll go with you.

1027
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,260
Let's go.

1028
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,260
Master Ren,

1029
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,260
happy birthday.

1030
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,260
Thank you.

1031
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,260
Master Qiu,

1032
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,260
happy birthday.

1033
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,260
Okay.

1034
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,260
Thank you.

1035
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,260
Master Qiu,

1036
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,260
happy birthday.

1037
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,260
Okay.

1038
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,260
Happy birthday.

1039
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,260
Happy birthday.

1040
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,260
Tao Tao.

1041
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,260
Master.

1042
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,260
Is it beautiful?

1043
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,260
Yes.

1044
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,260
Where is it?

1045
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,260
It smells so good.

1046
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,260
Today is an important day.

1047
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,260
It's called the Teacher's Day.

1048
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,260
I hope you

1049
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,260
can tell me

1050
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,260
that you wish me a happy teacher's day

1051
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,260
and express your gratitude.

1052
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,260
I'll go with you.

1053
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,260
Okay.

1054
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,260
I'll go with you.

1055
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,260
Okay.

1056
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,260
I'll go with you.

1057
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,260
Okay.

1058
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,260
I'll go with you.

1059
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,260
Okay.

1060
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,260
I'll go with you.

1061
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,260
Master,

1062
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,260
I'm not only grateful

1063
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,260
to you

1064
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,260
on the Teacher's Day.

1065
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,260
I'm grateful to you every day.

1066
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,260
So I'm not grateful

1067
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,260
to you

1068
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,260
on the Teacher's Day.

1069
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,260
I'm grateful to you.

1070
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,260
Do you know?

1071
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,260
You should say

1072
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,260
that you wish me a happy teacher's day.

1073
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,260
If you don't say it,

1074
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,260
you've done

1075
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,260
a lot of things.

1076
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,260
But you've shown it to me.

1077
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,260
In this way,

1078
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,260
a holiday

1079
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,260
will give you a step

1080
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,260
to express

1081
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,260
your usual

1082
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,260
embarrassing words.

1083
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,260
Have you said thank you

1084
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,260
to your teacher?

1085
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,260
I saw

1086
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,260
a fight in the morning.

1087
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,260
Did you apologize to her?

1088
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,260
When did I fight with her?

1089
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,260
You did.

1090
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,260
Your teacher asked you

1091
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,260
to bring a scarf

1092
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,260
to make you feel better.

1093
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,260
But you didn't bring it.

1094
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,260
You said it's cold.

1095
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,260
Why did I bring it?

1096
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,260
You even patted her.

1097
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,260
Your face changed

1098
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,260
when you patted her.

1099
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,260
It's two different things.

1100
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,260
It's the same thing.

1101
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,260
You don't even thank her.

1102
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,260
You don't care

1103
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,260
if she's angry.

1104
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,260
Right?

1105
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,260
Why did I say that?

1106
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,260
Why do you have to

1107
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,260
wait for me here?

1108
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,260
Who is my teacher?

1109
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,260
You said it yourself.

1110
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,260
The law is the law.

1111
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,260
Right?

1112
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,260
The law is the law.

1113
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,260
When the law is clear,

1114
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,260
everything is clear.

1115
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,260
Then you say

1116
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,260
one thing and do another.

1117
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,260
Then you can't beat me.

1118
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,260
You...

1119
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,260
You just used

1120
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,260
my teacher's hat to press me.

1121
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,260
Look at you.

1122
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,260
I...

1123
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,260
I just

1124
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,260
accept the gift

1125
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,260
and not the favor.

1126
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,260
I don't care.

1127
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,260
You tell me first

1128
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,260
that the teacher is happy.

1129
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,260
I don't care.

1130
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,260
I don't care either.

1131
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,260
You don't have to talk about conditions.

1132
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,260
It's not something to talk about.

1133
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,260
Even if I'm doing a class,

1134
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,260
I can't talk to you about conditions.

1135
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,260
ated immediately,

1136
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:12,260
not instantly

1137
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,260
He called to apologize.

1138
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,260
You should know

1139
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:20,260
why this person was beaten.

1140
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,260
I was taught

1141
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,260
I had to teach him.

1142
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,900
It seems very interesting

1143
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:12,900
The us in the sunset

1144
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,660
This youth

1145
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:25,380
The more it is, the more complete it becomes

1146
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:30,900
Missing you is happening

1147
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,700
There are always someone

1148
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,460
You better cross the distance

1149
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,740
Complete

1150
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:42,340
Glass noodles snuggles years and stars

1151
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,540
Sure enough

1152
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,860
Who are you

1153
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,900
I admit

1154
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:55,180
It's not that pure, but it's so heavy

1155
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,460
It has been trapped in your eyes

1156
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:05,460
The Long Ballad
