00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
I want to try again.

4
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,200
So I will come to you with a big ball.

5
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,000
How did you know about me?

6
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,200
I saw the list you wrote.

7
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,800
There are diseases in the list.

8
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,600
The same diseases.

9
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,400
You cured it.

10
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,600
So I came to you.

11
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,000
Miss Bally.

12
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,400
I am Bally.

13
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Jasmine is my name.

14
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,000
You can call me Molly.

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,400
Molly.

16
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,600
Bally Molly.

17
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
A beautiful name.

18
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,200
Thank you.

19
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,400
It's like this.

20
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,400
The Chinese medicine's treatment

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,800
is also a disease's name.

22
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,000
So the western medicine

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,600
needs to check the patient's weight

24
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,400
and the various indexes that have been checked.

25
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,800
They will prescribe you medicine.

26
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,400
So the Chinese medicine

27
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,400
although it's also a lung disease,

28
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
but the symptoms are different.

29
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,200
The prescription I prescribed is also different.

30
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,000
I believe you.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,800
Everyone is unique in this world.

32
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,400
Yes.

33
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Tell me.

34
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,800
What else do you feel uncomfortable about except cough?

35
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,000
There is nothing uncomfortable.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,800
I am tired.

37
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,400
Tired?

38
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,200
Tired.

39
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,600
Tired is also a disease.

40
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Chen Tai.

41
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
Let the chief come here.

42
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,600
You two.

43
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,000
Mr. Shao.

44
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,400
You two.

45
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,000
Let me die.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,600
What did I do that I can't forgive?

47
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,400
Where did you get this?

48
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,000
Tell me.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,600
My dad gave it to me.

50
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,800
Your dad gave it to you?

51
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,000
Liu Zihong.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,800
No one plays with you.

53
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,400
Tell me the truth.

54
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,000
My dad gave it to me.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I didn't lie to you.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,200
What is this?

57
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,200
Isn't this a good thing?

58
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't understand.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,800
Liu is very precious.

60
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,400
Good.

61
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,000
Very good.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,800
Sports are good things.

63
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
Yes.

64
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,600
I said it's a good thing.

65
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,000
Liu took it back in the middle of the night

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,200
and hid it secretly.

67
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,000
It must be precious.

68
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
If I didn't do it,

69
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,200
it would be in Liu's safe.

70
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,000
Why did you give it to me?

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Look.

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
As the old saying goes,

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,600
the one who is grateful should repay the debt with his whole life.

74
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,000
You helped me in the past.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,200
Liu agreed to me to continue to be a trainee.

76
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,000
I must show my gratitude.

77
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
And

78
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,000
you are my number one pre-ordered fan.

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,800
As an idol,

80
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,000
I should give you some benefits.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,200
I'll give you some benefits.

82
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,400
I'll give you some benefits.

83
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,600
As an idol,

84
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
it's normal to give some benefits.

85
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,200
You know my relationship with Liu.

86
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,600
I just want him to feel bad.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,200
He said this thing can save lives.

88
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,000
I think his friends

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,200
are not so lucky.

90
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,400
This thing is so good.

91
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,800
I'll give it to you.

92
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,000
It must be better than him.

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You are ruining your dad's big event.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,600
You ruined our big event?

95
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,200
This thing

96
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,600
can save lives.

97
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,800
It's the life of our class.

98
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,200
It's our life.

99
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,600
Do you know what you did?

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,200
What do you mean?

101
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,600
Don't listen to others.

102
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,000
I didn't do it on purpose.

103
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,600
It's too late to say anything now.

104
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,200
Your dad has been detained.

105
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,000
We don't have a place to stay.

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,600
You are here again.

107
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,200
You are here again.

108
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,000
You are here again.

109
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,000
Brother.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Listen to me.

111
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,200
Don't be an idol.

112
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,600
Okay?

113
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't be an idol.

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,200
We are short of

115
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,600
brains and foundation.

116
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,000
He can't do this.

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,800
He can't be famous.

118
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,200
Do you know?

119
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Koukou.

120
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,800
The teacher is looking for you.

121
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,400
Coming.

122
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
This...

123
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,000
It's so hard to see something good.

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,200
This...

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,840
You're preparing to upload Taotao's Yicheng.

126
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,400
Continue.

127
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,600
What's the matter?

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,200
Question want is

129
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
the very important moment.

130
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
I have to see it carefully.

131
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,700
What do you want to ask?

132
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,120
Yingshu animals this year

133
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,120
gather once again

134
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,160
after eight gift boxes did.

135
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,820
Nine ounce Exploration

136
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,760
and tea.

137
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,540
No.

138
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,160
You missed it

139
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,120
when you asked about jaltc.

140
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,160
You've all got it wrong.

141
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,200
Am I?

142
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,500
What's the answer?

143
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,800
Before we talk about the emergency in Chinese medicine,

144
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,600
I want to ask you guys.

145
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,800
What's the eye of a Chinese doctor?

146
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,000
Yin Yang.

147
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,600
Right, you're right.

148
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
Yin Yang.

149
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,200
The eye of a Chinese doctor?

150
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,200
Checking Yin Yang?

151
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,600
How can you be wrong if you can check Yin Yang?

152
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,200
How can you be wrong if you can check Yin Yang?

153
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
You speak Chinese well.

154
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
You can understand our conversation.

155
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,400
It's not easy to bring students now.

156
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,800
She has to pick the teacher's problem.

157
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
No.

158
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,800
I don't.

159
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,600
You remind me of

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,400
the teacher I met when I was a kid.

161
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Because she helped me become a teacher.

162
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,800
Grandma Le Le.

163
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,800
Why are you here today?

164
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,000
Where's your mom?

165
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Le Le.

166
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,600
Tell Mr. Zhang

167
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,400
you're going to grandma's house this weekend, right?

168
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Right?

169
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Mr. Zhang.

170
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,600
Grandma has a big car.

171
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,400
And a machine that's taller than me.

172
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Great.

173
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,200
Did Le Le tell mom

174
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,400
she's going to grandma's house today?

175
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Mr. Zhang.

176
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Le Le.

177
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,000
Follow us.

178
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,800
Chen Ying Cha knows it.

179
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,000
Don't worry.

180
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,000
Le Le, say goodbye to the teacher.

181
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,400
We're going home.

182
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
Sorry.

183
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,200
Mr. Zhang, there's traffic today.

184
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
I'm late.

185
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
Le Le.

186
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,000
What did mom tell you this morning?

187
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,200
After school,

188
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
you can only wait for mom to pick you up.

189
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,400
You can't go with strangers.

190
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,600
Remember?

191
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Chen Ying.

192
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,200
What do you mean?

193
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Le Le is my grandson.

194
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,800
I'm her grandma.

195
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,200
Why did I become a stranger?

196
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,000
I didn't mean anything else.

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,800
She's young.

198
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,400
She's not very safe.

199
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,600
I have to remind her.

200
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,800
Otherwise, grandma will pick you up today.

201
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,400
And dad will pick you up tomorrow.

202
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,200
Maybe one day,

203
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,000
some stranger aunt will pick my son up.

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's bad.

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You have a new granddaughter.

206
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,600
Don't worry about Le Le anymore.

207
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Let's go.

208
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,200
What are you doing?

209
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,400
She's spending the weekend with her dad.

210
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,600
Put Le Le down.

211
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
I made it clear to you that

212
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,400
Le Le has nothing to do with your family.

213
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Let's go.

214
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,600
What?

215
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,000
Nothing to do with what?

216
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,800
Nothing to do with what?

217
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,200
Yes, you and we have nothing to do with each other.

218
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,000
But Le Le is my grandson.

219
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,200
He's sweating in the courtyard.

220
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
He's spending the weekend with his dad.

221
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,800
You think you can break it with one word?

222
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,000
What a joke!

223
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,200
Then I'll tell you.

224
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
I'll go to the court to file a complaint.

225
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,400
From now on,

226
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
my son has nothing to do with your family.

227
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
He's my son.

228
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
I'm your son.

229
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Le Le, let go.

230
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
What are you doing?

231
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll prescribe some tonics for you.

232
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
To adjust your body.

233
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,000
Professor Ren,

234
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,600
can my disease be cured?

235
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,000
Try it.

236
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,600
You eat a lot of antibiotics.

237
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,200
Antibiotics

238
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,200
are a very good medicine.

239
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,800
After eating it, you can cure and save your life.

240
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,400
But if you take it for a long time,

241
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,200
your immune system will retreat.

242
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
After taking some medicine,

243
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,800
you can restore your body's energy to normal.

244
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,200
You can keep your oxygen.

245
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,600
You're going to fight a war.

246
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,400
You need to recover first.

247
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Only then can you fight a war.

248
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,600
Okay.

249
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Where do you live?

250
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Kaiyue Hotel.

251
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,000
Kaiyue?

252
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,400
Yes.

253
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,400
This hotel is quite expensive.

254
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,000
Your disease

255
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,400
can't be cured in one or two days.

256
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,400
I suggest you change a hotel.

257
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,000
Move closer to the hospital.

258
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This way,

259
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
you can save a lot of money.

260
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,400
Okay.

261
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,800
I'll do it.

262
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
In terms of food,

263
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,400
you need to eat fruit first.

264
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,000
Don't eat raw or cold food.

265
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,200
Okay?

266
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,800
Okay.

267
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Who's going to be with you now?

268
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,600
My granddaughter will be here in two days.

269
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Don't worry.

270
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,200
The people in my hotel will be with you.

271
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,800
Wait until your granddaughter comes.

272
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Okay?

273
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,200
Okay.

274
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,400
So you can be at ease.

275
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,800
Okay.

276
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,400
Dou Dou, inform Zhu Xia

277
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,200
to meet with Bai Mo Li later.

278
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Okay.

279
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,600
I'll prescribe some medicine for you.

280
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
If you insist on eating,

281
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,800
you need to get your body well.

282
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,200
Okay. I'll try my best.

283
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
I'll try my best too.

284
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll try my best too.

285
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,200
I'll try my best too.

286
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,200
This is a note and a note during the treatment.

287
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,400
See?

288
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,800
You can read it when you get back.

289
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,000
Okay?

290
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,800
Okay.

291
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,800
And this.

292
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,200
This is the dumplings.

293
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,400
I've packed them for you.

294
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Okay.

295
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm afraid you don't have a bubble.

296
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So I'll get you a new bubble.

297
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
This.

298
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,600
Thank you.

299
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,400
New one.

300
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,000
Thank you.

301
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,600
You can put it in the bubble.

302
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,800
Master said you need to sunbathe more.

303
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,000
Sunbathe more.

304
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,400
It's good for your health.

305
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:41,600
Okay?

306
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,200
Okay.

307
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,600
Come here to treat your illness.

308
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,000
You can just be at ease and treat it.

309
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,200
Master said it's okay to treat your illness.

310
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,400
We all need to work hard.

311
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,000
I'll put it here.

312
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I know he's very good.

313
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,400
I believe in my decision and choice.

314
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
I've been sick for three years.

315
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,200
I'm not afraid to fight with the doctor for three years.

316
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,400
Fight.

317
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,000
Fight.

318
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Boss.

319
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,200
This is Miss Bai who Professor Ren asked me to take care of.

320
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,800
Miss.

321
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,000
This is Grandma Mo Li.

322
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,200
Hello.

323
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Miss.

324
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,000
If you have any questions or needs,

325
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
you can ask her.

326
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,600
Okay.

327
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,200
I'll go check on the medicine.

328
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,800
Okay.

329
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,600
Okay.

330
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,400
Thank you.

331
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,600
You're welcome.

332
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,000
It's not a problem.

333
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,800
I'm a patient's family.

334
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,800
I know what patients need.

335
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,200
Yes.

336
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,400
I'll take good care of you.

337
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
Wait for your granddaughter.

338
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,800
Thank you.

339
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,600
You're welcome.

340
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,000
You're the child's grandmother?

341
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,600
Grandma Qing?

342
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,800
Are you the child's mother?

343
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,200
Yes.

344
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,800
Mother Qing?

345
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,400
Of course.

346
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,800
Officer.

347
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,400
You're here.

348
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,800
You must help me.

349
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,600
You must help me.

350
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Listen.

351
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,400
This woman won't let me take my grandson.

352
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,200
She's still hitting me.

353
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,400
You didn't take my son away

354
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,200
because you didn't get my permission.

355
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,000
Of course I don't agree.

356
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
My son was my husband when we divorced.

357
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,600
The court ruled that

358
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,400
I planned to live with his father

359
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,000
every weekend.

360
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,600
It's different now.

361
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,200
Since you lied to me last time,

362
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,000
I won't allow my son

363
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,400
to go to a stranger's house.

364
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,800
I want to go through legal procedures again.

365
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Okay.

366
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,400
You want to re-examine?

367
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,200
Okay.

368
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,800
I want to get my grandson's custody right.

369
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,600
I'm telling you.

370
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,600
It's not because you were a woman.

371
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,000
Le Le's father couldn't afford it.

372
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,800
That's why we left Le Le to you.

373
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,000
Look at you.

374
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,200
You're so unreasonable.

375
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
We'll file a lawsuit.

376
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,000
What do you mean?

377
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What do you mean?

378
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,600
Officer.

379
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,000
No wonder my son doesn't like you.

380
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You're so emotionally unstable.

381
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,400
Le Le won't look down on you.

382
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,200
Nonsense.

383
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,000
What's wrong with you?

384
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,400
You're so emotionally unstable.

385
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:04,800
I'm not.

386
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:26,860
Don't you know he's so

387
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
I'm not.

388
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,000
Stop it.

389
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,800
You're so unreasonable.

390
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,000
You can't trust them.

391
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,600
I'm so scared.

392
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,200
I promise I won't come back.

393
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,600
No one can take away this mother's custody.

394
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
I won't let you leave me.

395
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,800
Mother.

396
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,400
In this situation,

397
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,200
this week,

398
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,600
you can ask grandma to take your son back.

399
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
No.

400
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,600
First,

401
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,800
you can't refuse the right of the father

402
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,200
to see the child.

403
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,400
And your emotions

404
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,200
are not suitable for the child to be with.

405
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,000
What's wrong with me?

406
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,200
What's wrong with me?

407
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,400
Why can't I be with my own child?

408
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,200
Calm down.

409
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,600
Le Le, don't do this.

410
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,800
Le Le.

411
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
Mother.

412
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,600
If you really want a child,

413
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,400
you must control your emotions.

414
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,200
Don't let this happen again.

415
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,000
Where did you take me?

416
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,600
Mother.

417
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,200
Miss.

418
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
What's wrong with you?

419
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,800
Miss.

420
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,600
What happened to you?

421
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,400
Aren't you going to pick up Le Le?

422
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,000
I can't live anymore.

423
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,200
Take your time.

424
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,800
It's okay. Don't cry.

425
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,400
Don't cry.

426
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,200
Professor Ren, I think I can't get better.

427
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm controlling my emotions as you taught me.

428
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm really controlling them.

429
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,400
But why is everyone

430
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,000
pushing me so hard?

431
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,400
How?

432
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,200
They are really too much.

433
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,400
They are so arrogant.

434
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,600
My ex-mother-in-law,

435
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,800
she wants to steal my child from me.

436
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,400
She wants to take my son away.

437
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,600
I have nothing left.

438
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,200
But I've already thought about it.

439
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,000
If someone dares to take my son away,

440
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,800
I will surely die with them.

441
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,800
You won't die with them.

442
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,800
You are really fine this time.

443
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,600
You are really going to be reborn.

444
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,200
Professor Ren, I'm already so angry with them.

445
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,400
You are still making fun of me.

446
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,600
I'm not making fun.

447
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,600
You were very weak before you came here.

448
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,800
This time, you are very angry.

449
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,600
And you are full of anger.

450
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,200
Chengyin,

451
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,800
emotions are something that

452
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,600
we all have to face for our whole lives.

453
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,000
It's not like we can just listen to a class

454
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,800
and we can just be in a big mess.

455
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,600
A big mess.

456
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,000
But if that's really the case,

457
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
then you will be reborn.

458
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
We are both physically and mentally.

459
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,400
We can't just do one thing and it's done.

460
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Emotions

461
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,200
are not something that you can endure or control.

462
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
That is unhealthy.

463
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,800
And it will hurt you.

464
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,800
If you have emotions,

465
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:01,000
the one that can dissolve them is loyalty.

466
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,200
Loyalty to the right and the wrong.

467
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,800
If you can't dissolve them, what will you do?

468
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Then let them release them peacefully.

469
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,000
It's not like a mountain of reds and yellows.

470
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,200
Isn't that okay?

471
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,000
Loyalty to the right and the wrong.

472
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
These four words.

473
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,200
If you can do one thing,

474
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,400
then you are healthy.

475
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,800
Come.

476
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,600
Let's play.

477
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,400
Then, look at my illness.

478
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,600
Can I still be cured?

479
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,200
If you want to reconcile with yourself, then you can.

480
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,800
How can I reconcile with myself?

481
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,000
Look at this person.

482
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,200
There are very few things that you can control.

483
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,400
You can't control how others think of you or say you.

484
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,200
What should you do?

485
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,400
Be nice to yourself.

486
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,400
I just don't know how to be nice to myself.

487
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,000
Look, if you are happy,

488
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,400
you still care about the unhappiness before.

489
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,200
Just like you have a million now.

490
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,400
You still care about the 10 or 20 dollars you lost before.

491
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,400
Remember to let go of yourself.

492
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,800
You hate your ex-husband and hate your mother-in-law.

493
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,000
They are all a knife stuck in your chest.

494
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,200
What relationship can you remember by picking up your own hair?

495
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,600
Doing this can only hurt the person who loves you.

496
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,200
For example, your son.

497
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,400
He doesn't have any effect on others.

498
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,400
Letting go of yourself is very important.

499
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,800
Enough. Don't cry.

500
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,600
Go back. I should get off work too.

501
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,200
You still haven't prescribed me the medicine.

502
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,600
I just touched your pulse. It's very mild.

503
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,200
The medicine is just an eye-catching method.

504
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,800
Then you should prescribe me some eye-catching methods.

505
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,400
I need to digest your prescription.

506
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,400
cautas

507
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:55,900
Essence

508
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,900
I'm still in the lounge

509
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,900
I'm being encouraged

510
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,900
Mr. Ren, dinner and supper tonight

511
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,900
are all on me

512
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,900
Don't blame me

513
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,900
You're a member of the teacher's class

514
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,900
This is what you should do

515
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,900
I mean

516
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,900
monitor has no sense of responsibility

517
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,900
He just knows Chen Tian is yelling here

518
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,900
Right

519
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,900
When did you two

520
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,900
become so consistent?

521
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,900
But isn't our teacher's class

522
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,900
already cold?

523
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,900
When did you take a leave?

524
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,900
Did you go to work?

525
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,900
Why didn't I see Mr. Yang?

526
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,900
I saw that Mr. Dong

527
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,900
was in the clinic

528
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,900
He was self-studying

529
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,900
and he was Mr. Dong's

530
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,900
favorite student

531
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,900
He was so reluctant to go to class

532
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,900
He's been stuck

533
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,900
in the back for days

534
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,900
He disappears

535
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,900
every few hours

536
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,900
You don't know

537
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,900
what he does

538
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,900
If you ask him

539
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,900
he won't tell you

540
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,900
I guess

541
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,900
he's going to

542
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,900
work in the bank

543
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,900
He's going to work in the bank

544
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,900
He's going to work in the bank

545
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,900
I guess he's going to

546
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,900
work in the bank

547
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,900
Why are you so

548
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,900
grumpy and miserable?

549
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,900
I haven't started to fight

550
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,900
You've already

551
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,900
beaten yourself to death

552
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,900
Dong

553
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,900
Miss

554
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,900
Where's Professor Ren?

555
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,900
Teacher is inside

556
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,900
Grandma, I'm coughing

557
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,900
Look

558
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,900
No, teacher

559
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,900
There are patients inside

560
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,900
Are there any other symptoms

561
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,900
besides coughing?

562
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,900
Did you take the medicine?

563
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,900
I gave him the medicine

564
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,900
on time every day

565
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,900
I took it without any problem

566
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,900
I followed

567
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,900
Professor Ren's instructions

568
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,900
to let him

569
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,900
wake up early

570
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,900
and take the medicine on time

571
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,900
Actually, his coughing

572
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,900
is much better than before

573
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,900
As a result, this morning

574
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,900
Anni called me

575
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,900
and said that

576
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,900
his grandma vomited all night

577
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,900
I went there

578
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,900
and asked him to take the medicine

579
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,900
But he vomited all the medicine

580
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,900
and even vomited blood

581
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,900
Did he cough and cough?

582
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,900
Are there any other symptoms

583
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,900
besides coughing and bleeding?

584
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,900
Headache, stomachache,

585
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,900
coldness

586
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,900
No, no

587
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,900
No, no

588
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,900
No, no

589
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,900
No, no

590
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,900
No, no

591
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,900
No, no

592
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,900
No, no

593
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,900
No, no

594
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,900
No, no

595
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,900
No, no

596
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,900
No, no

597
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,900
No, no

598
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,900
No, no

599
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,900
He vomited blood

600
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,900
It's okay

601
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,900
Don't worry

602
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,900
It's not a big problem

603
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,900
According to the original plan

604
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,900
he should be in the hospital tomorrow

605
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,900
Yes, yes, yes

606
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,900
Tomorrow

607
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,900
But he vomited blood

608
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,900
Anni is at home

609
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,900
with him now

610
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,900
Professor Ren

611
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,900
It's probably better

612
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,900
to go to the hospital

613
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,900
to do CT

614
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,900
I suggest you

615
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,900
send him to the hospital

616
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,900
Miss

617
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,900
In your understanding

618
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,900
only the western medicine is called hospital

619
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,900
The brand on my door

620
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,900
was also sent by the health committee

621
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,900
I admit

622
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,900
Chinese medicine is amazing

623
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,900
Chinese medicine is treated

624
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,900
on some diseases

625
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,900
My dad's

626
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,900
spondylitis is very effective

627
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,900
Although spondylitis

628
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,900
is not treated

629
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,900
it will be better

630
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,900
But if the old lady

631
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,900
has other basic diseases

632
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,900
If the spondylitis is broken

633
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,900
it will be troublesome

634
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,900
Yes, yes, yes

635
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,900
It's scary to cough and bleed

636
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,900
Anni is crying

637
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,900
Don't worry

638
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,900
According to the current condition

639
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,900
of Bai Mu

640
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,900
coughing and bleeding

641
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,900
is a normal thing

642
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,900
It's also a natural phenomenon

643
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,900
of the body

644
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,900
like we have been poisoned

645
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,900
We can't cough and bleed

646
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,900
But don't doubt

647
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,900
your body's resistance

648
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,900
If you follow

649
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,900
the current situation

650
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,900
it should be better

651
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,900
in the early morning

652
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,900
You can go to

653
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,900
inform him later

654
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,900
Tomorrow

655
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,900
you should come to the hospital

656
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,900
Okay

657
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,900
Don't worry

658
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,900
Don't worry

659
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,900
Good news

660
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,900
Professor Ren

661
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,900
Xiao Hu

662
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,900
Good news

663
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,900
I found a place

664
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,900
to rent

665
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,900
for our class

666
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,900
Would you like to go and have a look?

667
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,900
What?

668
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,900
You also live in this hospital?

669
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,900
Where?

670
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,900
Near here

671
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,900
You can see it anytime

672
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,900
I'll go now

673
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,900
I'll change my clothes

674
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,900
Professor Ren

675
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,900
You don't want to see

676
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,900
Moli?

677
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,900
I don't mind

678
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,900
You are worried about your master

679
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,900
I have to go with you

680
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,900
Miss

681
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,900
Wait for me

682
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,900
I'll go with you

683
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,900
Okay

684
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,900
Master Yuan

685
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,900
I have been

686
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,900
around here

687
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,900
almost everywhere

688
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,900
This is the best place

689
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,900
First

690
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,900
this place is big enough

691
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,900
We can have more people to have classes

692
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,900
Do you know?

693
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,900
This is

694
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,900
an art gallery

695
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,900
So these sections

696
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,900
and so on

697
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,900
have been opened

698
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,900
The space is very clear

699
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,900
Like Professor Dong's

700
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,900
handwork class

701
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,900
you can have classes here

702
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,900
Right, Professor Ren

703
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,900
And this side

704
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,900
Come and have a look

705
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,900
There are several small rooms here

706
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,900
So

707
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,900
our interrogation

708
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,900
and acupuncture classes

709
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,900
can be done

710
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,900
in these rooms

711
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,900
The most important thing is

712
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,900
this is close to our clinic

713
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,900
It's convenient

714
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,900
for us to arrange classes

715
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,900
And

716
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,900
some of our classmates

717
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,900
can go home at night

718
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,900
to sleep

719
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,900
and reduce the burden

720
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,900
of our master's class

721
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,900
The most important thing is

722
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,900
the landlord heard

723
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,900
that we would have to pay a long rent

724
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,900
The rent

725
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,900
gave us a great discount

726
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,900
It must be a lot of money

727
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,900
Not bad

728
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,900
The rent is much cheaper

729
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,900
than the market price

730
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,900
Really?

731
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,900
This house

732
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,900
is really good

733
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,900
But

734
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,900
the price may

735
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,900
not be able to be reduced

736
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,900
What should we do?

737
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,900
How about

738
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,900
I take you

739
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,900
to this side

740
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,900
That building over there?

741
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,900
Yes

742
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,900
Because I think

743
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,900
this building

744
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,900
meets your requirements

745
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,900
And for the price

746
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,900
it will be more spacious

747
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,900
The price has been

748
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,900
given to the lowest

749
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,900
You can contact me

750
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,900
if you need anything

751
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,900
Okay

752
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,900
I see

753
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,900
Thank you

754
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,900
Okay, bye

755
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,900
Bye bye

756
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,900
How is it?

757
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,900
Is my house okay?

758
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,900
Yes

759
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,900
I think the house

760
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,900
is not a problem

761
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,900
Mr. Ma

762
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,900
You have to give me

763
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,900
a little more discount

764
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,900
Rebecca

765
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,900
You know

766
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,900
how much

767
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,900
my market price is

768
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,900
I have reported the base price

769
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,900
Besides, you have been

770
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,900
in the business for five years

771
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,900
I haven't paid

772
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,900
a higher rent

773
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,900
I have told you

774
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,900
if you want to buy a house

775
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,900
you have to pay a higher rent

776
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,900
I have told you

777
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,900
if you want to buy a house

778
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,900
you have to pay a higher rent

779
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,900
I have told you

780
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,900
if you want to buy a house

781
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,900
you have to pay a higher rent

782
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,900
I have told you

783
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,900
if I pay a higher rent

784
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,900
I won't deduct a penny from you

785
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,900
But we teach

786
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,900
public service in the master class

787
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,900
The lower the cost, the better

788
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,900
I don't have a high rent

789
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,900
I know

790
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,900
Otherwise, I won't

791
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,900
pay a high rent

792
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,900
But

793
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,900
your house is not adjacent

794
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,900
The subway stations on both sides

795
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,900
are a little far

796
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,900
The Internet red years

797
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,900
around you

798
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,900
are at least guaranteed

799
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,900
It's hard for you

800
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,900
to find a house

801
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,900
like mine

802
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,900
that can be rented

803
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,900
for a long time

804
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,900
If you manage it separately

805
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,900
the cost is high

806
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,900
If you come here today

807
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,900
you can leave tomorrow

808
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,900
You are not familiar with others

809
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,900
I know my place

810
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,900
I have my trust here

811
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,900
I won't run away

812
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,900
Ms. Yang

813
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,900
You are a personal guarantee

814
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,900
What unit

815
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,900
can you invest so much in?

816
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,900
The future of an industry

817
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,900
This is a peak

818
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,900
What can I say?

819
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,900
Can you give me some shares?

820
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,900
Public service

821
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,900
No return

822
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,900
You can invest money and time

823
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,900
You can take the shares

824
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,900
How about this, Mr. Ma?

825
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,900
I rent here for one day

826
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,900
I will be your

827
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,900
legal consultant for free

828
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,900
You said it

829
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,900
I can sign the contract

830
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,900
to supplement the terms

831
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,900
and make it my own

832
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,900
OK, let's do it

833
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,900
This way, please

834
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,900
OK, thank you

835
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,900
You have put a lot of effort

836
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,900
It's what I should do

837
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,900
It's mainly my friend's help

838
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,900
Yes

839
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,900
I can do it

840
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,900
Thank you

841
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,900
I hope you can help me

842
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,900
I'm willing to do it

843
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,900
Thank you

844
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,900
Thank you

845
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,900
I forgot

846
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,900
How much is your Puman?

847
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,900
About half

848
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,900
You can get it

849
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,900
after you go back today

850
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,900
Xiaohong

851
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,900
It's a pleasure

852
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,900
to have a apprentice like you

853
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,900
Thank you

854
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,900
You're welcome

855
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,900
But in my heart

856
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,900
I have long recognized

857
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,900
Mr. Dong as my master

858
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,900
Because

859
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,900
I really want to

860
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,900
inherit the skills

861
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,900
Great

862
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,900
Mr. Dong is great

863
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,900
Mr. Dong is really

864
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,900
a rare person

865
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,900
OK

866
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,900
By the way, Mr. Dong

867
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,900
Although it's not expensive

868
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,900
the monthly rent

869
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,900
is quite high

870
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,900
Don't worry

871
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,900
I have money

872
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,900
Thank you

873
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,900
Cheers

874
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,900
It's so scary to walk

875
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,900
without a sound

876
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,900
We have a big box

877
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,900
How big

878
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,900
Who are you going to install?

879
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,900
My female apprentice

880
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,900
found me a house

881
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,900
I can start class at ten o'clock

882
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,900
You have to tell someone

883
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,900
to help me pack

884
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,900
and send it to someone

885
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,900
I interview you

886
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,900
Which female apprentice

887
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,900
is so blind?

888
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,900
Lawyer Yang

889
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,900
She

890
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,900
You tell Lawyer Yang

891
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,900
how much you have lost

892
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,900
in your life

893
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,900
You tell him

894
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,900
You won't spend a penny

895
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,900
for a woman in your life

896
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,900
Am I that stingy?

897
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,900
You

898
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,900
She has money

899
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,900
She won't show me her face

900
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,900
You have a dream

901
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,900
a little early

902
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,900
Do you still sell this house?

903
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,900
Sell

904
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,900
Why?

905
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,900
You have someone to take over

906
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,900
Why do you still sell

907
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,900
my father's house?

908
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,900
No, sell the house

909
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,900
Yang Xiaohong

910
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,900
found that house

911
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,900
It's cheap

912
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,900
and in the city center

913
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,900
We have to pay the rent

914
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,900
That's it

915
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,900
You say

916
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,900
I called the agent

917
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,900
He said the house in our community

918
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,900
is not for sale

919
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,900
I can give you the money soon

920
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,900
In addition, I also let them pay attention

921
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,900
Is there a suitable rent?

922
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,900
Don't worry

923
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,900
We two retired old people

924
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,900
No matter the house or the house

925
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,900
They all have work

926
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,900
Master

927
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,900
Ling Lan said

928
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,900
Our house

929
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,900
Our house is not for sale

930
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,900
I'm going to clean up

931
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,900
We move back to live

932
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,900
Let's be small

933
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,900
We squeeze

934
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,900
Meng Meng and Toto

935
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,900
can't live with us

936
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,900
There is no place

937
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,900
Let them go back to their homes

938
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,900
I live in the dormitory

939
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,900
I give them two rooms

940
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,900
No

941
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,900
You say I can't live in the school

942
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,900
And let Meng Meng

943
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,900
Keep it here

944
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,900
No

945
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,900
Naive

946
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,900
Still have to live in the house

947
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,900
Otherwise, there will be no bar to drink

948
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,900
Toto

949
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,900
There is no home

950
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,900
We can give him a bed

951
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,900
in the hall

952
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,900
Meng Meng has a home

953
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,900
Meng Meng can go home

954
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,900
No, grandpa

955
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,900
Grandpa can live for a few years

956
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,900
You can't be filial

957
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,900
Go out with me

958
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,900
No

959
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,900
Go

960
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,900
What to do

961
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,900
Toto

962
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,900
Toto

963
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,900
Toto

964
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,900
Toto

965
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,860
You

966
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,900
Toto

967
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,900
Toto

968
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,900
Toto

969
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,900
Toto

970
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,900
Yes

971
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,900
Toto

972
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,900
Toto

973
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,900
Toto

974
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,900
Toto

975
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,500
Okay.

976
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,420
Good news then.

977
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,820
For real.

978
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,500
fits.

979
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:00,700
Sure.

980
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,700
What about.

981
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,260
She's not mad at all.

982
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,380
You want to lose the sun

983
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,060
and the moon.

984
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,780
What do you mean?

985
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,020
What do you mean?

986
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,980
Are you going to move to Yang Xiaohong's place

987
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,580
tonight?

988
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,460
No.

989
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,100
Don't run.

990
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,380
You're jealous.

991
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,220
Me?

992
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,620
Why should I be jealous?

993
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,020
I want to take back

994
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,220
all the money you spent on me

995
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,860
in the previous life.

996
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,740
You're jealous.

997
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,020
You're jealous.

998
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:47,980
Actually...

999
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,980
I was afraid that I would be an exception.

1000
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,280
My granddaughter didn't sleep at all.

1001
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,880
She just went to sleep.

1002
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,680
So I called the doctor.

1003
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,080
He didn't come.

1004
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,480
I see.

1005
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,480
Don't think too much.

1006
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,480
I'm standing up for your father.

1007
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,480
I respect people.

1008
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,880
He's coughing.

1009
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,680
I won't cough anymore.

1010
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,480
You won't cough anymore?

1011
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,280
I won't cough anymore.

1012
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,080
You won't cough anymore?

1013
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,280
Yes, I won't cough anymore.

1014
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,280
Come, let me show you.

1015
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,280
Come.

1016
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,480
What are you doing?

1017
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,280
I'm going to sleep.

1018
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,680
I'll go to sleep.

1019
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,680
How was your sleep last night?

1020
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,280
I slept very well.

1021
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,780
Actually, I slept very well

1022
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,480
from the time I was taking the medicine.

1023
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,280
I don't understand.

1024
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,280
You'll understand after a long touch.

1025
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,880
You did sleep well.

1026
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,280
Yes.

1027
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,680
Your pulse is much better than before.

1028
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,880
Chinese characters are very interesting.

1029
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,680
I just said sleep.

1030
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,680
That sleep

1031
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,480
is through the sense of sense.

1032
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,280
The sense of sense of sense.

1033
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,880
After you sleep well,

1034
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,980
you'll have a sense of sense

1035
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,980
of every function of your body.

1036
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,580
If you feel uncomfortable,

1037
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,980
you'll adjust it yourself.

1038
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,180
Remember,

1039
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,180
if a person can do it well for three things,

1040
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,580
it should be his health.

1041
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,180
What three things?

1042
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,580
Eat,

1043
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,780
sleep,

1044
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,980
and pull.

1045
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,180
There are many reasons for a person's illness.

1046
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,280
For example,

1047
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,280
what does the virus have to do with these three things?

1048
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,280
Why do you say

1049
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,280
some people can get infected

1050
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,280
and some people can't get infected?

1051
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,280
It's because of the immunity of your body.

1052
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,280
What is the immunity of the body?

1053
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
It's the supply.

1054
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,280
If a person has a supply,

1055
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,280
the virus will not enter the body.

1056
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,280
For example, when we charge our phone,

1057
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,380
we charge it by sleeping.

1058
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,380
With an app,

1059
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,380
it can operate normally.

1060
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,380
But

1061
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,380
there must be space in the phone.

1062
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,380
If there is no space,

1063
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,380
it's just a brick.

1064
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,380
I see.

1065
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,380
So you're saying

1066
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,380
we have to clean up the memory often.

1067
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,380
Actually, I often tell my classmates

1068
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,380
that everything

1069
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,380
is a regular prop.

1070
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,480
If we find the rules,

1071
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,480
there will be a circle.

1072
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,480
If we operate according to the rules,

1073
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
we will be eliminated.

1074
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,480
No wonder you always say

1075
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,480
the world is harmonious.

1076
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,480
I thought you meant

1077
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,480
people should be harmonious with the world.

1078
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,480
If people have a supply,

1079
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,480
they can be harmonious with the world.

1080
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
By the way, Mr. Chen,

1081
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,480
I'm curious about one more thing.

1082
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,480
How do you know

1083
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,480
that he won't cough in the middle of the night?

1084
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,580
The uncle said so.

1085
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,580
The uncle over there?

1086
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,580
Look.

1087
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,580
He doesn't study hard.

1088
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,580
Tell him.

1089
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,580
When he was diagnosed with the disease,

1090
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,580
he had 275 injuries from the cancer.

1091
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,580
Great.

1092
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,580
I didn't see it.

1093
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:39,580
I knew he would test me today.

1094
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,680
I went to memorize it the night before.

1095
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,680
That's even better.

1096
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,680
You're the insect in my stomach.

1097
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,680
It's amazing.

1098
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,680
The books from 2000 years ago

1099
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,680
are still useful today.

1100
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,680
It's incredible.

1101
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,680
Miss Bai Mo,

1102
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,680
I'm going to change your way.

1103
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,680
Are you ready?

1104
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,680
Take your time.

1105
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,780
Take your time.

1106
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,780
Look.

1107
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,780
I said that Chinese medicine is the best.

1108
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,780
I don't like to hear you talk.

1109
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,780
No one likes to hear him talk.

1110
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,780
Get out.

1111
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,780
Get out.

1112
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,780
I want to get some air.

1113
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,780
This is a student.
