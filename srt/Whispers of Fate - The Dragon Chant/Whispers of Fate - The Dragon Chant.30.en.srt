not to believe what you say.

and at the end,

114
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,390

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,260

116
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,620

Lici.

118
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,190
I'm jealous of you.

119
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Because I'm more powerful than you?

120
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,340
Because despite how dangerous you were,

121
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,920
Fang Zhou still chose to trust you,

122
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,970
passing the Heart-Moon Return to you,

123
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,610
and Zhoudi Tower as well.

124
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,430

125
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,580
I was here long before you.

126
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,630
What was I to him?

127
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,010
You were a good junior to him

128
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,240
and a bad senior to me.

129
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:20,960
Actually,

130
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,840
he knew I was hiding something.

131
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,290
Yet he still chose to believe in me.

132
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,750
But I

133
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,490
couldn't bring myself

134
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,380
to trust Shei from the beginning.

135
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,550
Shei?

136
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,870
Hao Wenhou's fiancée?

137
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,030
I originally thought

138
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,420
you sent her to me.

139
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,320
Why would I send someone

140
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,850
with no martial arts skills

141
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,530
to you?

142
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,200
Then why did Fang Zhou trust me?

143
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,640
Because that's just how he was.

144
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,440
He clearly knew

145
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,000
about your connection

146
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,270
with Yique Yinyang.

147
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,020
Yet he still believed
he could guide you properly.

148
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,700
Only he could do that.

149
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,480
I couldn't.

150
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,960
And you

151
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,510
couldn't either.

152
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,670
Did he really love every single person

153
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,980
in this world that much?

154
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,750
He would

155
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,480
sacrifice himself for someone

156
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,080
he'd never even met.

157
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,200
How foolish.

158
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
I think so too.

159
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,630
I told him that.

160
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,530
But he wouldn't listen.

161
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,320
One time,

162
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,920
he brought an injured tiger
from the mountain

163
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,920
back to Zhoudi Tower for treatment.

164
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,440
It scared away all the children

165
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
living in the peach blossom forest.

166
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,300
Fu had to feed the tiger.

167
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,460
When the tiger roared,

168
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,280
he was scared half to death.

169
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,170
Any news about Fu?

170
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,620
I've been looking for him too.

171
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,370
I miss Fu's cooking.

172
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,870
Indeed.

173
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,460
Where can we find a chef

174
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,930
who masters cuisines from nine provinces?

175
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,030
So,

176
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,870
whenever I arrive at a new place,

177
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,870
I visit the famous local restaurants

178
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,030
to taste their food.

179
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,390
If Fu really became a chef,

180
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,770
his restaurant

181
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,030
would certainly be

182
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,760
the most famous one in the area.

183
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,790
Fu's cooking—

184
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,640
I could recognize it with just one bite.

185
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,360
Perhaps

186
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,680
while eating around,

187
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,480
I'll eventually find him.

188
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,390
Me too.

00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:21,880
I've searched,

191
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,550
but Fang Zhou's body isn't here.

192
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,130
You said you'd prove it to me,

193
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,030
and I'll trust you

194
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,560
one last time.

195
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,360
Follow me.

196
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,990
[Fang Zhou's Tomb]

197
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,590
This is the cenotaph I built for him.

198
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,600
His body isn't inside.

199
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,870
I know.

200
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,870
Above this tomb,

201
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,170
I've set up a formation
of the Tianren Realm.

202
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,510
Ordinary people can't see through it,

203
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,040
so it can protect Fang Zhou.

204
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,840
If what you say is true,

205
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,680
I'll return the power
of the Rebirth Scroll

206
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,470
to you.

207
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,490
This formation

208
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,750
changes with the flow of time.

209
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,400
Every day,

210
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,980
the hour

211
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,520
and direction

212
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,290
to open the formation change accordingly.

213
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,420
Even on the same day,

214
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,490
the position
to open the formation differs.

215
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,000
From the position
of the one opening the formation,

216
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,510
the moon

217
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,790
must be

218
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,450
directly above the cenotaph.

219
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,360
If you miss the time,

220
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,510
you cannot

221
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,260
open it again that day.

222
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,910
Besides,

223
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,390
opening the formation

224
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,850
also requires the power
of the bone-washing silver bracelet.

225
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,900
Senior.

226
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,110
I've made an agreement with Shui Duopo.

227
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,200
As long as you return
the power of the Rebirth Scroll

228
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,880
to me,

229
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,710
she will extract from my abdomen

230
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,730
Fang Zhou's heart crystal

231
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,820
to help resurrect him.

232
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,810
I want to see him again.

233
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,640
May I?

234
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,510
Yes,

235
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,740
but not for too long.

236
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,640
Yan.

237
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,170
We need to seal the coffin now.

238
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,070
I keep telling myself

239
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,240
not to be deceived by you.

240
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,440
But I still can't help

241
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,170
believing you again and again.

242
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,310
Now,

243
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,050
you're trying to fool me

244
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,080
with such a cheap trick,

245
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,000
and you still expect me to believe you?

246
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,530
What are you talking about?

247
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
How could this be?

248
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
How could this be?

249
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,550
It's impossible.

250
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,610
How could this happen?

251
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,960
Where is Fang Zhou?

252
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,170
Where's Fang Zhou?

253
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,510
Tang Lici,

254
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,000
you're still acting even now!

255
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,920
How could this happen?

256
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,120
Where exactly is Fang Zhou?

257
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,140
Where is he?

258
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,160
Where exactly is he?

259
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,590
Fang Zhou's been dead for years!

260
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,400
He died at Zhoudi Tower four years ago!

261
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,800
His body was never found!

262
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,110
Tang Lici.

263
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,720
Don't try to fool me again!

264
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:43,920
Liu Yan.

265
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,000
Did you tell Ghostly Peony

266
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,880
about Fang Zhou?

267
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,210
Do you take me for a fool?

268
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,510
I didn't tell anyone

269
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,440
about Fang Zhou!

270
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,830
So you do know him.

271
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,880
Has Ghostly Peony

272
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,340
ever been to Zhoudi Tower?

273
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,460
You just said it yourself.

274
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,440
This is a formation of the Tianren Realm.

275
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,350
Without the bone-washing silver bracelet,

276
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,350
no one can open it.

277
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,270
He did come here,

278
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,870
but he couldn't do anything!

279
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,070
Ghostly Peony is Yique Yinyang!

280
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,440
Yeah.

281
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,910
Ghostly Peony is Yique Yinyang.

282
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,960
Why didn't I realize this sooner?

283
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,270
He's not merely the vessel

284
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,870
for Yique Yinyang's spirit.

285
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,140
He's Yique Yinyang himself!

286
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,690
Otherwise…

287
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,010
how could he open the formation?

288
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,280
Impossible.

289
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:40,580
Impossible.

290
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:41,970
Impossible!

291
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,830
Shut up!

292
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,750
No, you shut up!

293
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:51,790
Liu Yan.

294
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,590
Listen to me.

295
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,550
Ghostly Peony has stolen

296
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,550
Fang Zhou's body.

297
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,550
Let's join forces

298
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,240
to make him return

299
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
Fang Zhou's body.

300
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,460
Tang Lici, you're really something.

301
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,070
How can you tell one lie

302
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,240
after another?

303
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,640
Liu Yan!

304
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,400
Shut up!

305
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,110
Fine.

306
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,200
You won't help me.

307
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,050
Then I'll do it myself.

308
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,750
Tell me.

309
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,550
Where is Ghostly Peony?

310
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,600
After I kill you,

311
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,000
I'll send him to see you.

312
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,200
Liu Yan.

313
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,670
I'm asking you one more time.

314
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,160
Where is

315
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,270
Ghostly Peony?

316
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,110
Yan!

317
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,720
Don't go!

318
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,590
Yan.

319
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:04,550
Fang Zhou.

320
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,120
Ghostly Peony.

321
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,110
Ghostly Peony!

322
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,310
Tang Lici will definitely not let you go.

323
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,550
The formation of the Tianren Realm

324
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,350
required the bone-washing silver bracelet
as the key.

325
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,880
Fortunately, Qiaoyi Qiankun
made it in time.

326
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,480
That was close,

327
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,080
wasn't it?

328
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,200
Fang Zhou's body is missing.

329
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,000
Do you think

330
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,960
Tang Lici can still remain calm?

331
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,350
At least,

332
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,440
Liu Yan can't stay calm.

333
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,640
Lies attract more lies.

334
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,400
Around one lie,

335
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,110
there are at least four more.

336
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,170
Fang Pingzhai's Inverted Dream.

337
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,830
Fang Zhou's body at Zhoudi Tower.

338
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,790
Around Tang Lici,

339
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,150
how many more lies are there?

340
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
Head Fang,

341
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,100
I can't persuade your disciple.

342
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,920
I just hope
that when you learn your resurrection

343
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,880
was paid for

344
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,400
with your disciple's life,

345
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,460
you won't blame me.

346
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,480
Miss Shei.

347
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,240
Senior.

348
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,480
Mr. Tang has been gone for days.

349
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,750
Do you know where he went?

350
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,280
He's not my responsibility.

351
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,310
Besides,

352
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,270
that fox

353
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,790
must be plotting something.

354
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,510
He might be

355
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,310
stirring up trouble somewhere.

356
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,920
You talk

357
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,390
just like Chi.

358
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,110
Do I?

359
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,060
I told you he's cunning.

360
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,750
This is

361
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,920
Head Fang's figurine?

362
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,480
You know it?

363
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,950
I've seen it before.

364
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,750
Mr. Tang has been carving it recently.

365
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,130
I didn't expect

366
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,050
he'd finish it so quickly.

367
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,190
His face...

368
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,710
Shei.

369
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,000
Brother.

370
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,000
My sister Fang Ci

371
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,030
is now in your care.

372
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,280
I must go to the mountain to learn skills

373
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,070
to fight against Yique Yinyang.

374
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,600
I don't know if I'll survive.

375
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,220
Her past name no longer matters.

376
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,830
From now on, call her Shei.

377
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,590
Father.

378
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,410
Your brother's name is

379
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,160
Fang Zhou.

380
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,830
He's been looking for you.

381
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,680
Brother.

382
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,680
It's me.

383
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,480
Brother.

384
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,270
Brother, where are you?

385
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:13,960
Brother!

386
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,110
He's Tang Lici.

387
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,880
Do you want revenge?

388
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,710
With your memory intact,

389
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,390
you can't fool Tang Lici.

390
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,160
Have you lost your memory before?

391
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,880
What?

392
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,590
I used the Xuluo needle

393
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,170
to pierce your Yuzhen acupoint.

394
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,300
You had no reaction.

395
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,550
This is a symptom of memory loss.

396
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,650
Forget your brother.

397
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,400
Miss Shei,

398
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,030
you confuse me.

399
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,550
You're in this game,

400
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,350
yet you know

401
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,800
nothing about it.

402
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,240
Miss Shei.

403
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,150
Miss Shei, what's wrong?

404
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,200
Shei?

405
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,300
Fang Zhou is gone.

406
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,520
He really died because of me.

407
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,070
Fang Zhou is gone.

408
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,620
He really died because of me.

409
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,070
Master!

410
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,400
Master!

411
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,310
I need to complete the final refinement

412
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,970
of the Thousand Curse Needle.

413
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:37,720
Get out!

414
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,270
No.

415
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,720
To refine the Thousand Curse Needle,

416
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,580
you must force it out
through the Tianmen acupoint.

417
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,160
The pain will kill you.

418
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,250
If Tang Lici isn't dead yet,

419
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,480
how can I die?

420
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,480
Master.

421
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,510
Tang Lici

422
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,770
isn't worth you suffering like this.

423
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,480
Master!

424
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,240
Don't tell me what to do!

425
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,880
Get out!

426
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,070
Master!

427
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:11,720
Master!

428
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,870
Open the door!

429
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,750
Master!

430
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,720
Master!

431
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,750
Tang Lici.

432
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,830
I'll make you wish you were dead.

433
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,350
I'll make you wish you were dead!

434
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,720
Mr. Tang,

435
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,160
reports from the front:

436
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,400
Xifang Tao has gathered troops
on the western front.

437
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,550
Fucui is on the eastern side.

438
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,920
It seems they plan

439
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,310
to strike from both sides

440
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,970
to attack the Sword Alliance.

441
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,750
They're determined to fight

442
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,480
to the death with the Alliance.

443
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,690
Master Shao,

444
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,930
any news of Ghostly Peony?

445
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:04,720
Not yet,

446
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,790
but Fengliu Shop has mobilized
all their forces this time.

447
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,770
Ghostly Peony will certainly come.

448
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,270
Tongsha River and Xiulao Peak

449
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,130
on the east and west of Mount Cloud

450
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,030
are crucial for gaining

451
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,090
the upper hand against the Alliance.

452
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,400
Mr. Tang,

453
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,220
do you have a strategy?

454
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:39,890
At this moment,

455
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,640
neither side has fully recovered
its strength.

456
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,400
Fengliu Shop has sent out all their forces

457
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,000
because they want a quick victory.

458
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,030
With this battle,

459
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:52,110
they aim to determine the winner
between them and us.

460
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,920
The Tongsha River
forms a natural barrier to the west.

461
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,270
The banks on both sides are flat.

462
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,720
Liu Yan will deploy
the Nine Qilin Transformations

463
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,400
there.

464
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,110
We can position
our main forces along the river.

465
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,160
Master Puzhu and I

466
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,750
will lead the Sword Alliance

467
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,440
and the Yanmen disciples to fight them.

468
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,370
On the east side,

469
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,030
at Xiulao Peak,

470
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,720
we can take advantage of the mountain

471
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,960
and maintain a strong defense.

472
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,690
Master Shao,

473
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,350
you and Master Cheng

474
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,310
should establish
a defensive line here together.

475
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,910
Hold your ground without attacking.

476
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,170
Once Master Puzhu and I

477
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,110
break through the western line together,

478
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,750
we'll move downstream along the river

479
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,080
and circle behind Fucui

480
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,680
to attack from both the front and back.

481
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,720
Fengliu Shop

482
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,510
will be annihilated in this one battle.

483
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,480
If Liu Yan makes a move…

484
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:34,990
Even if he doesn't come for me,

485
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,180
I'll go after him.

486
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,960
Master.

487
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,280
All troops are in position.

488
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,660
We await your command.

489
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,400
Starting tomorrow,

490
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,640
gather all our forces

491
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,040
to completely destroy the Sword Alliance.

492
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,040
Notify Qiaoyi Qiankun

493
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,560
to act as the vanguard

494
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,560
and break through the front line
at the Tongsha River.

495
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,670
Qingchan,

496
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,960
you will assist Palace Chief Xifang.

497
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,750
The battle at Tongsha River

498
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,640
can't be lost!

499
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,480
Yes, Master.

500
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,200
Fucui,

501
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,830
I'm giving you the remaining

502
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,960
Blood Ghost Pills.

503
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,310
Xiulao Peak's terrain is complex.

504
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,910
You'll have to fight on foot.

505
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,240
Bring Kuanglan Wuxing

506
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,550
with you.

507
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,750
Yes.

508
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,480
Then, Master,

509
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,790
which front will you lead?

510
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,750
Wherever Tang Lici is,

511
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,060
that's where I'll be.

512
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,240
Set off now.

513
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,440
Don't worry, Mr. Chi.

514
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,020
With Yanmeng here,

515
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,440
they won't be able to cross

516
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,720
the Tongsha River.

517
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,200
Tongsha—

518
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,960
what a good name.

519
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,590
Let's kill

520
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,450
every last one of them right here.

521
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:57,930
Mr. Tang.

522
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,300
Have you found Ghostly Peony yet?

523
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,230
Ten li southwest

524
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,270
lies Master Puzhu's unit.

525
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,530
All of you stay here.

526
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,719
I'll go to help them.

527
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,280
Shen.

528
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,320
Have you noticed that Foxy Tang has been

529
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,320
acting stranger and stranger lately?

530
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,120
I'll go check.

531
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,070
Ants!

532
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,570
You're all just ants!

533
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,150
What kind of monster is that?

534
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,760
Nine Qilin Transformations!

535
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,440
Run!

536
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,190
Light Technique.

537
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,320
Unbreakable Snare!

538
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:12,590
Don't kill him!

539
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,130
Take him as a hostage.

540
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,100
Where is Ghostly Peony?

541
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,630
That's not something I should know.

542
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,380
Only one of you needs to live.

543
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,840
Let's see which one that'll be.

544
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,770
You're not escaping.

545
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,020
Step aside!

546
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,210
Puzhu's wounded!

547
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:08,840
Not my problem.

548
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,800
Tang Lici!

549
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,230
How could you lose

550
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,490
your usual composure?

551
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,260
That fire was poisonous.

552
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,650
Return to camp and rest.

553
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,570
The fire poison is fierce.

554
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,030
Master Puzhu,

555
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,280
you must return to the Sword Alliance

556
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,280
and seek treatment from Shui Duopo.

557
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,230
We're in the middle

558
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,550
of a decisive battle with Fengliu Shop.

559
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,680
I can't retreat now.

560
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,570
Going into battle wounded

561
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,430
will only aggravate the injury.

562
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:02,960
Then, Mr. Tang,

563
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
can you stay calm?

564
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,150
Why do you ask?

565
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,320
I've

566
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,280
never seen you

567
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,210
so angry before.

568
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,640
I know what I'm doing.

569
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,240
Xifang Tao, what are you doing here?

570
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,440
I'm just here to deliver medicine.

571
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,480
Why don't you two believe me?

572
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,730
A cat delivering rice to a mouse—

573
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,660
who'd buy that?

574
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,510
How is Master Puzhu?

575
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,240
If you came to spy on our forces,

576
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,230
you'll have to leave some intel

577
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,440
before you go.

578
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,430
This medicine

579
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,890
won't fully neutralize the fire poison,

580
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,920
but it can ease

581
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,520
Master Puzhu's pain for now.

582
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,970
No one here believes that.

583
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,190
I do.

584
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:18,840
Miss Tao,

585
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,960
did you bring this medicine

586
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,020
especially for me?

587
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,070
As you can see.

588
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,150
May I leave now?

589
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,550
Since you're already here,

590
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,360
why leave?

591
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:33,920
Sir,

592
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,950
don't forget

593
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,160
that we stand on opposite sides.

594
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:40,750
If that's the case,

595
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,110
why

596
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,880
save me at all?

597
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,890
I'm indebted to you.

598
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,490
I wanted to offer myself to you,

599
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,460
but I feared you'd refuse,

600
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:53,090
so all I could give was this antidote.

601
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,390
They're...

602
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,670
Is your tongue broken?

603
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:01,710
There's nothing improper
between Master Puzhu and me.

604
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,360
Besides,

605
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,590
he's the successor of Tianjing Pavilion—

606
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,640
he's as chaste as they come.

607
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,230
Foxy Tang,

608
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,040
are you just letting her go?

609
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,280
If Ghostly Peony dies,

610
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:20,960
will you

611
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,510
be free again?

612
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,440
Where is

613
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,620
Ghostly Peony?

614
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,180
If you'd asked me earlier,

615
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:32,960
I'd have told you

616
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,160
he was at Plum Garden.

617
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,440
But a few days ago,

618
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,670
he somehow

619
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:38,880
got hold of a coffin.

620
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,480
A coffin?

621
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,440
He said he was going to

622
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,840
the Sky-Ascending Pillars in Puti Valley.

623
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,880
The Sky-Ascending Pillars
built by Yique Yinyang?

624
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,400
I guess

625
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,920
he wants to place

626
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,500
that coffin there.

627
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,440
Can we trust you?

628
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,860
You won't get more from me
even if you kill me.

629
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:59,590
At least we can't let you remain a threat.

630
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:14,970
Mr. Tang,

631
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,590
isn't this repaying kindness with enmity?

632
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,250
Because of your sneak attack,

633
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,320
Master Puzhu was injured.

634
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,400
You brought him medicine

635
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,360
because you owed him a favor.

636
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:28,670
And this strike of mine

637
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,760
was for your ambush just now.

638
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,050
For seven days,

639
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,520
you'll only have 30% of your power,

640
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,770
but it won't be life-threatening.

641
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,560
This settlement

642
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,660
is more than merciful.

643
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:47,230
Mr. Tang, you're quite calculating.

644
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,000
This is indeed fair.

645
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,760
Master Puzhu,

646
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,520
farewell.

647
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,190
Why did she only say

648
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,120
farewell to you?

649
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,080
Master Puzhu,

650
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,090
your injuries are severe,

651
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,150
but if you return to the Sword Alliance,

652
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,510
Shui Duopo can heal you.

653
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:38,470
You can return to battle
within seven days.

654
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,400
That's faster than

655
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,630
Miss Xifang's

656
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,400
recovery time.

657
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:44,630
Also,

658
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,870
please notify Her Highness quickly

659
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:48,920
to send reinforcements to Tongsha River.

660
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,510
Ideally,

661
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,320
General Yuchi

662
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,080
should personally command the troops.

663
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,370
Alright.

664
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:04,550
I will return to the Alliance immediately.

665
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:06,650
Thank you, Master Puzhu.

666
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:15,710
Tang Lici.

667
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,770
I have something to say.

668
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,800
What happened?

669
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:26,840
The coffin

670
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,040
and your strange behavior.

671
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:32,230
Fang Zhou…

672
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,000
is not dead.

673
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,760
Fang Zhou isn't dead?

674
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:38,300
That's impossible.

675
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,000
Why is it impossible?

676
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,670
When Fang Zhou

677
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:46,440
had just a breath left,

678
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,550
I extracted his heart crystal
with my own hands

679
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:51,080
and buried it in my abdomen.

680
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,000
With my self-healing constitution,

681
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,260
I've been nurturing this heart crystal,

682
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:56,550
cleansing the evil energy

683
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:58,280
left by Yique Yinyang.

684
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,590
That's why

685
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:01,800
you've been having stomach pains.

686
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,800
Does Liu Yan know?

687
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:09,330
He doesn't believe me.

688
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,440
You're truly insane.
