[Episode 34]

3
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,600
What about Shei?

4
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,020
Shouldn't you be angry about that?

5
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,950
Before I answer,

6
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,530
I also want to ask you

7
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,479
a question.

8
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,800
What's the relationship

9
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,170
between Shei and Fang Zhou?

10
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,229
Why do you ask?

11
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,450
These 4 years,

12
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,150
I've been wandering around jianghu.

13
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,870
Many people like me,

14
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,920
and many dislike me,

15
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
but hatred—

16
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,360
I've only seen it in Liu Yan's eyes

17
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,000
and in Shei's.

18
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,430
I'm not a good man,

19
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,350
but I've done nothing

20
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,630
to deserve such hatred

21
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,579
from a stranger.

22
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,670
The only explanation

23
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,660
is Fang Zhou.

24
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,400
She's Fang Zhou's younger sister.

25
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,150
I see.

26
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,680
So this time,

27
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,370
you should be angry, right?

28
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,520
No.

29
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
You're laughing?

30
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:52,840
Is...

31
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,790
Is this joy?

32
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,400
No.

33
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,250
Then what is it?

34
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,320
Among all these masks of yours,

35
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,660
none...

36
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,730
show my feelings.

37
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,580
It's...

38
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,000
It's impossible.

39
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,250
These are all the expressions I recorded.

40
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,930
Then tell me,

41
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,960
is there one

42
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,400
that can hold joy

43
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,960
and anger,

44
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,360
sorrow

45
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,590
and happiness,

46
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,150
love

47
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,079
and hate all at once?

48
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,680
Is there...

49
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,540
such an expression in this world?

50
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,120
Mr. Tang,

51
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,340
are you teasing me?

52
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,670
Knowing that Fang Zhou has family alive

53
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,120
brings joy.

54
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,980
Knowing that his family is being used

55
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,110
brings anger.

56
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,880
Knowing that they will never be reunited

57
00:03:59,070 --> 00:03:59,930
brings sorrow.

58
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,790
And knowing that this person

59
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,210
is Shei...

60
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,460
brings happiness.

61
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,530
As for love and hate—

62
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,240
I don't know what to say.

63
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,560
What kind of feeling is this?

64
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,240
Leader.

65
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,600
This is relief.

66
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,630
Let me think about it.

67
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,190
Leader, take your time.

68
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,990
Shen, what should we do?

69
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,270
Everyone thinks

70
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,720
it's not the right time to save Foxy Tang.

And that Xifang Tao—

73
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,590
she refuses to say
where the Plum Garden is.

74
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,590
There's someone

75
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,950
who might know.

76
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,800
Who?

77
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,480
Bai Suche?

78
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:33,480
Once she tells you,

79
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,180
send me a message immediately.

80
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,940
And let's

81
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,350
set out together.

82
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,050
How does it feel?

83
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,040
Does avenging

84
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,920
bring you joy?

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,230
People's emotions
are really unpredictable.

86
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,480
Tomorrow will be Tang Lici's

87
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,390
last day.

88
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,760
Aren't you staying with Tang Lici?

89
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,850
These last two days,

90
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,070
I don't want to see him.

91
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,650
Leader, you don't understand.

92
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,650
I don't.

93
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,750
I hate him,

94
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,040
I love him,

95
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,240
and I resent him.

96
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,860
I'm afraid I won't bear to do it,

97
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,230
and I hate myself for that.

98
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,160
The closer his death comes,

99
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,270
the stronger

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,260
this feeling becomes.

101
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,750
Leader, tomorrow you will take

102
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,950
Tang Lici's body?

103
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,720
Actually,

104
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,950
it's Yique Yinyang's.

105
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,870
I'm just an executor.

106
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,130
If Yique Yinyang descends,

107
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,680
you will be replaced by him,

108
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,870
just like Tang Lici.

109
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,240
So tomorrow will be

110
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,560
your last day too.

111
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,550
I feel sorry for you.

112
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:57,940
It's meaningless

113
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,310
to pity me.

114
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,390
You have curiosity,

115
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,960
but unfortunately,

116
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,270
you have no feelings.

117
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,040
You know neither love nor hate,

118
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,750
neither joy nor anger,

119
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,770
and neither fear

120
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,320
nor excitement.

121
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,190
It's a pity,

122
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,360
but puppets cannot feel it.

123
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,270
All your short life,

124
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,740
you've been trying to experience,

125
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,240
desperately trying
to grasp what human emotions are.

126
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,830
I suppose all of this

127
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,980
wasn't Yique Yinyang's command.

128
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,830
If you were only a puppet,

129
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,920
how could you have thoughts

130
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,780
beyond what your master ordered?

131
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,040
It's not that you can't think of

132
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
a name for the cat—

133
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,190
you just don't dare

134
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,120
to have anything

135
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,720
truly your own in this world.

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,560
A puppet found itself

137
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,600
when dying.

138
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,930
I guess now

139
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,300
you finally understand

140
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,120
what human regret

141
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
feels like.

142
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,010
I'm going to deliver food to Mr. Tang.

143
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,060
Leader asked you to eat.

144
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,090
I've tidied up after you so many times.

145
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,530
After you finish today,

146
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,210
clean up yourself.

147
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,480
Miss Shui,

148
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,910
why did you ask to see me

149
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,240
at this hour?

150
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,200
Is the Sword Alliance really not going to

151
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,080
save Tang Lici?

152
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,840
We will, but right now...

153
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,320
Bad news. Something bad happened.

154
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,000
Shen Langhun and Chi Yun are both missing.

155
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,960
They must have gone

156
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,960
to find the Plum Garden on their own.

157
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,900
Then I'll go look for them.

158
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,690
We need to find them,

159
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,270
but you need to stay
in charge of the rear.

160
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,510
There's something suspicious

161
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,370
about Little Fox's injury this time.

162
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,960
I need you to investigate.

163
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,730
Your Highness,

164
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,840
Master Shao requests an audience.

165
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,790
Invite him in.

166
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,170
Chunji.

167
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,600
Master.

168
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,440
You don't look well.

169
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,300
What happened?

170
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,840
I'm a bit tired.

171
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,320
Master, please have a seat.

172
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,030
Okay.

173
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,840
Just in time,

174
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,170
I made your favorite tea today.

175
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,670
Really?

176
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,030
Master, what did you

177
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,390
want to see me for?

178
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,620
I had something to discuss,

179
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,630
but now that I see you,

180
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,430
it's nothing.

181
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,390
After I went back,

182
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,150
I thought about what really happened

183
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,550
the day Mr. Tang got hurt.

184
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,790
Didn't I tell you

185
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,410
I was controlled by Liu Yan?

186
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,650
I don't know why

187
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,270
I ended up stabbing Mr. Tang.

188
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,960
Why did you have that needle?

189
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,600
Liu Yan controlled me.

190
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,910
I don't even know

191
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,990
how the needle ended up on me.

192
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,870
Master,

193
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,100
you suspect me?

194
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,360
Chunji,

195
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,550
you like Mr. Tang?

196
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,410
Yes.

197
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,150
Since you like him,

198
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,360
why did you do that?

199
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,040
Master, why do you still not believe me?

200
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,570
With your personality,

201
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,830
if you really had a clear conscience,

202
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,790
you wouldn't feel guilty

203
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,270
or tormented over this.

204
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,790
Making a mistake in a moment
isn't a problem.

205
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,240
But you have to admit it.

206
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,130
I did nothing wrong.

207
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,150
Chunji.

208
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,550
You don't understand Mr. Tang at all.

209
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,510
You have no idea

210
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,910
how exhausted he is.

211
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,320
He's doing something

212
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,550
that's impossible.

213
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,870
No one is protecting him,

214
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,960
no one ever stopped him,

215
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,020
and no one has told him

216
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,800
he doesn't have to live so heavily.

217
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,160
Everyone is using him,

218
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,760
using him to get revenge,

219
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,600
to destroy Fengliu Shop.

220
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,680
Have you ever thought about

221
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,860
how heavy the burden on his shoulders

222
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,740
really is?

223
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,270
Only I understand him.

224
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,730
If you really think you did nothing wrong,

225
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,320
why didn't you go save him?

226
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,910
I know that with your personality,

227
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,240
if you know Mr. Tang is in danger,

228
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,440
you will do everything possible

229
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,200
to bring him back.

230
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,550
The reason you didn't

231
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,510
isn't that you don't want to.

232
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,390
It's that you don't know

233
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,080
how to face Mr. Tang.

234
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
But I'm trying to make up for it.

235
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,240
If I hadn't requested reinforcements

236
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,360
from the court,

237
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,080
how could we have achieved
a complete victory

238
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,680
in the Battle of Mount Cloud?

239
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:53,720
Master.

240
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,010
please help me keep this a secret.

241
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,660
You want me to keep it a secret?

242
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,060
If others find out,

243
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,770
no one will understand me.

244
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,810
You're such a silly disciple.

245
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,170
Silly disciple.

246
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,030
Master.

247
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,380
Why is it that when others make mistakes,

248
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,160
they don't always get punished,

249
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,120
but when I make a mistake,

250
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,550
I have to suffer?

251
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,520
You are a princess.

252
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,450
Apart from His Majesty,

253
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,510
no one dares make you suffer.

254
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,030
What about before I became a princess?

255
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,270
The Sword Alliance

256
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,720
was never fair to me.

257
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,760
Chunji,

258
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,790
do you remember

259
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,050
what I told you before?

260
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,650
Be a good person and do good deeds—

261
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,330
even if it costs you something,

262
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,550
you can still be at peace.

263
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
There's nothing unfair about that,

264
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,090
because I want you

265
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,600
to always be a good person.

266
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,370
Your Highness.

267
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,520
What is it now?

268
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,320
It concerns the dignity
of the royal family.

269
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
Your reputation is very important.

270
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,360
If someone wants to

271
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,960
to tarnish your reputation,

272
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,720
that is treason.

273
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,160
What do you mean?

274
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,630
My family
has been generals for generations,

275
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,830
guarding the palace.

276
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,390
The emperor of the previous dynasty
was incompetent,

277
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,910
and now His Majesty has taken the throne.

278
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,030
I've heard many things

279
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,490
that shouldn't be spoken,

280
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,070
but in the end,

281
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,350
none of them were actually said.

282
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,750
I will not allow anyone

283
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,750
to hurt my master!

284
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,580
I will go apologize to him.

285
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,760
If you dare harm my master,

286
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,200
I'll cut your head off.

287
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,000
Yes.

288
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,550
These past few days, apart from eating,

289
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,670
the Ghostly Peony has kept

290
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,800
putting me to sleep.

291
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,270
Waking me now

292
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,480
must mean he's ready.

293
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,840
I said I wouldn't see him tonight,

294
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,390
but somehow

295
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,590
I still wound up here.

296
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,320
You are a cat in the Plum Garden.

297
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,800
You should be smart.

298
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,000
Why do you eat

299
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,530
whatever anyone gives you?

300
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,630
Because it's you.

301
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,000
Even if it's poison,

302
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,270
it would eat it.

303
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,750
You and Fang Zhou

304
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,290
have the same talent.

305
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,010
You already know?

306
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
Shei,

307
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,510
I'm dying.

308
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,000
You're not an orphan.

309
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,880
You have an older brother

310
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,270
still alive.

311
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:24,040
He's Fang Zhou, Chief of Zhoudi Tower

312
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,920
in Jiangnan.

313
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,550
After I'm gone,

314
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,270
go find him.

315
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,070
Madam,

316
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,240
could you tell me

317
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,730
how to get to Zhoudi Tower?

318
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,000
You asked the right person.

319
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,070
Let me tell you.

320
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:35,800
Head that way

321
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
toward Mount Li.

322
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,270
The place you're looking for

323
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,530
is up on that mountain.

324
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,240
Thank you, Madam.

325
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,170
You're welcome.

326
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,790
Miss.

327
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,590
Are you going to Zhoudi Tower

328
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,680
for something

329
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,590
or to look for someone?

330
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,720
No.

331
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:56,930
Who are you?

332
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,480
I'm Fang Zhou.

333
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,270
Miss?

334
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,920
Are you okay?

335
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,640
Luckily,

336
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,080
it's just a sprain,

337
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,080
nothing serious.

338
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,560
But you should be careful when walking

339
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,690
these next few days.

340
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,990
You were asking about
Zhoudi Tower earlier.

341
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,450
Why do you want to go there?

342
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,160
I just...

343
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,240
read about it in a book

344
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,350
and got curious,

345
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,510
so I asked a few questions.

346
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,750
Is that so?

347
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,310
Thank you.

348
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,680
I'll be going now.

349
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:10,830
Wait.

350
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,720
Miss,

351
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,000
may I know your name?

352
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:20,370
I...

353
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,690
Shei?

354
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,240
You're Shei?

355
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,290
Brother.

356
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,050
It's really you?

357
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,310
Brother,

358
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,270
it's me.

359
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,480
I'm Shei.

360
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,580
Now that we've finally reunited,

361
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,400
that's the greatest joy.

362
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,930
Being able to see you again,

363
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,570
I have no more regrets.

364
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,480
I have a lot

365
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,210
to tell you,

366
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,200
but there is something

367
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,220
that is at a critical point right now.

368
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,660
Shei,

369
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,070
stay nearby for now.

370
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,580
After half a month,

371
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,750
come find me in Zhoudi Tower.

372
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,700
If I'm still there by then...

373
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,400
What do you mean?

374
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,090
If I happen to be away

375
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,790
by then,

376
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,800
go find Lici and the others.

377
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,070
Tell them

378
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,440
you're my sister,

379
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,090
and they'll let you in.

380
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:39,880
Okay.

381
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,160
I'm so happy to see you.

382
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,680
You know,

383
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,800
[Half a month later]

384
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,160
I have two juniors

385
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,000
I'd like to introduce you to.

386
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,070
I'm happy too.

387
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,490
What happened

388
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,120
in the past half a month?

389
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,180
I lost my family again.

390
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,010
Instead of listening to my story here,

391
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,400
shouldn't you be figuring out

392
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,200
how to get out of the Plum Garden?

393
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,530
Why should I escape?

394
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,550
What I need to do

395
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,070
isn't finished yet.

396
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,270
The time for Yique Yinyang's resurrection

397
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,070
is coming.

398
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,880
Mr. Tang, do you have any last wishes?

399
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,940
I'll try my best to fulfill them.

400
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,760
I've been thinking—

401
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,880
Tuo Dragon
relies on the power of Tianren Realm

402
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,590
to survive.

403
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,710
When it came to Shenzhou,

404
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,590
it was like a fish out of water.

405
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,480
So why is it still able to use its power?

406
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,850
Now I finally understand.

407
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,350
It's you

408
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,000
who has been continuously

409
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,060
feeding energy into the bronze tree.

410
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,880
It's those black crystals.

411
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,960
What a pity, Mr. Tang.

412
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,400
If it weren't for the fact that the timing

413
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,720
of Yique Yinyang's resurrection
cannot be missed,

414
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,350
I would have learned more

415
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,720
from you.

416
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,070
Those who take the Blood Ghost Pill

417
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,640
will produce a black crystal

418
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,840
called Black Tuli inside their bodies.

419
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,880
It's the best nourishment
for the bronze tree.

420
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,400
Now there's enough of it.

421
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,460
As long as we get your body,

422
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,550
Yique Yinyang

423
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,000
can be resurrected.

424
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,750
Well, since it's my body,

425
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,640
who will survive in the end—

426
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,720
me,

427
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,720
you,

428
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,880
or Yique Yinyang?

429
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,120
It will be

430
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,160
a combination of me and Yique Yinyang.

431
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,490
He'll have my memories,

432
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,250
and your consciousness

433
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,070
will be erased.

434
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,440
Why is your consciousness
not the one being erased?

435
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,160
You don't know how to appreciate
the delicacies of the human world,

436
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,760
nor do you know what you live for.

437
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,890
How do you like them?

438
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,570
All these dishes are good.

439
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,680
But I don't understand
what makes them good.

440
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,310
Your memories

441
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,790
are useless to him,

442
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,440
because

443
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,200
you're just a puppet.

444
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,830
Therefore,

445
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:33,930
once he awakens,

446
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,400
you will end up

447
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,810
vanishing into nothing.

448
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,720
You are right.

449
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,470
Since you don't want to lose your body,

450
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,640
and I don't want to lose my consciousness,

451
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,920
we can work together.

452
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,400
Inside the bronze tree,

453
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,240
there's a Sky-Fallen Stone

454
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,160
that traveled here with you.

455
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,340
Through it,

456
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,270
we can trace back through time.

457
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,660
Let's go back to the world's origin

458
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,350
and kill Yique Yinyang.

459
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,710
You really are

460
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,400
a presumptuous puppet.

461
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,350
However,

462
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,310
once I reach Tianren Realm,

463
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,770
my power will be restored.

464
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,750
Aren't you afraid I'll turn around

465
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,680
and kill you?

466
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:25,960
Also,

467
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,900
why don't you go yourself?

468
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,620
That's a good question.

469
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,030
I've thought about it

470
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,590
before.

471
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,030
But that's Tianren Realm.

472
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,290
It's heavily guarded.

473
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,510
If we work together,

474
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,310
nothing can go wrong.

475
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,350
Is this reason

476
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,160
good enough?

477
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,830
I'll trust you this once.

478
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,940
I'll send you back to the moment

479
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,200
before Ye Mo escaped from Tianren Realm.

480
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,360
Are you ready?

481
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,520
You'd better not play tricks.

482
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,590
[Tianren Realm]

483
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,610
Tianren Realm?

484
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,310
I'm back.

485
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,920
The power of the Rebirth Scroll

486
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,010
has also returned.

487
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,580
The bone-washing silver bracelet is gone?

488
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,740
Ye Mo,

489
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,180
where are you?

490
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:51,410
Holy Son!

491
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,880
This child

492
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,640
is a miracle created with the power

493
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,700
of the entire realm

494
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,110
and also our last chance.

495
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,650
He will end the Tianren Five Declines

496
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,000
and save everyone.

497
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,230
She is Ye Mo's mother?

498
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,320
The Holy Son is about to be born.

499
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,820
I will guard the Qi-gathering Formation

500
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,640
and will not leave the tower.

501
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,830
Holy Son!

502
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,960
Goddess, take care.

503
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,110
So

504
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,350
Ye Mo is not born yet.

505
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,150
Escort the Goddess back to Guanxing Tower.

506
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,480
What's...

507
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,860
wrong with me?

508
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,670
Greetings, Goddess.

509
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:59,010
Goddess,
thank you for carrying the Holy Fetus.

510
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,830
She is so respected.

511
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,110
Why is there

512
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,110
no record of her

513
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,350
in the Tianren Realm's

514
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,480
scripture scrolls?

515
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,590
Could it be that after Ye Mo was born,

516
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,590
she disappeared?

517
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,960
And even traces of her existence

518
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,880
were erased?

519
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:17,880
Wait.

520
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,030
The medicines for the Goddess

521
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,230
must be handled with care.

522
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,990
I'll check them first.

523
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,180
You've got some nerve.

524
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,170
As a General of Guanxing Tower,

525
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,980
how dare you steal while on duty?

526
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,300
Don't act smart in front of me.

527
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,270
Or I'll strip you of your powers.

528
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Got it?

529
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,790
What are you talking about?

530
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:13,880
Still acting?

531
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,160
Stop pretending.

532
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,960
Stealing offerings is a serious crime.

533
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:22,610
What...

534
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,510
What are you talking about?

535
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,360
Please spare my life.

536
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,000
I am the leader of the Garuda Clan.

537
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,640
I was ordered to guard Guanxing Tower.

538
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,350
I was wrong

539
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,050
to steal the offerings.

540
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,350
I'm really sorry.

541
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,090
Then why did you steal the offerings?

542
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,590
Since the Tianren Five Declines began,

543
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,850
everyone has changed.

544
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,410
People can actually grow old.

545
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,210
I am the leader of Jinyu Tribe,

546
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,790
only 300 years old,

547
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,950
yet I already look like this.

548
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,110
Many of my people have died.

549
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,350
Now we can only wait
for the Holy Son to be born

550
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,440
and end the Tianren Five Declines

551
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,570
so we can stop aging.

552
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,480
Until then,

553
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,200
we can only sustain ourselves
by secretly eating offerings.

554
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,830
Outside the Tianren Realm,

555
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:14,680
humans

556
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,400
naturally grow old.

557
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,960
My Lord, have you been to Shenzhou?

558
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,830
I heard the people there

559
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,490
live in peace and prosperity.

560
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,720
Is that true?

561
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:31,920
Yes.

562
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,590
Now, Shenzhou

563
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,790
is still full of life.

564
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,270
The Yique Yinyang Rebellion
hasn't happened.

565
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,070
If I can

566
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,470
kill Yique Yinyang here,

567
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,880
everyone will survive,

568
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,600
including Fang Zhou.

569
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,310
I am the divine official

570
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,770
in charge of criminal law.

571
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,030
I was ordered by the Asura King

572
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,230
to investigate the missing offerings.

573
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,640
I tracked the fugitive Ghostly Peony here

574
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,200
to investigate his whereabouts.

575
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,310
Stealing offerings is a serious crime.

576
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,350
If you don't want to die of old age

577
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,330
in the heavenly prison,

578
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,440
then listen to me.

579
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,200
Give me the golden elixir first.

580
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,110
Yes.

581
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,270
Go to the library now

582
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,900
and look something up for me.

583
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,320
I have other arrangements.

584
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,250
My Lord,

585
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,240
I'll use our secret method to talk to you.

586
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,570
It won't cause trouble.

587
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,440
The current Goddess

588
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,240
was chosen from the Dragon Clan.

589
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,010
They can control the dragons.

590
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,440
Every day at midnight,
the Goddess begins meditating

591
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,100
to absorb the Tianren Realm's energy

592
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,900
in order to nurture the Holy Son.

593
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,200
After giving birth to the Holy Son,

594
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,400
the Goddess will die

595
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,260
due to the depletion of her power.

596
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,850
So the birth of the Holy Son

597
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,750
is actually his mother's calamity,

598
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,610
whether he is me

599
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,590
or Ye Mo.

600
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,830
Do you suspect

601
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,000
that Ghostly Peony
has sneaked into Guanxing Tower

602
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,500
and that the Goddess might be in danger?

603
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,980
Focus on your task.

604
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Find out the truth

605
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,960
about that.

606
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,870
I was sent by Lord Garuda

607
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,830
to deliver the missing offerings.

608
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,150
Are you worried?

609
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,750
Am I the only one

610
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,630
who can hear this voice?

611
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,110
Take it.

612
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,870
Don't be so nervous.

613
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,200
Could she

614
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,720
have sensed

615
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,180
my emotional disturbance

616
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,080
and thought I intended
to seize the offerings?

617
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,920
You can leave now.

618
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,310
Wait.

619
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,060
You stay here.

620
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,200
Guardian goddesses,

621
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,460
I don't need your protection right now.

622
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,590
You may leave now.

623
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:12,880
Yes.

624
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,240
You shouldn't be here.

625
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,790
It gets cold at night.

626
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,390
What about you?

627
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,130
Aren't you cold?

628
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:49,960
I...

629
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,000
I'm used to it.

630
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,920
This is where
the heavenly wall is thinnest.

631
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,670
It's the only place in Tianren Realm

632
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,320
where one can see the stars.

633
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,720
I like it here.

634
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:04,940
Look.

635
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,720
Stars

636
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,699
can see everyone's fate.

637
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,630
Even your child's?

638
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,199
I never looked at him.

639
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:19,719
If I do,

640
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,260
I'll become obsessed.

641
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,230
Kid,

642
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,150
come here.

643
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,960
This is the swaddling cloth

644
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,420
I made for my unborn child.

645
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,050
It can keep you warm.

646
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:44,699
It gets very cold here at night.

647
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,880
Put it on.

648
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,360
I'm not cold.

649
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,110
I'm not a kid either.

650
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,800
It's time.

651
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,170
I'll begin my meditation.

652
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,890
The Dragon Goddess
is about to begin her meditation.

653
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,320
Call the guards at once

654
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,380
to join us in guarding the formation.

655
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,450
I didn't expect

656
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,800
Ye Mo's mother

657
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,190
to be so kind.

658
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,030
Why do I feel

659
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,740
something strange when I see her?

660
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,340
My Lord.

661
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,210
Did you find it?

662
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,150
Yes.

663
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,880
This secret scroll records

664
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,000
a hidden cultivation art of Tianren Realm,

665
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,880
the Soul Transfer Technique.

666
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,210
It sounds just like the one you described.

667
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,930
I'm not looking, I'm not looking.

668
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,420
Open the Heaven Halo,

669
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,160
channel the energy of the earth veins,

670
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,410
and use the power of the Rebirth Scroll

671
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,670
to cleanse the miasma.

672
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:05,960
As expected,

673
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,880
the Heaven-Halo Technique
is the Soul Transfer Technique.

674
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,550
When cast upon heaven and earth,

675
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,350
it can purify the world's filth.

676
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,600
When used on a person,

677
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,190
it can disrupt

678
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,090
or stabilize their energy flow

679
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,880
and even process their body

680
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,030
when their energy

681
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,260
is in chaos.

682
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,050
Heaven-Halo Technique

683
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,910
is the key to restarting the soul.

684
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,210
What will happen

685
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,550
if I use it

686
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
on Ghostly Peony?

687
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,070
Come out.

688
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,610
Don't worry.

689
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,210
I've sent them all away.

690
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,630
You knew I would come again?

691
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,560
Aren't you afraid I might hurt you?

692
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,670
I don't know why,

693
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,150
but I feel

694
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,720
a strange familiarity with you.

695
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,710
And I can sense

696
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,880
that you mean me no harm.

697
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,760
Do you want to see the stars tonight?

698
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,800
Since yesterday,

699
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,200
I've been regretting

700
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,620
that you didn't see

701
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,100
this beautiful sky.

702
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,710
It's only as wide as a well opening here,

703
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,670
but the starry sky I've seen before

704
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,030
filled the whole world.

705
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,150
Really?

706
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,440
I'm so happy for you,

707
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,200
kid.

708
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,630
I told you.

709
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,360
I'm not a kid.

710
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,760
Stop calling me kid.

711
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:00,890
I was wrong.

712
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,850
You're no longer a kid.

713
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,020
I shouldn't call you that.

714
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,280
Then your mother

715
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,230
must have been happy

716
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,400
to watch you grow up.

717
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,480
Not everyone
has their mother by their side

718
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
as they grow,

719
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,030
and not everyone

720
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,010
is meant to become a mother.

721
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,150
As the leader of the Dragon Clan,

722
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,350
your cultivation is a path of solitude.

723
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,110
Yet now,

724
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,840
you've formed a bond

725
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,900
with another life.

726
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,960
Because of this child,

727
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,920
every time the midnight bell tolls,

728
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,630
you're frozen in ice,

729
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,110
becoming

730
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,520
the most fragile person in this world.

731
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:41,440
He...

732
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:42,930
is harming you.

733
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,440
I don't think so.

734
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,920
On the contrary, it's because of him

735
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:02,010
that I've seen a greater

736
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,130
and more beautiful sky.

737
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,560
How ridiculous.

738
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,880
The starry sky you speak of

739
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,440
is no bigger than the opening of a well.

740
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,300
For that tiny patch of starry sky,

741
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,880
you've destroyed countless others' chance

742
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,110
to see it.

743
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:28,580
You all think

744
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,770
he's the savior.

745
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,440
But you don't know

746
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,480
that once he's born,

747
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,710
he'll fall into darkness
and become a devil.

748
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,150
Not only will he kill you,

749
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,060
erasing you from the world's memory,

750
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,800
but he'll also cause chaos in Shenzhou

751
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,350
and bring endless calamities

752
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,140
to the people there.

753
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,920
Let me tell you,

754
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
your child's name

755
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,230
is Ye Mo.

756
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,630
The reason I came here...

757
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:13,920
is...

758
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,590
Wait.

759
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,220
Ye Mo isn't my child.

760
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,280
Didn't he...

761
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,590
leave the Tianren Realm

762
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,440
years ago?

763
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,070
The name

764
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,150
I gave my child

765
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,300
is Ajibanr Tang Jia.

766
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:39,320
Holy Son.

767
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,880
This child

768
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,440
is a miracle

769
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,510
created with the power
of the entire realm.

770
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,590
He will end the Tianren Five Declines

771
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,850
and save everyone!

772
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,480
I don't know why,

773
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,840
but I feel

774
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,090
a strange familiarity with you.

775
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,540
Kid.

776
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,110
What's your name?

777
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,290
Ajibanr

778
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,670
Tang Jia.

779
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,550
We meet again,

780
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,190
Ajibanr Tang Jia.

781
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,280
It looks like

782
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:18,060
I'm not the person you're looking for.

783
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,650
Because Ye Mo left,

784
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,210
I was chosen as the Goddess.

785
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,030
And my child

786
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,110
will become the new Holy Son.

787
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,310
The moment he's born,

788
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,170
he must leave the tower to cultivate.

789
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,360
And I

790
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,540
will never be able to leave this prison.

791
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,540
I'm destined never to meet him

792
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,070
or watch him grow.

793
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,170
And I will never have the chance

794
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,000
to know

795
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:45,610
what kind of person

796
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,480
my child will become.

797
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,110
I hope he knows

798
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,000
that his birth

799
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,190
is not a calamity.

800
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,030
He'll be born

801
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,440
with his mother's love,

802
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,710
coming into the world

803
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,970
through decay and decline.

804
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,190
This is a magical artifact

805
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,990
nurtured with the Dragon Pearl,

806
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,000
the bone-washing silver bracelet,

807
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,810
kept for my unborn child.

808
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,760
If you ever meet him,

809
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,230
please give it to him.

810
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,450
Are you okay?

811
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,840
The Goddess got attacked!

812
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,100
Capture the assassin!

813
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:56,080
Go!

814
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:09,520
The energy of Tianren Realm
is about to overflow.

815
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:10,900
Come with me.

816
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,230
I can save you.

817
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:16,570
Go.

818
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,180
Catch the assassin!

819
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,320
Tang Lici, are you crazy?

820
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:39,550
I'm trying to kill Yique Yinyang.

821
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,510
A few pieces of wood

822
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,840
want to be human?

823
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,200
Die!

824
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:57,550
Mother.
