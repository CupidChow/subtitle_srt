00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,930
[Episode 29]

3
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,430
What's this?

4
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,560
Senior,

5
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,880
why don't we

6
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,680
just forget it?

7
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,710
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,440
I didn't mean it that way.

9
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,200
I'm just a bit curious—

10
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,680
how have you managed to survive until now?

11
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,000
You have a heart-withering disease.

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,640
This is a terminal illness

13
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,950
that even I can't cure.

14
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,150
Tell me

15
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,860
which doctor you've seen.

16
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,200
I haven't seen a doctor.

17
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,520
That's weird.

18
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,310
There's a strange energy

19
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,750
inside your body.

20
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,280
Did you experience something unusual

21
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,590
when you were a child,

22
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,920
or accidentally eat something?

23
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,430
Think carefully.

24
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,470
This way I can find

25
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,400
a breakthrough.

26
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,120
Then this illness

27
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,650
won't be terminal anymore.

28
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,800
But...

29
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,360
I

30
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,079
can't remember.

31
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,270
Actually, when I took your pulse earlier,

32
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,730
I found poor blood circulation
in your head.

33
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,760
It's quite strange.

34
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,640
You've lost your memory.

35
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,400
What?

36
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,680
When I used the Xuluo needle

37
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,530
to stimulate your Yuzhen acupoint,

38
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,660
you had no reaction.

39
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,610
This is a symptom of memory loss.

40
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,079
I can't remember.

41
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,560
Perhaps

42
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,310
they're painful memories

43
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,030
of wandering around and begging.

44
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,990
And I deliberately forgot them.

45
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,910
It seems

46
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,910
these memories,

47
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,090
whether I have them or not,

48
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,530
don't matter to me.

49
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,960
Senior.

50
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,850
I'm satisfied with my life now.

51
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,880
That's your personal business.

52
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,380
I'll keep your secret.

53
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,950
But as a doctor,

54
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,050
I must remind you

55
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,829
your heart-withering disease
hasn't been fully cured.

56
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,490
The reason you're still alive

57
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,890
is that the energy in your blood

58
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,280
is constantly healing you.

59
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,060
Once you lose that energy,

60
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,780
the disease will return and be fatal.

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,920
I understand.

62
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:55,990
Why can't I...

63
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,050
Let me help you.

64
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,000
Thanks.

65
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,650
Give me that one.

66
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,680
Here.

67
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,450
This one is better.

68
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,830
Okay.

69
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,040
A bit higher. More to the left.

70
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,800
Is this good?

71
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,200
Yes, that's about right.

72
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,390
Chi.

73
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,750
This is for the ancestors.

74
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,680
If you want some,

75
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,000
get some from the stove.

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,750
The weather is nice today.

77
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,159
Good weather.

78
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,630
May everything go well.

79
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,360
Shen.

80
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:10,800
Shen.

81
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,830
Is this for me?

82
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,750
You...

83
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,410
Let's go celebrate the New Year.

84
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,330
Alright.

85
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,500
Shei's cook is excellent.

86
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,600
Delicious.

87
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,220
Come give me a hand.

88
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,000
Be careful.

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,860
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

90
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,120
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

91
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,520
No need for formalities.

92
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,160
Be careful.

93
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,900
Be careful.

94
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,350
Got it.

95
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,000
Let me do it.

96
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,210
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

97
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,950
I'm just passing by to have a look.

98
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,950
Go ahead.

99
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,360
Yes.

100
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:23,870
Take it slow.

101
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,670
Wrap one more.

102
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,430
Like this.

103
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,680
Look at them.

104
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,790
They long for eternity,

105
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,800
yet they indulge in this fleeting,

106
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,950
ephemeral beauty.

107
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,960
The intimacy of this moment,

108
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,090
when sudden misfortune strikes,

109
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,140
will fade away like these fireworks

110
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,070
growing cold in the darkness.

111
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,920
What are you saying, Your Highness?

112
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,560
Nothing.

113
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,240
I've heard that during the festival,

114
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,190
people release lanterns on the river

115
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,430
to pray for good weather,

116
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,690
happiness, and peace.

117
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:11,950
If lovers

118
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,800
write their wishes on the lanterns

119
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,660
that float across the River of Hearts,

120
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,720
the river god will hear their wishes.

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,730
From then on,

122
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,150
they can be together forever,

123
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,480
through life and death.

124
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,090
When it truly becomes
a matter of life and death,

125
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,390
people always have to make choices.

126
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,210
I spoke out of turn.

127
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,240
Except for him.

128
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,370
No matter how dangerous,

129
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,960
he would never give up.

130
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,090
Your Highness.

131
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,130
Let's go.

132
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,580
Happy New Year.

133
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,940
Happy New Year.

134
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,050
I have something

135
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,390
I'd like to speak to you alone.

136
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,320
Alright.

137
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,480
Everyone, please leave us.

138
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,320
Yes.

139
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,180
Your Highness, you have become

140
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,640
more and more commanding.

141
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,390
Ms. Zhong,

142
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,840
are there

143
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,540
any important imperial court matters?

144
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,530
Do I need a reason

145
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,030
to talk

146
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,200
to you?

147
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,280
Do you remember

148
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,270
when we first met?

149
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,180
What did you think of me then?

150
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,670
What a spirited and valiant lady.

151
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,000
And now?

152
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,400
Do you still think so?

153
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,790
I still do.

154
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,150
When I was in the palace,

155
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,690
my mother would often bring

156
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,740
gold, jade, fine embroidery,

157
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,350
and rare treasures to see me.

158
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,010
She would ask what I wanted.

159
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,260
I wanted to return quickly
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

160
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,590
I wanted to see you soon.

161
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,200
Since I have promised your master,

162
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,720
as long as the Fengliu Shop remains,

163
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,120
I will not rashly leave.

164
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,550
Besides,

165
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,200
you and I are friends.

166
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,440
Even if someday

167
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,910
I leave the Sword Alliance,

168
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,270
I would still welcome you

169
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,260
to visit the Wanqiao Chamber.

170
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,770
Do you truly not understand what I mean?

171
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,390
Ms. Zhong.

172
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,440
I am not an ordinary person.

173
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,200
I know.

174
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,030
No,

175
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,550
you don't.

176
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,750
I

177
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,600
was deliberately created.

178
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,390
What do you mean?

179
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,330
I was born in a place

180
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,720
you can't possibly imagine.

181
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,130
In my childhood,

182
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,950
I was trained to kill.

183
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,070
The person who created me

184
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,130
didn't allow me to have emotions.

185
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,870
The world I could see

186
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,240
was just one room

187
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,630
and one corridor.

188
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,420
At the end of that corridor

189
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,650
was endless slaughter.

190
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,680
It was bright there,

191
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,050
but with less light than here.

192
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,450
I dreamed of the outside world.

193
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,590
With my only toy,

194
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,620
a carving knife,

195
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,550
I carved

196
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,540
all the things I imagined.

197
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,090
I risked my life

198
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,630
to escape from that place.

199
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,270
I can't believe

200
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,140
such places exist in this world.

201
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,570
Of course they do exist.

202
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:15,960
I

203
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,260
share the same origin

204
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,140
as Yique Yinyang.

205
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,350
And just like Yique Yinyang,

206
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,410
I don't understand emotions.

207
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,530
How could you...

208
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,880
How could you be anything like him?

209
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,080
I can disregard

210
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,610
others' lives and deaths.

211
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,200
Because I truly don't care.

212
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,920
I save people

213
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,780
only because it's convenient.

214
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,580
But you care about Chi Yun.

215
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,390
You care about everyone.

216
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,390
You care about us.

217
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,910
This is what I learned

218
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,770
from Fang Zhou.

219
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:01,960
But

220
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,360
Fang Zhou never taught me

221
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,960
how to love someone.

222
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,240
You're lying.

223
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:11,560
Even Chi Yun

224
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,890
has never heard of this.

225
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,320
That's because I

226
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,120
wasn't willing to say it before.

227
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,240
I pretended

228
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,550
that I had forgotten everything.

229
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,520
I marked the beginning of my life

230
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,960
as the day I met Fang Zhou

231
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,120
at Zhoudi Tower.

232
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,600
Since you told me these things,

233
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,360
does it prove

234
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,150
that I am

235
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,690
somewhat different from them?

236
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,800
Wounds aren't frightening.

237
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,310
What scares people

238
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,000
is the pain.

239
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But one can't avoid treating wounds

240
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,440
just because they hurt.

241
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,200

00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,740

Careful.

255
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,780
Stone is really amazing.

256
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,870
Stone, you forgot the lantern.

257
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,400
Catch it.

258
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,460
Stone, stay calm.

259
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,600
Stay calm.

260
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,840
Maybe we should

261
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,970
keep our distance.

262
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,220
No.

263
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,080
What's wrong?

264
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,800
-Mr. Tang.
-Mr. Tang.

265
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,030
Let me see.

266
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,030
Master.

267
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,000
Master.

268
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,030
I...

269
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,320
I knocked over

270
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,460
the stone stack again.

271
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,200
Stone.

272
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,520
You didn't knock it over.

273
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,150
Do you have scissors?

274
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,550
Yes.

275
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,840
Mr. Tang,

276
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,550
what are you going to do?

277
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,720
Mr. Tang is so skillful.

278
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,370
Indeed.

279
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,109
Look.

280
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,270
That's amazing.

281
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,650
It's beautiful.

282
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,000
This way we can

283
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,859
seal that hole.

284
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,400
He cut it so well.

285
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,830
Does it look nice?

286
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,680
It's really beautiful.

287
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,480
Yes.

288
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,480
Master.

289
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,920
Let's go home.

290
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,440
Okay.

291
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,480
Master,

292
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:57,680
look.

293
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,420
Did you draw this?

294
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,030
Stone.

295
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,350
Do you like Miss Shei?

296
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:23,880
I like her.

297
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,590
Shei

298
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,330
cooks delicious food.

299
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,640
She's nice

300
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,510
to me.

301
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,270
I like her

302
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,880
just as I like you.

303
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,310
Stone,

304
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,340
you've learned how to flatter others now.

305
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,680
I really

306
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,920
like you.

307
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,980
Mr. Tang, you're back.

308
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,640
Shei.

309
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,160
Look.

310
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,490
I drew something.

311
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,720
It's very good.

312
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,200
Stone,

313
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,920
it's time for practice.

314
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,830
No practice today.

315
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,070
We are

316
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,430
going out.

317
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,270
Going out?

318
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,960
Let's go out

319
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,070
to celebrate the New Year.

320
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,690
Let's go.

321
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,440
It's rare to see you

322
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,000
willing to come out and walk.

323
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,440
When we were at Jinye Temple,

324
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,790
you never wanted to go out.

325
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,160
I was recovering then.

326
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,920
What is the New Year?

327
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,550
New Year

328
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,830
is when the whole family gathers

329
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,400
and enjoys themselves.

330
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,540
That's what the New Year is about.

331
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,160
Here.

332
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,350
Thank you, Sir.

333
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,590
Here's the money.

334
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:27,880
Take care.

335
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,070
Dad, let's go over there.

336
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,840
Shei.

337
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,640
I want that.

338
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,640
Okay.

339
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,920
Shei.

340
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,170
I want to eat that.

341
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:41,960
Here you go.

342
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,560
Thank you.

343
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,490
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

344
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,240
Sir, give me two more skewers.

345
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,900
Sure thing.

346
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,410
Alright.

347
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,720
You all have one now?

348
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,360
Let's look around up ahead.

349
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,880
Great!

350
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,400
Great.

351
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:14,920
Look.

352
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,800
Great!

353
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,760
Let's go, Stone.

354
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,660
Let me take you to try it.

355
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,350
No.

356
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,000
That's for kids.

357
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:31,840
You...

358
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,010
How old do you think you are?

359
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,140
Aren't you a kid too?

360
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,690
Let's go.

361
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,440
Sir!

362
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,350
How much

363
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,340
for one turn?

364
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,480
This much.

365
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,880
Play as much as you like.

366
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,240
Deal.

367
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:42,870
Come on.

368
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,360
Let's go check it out?

369
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,730
Let's go.

370
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,350
Take your time.

371
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,750
Okay.

372
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,220
Shen, you should try it too.

373
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,360
I feel that you

374
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,120
seem a bit strange today.

375
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,440
Strange how?

376
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,510
I can't quite put my finger on it.

377
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,440
But you're different from before.

378
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,480
Perhaps it's because we've called a truce

379
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,750
with the Fengliu Shop,

380
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,180
and it's a holiday,

381
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,610
so I'm in a good mood.

382
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,850
River lanterns.

383
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,750
Yes.

384
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,830
There's a tradition
of floating river lanterns here.

385
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,890
During festivals,

386
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,790
people

387
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,070
write their wishes

388
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,160
on these lanterns.

389
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,200
They light them and let them drift away,

390
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,880
praying

391
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,570
that the river god will hear their wishes

392
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,330
and make them come true.

393
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,310
I see.

394
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,070
Sir,

395
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,940
why not buy a lantern for your wife?

396
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,910
I'm not.

397
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,380
Does that mean I can't buy one?

398
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,660
What wish are you going to make?

399
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,190
You've thought for so long.

400
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,960
I hope

401
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,370
to destroy the Fengliu Shop soon.

402
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,830
I wish Chi,

403
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,730
Shen, Ms. Zhong,

404
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,390
Stone, Master Shao, and Mr. Gu

405
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,010
safe and sound.

406
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,000
You can just

407
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,080
make this kind of wish to me.

408
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,670
Why trouble the heavens?

409
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,540
Think of something

410
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,450
that you want for yourself.

411
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,400
Then I wish

412
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,890
you safe and sound.

413
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,720
I meant

414
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,680
wishes for yourself.

415
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,880
I just want you to be safe.

416
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,530
[Mr. Tang to be safe]

417
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,170
Making such wishes

418
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:34,910
won't come true.

419
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,240
Who says so?

420
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,840
Sincerity brings miracles.

421
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,310
What wish did you make?

422
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,090
I never said I'd tell you.

423
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,830
You

424
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,160
always trick me.

425
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,440
Everything will surely be safe and smooth.

Let's go.

427

Let's go.

I hope

429
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,790
it can float past that bridge ahead,

430

Senior.

499
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,680
It's so late.

500
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,590
What important matter brings you here?

501
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,400
Regarding what you mentioned last time,

502
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,790
about me and Fang Zhou,

503
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,480
I have made up my mind.

504
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,960
So you've decided

505
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,750
to remove this heart crystal

506
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,080
and keep your own heart?

507
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,790
I hope you can

508
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,000
preserve this heart crystal.

509
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,890
Are you sure?

510
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,400
I've told you before.

511
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,480
Fang Zhou's heart crystal has already

512
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,280
connected with your bloodline.

513
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,270
If you want to preserve
this heart crystal,

514
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,990
even with your special constitution,

515
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,470
you will certainly die.

516
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,590
I know.

517
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,270
You're surprised

518
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,590
that I chose to save others

519
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,300
over myself?

520
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,760
You should leave.

521
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,620
I'm a healer, not an executioner.

522
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,400
I can't agree to a patient's request

523
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,000
that leads to certain death.

524
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,790
Senior.

525
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,720
You really shouldn't have

526
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,930
such misplaced compassion

527
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,050
and mercy for me.

528
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,160
You are indeed not an executioner,

529
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,240
but neither are you

530
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,440
the princess's maid.

531
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:00,930
Isn't that right,

532
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,350
Princess Xi Ya?

533
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,350
Yique Yinyang used heavenly fire

534
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,440
to burn down the entire Gumo State.

535
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,160
Yet he spared the only one

536
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,690
who had shown him kindness—

537
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,200
Princess Xi Ya.

538
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,200
I want to know

539
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,240
what made you

540
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,370
make this decision.

541
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,200
At Mount Baojing,

542
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,970
you asked me to save you.

543
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,200
I'd like to know,

544
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,830
after I made

545
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,720
such a request,

546
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,640
why you hesitated.

547
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,640
I asked you first.

548
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,030
You should answer me first.

549
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:54,830
If your reason

550
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,750
satisfies me,

551
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,740
I might be willing to grant your wish.

552
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,280
You must grant my wish.

553
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,750
Otherwise,

554
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,590
Shenzhou will be destroyed

555
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,830
by a catastrophe.

556
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,960
What do you mean?

557
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,510
Ye Mo is still alive.

558
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,360
What?

559
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,600
How is that possible?

560
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,080
How is that possible?

561
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,480
I suspect

562
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,290
he used the secret technique
of the Tianren Realm

563
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,730
to preserve his spirit.

564
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,720
Once he finds a suitable vessel,

565
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,330
he can be reborn.

566
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:39,120
That's why he's been looking for me
all along.

567
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,950
But just because of this suspicion,

568
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,240
you're willing to give up your life?

569
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,330
I was born in bloodshed.

570
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,070
This Tianren body I've cultivated

571
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,180
is so coveted by Yique Yinyang.

572
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,370
It must have tremendous value.

573
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,090
So I'll destroy it.

574
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,920
Let all his scheming

575
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,760
and desires come to nothing.

576
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,969
Wouldn't that be amusing?

577
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,290
That's indeed very like what you would do.

578
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,510

everyone will trust him.

581
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,070
He can lead the Sword Alliance

♪ Singing a long, unfinished song ♪

583
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,050
and unite the martial arts world.

584
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,719
Then I will have won.

585
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,880
But how will you revive Fang Zhou?

586
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:41,620
♪ The full moon and a few shining stars ♪

587
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:39,880

in Zhoudi Tower.

592
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,780
It's preserved
in the Immortal Crystal Coffin.

593
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,840
I've already arranged to meet Liu Yan

594
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,219
at Zhoudi Tower.

595
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,230

please help me

599
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,000
cut out Fang Zhou's heart crystal

600
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,110
from my abdomen

601
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,750

603
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,390
Then Fang Zhou can be revived.

604
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,230
I've done my best.

605
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,030
But I could never become Fang Zhou,

606
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,700
nor inherit the Seven‑String True Tune.

607
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,710
The person who should live in this world

608
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,000
is Fang Zhou,

609
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,670
not Tang Lici.

610
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,130

617
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,430
couldn't bring myself to start.

618
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,220
Only because I didn't understand

619
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,680
what he was thinking in that white haze

620
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,920
as death approached.

I understand.

00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:45,880
I can now

628
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
carve his face,

629
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:48,760
because I've finally

630
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,560
prepared myself to say goodbye.

631
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,000
Senior,

after Fang Zhou is revived,

633
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,250
please give this

634
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,930

♪ Trapped in the loop of loneliness ♪

641
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,810
Remind Fang Zhou

642
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,380
that Ghostly Peony

643
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,920
is the mastermind

644
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,850
behind the Fengliu Shop incident.

645
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,880
His relationship with Yique Yinyang

646
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,940
is far from simple.

647
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,440
In fact,

648
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,800
he might be

649
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,400
Yique Yinyang's vessel

650
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,330
for his remaining consciousness.

651
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:06,840
However,

652
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,600
I'll just leave the trouble

653
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,670
to Fang Zhou.

654
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,630
Anything else?

655
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,410
About yourself?

656
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,510
Bury me

657
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,000

658
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,000
Please

659
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,960

00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,150
for me.

661
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:50,920
And also,

662
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,880
I'm sorry.

663
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,970
At the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

664
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,590
I heard rumors about you.

665
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,400
Mr. Tang, you're brilliant, formidable,

666
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,860
generous, and righteous.

667
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,650
Though your methods are unconventional,

668
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,250
you're willing to save others

669
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,410
at your own risk.

670
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,730
That's why I hesitated.

671
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:18,960
Thank you.

672
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,150
Hurry.

673
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,280
Happy New Year!

674
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,050
Happy New Year.

675
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:53,960
Happy New Year.

676
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,690
What a feast.

677
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,360
Chi,

678
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,520
wait for Master.

679
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,150
So strong?

680
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,980
Okay, okay.

681
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,710
Where is Mr. Tang?

682
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,350
Maybe he has gone out.

683
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,340
Going out on the first day
of the lunar year?

684
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,920
Where to?

685
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,590
Visiting relatives?

686
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,370
It'll burn you.

687
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:28,840
Boring.

688
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,130
He'll come back eventually.

689
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:34,830
That's right.

690
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,480
He'll come back for sure.

691
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,140
I think what you said is right.

692
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,840
He'll definitely return.

693
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,440
What's there to worry about?

694
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:07,920
Why are you

695
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,580
interested in them suddenly?

696
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,510
Because

697
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,040
I'm tired.

698
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,670
Tired?

699
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,150
People only have one face,

700
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,240
but need

701
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,260
countless masks

702
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,380
to gain so-called freedom.

703
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,280
Of course it's exhausting.

704
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,150
I am not.

705
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,110
Because you have masks.

706
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:45,610
You came here today

707
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,710
because you're tired?

708
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:50,480
No.

709
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,800
Liu Yan has arrived at Zhoudi Tower.

710
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:39,800
Come.

711
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,460
Come on.

712
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,110
Come.

713
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:18,880
You're here.

714
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,960
I thought

715
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,580
you were dead.

716
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,590
Didn't you say

717
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,480
I was trouble?

718
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:34,840
Trouble

719
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,320
doesn't die so easily.
