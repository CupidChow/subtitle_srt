00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,630
Yes.

who excelled at the qin,

Do you have any evidence?

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Please ask, Miss.

139
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,700
What did you see

140

Suddenly, my limbs felt weak,

147
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,920
and my mind started to fade.

148
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,840
I don't know how long it took,

149
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,480
but when I slowly regained consciousness,

150
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,750
everything around me was deathly silent—

151
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,510
so quiet it was unsettling.

152
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,720
It's your wedding night.

what kind of spell

171
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,360
you used on the Abbot.

You didn't follow the Buddhist teachings

175
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,240
or help out at the temple.

176
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,440

177

and carves wood every day,

178
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,840
and the other only steals chickens
and sleeps in.

180

to an innocent child?

195
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,400
Are you the city lord of Yanxian

196
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
or a gang leader?

197
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,120
Young monk,

198
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,440
are you all right?

199
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,030
I'm fine.

200
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,750
Who are these people?

201
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,790
Are they the ones

202
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,050
who beat you like this?

203
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,120
Go now.

204
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
Be careful, Miss.

205
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,960
Ms. Zhong, don't forget,

206
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,510
this case involves many parties.

207
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,200
Jinye Temple dares to harbor a suspect.

208
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,750
Everyone there

209
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,080
could be an accomplice.

210
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,370
Go in and search!

211
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,030
Yes!

212
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,200
I finally got

213
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,510
a chance to sleep,

214
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,880
and now
there's a pack of wild dogs barking.

215
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,090
I'll count to three.

216
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,000
Anyone still here after that

217
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,880
will face the consequences.

218
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,960
Who are you?

219
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,030
One.

220
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,480
Where is he?

221
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,870
How did he disappear?

222
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,130
Insolent rogue!

223
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,440
Search the place!

224
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,510
-Yes!
-Yes!

225
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,480
The Moon-crossing Ring?

226
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
You are Cloud,

227
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,790
Chi Yun?

228
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,600
Where did you take Miss Shei?

229
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,240
Judging by his lightness skill,

230
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,090
he must be that guy's henchman!

231
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:32,910
Three.

232
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,750
My Lord!

233
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,440
My Lord!

234
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,610
Whether I'm a gangster or not

235
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,360
isn't for a coward like you

236
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,000
to decide.

237
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,360
Chi Yun,

238
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,960
give Miss Shei back to us now.

239
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,120
So you can take her back

240
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,450
and keep torturing her?

241
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,390
The Central Plains Sword Alliance
will investigate this thoroughly.

242
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,000
We will not wrong the innocent
nor let the guilty go unpunished.

243
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,360
Forcibly taking someone

244
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,150
is a crime too.

245
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,640
Which stupid Central Plains Sword Alliance

246
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,240
thinks it can boss me around?

247
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,110
His name is Feng.

248
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,500
He just got woken up.

249
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,510
Would you mind

250
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,770
calming him down?

251
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:02,960
You...

252
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,890
It really is you.

253
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,000
Miss,

254
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,500
have we met before?

255
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,190
You look exactly like him,

256
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,170
but your gaze is completely different.

257
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,100
Sound Killing Technique?

258
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,070
Now,

259
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,100
does anyone else want to go in?

260
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,830
The expert in the inner courtyard

261
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,580
is formidable.

262
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,840
We are no match for him.

263
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,260
But I must see him in person

264
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,720
to clear him of suspicion.

265
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,090
Please lead the way.

266
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,200
Miss Zhong,

267
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:04,830
you...

268
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,120
Heroine,

269
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,870
you've got guts.

270
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,270
I admire that.

271
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,070
This way, please.

272
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,650
The rest of you,

273
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,350
go back and wait for news.

274
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:22,960
Move.

275
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,210
What did you say?

276
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,280
Miss Zhong!

277
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,400
If you dare to harm Miss Zhong

278
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,660
even a hair on her head,

279
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Master Shao
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance

280
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,590
will not let you off!

281
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:39,960
Just now, what...

282
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,030
what did he say?

283
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,960
Miss, put this on.

284
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,270
Don't catch a cold.

285
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,720
Tang Lici.

286
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:52,720
Miss Shei!

287
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,440
I just asked you to help me

288
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,640
look after this lady.

289
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,420
I didn't ask you to steal my thunder.

290
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,670
Who asked for your help?

291
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,930
Did you lose the fight?

292
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,440
I, the mighty Cloud, I...

293
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,240
If you didn't lose,
it didn't really count as help.

294
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,160
That makes sense.

295
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,960
Is he the murderer?

296
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,480
The murderer...

297
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,570
looked like him.

298
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,930
Looked like?

299
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,110
Their build and appearance

300
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,310
are exactly the same.

301
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,400
But...

302
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,400
I just witnessed

303
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,070
your Sound Killing Technique.

304
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,790
Could you

305
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,530
be from Zhoudi Tower in Jiangnan?

306
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,830
I am Zhong Chunji
from the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

307
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,400
I request your cooperation

308
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,330
in investigating
the Hao family massacre 3 days ago.

309
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,480
Chi Yun.

310
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,310
Get up.

311
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,440
Me?

312
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,750
Get up.

313
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,440
Sir,

314
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,150
between 7 and 11 that evening, 3 days ago,

315
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,640
where were you,

316
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,800
what were you doing,

317
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,480
and who can vouch for you?

318
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,110
You know

319
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,830
you're no match for me.

320
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,030
Why did you come in to see me?

321
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,640
If I die,

322
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,150
it will prove your connection
to the massacre.

323
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,200
Exchanging my life

324
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,310
for the truth

325
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,230
is worth it.

326
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,380
You're Shao Yanping's disciple?

327
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,240
Shao Yanping is indeed my master.

328
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,270
Just as I thought.

329
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,160
Otherwise, how could you speak of

330
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,160
exchanging your life for the truth?

331
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,480
You know

332
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,110
you're no match for me.

333
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,300
Why did you come in to see me?

334
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,960
I am investigating this case
under the Sword Alliance's orders.

335
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,640
If you continue to evade my questions

336
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,830
and just seek to humiliate me,

337
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,110
then do not blame me

338
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,920
for arresting you as a suspect.

339
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,640
You know you're no match for me.

340
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,830
Why did you...

341
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,930
come in to see me?

342
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:57,830
You...

343
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,640
Foxy Tang,

344
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,640
Did you drink so much tea

345
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,300
that you damaged your throat?

346
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,860
Why do you keep repeating
this one sentence?

347
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,240
I see.

348
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,310
Mr. Tang,

349
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,640
I will come back.

350
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,160
Miss Shei,

351
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,320
I'll take you back.

352
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,010
Miss Shei will be safer

353
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
if she stays here.

354
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,000
Then I must trouble you

355
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,000
to take good care of Miss Ashui.

356
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,550
Miss Zhong.

357
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,400
Thank you.

358
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,750
You're welcome.

359
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,280
Foxy Tang.

360
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,030
What riddles

361
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,080
were you two playing at?

362
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,830
Miss Shei,

363
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,720
do you understand

364
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,180
the questions I asked her?

365
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,350
So I'm the only one

366
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,780
who doesn't get it?

367
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,440
Since you don't get it,

368
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,280
why didn't you ask?

369
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,110
Isn't that what I'm doing?

370
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,440
Asking me won't get you an answer.

371
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,360
I'll go ask Shao Yanping's disciple.

372
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,050
Chi Yun.

373
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,310
If you see Miss Zhong,

374
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,240
ask her one more question for me.

375
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,100
What question?

376
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,810
What is the one thing

377
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,110
everyone did

378
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,950
at the wedding banquet

379
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,830
except the bride?

380
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,000
Fine.

381
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,350
If you're not the murderer,

382
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,680
then why

383
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:40,610
do the two of you

384
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,870
look exactly the same?

385
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,190
Naturally, it's because

386
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,890
we once knew each other.

387
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,680
You know

388
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,510
who he is?

389
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,040
An enemy of mine.

390
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,490
He disguised himself as me

391
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,160
to take revenge on me.

392
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,920
Mr. Chi?

393
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,300
Where are your henchmen?

394
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,120
I told them
to go to the Hao Residence first.

395
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,110
I want to investigate alone for now.

396
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,750
Mr. Chi, did you rush here

397
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,530
for something urgent?

398
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,960
What exactly

399
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,250
did Foxy Tang say to you?

400
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,510
Mr. Tang just

401
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,710
asked me 3 questions.

402
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:42,790
Weren't you there

403
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,830
listening?

404
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,640
I didn't understand.

405
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,880
The 1st question

406
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,680
Mr. Tang asked

407
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,530
was why I wanted to see him.

408
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,550
I came because the Sword Alliance

409
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,810
sent me to investigate

410
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,110
the Hao family massacre.

411
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,440
As for the 2nd question,

412
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,340
it looks the same,

413
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,000
but it actually

414
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,600
has a different meaning.

415
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,110
It means that if Mr. Tang
were truly the murderer,

416
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,880
we'd clearly be no match for him.

417
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,740
So why didn't he

418
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,530
kill me and Miss Shei?

419
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,110
And...

420
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,140
why didn't he run away?

421
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,790
I see.

422
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,150
What about the 3rd question?

423
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,180
As for the third question,

424
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,110
what Mr. Tang really wanted to ask

425
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,310
was actually...

426
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,270
Why...

427
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:27,750
do you...

428
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,650
suspect me?

429
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,750
He wanted me to consider

430
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,550
why Miss Shei identified him.

431
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,510
Remember what I look like.

432
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,570
And that reason is,

433
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,310
of course, that Miss Shei

434
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,240
saw the murderer

435
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,600
and could point out that

436
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,680
Mr. Tang looks the same as him.

437
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,000
Got it.

438
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,960
Why didn't he just say so?

439
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,440
There's one more question—

440
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,590
one that Foxy Tang

441
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,920
later told me to ask you.

442
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,830
What is something everyone did

443
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,960
at the wedding banquet

444
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,960
except the bride?

445
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,550
This case is shrouded in mystery.

446
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,160
Among those we know,
the only suspicious one

447
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,400
is Yang Shangqing.

448
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,720
Why do you

449
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,960
suspect him?

450
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,030
Because Miss Shei

451
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,190
was clearly the victim,

452
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,400
yet Yang Shangqing tortured her severely.

453
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,720
He was obviously in a rush
to close the case.

454
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,480
That makes him

455
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,340
highly likely to be the murderer.

456
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,000
I've long suspected

457
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,530
that Yang was the murderer.

458
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,100
But the coroner said

459
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,510
the victims died
from the Sound Killing Technique—

460
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,270
no

461
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,240
external wounds,

462
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,960
only bleeding from the ears.

463
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,640
Well,

464
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,830
Miss Shei

465
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,720
really did see

466
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,850
the black-clad pipa player

467
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:35,970
who looks like

468
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,750
Mr. Tang.

469
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,480
But we can't find a single trace

470
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,640
of this pipa player.

471
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,640
So now,

472
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,240
let's think about

473
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,730
the other question from Mr. Tang.

474
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,640
What is something

475
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,110
everyone did at the wedding banquet

476
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,350
except the bride?

477
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,720
Tender black-bone chicken!

478
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,110
Fine osmanthus wine!

479
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:52,920
Sir!

480
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:53,920
Sir!

481
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,070
We just got some

482
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,400
especially tender black-bone chickens.

483
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,540
When paired with osmanthus wine,

484
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,790
it tastes simply divine.

485
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:03,720
How about it?

486
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,380
Would you like to give it a try?

487
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,520
Then let's go...

488
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:09,030
-have some chicken first!
-That's drinking!

489
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,720
What everyone at the wedding banquet
would do

490
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,960
except the bride

491
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,620
is drinking the wedding wine.

492
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,250
Let's go.

493
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,420
Examine the bodies.

494
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,370
Check, please.

495
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,920
A good banquet must come with fine wine.

496
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,800
Who would have thought the fine wine

497
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,860
would be poisoned?

498
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,350
No signs of poisoning?

499
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,830
Could we have guessed wrong?

500
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,630
That's right.

501
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,310
If they were really poisoned,

502
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,510
the coroner wouldn't have missed it.

503
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,590
Since Foxy Tang asked such a question,

504
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,160
it must be on the right track.

505
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,640
You trust Tang Lici that much?

506
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,770
Who says I trust him?

507
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,030
It's just that

508
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,750
he always looks

509
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,960
so confident.

510
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,640
He must have thought it through
before speaking.

511
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,230
So the direction must be correct.

512
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,700
The cause of death really does resemble
the Sound Killing Technique.

513
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,560
When falsehood stands for truth,

514
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,790
truth likewise becomes false.

515
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,680
Could it be...

516
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:00,590
Chi Yun,

517
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,570
is there a poison

518
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,270
that can make one's ears bleed,

519
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,640
making it look like
the Sound Killing Technique,

520
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,840
but is hard to detect?

521
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,490
There's no such poison.

522
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,530
There is.

523
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,160
Baibusha.

524
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,310
Baibusha?

525
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,140
You're not in the underworld,

526
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,790
so you don't know

527
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,920
these dirty tricks.

528
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,490
This poison is colorless, odorless,

529
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,960
and has no medicinal properties.

530
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,220
When dissolved in water,

531
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,280
even the best doctor can't detect it.

532
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,720
But if consumed

533
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,640
with osmanthus wine within an hour,

534
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,840
it becomes deadly.

535
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,670
The symptom is

536
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,040
bleeding from both ears.

537
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,510
How can we prove it?

538
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,160
The well.

539
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,480
Water is needed for cooking,
boiling tea, everything.

540
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,510
And before the banquet,

541
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,840
guests would drink tea.

542
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,240
So the well

543
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,170
must hold clues.

544
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,510
I'll go to the wine cellar
to find the osmanthus wine.

545
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,340
You take people

546
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,750
to find the leftover wine
and food from the banquet.

547
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,830
If I'm right,

548
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,570
they won't detect poison
in them separately.

549
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,170
Let's meet at the well later.

550
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,110
Just as you said,

551
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,000
we didn't detect poison

552
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,010
in the food and wine.

553
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:03,920
Now, let's mix

554
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
the wine and water

555
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,520
to see if my guess is correct.

556
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,030
Sure enough, it's poisoned.

557
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,070
Everyone in Yanxian knows

558
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,720
Hao Wenhou loves osmanthus wine.

559
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,650
For his wedding,

560
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,750
he would certainly serve

561
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,200
osmanthus wine to his guests.

562
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,310
When the host toasts,

563
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,440
everyone must drink

564
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,590
except the bride.

565
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,070
It's about time.

566
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,030
The coroner only tests for poison

567
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,350
by inserting
a silver needle into the throat

568
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,740
to see if it changes color.

569
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,540
But Baibusha and osmanthus wine

570
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,590
passed through

571
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,880
the victims' throat separately.

572
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,610
They must have thought of this.

573
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,590
That's why the coroner

574
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,050
didn't detect any poison.

575
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,680
This proves

576
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,010
they didn't die from the Sound Killing...

577
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,000
Technique.

578
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,000
Foxy Tang,

579
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,030
you didn't expect me

580
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:51,550
to figure it out

581
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,680
so quickly, did you?

582
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,330
It's only because I've seen so much

583
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,330
that I could clear your name so fast.

584
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,550
And you...

585
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,550
Wait.

586
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,590
I think I've been set up.

587
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,240
What's wrong?

588
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,300
Foxy Tang worried
you wouldn't find the truth

589
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,240
since you know nothing about poisons,

590
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,110
so he said all those things

591
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:10,960
I couldn't understand

592
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,090
to spark my curiosity.

593
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,880
That's how he got me
to help you solve the mystery...

594
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,140
and uncover the truth.

595
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:16,470
This...

596
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,860
Damn that Foxy Tang!

597
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,530
He tricked me again!

598
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,830
Your Sound Killing move yesterday

599
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,060
was powerful.

600
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:50,010
Looks like your injuries
are no longer serious.

601
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,580
But if you want to stay alive,

602
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,840
it's best not to use your martial arts.

603
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,510
Forget it.

604
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,570
You've been recovering here for 6 months.

605
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,320
No one has come looking for you,

606
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,790
and you have never left the temple.

607
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,430
Yet worldly matters

608
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,000
still found their way to you.

609
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,130
Abbot, are you displeased with me

610
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,000
for the trouble I brought yesterday?

611
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,200
You didn't bring trouble.

612
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,940
Mr. Chi has been eating chicken secretly

613
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,530
in the temple—that's trouble.

614
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,190
What you brought was karma.

615
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:35,640
Abbot,

616
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,070
what exactly is karma?

617
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,780
The doer is the cause,

618
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,920
and the receiver is the effect.

619
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:47,990
If someone

620
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,890
kills because of me,

621
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,590
or if an innocent

622
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,300
suffers because of me,

623
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,730
is that my karma?

624
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:59,160
It depends on whether you know

625
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:02,070
and whether you tried to stop it.

626
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,370
If trying to stop it

627
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,510
causes more deaths,

628
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,440
does that still count as compassion?

629
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,640
The wind blows the tiles on the roof,

630
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,600
and a tile falls and hits my head.

631
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,000
I don't blame the tile,

632
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,960
for it is not free.

633
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,000
Is it the wind's fault,

634
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,310
the tile's fault,

635
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,400
or mine

636
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,830
for standing beneath the roof?

637
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,250
It's your mistake, Master.

638
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,610
You made a mistake.

639
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,020
You lost 3.5 points in this round.

640
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,440
Amitabha.

641
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,520
How interesting.

642
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,160
Your question

643
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,610
is both false and true.

644
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,960
True and false, false and true—

645
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,270
perhaps you even deceived

646
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,350
yourself.

647
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,090
My surname is Fang,

648
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,590
my courtesy name is Pingzhai,

649
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,450
and my nickname

650
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,680
is Carefree.

651
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,750
I rarely do good deeds in my life.

652
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,030
Delivering a letter for someone

653
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,490
is actually a first for me.

654
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,200
I bought

655
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,110
a piece of news

656
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,370
in a mysterious tower,

657
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,920
yet forgot to tell them.

658
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,980
You'd better send someone discreet.

659
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:16,090
[To Tang Lici]

660
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,600
Oh, right.

661
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,070
The message has been delivered.

662
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,199
What a coincidence.

663
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,360
Someone else also asked

664
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,670
the same tower

665
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,230
you entrusted

666
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,760
to deliver that thing here.

667
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,960
I just don't know
if it's a real coincidence...

668
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,190
or not.

669
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,540
A half jade flute?

670
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,159
Sir,

671
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,710
could this

672
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,429
be your karma?

673
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,430
Sir.

674
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,280
Sir?

675
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,610
Does it hurt?

676
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,240
How could someone like me

677
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,730
even know what pain feels like?

678
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,190
I'll go check on Miss Shei.

679
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,800
Chi Yun,

680
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,840
I still feel something's off.

681
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,440
What's off?

682
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,690
What's Mr. Yang's motive?

683
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,190
We don't need to guess.

684
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,190
It all comes down to profit.

685
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,670
If it's really

686
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,400
such a simple, shallow reason,

687
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:02,840
it proves

688
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:03,920
Mr. Yang

689
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,250
isn't a man of great wit.

690
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,530
Then how could he

691
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
think of using the Sound Killing Technique

692
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,200
to cover up his crime?

693
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,600
What do you mean?

694
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,260
Hao Wenhou and his guests died horribly,

695
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,880
and Miss Shei didn't clearly see

696
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,800
the black‑clad pipa player

697
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,920
who resembled Mr. Tang.

698
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,190
But we've proven

699
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,510
Hao Wenhou and the guests

700
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,570
died of poisoning.

701
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,800
So where did that black-clad pipa player
come from?

702
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,660
Four years ago,

703
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,750
Zhoudi Tower was wiped out overnight.

704
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,510
And the Sound Killing Technique
has long vanished from jianghu.

705
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,840
If Mr. Yang really could

706
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,710
find a successor

707
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,320
of the Sound Killing Technique

708
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:33,920
to cover up

709
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,360
his crime,

710
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,440
he wouldn't have chosen

711
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,320
such a despicable method

712
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,760
as poisoning in the first place.

713
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,480
And he did it so secretively,

714
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,890
as if he was hiding something.

715
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,440
Are you saying

716
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,050
someone wants to frame Foxy Tang?

717
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,250
What do you want?

718
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,650
Beat Yang Shangqing

719
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,630
for 3 days,

720
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,840
and he'll confess to

721
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,350
even stealing the dog lost
in the next city.

722
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:54,950
Just wait!

723
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,000
Chi Yun!

724
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:57,670
You can't do that!

725
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,270
That's a forced confession.

726
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,590
Hurry!

727
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:11,880
Hurry up!

728
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,150
Be careful!

729
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,960
That's my family heirloom vase!

730
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,990
My vase!

731
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,000
My Lord?

732
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,430
What are you doing?

733
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,880
The silver's all on the ground.

734
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,280
Are you trying to run away

735
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,370
now that you can't hide it anymore?

736
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,380
Everyone, listen!

737
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,230
I'll give half my gold

738
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,260
to whoever kills this man!

739
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,880
Kill him!

740
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,800
Kill!

741
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,440
Kill him!

742
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,150
Hero,
your martial skills are truly impressive.

743
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,400
All this silver is yours.

744
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:11,880
Servants!

745
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,230
Take it to this hero.

746
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,030
Tell me.

747
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,450
Why did you try to frame Foxy Tang?

748
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,080
Please come in, sir.

749
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,320
You just got out of prison

750
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,880
and are already in the mood

751
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,480
to play with these trinkets?

752
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,510
Today I saw Feng

753
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,050
and took a liking to him.

754
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,120
Besides,

755
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,190
after all the ups and downs
I've experienced recently,

756
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,480
I always want to find something to do

757
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,610
to distract my mind.

758
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,920
What I did was improper.

759
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,340
Mr. Tang, I hope you and your wife
won't take offense.

760
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,400
I don't have a wife.

761
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,790
I just picked him up on a whim.

762
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,670
How pitiful.

763
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,630
Luckily, he met you,

764
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,100
and you kindly took him in
and have been taking care of him.

765
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,260
It must be fate.

766
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,600
You're wrong.

767
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,760
I just did it on a whim

768
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,000
to see what it felt like

769
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,930
to adopt a child.

770
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:40,960
But didn't you

771
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,070
give him a name?

772
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,030
A name

773
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,840
creates a bond.

774
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,190
One of a kind in a millennium,

775
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,600
break with old words.

776
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,440
So I'll call you

777
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,840
Tang Lici.

778
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,110
Now I see

779
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,840
that no matter what,

780
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,400
I am not him.

781
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,550
Man on earth...

782
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,760
Man on earth...

783
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,030
Good at birth.

784
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:05,030
Good at birth.

785
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,200
The same nature...

786
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,150
The same nature...

787
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,440
Miss,

788
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,650
you married into the Hao family

789
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,000
to get the money
to pay for your father's funeral.

790
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,960
Now that you've gone through
such a calamity,

791
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,410
if you feel uneasy,

792
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,360
you might seek the Abbot

793
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,100
for a talisman of peace.

794
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,840
It's quite effective.

795
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,070
I have no way to repay

796
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,000
Lord Hao's kindness.

797
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,400
Miss Shei,

798
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,580
you confuse me.

799
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,040
You're a part of the scheme,

800
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,310
yet you know nothing

801
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,590
about it.

802
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,320
I...

803
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:53,760
It seems

804
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,880
you're just a pawn

805
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,840
he used and discarded,

806
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,360
a catalyst to start his game.

807
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,920
But what did I do wrong

808
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,070
to become this discarded pawn?

809
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,400
If I'm a discarded pawn,

810
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,200
what role are you playing

811
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,480
in this game?

812
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,280
Chi Yun!

813
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,250
What are you doing?

814
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,360
Miss Zhong!

815
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,440
Miss Zhong, please save me!

816
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,890
He's trying to kill me!

817
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,980
Give me 30 minutes,

818
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,630
and he'll confess everything.

819
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,190
Chi Yun,

820
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,320
the Central Plains Sword Alliance

821
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,800
never forces confessions through torture.

822
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,130
Truth comes from careful investigation.

823
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,390
All the evidence is laid out on the floor.

824
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,320
Can't you see it?

825
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,480
He sent someone

826
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,110
to secretly follow us,

827
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,380
and when he was exposed,

828
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,070
he tried to run off with the money.

829
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,590
Run off with the money?

830
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,280
I'm just...

831
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,710
Mr. Yang!

832
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,360
Moving!

833
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,590
Please explain

834
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,110
where all this money and these treasures
you're moving

835
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:51,880
came from.

836
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,150
I earned them!

837
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,710
I'm at least a city lord.

838
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,770
This is just my small savings.

839
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,510
Is that not allowed?

840
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,510
Stop pretending!

841
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:01,630
Fine!

842
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,590
I'll tell you!

843
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,480
I killed them.

844
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,510
I'm the one
who killed those over 100 people

845
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,710
in the Hao Residence.

846
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,010
I killed them all.

847
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,710
It was my doing.

848
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,070
Then why

849
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,730
did you try to frame Tang Lici?

850
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,590
You're still denying it
when death is near!

851
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,880
No.

852
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,950
I never intended to frame Tang Lici.

853
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,040
It wasn't me.

854
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,500
It was that person.

855
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,140
He forced me to do it.

856
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:30,930
It was him.

857
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,620
That black-clad pipa player!

858
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,100
What black-clad pipa player?

859
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:35,840
When?

860
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:36,710
Where?

861
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,260
He's not human.

862
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,280
He's a ghost.

863
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,140
That night,

864
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,290
when I left the Hao Residence,

865
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,440
I was full of regret and fear.

866
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,880
You poisoned everyone in the residence

867
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,340
and betrayed their trust.

868
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,230
Well done.

869
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:16,570
A miserable death
is the reward you deserve.

870
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,430
Don't kill me!

871
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:18,510
I'll give you

872
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,940
whatever you want!

873
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,350
Please don't kill me!

874
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:25,360
You poisoned

875
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,300
over 100 people in the Hao Residence.

876
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,410
They should have died in utter misery,

877
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:30,960
but I killed them
with the Sound Killing Technique,

878
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,000
letting them die

879
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,400
in beautiful illusions.

880
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,110
If you want to keep your position
as city lord,

881
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,670
take
the Central Plains Sword Alliance people

882
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:39,140
to the old temple outside the city

883
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:39,980
to find me.

884
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,320
Remember my face.

885
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:51,910
This is your only chance to survive.

886
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,480
It was him.

887
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,770
It was Tang Lici.

888
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:02,080
It was Tang Lici!

889
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,710
You said

890
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,560
the murderer was your enemy.

891
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,270
But if what you said is true—

892
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:09,050
that he framed you like this—

893
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,150
why didn't you take revenge on him,

894
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,070
eye for an eye?

895
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:14,240
Or perhaps,

896
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,510
he's not your enemy,

897
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:17,880
but...

898
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,800
He is my enemy,

899
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,250
and was once my friend.

900
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,480
Forgive my boldness,

901
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,440
but what kind of friend

902
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,550
was he?

903
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,370
What kind of friend?

904
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,360
What's the rush?

905
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,750
We haven't seen each other for so long.

906
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,190
I hope you haven't forgotten

907
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,190
all those memories we shared.
