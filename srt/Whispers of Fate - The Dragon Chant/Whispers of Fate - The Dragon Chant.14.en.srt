[Episode 14]

3
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:36,979
Take it.

00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,020
[Wanted]

5
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:41,560
They captured your traits.

6
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,820
It looks just like you.

7
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,080
And it looks like you as well.

8
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,310
This one's the most accurate.

9
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,710
Who's this thug with the mean, fat face?

10
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,110
Which bastard drew this?

11
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,200
Chi Yun,

12
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,500
keep it down.

13
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,270
Don't expose ourselves.

14
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,419
Do I still need this disguise?

15
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,190
Who's this?

16
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,120
Ask them.

17
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,080
Just ask them...

18
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,420
You're Chi Yun!

19
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,190
Guys!

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,680
Catch them!

21
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,770
Where are they?

22
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,710
Where did they go?

23
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,370
Over there!

24
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,240
Go after them!

25
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,030
Let's go! After them!

26
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,910
Check over there!

27
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,170
After them! Follow me!

Shen, you...

29
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,630
Chi Yun,

30
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,410
you've dragged us down again.

31
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,280
From this portrait,

32
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,710
he could recognize me?

33
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,980
I told you yours was the most accurate.

34
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,090
These are gourd chicken,

35
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,060
mixed stir-fry,

36
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,010
clay-pot fish,

Ziyang steamed platter,

38
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,470
and warm shredded duck salad.

39
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,240
Sirs,

40
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,470
all dishes have been served.

41
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,400
Enjoy your meal.

42
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,850
Foxy Tang,

43
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:01,910
you don't look like

44
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,340
someone who's wanted at all.

45
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,540
You're clearly here to enjoy yourself.

46
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,240
You're right.

47
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,410
What's this?

48
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,730
From Jinzhou to Sanqin,

49
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,240
there are myriad delicacies.

50
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,680
I need careful notes to make sure

51
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,829
I don't miss anything.

52
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:20,160
Missing out on good food

53
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,810
would be a lifelong regret.

54
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,280
You really made

55
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,240
a food map.

56
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,150
Let me take a look.

57
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,960
What's this? It's so good!

58
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,070
This is called honey-glazed balls,

59
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,760
made with flour and eggs,

60
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,290
coated in honey sauce,

61
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,520
crispy outside, soft inside,

62
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,700
not only sweet but also fragrant.

63
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,960
It's a popular dish in the Sanqin region.

64
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,430
But

65
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,250
you ordered so much.

66
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,670
Can you finish it all?

67
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,770
It's not that much.

68
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,829
Not that much? Seriously?

69
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,840

all the dishes

76
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,160

78

80
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,850
Hope you had a great meal.
See you next time.

81
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:33,510
Sure thing!

82
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,920
Welcome, sirs.

83

Move aside!

Everyone, make way!

85
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:36,800
Move!

86
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,030
I heard Yique Yinyang

87
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,800
and his followers

88
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,860
are all at this inn.

89
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,780
Where are they?

90
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,840
Where did they go?

91
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,000
Where?

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,860
Where are they?

93
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,370
Man, I finally got a chance to eat.

94
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:47,750
Don't eat it.

95
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,280
I'll eat when I get back.

96
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,690
Chi Yun, the Cloud.

97
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,190
Who wants to get beaten up?

98
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,180
Kill him!

99
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,480
Chi Yun asked to save it for him.

100
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,560
He'll think

101
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,830
you ate it.

102
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,340
Hey, Shen Langhun.

103
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,870
They're such great delicacies.

104
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,600
Sir, are you

105
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,350
not satisfied with them?

106
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,490
I don't eat much.

107
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,250
But I wanted to try every dish.

108
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,200
How do you like them?

109
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,720
All these dishes are good.

110
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,230
But I don't understand
what makes them good.

111
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,230
Say, this gourd chicken dish

112
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,460
is made with a whole chicken,

113
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,470
simmered over low heat for an hour,

114
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,480
seasoned

115
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,310
with salt,

116
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,460
sugar, scallions,

117
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,240
ginger, rock sugar, and soy sauce.

118
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,340
Then stuff Sichuan peppercorns,

119
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:02,940
cinnamon,

120
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,940
star anise,

121
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,240
cloves, bay leaves, and other spices

122
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,120
inside it

123
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,720
to bring out the aroma.

124
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,070
Then deep-fry it.

125
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,060
Just this one dish alone

126
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,720
takes

127
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,610
over two hours to prepare.

128
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,090
Yet you, sir,

129
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,900
think it's not that tasty.

130
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,080
Making such a dish

131
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,600
requires

132
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,120
so much time and effort.

133
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,430
Is it worth it?

134
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,900
Those meaningless things

135
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,050
are what help us

136
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,600
make it through this limited journey
of life.

137
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,630
Without pursuit,

138
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,740
what joy is there in life?

139
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,600
Likewise,

140
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,610
without pursuit,

141
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,190
what is there to fear in death?

142
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,570
You are a clever man.

143
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,130
Following this logic,

144
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,240
if one obtains

145
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,680
what he's been pursuing,

146
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,250
then he should die with no regrets.

147
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,800
Maybe.

148
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,250
What if you chase something
to the very end

149
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,160
only to find it's a cliff

150
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,570
or something unattainable?

151
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,800
Then I'll keep going for it
until I hit a dead end.

152
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,370
I envy you

153
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,720
for having something to pursue.

154
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,070
I also envy you

155
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,920
for having so much time to pursue it.

156
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,350
It seems that delicacies

157
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,610
are not what I'm after.

158
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,740
How may I address you?

159
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:41,990
Ghostly Peony.

160
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,750
I am...

161
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,720
Foxy Tang!

162
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,450
You ate my honey-glazed ball!

163
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,590
We shouldn't linger here.

164
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,290
More enemies will come after us. Let's go.

165
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,490
See you around.

166
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,810
Goodbye,

167
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,750
Mr. Foxy Tang.

168
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,390
Nice to meet you.

169
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,870
In other words,

170
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,080
if you've done

171
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,480
everything you should do

172
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,970
yet still can't find
what you truly want...

173
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,460
Check, please.

174
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,630
Sir,

175
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,030
there's still so much food left.

176
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,960
What a waste.

177
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,320
Do you have anything you want to do?

178
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,130
Why are you suddenly asking me this, sir?

179
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,910
I don't really

180
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,310
have any dreams of my own.

181
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,110
With a big family to support,

182
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:15,950
making money,

183
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,200
I mean, lots of money,

184
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,440
is the only thing

185
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,640
I want to do in my life.

186
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,670
This is enough

187
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,860
to last you a lifetime, huh?

188
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,720
Yes, of course!

189
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,750
I could never earn

190
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,810
this much money, not in my whole life.

191
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,870
Thank you, sir.

192
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,030
Thank you for your generosity.

193
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,090
Is there anything else you want to do?

194
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:38,820
No.

195
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:39,960
With this gold,

196
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,080
I won't need

197
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,410
to do anything else
for the rest of my life.

198
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,850
You find him fishy?

199
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,810
If so,

200
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,860
why didn't you try him directly?

201
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,390
He doesn't have the murderous intent.

202
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,270
If trouble's coming, let it come.

203
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,360
No need to pay special attention.

204
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,490
I don't care anyway.

205
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,000
Honey!

206
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:12,740
Honey!

207
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,680
Honey!

208
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,150
Honey!

209
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:15,840
Come down!

210
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,340
Honey!

211
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,390
Come down now!

212
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,190
Why did you climb so high?

213
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,870
I've achieved

214
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,120
my lifelong goal.

215
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,360
There's nothing left to do.

216
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,080
Come down!

217
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Honey!

218
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,040
Then there's no reason to live.

219
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,960
Honey, please get down here!

220
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,000
Honey.

221
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,960
Honey!

222
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,490
He's smashed into this state...

223
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,800
Honey!

224
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,410
[Xiuyu Peony Pavilion]

225
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,060
Come in.

226
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Why did you act without permission?

227
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,770
I don't want to see you
suffer anymore, Master.

228
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,520
When did I ever say I was suffering?

229
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,200
Master!

230
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,700
Even if it irritates you, I must say this.

231
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,720
Master, you used your own bloodline

232
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,390
to forge the Thousand Curse Needle

233
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,480
to deal with Tang Lici,

234
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,680
but it's not worth it.

235
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,840
Tang Lici doesn't deserve

236
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,770
such a sacrifice from you, Master.

237
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,780
Are you telling me what to do?

238
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,310
Master.

239
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,160
What brings you here?

240
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,940
Master, treating Xiaohong this way,

241
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,260
aren't you worried

242
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,580
that her love might turn into hatred?

243
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,510
Get to the point.

244
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,360
The Leader is here.

245
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,250
He's waiting for you at the Peony Pool.

246
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,150
Don't always let him get his way.

247
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,390
People only reach out for things

248
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,640
that might slip through their fingers.

249
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,490

263
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,510
The girl who was with Tang Lici

264
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,060
has gone to the Sword Alliance.

265
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,240
Does she know

266
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,100
the location of the Fengliu Shop?

267
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,440
The base in Sword King City

268
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,320
is merely an expendable appendage.

269
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,580
It's nothing serious.

270
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,950
It took us three years

271
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,720
to establish that waterway channel.

272
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,750
After Tang Lici dies,

273
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,550
there will be
countless more three-year periods.

274
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,490
Is it hard for you?

275
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,750
I admire

276
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,430
your ability to recreate
the Blood Ghost Pill.

277
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,610
You're helping the Fengliu Shop grow,

278
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,790
and I'm having the Fengliu Shop
help you get revenge.

279
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,920
This is reciprocal.

280
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,870
You want revenge,

281
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,490
and I won't stop you.

282
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,900

I know when to stop.

288
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,840
Since you say so, Master,

289
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,440
I can rest assured.

290
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,610
I have news for you, Master.

291
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,990
I saw Tang Lici in Sanqin.

292
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,210
He was heading west.

293
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,120
Guess where he's going?

294
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,690
It's obvious.

295
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,270
The Biluo Palace.

296
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,390
But I'm curious.

297
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,490
You met Tang Lici,

298
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,200
yet you didn't do anything.

299
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,990
That's your plaything.

300
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,590
I wouldn't dare overstep.

301
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,390
I hope you

302
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,670
can seize this opportunity.

303
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,180
Master.

304
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,750
Told the East and West Palace Chiefs

305
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,630
to catch up with Tang Lici.

306
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,440
Yes.

307
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,350
Master,

308
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,640
I know my mistake.

309
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,790
Let's go.

310
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,040
Zhong Chunji,

311
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,680
last time in Yanxian,

312
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,720
you failed to bring Tang Lici to justice

313
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,400
and made up various excuses.

314
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,870
And this time,

315
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,640
you had the audacity

316
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,000
to collude with the criminal

317
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,550
and let him get away!

318
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,360
You...

319
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,830
Zhong Chunji,

320
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,510
do you even take

321
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,240
the Sword Alliance seriously?

322
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,340
After all,

323
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,000
we shouldn't have
let the Yanxian incident slide.

324
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,310
If she had arrested Tang Lici

325
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,270
and brought him back
to the Sword Alliance in the first place,

326
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,070
how would Sword King City

327
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,880
have been thrown into such chaos?

328
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,000
Although there are no casualties,

329
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,310
Zhong Chunji, can you

330
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,030
bear the responsibility

331
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,740
for the cost of this city's destruction?

332
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,160
You don't live up to the title
of the Shanfeng Branch Chief.

333
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,400
I've said it long ago

334
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,650
that this woman

335
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,890
can never achieve anything great.

336
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,400
Master Pu.

337
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,620
What's with your attitude?

338
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The real criminal in Sword King City

339
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,400
is Yu Qifeng, obviously.

340
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,640
The Sword King City Case is
full of inconsistencies.

341
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,110
The night before the public trial,

342
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,510
Yu Qifeng set a trap,

343
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
trying to frame Mr. Tang for murder.

344
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,210
Master Puzhu can testify to this.

345
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,520
You might as well invite him over

346
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,160
and question him as you questioned me.

347
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,460
You.

348
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,680
In order to find clues
about the Evil Pill,

349
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,310
Mr. Tang

350
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,000
even risked going against Sword King City

351
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,100
to collect Sword King City's past ledgers.

352
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,630
When we were checking them,

353
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,820
not only were there villains

354
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,000
who destroyed the ledgers,

355
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,830
but they also attempted to kill

356
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,440
innocent people to silence them.

357
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:54,880
Also,

358
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,590
you said I should be responsible

359
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,750
for the destruction of Sword King City.

360
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,110
But when the city was destroyed,

361
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,990
I was rescuing
and evacuating the citizens.

362
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,590
As for you,

363
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,160
all of you,

364
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,190
where were you then?

365
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:11,790
I...

366
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,640
You can question me

367
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,440
about my actions in Sword King City.

368
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,550
I've got nothing to hide

369
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,880
or to feel guilty about.

370
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,300
As the Sword Master,

371
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,960
how could you say something

372
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,620
so narrow-minded and biased?

373
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,070
What will people think

374
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,030
of our Central Plains

375
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,960
Sword Alliance?

376
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,550
Master Pu,

377
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,110
when have you ever
taken the Central Plains

378
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,240
Sword Alliance seriously?

379
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,040
Zhong Chunji!

380
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:32,890
Chunji.

381
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,960
Master Shao,

382
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,530
forgive me for being blunt.

383
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,030
Everyone

384
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,160
clearly saw

385
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,560
Tang Lici's golden eyes and forehead mark.

386
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,240
She claims that Tang Lici is innocent.

387
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,000
Then she should have

388
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,810
taken Tang Lici back to clarify everything

389
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,110
instead of letting the criminal go
in secret.

390
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,570
If I brought Mr. Tang back,

391
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,240
wouldn't that be

392
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,110
playing
right into the Fengliu Shop's hands?

393
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,220
This is just an expedient.

394
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:56,790
This is just

395
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,120
your wishful thinking.

396
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,750
As a junior,

397
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,270
do you think you're wiser

398
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,800
than all the Sword Masters?

399
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,270
Is justice in the world

400
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,830
determined by seniority,

401
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,030
by power,

402
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,750
or by the number of followers?

403
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,280
Do they represent justice?

404
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:12,830
Zhong Chunji!

405
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,640
It's one thing
that you have a lowly background,

406
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,680
and now you even

407
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,880
disregard the rules?

408
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,800
Master Jiang,

409
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,730
please stick to the point.

410
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:21,510
Do you

411
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,200
also forget the rules

412
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,240
and want to overstep your boundaries

413
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,110
to discipline

414
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,510
Master Shao's disciple?

415
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,130
I wouldn't dare.

416
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,720
But Master Shao,

417
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,510
as you know,

418
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,320
people everywhere

419
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,750
are eagerly waiting for the Sword Alliance

420
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,790
to capture the suspect

421
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,050
and uncover the truth.

422
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,270
Yet Zhong Chunji,

423
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,140
as the Shanfeng Branch Chief,

424
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,550
has repeatedly failed in her duties

425
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,830
and spoken disrespectfully.

426
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,090
If we don't punish her,

427
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,920
I'm afraid we'll have to face
public criticism.

428
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,590
Master Jiang's got a point.

429
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,160
I've long believed

430
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
that Zhong Chunji

431
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,920
is no longer suitable

432
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,110
for the position
of the Shanfeng Branch Chief.

433
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,120
We should appoint someone more capable

434
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,750
for the good of the Sword Alliance.

435
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,720
Otherwise, allowing such a troublemaker

436
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,640
to act recklessly

437
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,640
will lead others in the Sword Alliance
to follow suit.

438
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,770
I hereby order Zhong Chunji

439
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,510
to be immediately dismissed

440
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,830
from her position
as the Shanfeng Branch Chief

441
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,560
and serve
as an ordinary Sword Alliance disciple

442
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,340
to atone for her mistakes.

443
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,750
I object.

444
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,440
How dare you object?

445
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,280
Master, you've always taught me

446
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,510
to do what is right.

447
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,260
But I clearly did the right thing.

448
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,310
Why am I still being blamed,

449
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,640
punished,

450
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,640
and bullied by all these senior masters?

451
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,200
Chunji!

452
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,240
Am I wrong?

453
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,130
I don't accept this!

454
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,370
The Sword Masters have made
their decision.

455
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,720
You should go pack your things

456
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,450
and move out
of the Shanfeng Branch Chief's room.

457
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,310
Yes.

458
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,330
I'll take my leave.

459
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,880
What's with your attitude?

460
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,550
Being high and mighty
just because you became

461
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,080
the Shanfeng Branch Chief?

462
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,490
You're actually arguing with us

463
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,250
for an outsider, Tang Lici.

464
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,770
I've said it long ago

465
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,570
that people from the lower classes are

466
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,090
always shortsighted.

467
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,270
Give me some.

468
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:07,880
Don't grab it.

469
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,830
Give me some.

470
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,280
I have a steamed bun left.

471
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,680
What if we slip the beans

472
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
and someone comes after us?

473
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,040
What's there to be afraid of?

474
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,820
Once the food is in our stomachs,

475
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,550
they can't make us

476
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,750
spit it out, can they?

477
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,640
Right.

478
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,350
Exactly.

479
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,720
Just eat quickly.

480
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,920
Next time,

481
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,960
we still need you

482
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,200
to lure the boss away.

483
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,720
I don't want to do it again.

484
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,110
His pinches hurt.

485
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,960
Think about all of us.

486
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,310
If you don't go,

487
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,240
what will we eat?

488
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,310
We share the weal and woe.

489
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,030
Right.

490
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:46,750
You have to go.

491
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,550
That's right.

492
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,270
Look!

493
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,590
They're over there!

494
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,090
Catch them!

495
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,270
Don't let them escape!

496
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,760
Mr. Tan, she did it!

497
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,350
It has nothing to do with us!

498
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,440
Run!

499
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,360
Let's go!

500
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,650
Stop right there, you little brat!

501
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,450
Stop there!

502
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:04,660
You little brat,

503
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,320
you're quite the runner.

504
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,170
You have nowhere to escape now!

505
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,990
You made it out alive?

506
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,310
Why did you betray me?

507
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,590
Why?

508
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,240
You're not a local here.

509
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,270
We're already generous, giving you food.

510
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,590
You should be grateful.

511
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,550
That's right.

512
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,030
Be grateful!

513
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,640
Be grateful!

514
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,840
You country bumpkin.

515
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,570
You should be grateful.

516
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,850
Since childhood, I've figured out

517
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,850
that a homeless person

518
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,120
is an outsider everywhere they go.

519
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,510
People's hearts distinguish
between those close and distant.

520
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,840
We can easily share joy,

521
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,480
but not hardship.

522
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:07,140
I thought
the Sword Alliance would be different.

523
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,790
But despite all my efforts

524
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,190
to be a good swordswoman,

525
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,530
why am I criticized for my background?

526
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,000
Why is it that when I do good deeds,

527
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,110
I repeatedly face setbacks

528
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,710
and even suffer innocently,

529
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,720
while they remain high and mighty?

530
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,740
Looks like someone is still sulking.

531
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,760
I didn't do anything wrong.

532
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,070
Master, you didn't answer my question

533
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,400
at Wanhua Hall earlier.

534
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,520
I told you to do what's right,

535
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,270
but I never said

536
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,270
that you wouldn't pay a price for it.

537
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,800
Pay a price for doing good deeds?

538
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,110
Does that even make sense?

539
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,550
Do you think doing wrong things

540
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,150
doesn't have consequences?

541
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,350
When you do good deeds,

542
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,880
even if you have to pay a price,

543
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,610
at least you won't feel guilty.

544
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,840
That's why

545
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,740
it's hard to be a good person.

546
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,310
Our Central Plains Sword Alliance

547
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,710
does strive for justice.

548
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,200
But as human beings,

549
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,050
most of us
have selfish interests to pursue.

550
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,070
The Sword Alliance is
plagued by deep-rooted problems.

551
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,310
All the Sword Masters are

552
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,170
strong in their own territories.

553
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,960
But to truly make people join hands

554
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,360
and work together as one,

555
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,480
we need

556
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,960
more fresh blood

557
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,910
and decisive measures.

558
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,470
Master, what do you mean?

559
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,910
Alright, don't be upset.

560
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,920
This is only temporary.

561
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,720
I'll

562
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:37,550
teach you a move,

563
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,150
my most powerful technique.

564
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,600
Take them.

565
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,640
These are

566
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,530
iron chopsticks?

567
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,390
That's right.

568
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,210
Throw them.

569
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,810
Put more force into it.

570
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,530
Well...

571
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,380
Smash them.

572
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,190
Go ahead.

573
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,310
Fine, I'll throw them.
I have nothing to fear!

574
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,030
How is it?

575
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,440
Do you feel

576
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,370
much better now?

577
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,200
Smash them again.

578
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,730
Put even more force into it.

579
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,070
How are you feeling?

580
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,400
Better now?

581
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:24,550
This is

582
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,920
my most powerful

583
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,130
chopstick-throwing technique.

584
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,640
Next time you're angry

585
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,960
and want to smash something,

586
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,490
just use metal chopsticks.

587
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,720
First, they won't break.

588
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,830
Second, they make a loud noise.

589
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,760
Since it's loud,

590
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,550
people will know you're angry

591
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,280
and won't dare to mess with you.

592
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,170
Look at you.

593
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,970
If you break these vases
or porcelain items,

594
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,380
it'll be such a waste of money.

595
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,870
And if you hurt your hands,

596
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,670
that would be even worse.

597
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,180
These vases are nice.

598
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,510
I'll take them as a gift.

599
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,960
I paid for these myself.

600
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,620
I'm taking all of them with me.

601
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,310
Stingy.

602
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,360
Alright,

603
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,140
you can continue packing.

604
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,130
I'm leaving now.

605
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,340
Take your time.

606
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,810
Don't forget the iron chopsticks.

607
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,110
Have you studied the new technique

608
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,510
that Master mentioned yesterday?

609
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,840
I did, but I don't get it.

610
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,670
Miss Shei.

611
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,110
Miss Shei.

612
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,350
Gu.

613
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,750
Master Shao asked me to take you

614
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,610
to get settled.

615
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,320
This way.

616
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,960
This is where

617
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,960
the Shanfeng Branch disciples live.

618
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,230
Usually, no one's here during the day.

619
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,630
Everyone goes to practice swordsmanship.

620
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,070
Go ahead that way,

621
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,170
and it's your temporary quarters.

622
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,070
If you need anything,

623
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,310
you can come to me.

624
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,690
Hello, Senior Gu.

625
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,270
If you can't find me,

626
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,930
you can ask any of them as well.

627
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,790
Thank you, Gu.

628
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,870
If it weren't for you and Miss Zhong,

629
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,000
I wouldn't know what to do, where to go.

630
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,110
Don't mention it.

631
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,840
Before Mr. Tang left,

632
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,030
he specifically asked me

633
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,090
to take care of you.

634
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,900
This is nothing.

635
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,360
Mr. Tang...

636
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,040
Foxy Tang.

637
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,160
Are we really not
taking Miss Shei with us?

638
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,440
Going to the Central Plains Sword Alliance
with Miss Zhong

639
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,440
is a better choice

640
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,400
for her.

641
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,480
I spoke too harshly just now.

642
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,030
However,

643
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,750
I hope you remember

644
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,200
not to mention

645
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,370
your special constitution to anyone,
no matter what.

646
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,680
Don't put yourself

647
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,120
in unnecessary danger.

648
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,050
Where are you going, Mr. Tang?

649
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,290
Take care of yourself.

650
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,120
Don't worry about me.

651
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,920
Miss Shei?

652
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,300
I'm fine.

653
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,520
Then I'll take you to your room.

654
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,550
Stone,

655
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,750
stop playing.

656
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,680
It's time to eat.

657
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,790
Stop piling up those stupid rocks.

658
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,440
I'm talking to you.

659
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,500
Are you listening?

660
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,270
Stop!

661
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,480
Senior Gu.

662
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,920
Were you trying to bully Xiaoshi just now?

663
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,440
No, no.

664
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,210
Absolutely not.

665
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,610
Just leave the food here.

666
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,880
Stone will eat

667
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,960
when he wants to.

668
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,440
Yes.

669
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,550
Is your name Stone?

670
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,480
Miss Shei.

671
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,310
Stone

672
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,680
doesn't talk to anyone.

673
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,370
Six months ago,

674
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,260
a master of a small sect in Lizhou

675
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,060
suddenly went mad
along with his disciples

676
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,550
and massacred

677
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,010
an entire village nearby.

678
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,140
Master Shao went to investigate in person.

679
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,420
In a dilapidated hut there,

680
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:36,920
he found

681
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,380
Stone huddled in a corner.

682
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,550
He must have experienced some trauma

683
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,810
to end up in this state.

684
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,830
Now it seems

685
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,720
that it was

686
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,140
the Fengliu Shop causing chaos,

687
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,340
spreading the Blood Ghost Pills there.

688
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,750
Master Shao

689
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,360
is truly kind-hearted.

690
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,070
After Stone arrived at the Sword Alliance,

691
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,730
he's never said a single word.

692
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,290
He's like this every day,

693
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,010
constantly piling up stones.

694
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,400
That's why we call him

695
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,830
Stone.

696
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,160
He can move such large stones?

697
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,850
Stone's strength is

698
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,730
much greater
than that of ordinary children.

699
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,920
But you've also seen

700
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,070
his personality.

701
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:17,880
Stone.

702
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,350
Stone!

703
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,280
What's wrong?

704
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,680
Why do I feel

705
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,130
that he's a bit like Mr. Tang?

706
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,590
Miss Shei, you must be joking.

707
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,030
Mr. Tang is handsome, graceful,

708
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,000
and eloquent.

709
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,270
But Stone can't even

710
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,200
speak properly.

711
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,440
I don't know why.

712
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,680
It's just a feeling.

713
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:10,960
Miss Shei,

714
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,310
let me take you to your quarters.

715
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,110
You two!

716
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,630
I'm dog-tired.

717
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,570
You're still eating

718
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,000
as if watching a show?

719
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,630
If I go fight, they'll end up

720
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,290
either dead or badly injured.

721
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,190
I'm injured.

722
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,580
How are your injuries?

723
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:50,210
Not fatal.

724
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,500
But when it comes to fighting,

725
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,920
I should avoid it if possible.

726
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,550
So you're just making me do all the work.

727
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,050
You are my bodyguard after all.

728
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,510
Even an ox

729
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,190
needs some rest when plowing.

730
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,630
This is already

731
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,190
the third batch today.

732
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,080
If we keep attracting attention like this,

733
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,920
fighting our way through

734
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,000
is not a good idea.

735
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,330
The whole world is looking for us.

736
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,190
Hiding anywhere ends up the same.

737
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,630
These ordinary martial artists are
no big problem.

738
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,400
But if we keep getting delayed like this,

739
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,590
the Fengliu Shop
will catch up with us sooner or later.

740
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,650
Especially Liu Yan

741
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,810
and the other one...

742
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,540
That Xifang Tao you mentioned.

743
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,060
West Peach (Xifang Tao) of three colors.

744
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,640
She's powerful.

745
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,170
She's got great inner strength.

746
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:29,760
However,

747
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,960
that's nothing.

748
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:33,710
She's

749
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,710
so good at waiting for the right timing.

750
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,530
Her stab to my abdomen

751
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,730
nearly severed my meridians.

752
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,380
She's a well-disguised snake.

753
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,510
The Fengliu Shop

754
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,970
won't give you a chance
to catch your breath.

755
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,270
Bait like me is

756
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,110
worth them coming out in full force.

757
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,670
Who knows what you're

758
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,880
planning, Foxy Tang?

759
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,700
What should we do now?

760
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,480
Still follow your map?

761
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,580
Mr. Zhao, Mr. Zhang.

762
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,050
Hi, Mr. Wang.

763
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,080
Long time no see.

764
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:04,490
This time,

765
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,920
we must arrest him
and bring him to justice.

766
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,710
More people are coming after us.

767
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,770
Let's leave first.

768
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,320
Miss Shei,

769
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,000
please have some tea.

770
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,200
So what's the matter?

771
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,070
I was with them

772
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,060
through the entire Sword King City Case.

773
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,800
Mr. Tang was indeed

774
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,480
investigating the truth
about the Blood Ghost Pill

775
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,630
when he was framed.

776
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,760
Do you have any evidence?

777
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,070
Mr. Tang and Miss Zhong

778
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,400
found the ledgers of Sword King City.

779
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,230
I

780
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,610
noted down all the suspicious details

781
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,580
for your review, Master Shao.

782
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,640
Weren't the ledgers burned?

783
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,070
Although those ledgers revealing clues

784
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,910
have all been destroyed,

785
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,590
I still remember

786
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
the suspicious locations we found.

787
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,110
So I sorted through and memorized them,

788
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,150
all written down in this notebook.

789
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,810
You have an excellent memory.

790
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,960
Someone has been sent
to investigate this matter.

791
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,020
Miss Shei,

792
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,140
could you take a walk with me?

793
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,500
Miss Shei.

794
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,250
It might sound a bit blunt,

795
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,570
but I've been wanting to ask you this.

796
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,320
Since you are

797
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,450
a survivor of the Hao family massacre,

798
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,030
why did you keep following someone

799
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,800
who's suspected of being the murderer?

800
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,760
Although

801
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,800
he does look like

802
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,460
that black-clad pipa player,

803
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,300
after meeting him,

804
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,400
I had a feeling

805
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,490
that he's not that person.

806
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,050
Mr. Tang not only found the real culprit,

807
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,460
but also took me in.

808
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,110
After my time with him,

809
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,430
I feel

810
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,370
that he doesn't want to be a bad person.

811
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:00,520
Not that he's a good person,

812
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:01,440
but

813
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,370
that he doesn't want to be a bad one?

814
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,520
That's an interesting way to put it.

815
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:06,670
Don't you resent him

816
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,510
for dragging you into danger?

817
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,480
He made someone

818
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,190
who should have

819
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,400
seen him as an enemy

820
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,480
not only stop hating him,

821
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,300
but also want to brave danger for him.

822
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,530
Doesn't this prove

823
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,520
that Mr. Tang is trustworthy?

824
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,630
Well, then,

825
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,070
I

826
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,180
would like to ask you for a favor,
Miss Shei.

827
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,480
The people chasing us now

828
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,760
use peculiar techniques.

829
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,690
They must be from the Fengliu Shop.

830
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,580
They're finally here.

831
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,070
So you deliberately lingered here

832
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,070
waiting for them.

833
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,900
We'll talk later.

834
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,710
Chi Yun,

835
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,280
are you here?

836
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,360
Chi Yun?

837
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,760
She even sent a signal?

838
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,190
She really has no regard for our past.

839
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:34,840
It seems

840
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,590
that Miss Bai doesn't want

841
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,320
to have anything to do with you.

842
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,650
But she's still my wife.

843
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,960
You should learn to respect others.

844
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,600
How have I disrespected her?

845
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,480
Greetings, East Palace Chief,

846
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,540
West Palace Chief.

847
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,340
Where is Tang Lici?

848
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,680
I tracked him to this place,

849
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,840
but somehow

850
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,200
I lost his trail here.

851
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,550
Seems like Mr. Tang isn't

852
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,250
good at hiding or escaping.

853
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,190
So why did you send that damn signal?

854
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,920
You're scaring off our target!

855
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:22,620
Fucui,

856
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,410
do not hit women to vent your anger.

857
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,490
You're my subordinate,

858
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,730
yet you can't even handle
such a simple task.

859
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,200
Next time I assign you something

860
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,260
and you fail again,

861
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,230
I'll tear you apart!

862
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,230
Yes.

863
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,630
There are only two routes

864
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,920
to the Biluo Palace, west and south.

865
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,610
If we take the south route,

866
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,870
we'll definitely intercept Tang Lici.

867
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,460
What about the west route?

868
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:55,690
No one can go that way.

869
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,410
Let's go!

870
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,860
Apply this, and it will heal quickly.

871
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,890
Thank you, West Palace Chief.

872
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,110
We're both women.

873
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,920
Let's look after each other.

874
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,850
I wouldn't dare.

875
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,760
He even dared to hit my...

876
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,510
Dared to hit Miss Bai.

877
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,510
He'd better not let me catch him.

878
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,110
I'll beat him to death if I do.

879
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:41,840
Don't worry.

880
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:42,840
You'll

881
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,280
definitely meet that person again.

882
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,920
Next time,

883
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,150
let him pay the price with interest.

884
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,620
Where did this pigeon come from?

885
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:12,820
We're on the run now.

886
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,260
Who are you writing to?

887
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,510
Master Puzhu.

888
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,140
[Jingnan]

889
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,480
Sir,

890
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,920
we found 50 boxes of Evil Pills

891
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,380
from the ships at the dock.

892
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,140
The next one

893
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,970
is the Jingnan Sect.

894
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,010
I'll go first.

895
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:58,310
Follow me.

896
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:58,760
Yes.

897
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,190
Are you two

898
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,450
on such good terms now?

899
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,030
What's going on here?

900
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,590
He's been looking for

901
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,360
the Fengliu Shop's hideouts along the way.

902
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,560
When did this happen?

903
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,230
While you were asleep,

904
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:17,030
I asked Shen to help me investigate.

905
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,760
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

906
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:21,440
So you deliberately
exposed your whereabouts

907
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,240
just for this?

908
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:23,770
After Shei reached the Sword Alliance,

909
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:24,510
she'd surely reveal

910
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:25,910
the clues we discovered.

911
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,990
And the Sword Alliance would definitely
use this information

912
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:30,120
to investigate Fengliu Shop's bases.

913
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:31,770
By exposing my whereabouts

914
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:33,920
to attract the main forces
of the Fengliu Shop,

915
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,070
we could prevent casualties

916
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,630
of the Sword Alliance as much as possible.

917
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,360
Shen helps me investigate

918
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,110
the Fengliu Shop's remaining hideouts
along the way.

919
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,150
This way, we can help

920
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:44,380
the Sword Alliance eliminate
more of the Fengliu Shop's forces.

921
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,710
There's one more thing.

922
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:46,400
What?

923
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:48,710
Hurrying to the Biluo Palace too soon

924
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,510
is pointless.

925
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:01,070
Are we really going to the Biluo Palace?

926
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:01,670
Looks like

927
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,590
the reputation of Biluo Palace

928
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:04,550
precedes it.

929
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,650
That's the most mysterious place,

930
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,510
even exceeding the Shisan Tower.

931
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,180
No one has ever been to the Biluo Palace.

932
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:14,880
Or rather,

933
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,190
no one has ever gotten

934
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,250
out of there alive.

935
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,510
Everyone knows

936
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:20,170
it's in the northwest region,

937
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,320
but no one knows its exact location.

938
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:22,850
Catch it.

939
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,200
Someone has been there

940
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:28,800
and

941
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,350
made it out alive.
