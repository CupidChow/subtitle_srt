[Episode 28]

00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,760
[Tingyun Pavilion]

4
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,120
I also brought gifts for Miss Shei,

5
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,400
Stone, Mr. Tang,

6
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,509
and Gu Xitan.

7
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:35,759
Foxy Tang went back to his room to rest

8
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,509
after seeing Minister Tang off.

9
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:38,479
Your Highness, why don't you

10
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,710
let me keep these for you?

11
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,000
Don't call me Your Highness.

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,310
Although I'm a princess now,

13
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,039
I grew up in the Sword Alliance.

14
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,150
Only when

15
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:45,920
I'm with you guys

16
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,180
do I feel truly at ease.

17
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,490
This is my home.

18
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,350
Me too.

19
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,009
Not until Mr. Tang took me in

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,759
and I met everyone

21
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,080
did I know what a home feels like.

22
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,130
Give it back!

23
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,280
Why are you chasing me?

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,790
Xianling Herb is for making soup,

25
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,870
not for feeding curse bugs.

26
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,600
Let me feed it to the bugs first!

27
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,930
Give it back to me!

28
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,560
Don't chase me!

29
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,230
If you want it,

30
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,490
go pick some yourself!

31
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,400
Come back!

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,470
Stop chasing me!

33
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,610
Alright,
let's not talk about this anymore.

34
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,870
With us here and Foxy Tang,

35
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,079
as long as we're together,

36
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,240
this will always be

37
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,840
our home.

38
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,820
Someone as strong-willed as her

39
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,110
has finally stepped into a bright future.

40
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,840
How could I not be happy for her?

41
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,350
But...

42
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,880
she's drifting away from me.

43
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,079
It hurts, Senior.

44
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,520
-You always…
-It's a good thing that it hurts.

45
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,620
A promising young man like you
shouldn't belittle yourself,

46
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,020
or you'll remain this way
your entire life.

47
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,560
I'm not.

48
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,150
I'm just...

49
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,079
Speak properly.

50
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,060
Don't be so bashful.

51
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,420
The way you look now

52
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,020
is what really makes you unworthy of her.

53
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,570
Look at them.

54
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,280
Aside from Tang Lici,

55
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,240
who among them has a noble background?

56
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,370
Do they act like you?

57
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,520
Yes.

58
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,230
She's a princess now.

59
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,280
But she...

60
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,390
is also Ms. Zhong from the Sword Alliance.

61
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,800
Your swordsmanship is so poor.

62
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,360
You still have the nerve
to think about this?

63
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,150
Besides,

64
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,990
if she's really keeping her distance
from you because of that,

65
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,940
why bother

66
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,230
pursuing her?

67
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,110
You're right.

68
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,020
Thank you, Senior.

69
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,800
Good.

70
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:32,840
Go now.

71
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:39,790
Senior.

72
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,280
You seem to understand everything
so clearly.

73
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,940
How come...

74
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,240
you still don't have a wife?

75
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,050
Gu Xitan, you little brat! I...

76
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:48,890
Zhong!

77
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,480
I have to say,

78
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,350
the dinner Shei made tonight was amazing.

79
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,030
I was about to burst.

80
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,710
You're still alive, aren't you?

81
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,590
Why is it that after spending so much time

82
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,470
with Foxy Tang,

83
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,530
you've only picked up his bad habits?

84
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,750
The Little Fox isn't here?

85
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,680
He went to see off the Minister Tang

86
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,480
and hasn't come back yet.

87
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,040
He's probably
slacking off somewhere again.

88
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Come on, Senior.

89
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,600
I don't mean to blame you,

90
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
but you can't just show up

91
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,800
out of nowhere

92
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,720
just because I used to admire you.

93
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,270
That's so...

94
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,310
Stop it.

95
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,510
I, your senior,

96
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,970
am in a foul mood right now.

97
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,720
I finally made it to Mount Baojing,

98
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,180
and none of you were there—

99
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,420
not even the old woman.

100
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,540
Who are you calling an old woman?

101
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,190
Whoever responds first, that's who.

102
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:48,680
You...

103
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,220
You don't have to be like this.

104
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:52,970
Where is Xue Fu?

105
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,510
Xue Fu is so small.

106
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,630
I'd like to see

107
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,830
what kind of precious treasure this is.

108
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,800
A chicken?

109
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,000
My little darling Xue Fu.

110
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,590
Wait, wait.

111
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,150
Wait.

112
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,390
Xue Fu is a chicken?

113
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,030
-Chicken?
-Chicken?

114
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,430
-She's Xue Fu!
-She's Xue Fu!

115
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,870
Isn't Xue Fu a chicken?

116
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,720
-Xue Fu is not a chicken.
-Xue Fu is not a chicken.

117
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,580
-Xue Fu is Xue Fu.
-Xue Fu is Xue Fu.

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,430
Shen,

119
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,270
this...

120
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,090
Xue Fu is not a chicken.

121
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,430
Xue Fu is Xue Fu.

122
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:28,690
Look.

123
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,670
How interesting.

124
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,040
You two really are interesting.

125
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,510
See? I told you.

126
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,730
You're the only blind one here

127
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,570
who can't see how beautiful Xue Fu is.

128
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,100
From the very first glance,

129
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,040
I felt she was unnaturally pretty.

130
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,770
Look at her fur, those little paws—

131
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,310
one of a kind

132
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,920
in this world, got it?

133
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,550
Shui Duopo, I'm telling you,

134
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,430
Xue Fu is just

135
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,560
temporarily staying with you.

136
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,690
I'll be checking on her anytime I want.

137
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,890
Your claws are dirty. Don't touch it.

138
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,630
Just one touch.

139
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,560
Don't touch her!

140
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,140
So cute.

141
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,750
Am I the only one who doesn't see it?

142
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,390
So cute.

143
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,550
Just one last step,

144
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,920
and I can turn back time

145
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,560
and rewrite fate.

146
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,290
You'll help me, won't you,

147
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,800
Brother?

148
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,050
You were the crown prince
of the former dynasty?

149
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,840
The chaos caused by Yique Yinyang

150
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,240
began because my father trusted traitors.

151
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,980
Though I was the crown prince,

152
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,490
I failed to stop my father.

153
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,750
I could only watch helplessly

154
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,410
as people suffered terribly.

155
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,780
Your Highness,

156
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,510
the rebels have taken several cities.

157
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,780
His Majesty is still unconscious.

158
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,840
At a time like this,

159
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,120
have you really made up your mind

160
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,380
to go to Tianjing Pavilion to cultivate?

161
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,370
I can't save

162
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,280
hundreds of thousands of lives.

163
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,610
Therefore,

164
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,159
I might as well go to Tianjing Pavilion
to cultivate.

165
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:38,870
I am,

166
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,270
among all those still living,

167
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,490
the one who deserves death the most.

168
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,550
If I'm still alive,

169
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,390
then others certainly shouldn't die.

170
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,920
If I cannot forgive others,

171
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,060
I certainly cannot forgive myself.

172
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,390
Then I must
make an agreement with you, Sir.

173
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,250
We'll keep each other's secrets.

174
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,200
Don't tell anyone

175
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,150
about my secret,

176
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,720
and I won't tell anyone

177
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,120
who you really are.

178
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,330
A mistake is a mistake.

179
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,870
Pain doesn't disappear

180
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,590
just because you hide the truth.

181
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,560
I'm telling you,

182
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,980
this myna is really smart.

183
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,830
It just called me a genius.

184
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,180
Are you sure it wasn't insulting you?

185
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:20,950
How could that be an insult?

186
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,510
What's going on?

187
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,800
It definitely was insulting you.

188
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,130
What are you looking at?

189
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,480
Mr. Chi, Senior.

190
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,970
What's so special about this bird?

191
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,809
This myna's no ordinary bird.

192
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,250
It can not only talk,

193
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,380
but also

194
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:38,240
tell a person's

195
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
most accurate trait

196
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,570
the moment it sees them.

197
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,030
The most accurate trait?

198
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:43,870
Yes.

199
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,680
Princess, Princess.

200
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,080
See?

201
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
Right?

202
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,960
Smart, huh?

203
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,820
This bird is really interesting.

204
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,160
What about me?

205
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,280
What about me?

206
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,270
Silly dog.

207
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,080
Silly dog.

208
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,440
You...

209
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,200
-Mr. Chi...
-I'll...

210
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,670
Don't be rash.

211
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,720
I'll teach you a lesson!

212
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,970
Chi Yun! Chi Yun!

213
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:08,170
When something's out of the ordinary,
there's usually something fishy behind it.

214
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,830
Master Puzhu, your leg injury

215
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,960
has healed already.

216
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,760
It's all thanks to you,

217
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,970
Mr. Tang.

218
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,000
It's all thanks to Shui Duopo's

219
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,330
superb medical skills.

220
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,880
It had nothing to do with me.

221
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,590
I can tell

222
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,800
you've got something on your mind too.

223
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,080
Crown prince! Crown prince!

224
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,570
Lately, there have been

225
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,870
so many of these gossiping birds

226
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,130
in the Sword Alliance.

227
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,690
Master Puzhu, you don't get out much,

228
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,620
so it's no wonder

229
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,650
you don't know.

230
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,270
Mr. Tang,

231
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,310
did you come to see me early this morning

232
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,510
just to watch mynas leaving their nest?

233
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,840
Mynas

234
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,860
are birds with regular patterns.

235
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,360
They leave their nests at dawn

236
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,480
and return at dusk.

237
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,750
Have you received any letters
from your family

238
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,270
during these years

239
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,630
at Tianjing Pavilion?

240
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,180
Cultivators

241
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,370
sever their ties to family,

242
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,480
like flowers parted from their branches,

243
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,740
drifting with the wind

244
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,030
and never asking where they came from.

245
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,830
But what if...

246
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,240
your family

247
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,510
wants to see you?

248
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,050
Once separated,

249
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,670
meeting again is but a delusion.

250
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,150
Mr. Tang,
why do you ask these questions today?

251
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,000
I just saw birds leaving their nests

252
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,800
and felt somewhat melancholic.

253
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,910
My ties to the past were severed

254
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,170
the moment I entered Tianjing Pavilion.

255
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,690
But yours

256
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,670
are still trapped

257
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,870
in that Zhoudi Tower.

258
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,470
Sir, are you trying to lecture me again?

259
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,600
I heard about the Battle of Peony Pavilion

260
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,550
from Master Shao

261
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,970
and Master Cheng.

262
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,970
I did hold prejudice against you

263
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,390
in the past.

264
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,670
Mr. Tang, your obsession

265
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,770
may end up hurting you.

266
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,240
I hope you

267
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,860
can let go of your past.

268
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,240
So you're

269
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,840
concerned about me?

270
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,610
But perhaps...

271
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,840
I need this obsession

272
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,750
so I won't be

273
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,080
a wandering ghost.

274
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,480
My injury is healed.

275
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,550
I'm heading down the mountain today

276
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,910
to lead the Sword Alliance disciples

277
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,030
in investigating leads

278
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,480
on Fengliu Shop's new base

279
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,940
and to demolish it in time.

280
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,120
Then I wish you

281
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,340
never have to look back

282
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,810
on your sacred path.

283
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,700
Mr. Tang.

284
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,150
It's nothing.

285
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,220
You may go down the mountain, Sir.

286
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,880
I, Xijin,

287
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,600
formally invite you to Shisan Tower
for a discussion

288
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,400
on the plan to restore the country.

289
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,440
You have 3 days.

290
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,520
If you don't arrive by then,

291
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,760
I will announce

292
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,550
your noble status to the world.

293
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,090
And Shisan Tower

294
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,250
will share honor and disgrace with you.

295
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,490
Xijin.

296
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,800
Not only are you going to reveal

297
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,460
Master Puzhu's identity
in the former dynasty,

298
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,870
but you also want to involve him

299
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,390
with Shisan Tower.

300
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,630
Master Fang,

301
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,290
you really never learn to behave.

302
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,220
Restore the country?

303
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,120
You're trying to

304
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,050
drag Master Puzhu into rebellion.

305
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,000
I, Tang Lici,

306
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,520
am here specifically

307
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,320
to visit Fang Pingzhai, the head

308
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,130
of the Fallen Shisan Tower.

309
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,840
Mr. Tang,

310
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,720
if I remember correctly,

311
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,350
the letter

312
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,680
was meant for Master Puzhu, right?

313
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,680
Master Puzhu...

314
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,770
doesn't want to see you.

315
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,830
That's really unfair.

316
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,870
You treat me like nothing,

317
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,320
yet you care so much

318
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,560
for my brother,

319
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,330
the crown prince of the former dynasty,

320
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,570
Chai Zongxun,

321
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,120
now the high and mighty Master Puzhu

322
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,700
of Tianjing Pavilion,

323
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,840
even venturing into Shisan Tower alone
for him.

324
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,700
I have to admit,

325
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,240
I'm a little jealous.

326
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,960
The first time I ventured into the tower,

327
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,150
I already told you

328
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,400
that being overly obsessed

329
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,910
isn't a good thing.

330
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,840
So is being like Master Puzhu,

331
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
detached from everything,

332
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,330
really a good thing?

333
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,320
Or do you really think he has

334
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
transcended worldly attachments

335
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,720
and let go of everything?

336
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:14,910
Wrong.

337
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,790
He's just too ashamed

338
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,910
to face his disgraceful past.

339
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,910
He's avoiding it.

340
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,240
If Chai Zongxun

341
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,510
truly has a clear conscience,

342
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,080
why doesn't he dare to face me?

343
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,150
Back then, he let the rebel army
into the city,

344
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,120
leaving the country to me,

345
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,120
an inexperienced boy,

346
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,720
and then simply walked away.

347
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,120
Fortunately, that night

348
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,840
I took the advice of my old ministers

349
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,870
and escaped through the secret passage
with the royal treasury.

350
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,390
That's how I was able to found
the Fallen Shisan Tower

351
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,840
and raise my loyal assassins.

352
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,390
Now,

353
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,750
I've finally found a way

354
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,720
to stand under the sun again,

355
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,270
openly and rightfully.

356
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,430
That throne has always belonged...

357
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,360
Kneel!

358
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,290
Remnant of the former dynasty!

359
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,290
Don't you realize

360
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,750
who you're talking to?

361
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,270
Tell me.

362
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,800
Who's behind all this?

363
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,360
You knew from the start

364
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,720
that I could use the Rebirth Scroll.

365
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,580
Liu Yan would never tell you this.

366
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,760
Whoever told you

367
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,120
must be someone else.

368
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,510
Who is this person?

369
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,270
Is it Ghostly Peony?

370
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,410
How about this?

371
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,650
Teach me the Rebirth Scroll,

372
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,450
and I'll tell you where he is.

373
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,940
Mr. Tang, you truly are clever.

374
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,640
This is called Inverted Dream.

375
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,360
It is a magical artifact
created by Qiaoyi Qiankun,

376
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,120
capable of traveling to the past

377
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,080
and reversing time.

378
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,660
It contains the power from Tianren Realm.

379
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,570
It needs the Rebirth Scroll
to activate it.

380
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,300
Originally,

381
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,350
I asked Chai Zongxun
to come to Shisan Tower

382
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,350
because I wanted him to persuade you

383
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,720
to activate this magical artifact for me.

384
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,110
I didn't expect you to come uninvited.

385
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,700
What a pleasant surprise.

386
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,120
Tang Lici,

387
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,440
now I command you

388
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,960
to use the power of the Rebirth Scroll

389
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,200
to activate the Inverted Dream

390
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,800
and help me rewrite history.

391
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:08,970
Otherwise,

392
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,240
my men will immediately

393
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
announce to the world

394
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,720
that Master Puzhu is the crown prince

395
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,980
of the former dynasty.

396
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,460
Think about it.

397
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,380
If the current emperor

398
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,440
learns of this,

399
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,359
will he turn a blind eye

400
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:22,510
and keep his alliance

401
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,000
with the Sword Alliance

402
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,030
to fight against the Fengliu Shop,

403
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,400
or will he see

404
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,350
Chai Zongxun and me,

405
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,120
remnants of the former dynasty,

406
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,510
as the greater threat?

407
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,420
Then you'll have to die.

408
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,310
Killing me won't do you any good.

409
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:37,770
Wait.

410
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,200
Xijin,

411
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,300
I'll go in with you.

412
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,730
Not entering Tianjing Pavilion

413
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,390
and instead fighting
alongside you and Father—

414
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,340
isn't that what you wanted?

415
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,560
That's my brother!

416
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,610
Master Puzhu.

417
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,330
This is my own karmic debt

418
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,260
and the Chai family's sin.

419
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,120
If the Inverted Dream is real,

420
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,230
I'll have a chance to rewrite history

421
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,410
and take responsibility on the day

422
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,410
of the rebellion,

423
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,130
sparing the people

424
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,460
from the flames of war.

425
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,320
Let's see whether this choice

426
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,200
can change

427
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,360
the outcome.

428
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,450
Can it really

429
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,300
change the outcome?

430
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,310
I see.

431
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,200
Master Puzhu,

432
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,790
your own karma

433
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,560
should be resolved by yourself.

434
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,680
I will

435
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,270
activate this magical artifact for you

436
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,870
and send you back to the past.

437
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,480
I've already set the time—

438
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,720
the year of the Battle of Tiandu Peak.

439
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,630
The Inverted Dream is real.

440
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:30,470
Your Highness!

441
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,310
Your Highness,

442
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,770
you can't enter Tianjing Pavilion

443
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:34,730
at such a time!

444
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,300
The rebel army has taken several cities,

445
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,540
His Majesty is still unconscious,

446
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,830
and the Imperial Preceptor
is at Tiandu Peak,

447
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,450
far away and unable to return in time.

448
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,090
Yet you want to enter
Tianjing Pavilion now?

449
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:42,980
The enemy is at our gates.

450
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,370
Your Highness, please reconsider!

451
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,050
Your Highness, I beg you

452
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,210
to guard the capital

453
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,710
and quell the rebellion!

454
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,680
Your Highness!

455
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,210
Brother,

456
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,720
over the years I've been sending

457
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,750
Shisan Tower's sworn assassins

458
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,830
across the land to gather intelligence

459
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,030
and uncover the cause

460
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,200
of this war.

461
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,310
I know exactly where the main forces

462
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,510
of the rebel army are

463
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,030
and where they hide their supplies.

464
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,240
We have a huge advantage,

465
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,700
enough to win this battle.

466
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,200
If you stay to help me

467
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,090
defend the capital

468
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,260
and pin the enemy down,

469
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,830
I can strike under cover of night,

470
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,400
slip past their front,
penetrate into their rear

471
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,640
to burn their provisions,

472
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,300
and deal them a decisive blow.

473
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,240
Will this plan end the war

474
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,980
and reduce casualties?

475
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,220
All these years,

476
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,200
I've been running simulations
of this battle every day.

477
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,460
No one knows this battle better than I do,

478
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,920
and no one knows better

479
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,480
how to win it.

480
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,960
I promise

481
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,640
I won't seek glory in battle;

482
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,040
I will limit the fighting

483
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,470
so losses are minimized.

484
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,090
Carry out my orders:

485
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,200
dispatch 5000 elite troops immediately

486
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,560
for the Sixth Prince to command.

487
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,640
Bring the civilians outside the city
into the walls for shelter.

488
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,170
Open the treasury for military expenses
and soldier compensation.

489
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,100
Spread the word

490
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,510
that His Majesty
has regained consciousness

491
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,350
and intends to execute
the traitor Yique Yinyang

492
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,650
to uphold imperial order.

493
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,910
If the rebels abandon their cause

494
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,180
and surrender to the royal forces,

495
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,260
they will be pardoned.

496
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,000
If they persist in their rebellion,

497
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,510
they will face punishment.

498
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,200
Meanwhile, urgently summon
the loyal forces everywhere

499
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,130
to aid the throne

500
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,570
and save the nation.

501
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,720
Yes, Your Highness!

502
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,960
Master Puzhu is truly

503
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,160
a man of great talent.

504
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,590
However,

505
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,440
when you returned to the past,

506
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,030
why did you all avoid

507
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,640
mentioning that topic?

508
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,370
Master Shao,

509
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,480
during the turmoil of the former dynasty,

510
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,610
why didn't Yique Yinyang come to help?

511
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,810
Wasn't he the Imperial Preceptor?

512
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,750
I've been puzzled

513
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,210
about this for a long time.

514
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,270
According to captured palace eunuchs,

515
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,160
Yique Yinyang

516
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,220
once sighted a dragon at Tiandu Peak,

517
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,200
so when the former dynasty's emperor

518
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,130
fell into a coma,

519
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,170
he chose that place to pray for him.

520
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,350
Tiandu Peak is far from the capital.

521
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,640
When the rebel army heard the news,

522
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,440
they believed the time to strike had come,

523
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,510
so they called heroes
from the martial arts world

524
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,070
to jointly attack Yique Yinyang

525
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,440
to pin him down.

526
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,680
Taking advantage of that, the rebel army

527
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,940
breached the capital.

528
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,880
Strangely, however,

529
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,550
after the battle,

530
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,640
no signs of any ritual

531
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,070
were found at the site.

532
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,720
According to Yique Yinyang's attendant,

533
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,880
he simply stood on the cliff

534
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,200
every day, gazing into the distance

535
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,350
and staring at the sky

536
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,650
day and night without rest.

537
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,420
And he wouldn't let anyone approach him,

538
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,080
which was quite frightening.

539
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,200
Some say

540
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,550
Yique Yinyang wasn't looking at the sky

541
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,040
but waiting for someone.

542
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:58,960
Or rather,

543
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,570
waiting for the dragon he had seen before.

544
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,840
There are many theories anyway.

545
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,240
Waiting for someone?

546
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,170
Your Highness!

547
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,990
The Sixth Prince's surprise attack
succeeded;

548
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,550
he took the rebels' supply port,

549
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,750
and the rebels
have withdrawn from the capital.

550
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,510
We won!

551
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,970
Where is the Sixth Prince now?

552
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,740
The Sixth Prince

553
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,030
seized the rebels' warships

554
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,270
and is preparing to lead the army north

555
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,130
to Tiandu Peak!

556
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,650
Saddle the horses!

557
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,120
You're going to save Yique Yinyang?

558
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,980
Are you insane?

559
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,460
Listen to me carefully!

560
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,960
I've run through this scenario many times.

561
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,160
With conventional tactics,

562
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,320
we won't win.

563
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,830
The rebels
have only temporarily withdrawn.

564
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,850
Only by seizing this opportunity
to take the port

565
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,270
and send a fleet straight to Tiandu Peak

566
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,810
to bring back the Imperial Preceptor

567
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,480
can we turn the situation around.

568
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,830
Otherwise, with our forces as they are,

569
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,720
we'll keep losing
no matter how many times we try.

570
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,160
Let me tell you what will happen next

571
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,460
according to my calculations.

572
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,130
Rebirth Scroll,

573
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:11,610
close.

574
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,590
After the rebel army is destroyed,

575
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,730
the frontier army will revolt.

576
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:15,710
We'll suppress the frontier army,

577
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,580
then the imperial guards will rebel.

578
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,410
Why is it not working?

579
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,960
The war will last for years,

580
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,680
and the land will remain soaked
with the people's blood.

581
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,080
No matter how hard we try,

582
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,960
the result
will always be the same—a fallen nation

583
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,280
and countless deaths.

584
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,950
It takes 4 hours

585
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,070
to extinguish the Inverted Dream,

586
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,510
which corresponds to 4 months

587
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,400
in our world.

588
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,350
After 4 months,
the Imperial Preceptor will return,

589
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,150
and our nation will be restored.

590
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,250
I had planned to bring Tang Lici here

591
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,400
so he could witness the glory
of my grand endeavor.

592
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,380
But by now, he is likely

593
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,410
still unconscious beneath Mount Li.

594
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,740
What a pity!

595
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,780
So that's how it is.

596
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:02,900
Brother,

597
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,440
now,

598
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,750
only the Imperial Preceptor has the power

599
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,880
to awe the world

600
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,480
and bring peace to the realm.

601
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,550
As long as he lives, the nation endures.

602
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,720
I'll bring your empire back

603
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,240
for you!

604
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:14,490
Guards!

605
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:15,930
From this day forward,

606
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,070
the Crown Prince is forbidden to leave

607
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:17,930
the naval camp.

608
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,120
Yique Yinyang wasn't looking at the sky

609
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,560
but waiting for someone.

610
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,680
Or rather,

611
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,440
waiting for the dragon he had seen before.

612
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,960
It takes 4 hours

613
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,740
to extinguish the Inverted Dream,

614
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,400
which corresponds to 4 months

615
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,240
in our world.

616
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,110
Time?

617
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,400
The dragon?

618
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,310
No,

619
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,300
Fang Pingzhai miscalculated.

620
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,530
What he refers to as this moment

621
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,860
is actually half a month

622
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,630
within the Inverted Dream.

623
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,680
At that time,

624
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,340
I had not yet arrived in Shenzhou.

625
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,010
So

626
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,360
what Yique Yinyang saw back then

627
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,830
was me, fighting the dragon,

628
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,500
preparing to escape from Tianren Realm.

629
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,510
If I enter the Inverted Dream as well,

630
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,110
with my full mastery

631
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,720
of the Rebirth Scroll at that time,

632
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,180
I will be able to kill Yique Yinyang
for sure.

633
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,880
[Tiandu Peak]

634
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,250
Why...

635
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:15,750
am I...

636
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,480
inside Yique Yinyang's body?

637
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,630
Yique Yinyang,

638
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,000
you're not leaving here today!

639
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,030
Fang Zhou.

640
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,750
Fang Zhou?

641
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,960
Who's in my mind?

642
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,920
"Power shakes the world," Jiangnan Feng,

643
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,180
"Ant trying to shake a tree," Wei Beiyin,

644
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,420
Heavenly Flame Sword Phoenix, Yu Xuanqing,

645
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,370
Kuanglan Wuxing, Zhu Yan,

646
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,490
"Deer in the wind," Qin Kunwu,

647
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:26,010
The Combination of Zen and Martial Arts,
Master Tainxuan,

648
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,160
and you...

649
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,350
Seven‑String True Tune,

650
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,720
Fang Zhou.

651
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,080
You think you can take me down

652
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,080
with the entire martial arts world?

653
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,850
That's far too heavy a burden

654
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,590
for you to bear.

655
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,130
Today's battle

656
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,070
is either the slaying of a demon

657
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,600
or a martyrdom
for the path of righteousness.

658
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,680
Just self-indulgent heroism.

659
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,980
The Sixth Heaven Demon,

660
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,680
Silence.

661
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,280
Seven‑String True Tune!

662
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:24,870
Break!

663
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,240
Mortals,

664
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,820
how dare you offend a deity?

665
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,240
With one strike,

666
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,300
I could kill you all.

667
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,670
Fang Zhou!

668
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,400
Stop!

669
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,140
Stop it!

670
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,100
Everyone,

671
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,070
allow me

672
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,110
to make the first move!

673
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,830
Light Technique!

674
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,230
Heavenly Sacred Light!

675
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,970
Tai'e Sword's Offering!

676
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,340
The Seven‑String True Tune.

677
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,440
Westwind Slashing Wildfire!

678
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,010
Demon-subduing Dharma Form!

679
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,170
I'm not dead yet.

680
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:05,370
No.

681
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,000
It's Yique Yinyang who's not dead.

682
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,720
But with such severe injuries,

683
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,580
he cannot possibly heal himself.

684
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,270
Ghostly Peony?

685
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,750
As long as you are alive,

686
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,480
I haven't lost.

687
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,070
Master Puzhu.

688
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,920
Why?

689
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,130
Why?

690
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,760
Are you alright?

691
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,950
Where exactly did I go wrong?

692
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,230
Where?

693
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,040
Master Fang,

694
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,610
it's time to wake up.

695
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,450
You cannot change
what has already happened.

696
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,150
As its name,

697
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,370
Inverted Dream, suggests,

698
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:13,190
it was nothing

699
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,449
but a dream of the past.

700
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,810
To cling too tightly to a dream

701
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,960
is mere delusion.

702
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,070
Reverse time?

703
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,840
Ghostly Peony!

704
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,969
You lied to me!

705
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,810
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

706
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,290
You've spent a great deal of energy

707
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,720
to activate the Inverted Dream.

708
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,470
I

709
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:10,910
will remember

710
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:11,660
this favor.

711
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,230
I just

712
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,560
wanted to find an answer

713
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,000
for myself.

714
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,400
Tang Lici,

715
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,760
I didn't expect
you could enter the dream as well.

716
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,100
Who were you inside it?

717
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:44,800
Master Fang,

718
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,110
to me,

719
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,280
this wasn't a dream.

720
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,920
It was a trap.

721
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,440
A trap

722
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,210
whose beginning I don't know,

723
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,460
whose boundaries I can't see.

724
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,890
All I know is that

725
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,020
I am its prey.

726
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,400
I

727
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,550
hate that feeling.

728
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,890
Foxy Tang!

729
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,550
Where did you go behind my back

730
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,630
this time?

731
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,190
Chi Yun.

732
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,780
What are you...

733
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,660
What are you doing standing here?

734
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,550
He has something on his mind.

735
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,610
Don't disturb him.

736
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,030
Ghostly Peony!

737
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,150
You lied to me!

738
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,010
Ghostly Peony?

739
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,670
The one I saw under the sea

740
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,730
was Ghostly Peony.

741
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,480
He's Yique Yinyang's

742
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,440
backup plan.

743
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,140
As long as you're alive,

744
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,070
I haven't lost.

745
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:27,710
Could it be

746
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,970
that Yique Yinyang is still alive?

747
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,870
Or is he extending his life

748
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:32,600
somehow,

749
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,850
plotting his resurrection?

750
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,670
And I...

751
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,530
Mount Baojing?

752
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,110
No.

753
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,780
Perhaps long before this,

754
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,030
he had been

755
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,280
watching me

756
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,340
like an unseen eye.

757
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,740
He has been guiding me all along,

758
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,920
making me believe

759
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,700
that he and I are alike.

760
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:50,840
Why?

761
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:00,820
Now,

762
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,320
he has become
the most perfect Tianren body

763
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,360
ever created in Tianren Realm.

764
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,760
So that's it.

765
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,230
He wants my Tianren body.

766
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,810
I haven't seen you for days.

767
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,150
Where have you been?

768
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,160
I went to the Fallen Shisan Tower

769
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,080
to take care of a small problem.

770
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,360
Master Shao.

771
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,030
Yique Yinyang

772
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,710
is not dead.

773
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,510
With the 7 masters
on Tiandu Peak attacking him

774
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,550
and the injuries

775
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,840
he suffered,

776
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,920
how could he possibly still be alive?

777
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,450
Master Shao, don't forget,

778
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,280
Yique Yinyang and I

779
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,180
share the same origin.

780
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,280
He possesses

781
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,980
the same physique as I do.

782
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,030
Oh no.

783
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:04,920
However,

784
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,870
though he's not dead,

785
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,710
he's not exactly alive either.

786
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,640
What do you mean?

787
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:10,870
Resurrection

788
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,670
requires a body.

789
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,840
Without one,

790
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,230
he cannot truly be resurrected.

791
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,190
What do you mean?

792
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,000
What I mean is—

793
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,920
I have my own way.

794
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,320
You might as well tell me now.

795
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,670
Master Shao,

796
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,480
someone will tell you

797
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:36,760
everything

798
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,660
you want to know in the future.

799
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,190
Mr. Tang,

800
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,500
I know you always have your own ideas.

801
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,360
I won't

802
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,070
ask further.

803
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,550
But I hope

804
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,840
that at least one day,

805
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,530
you can let go
of the restraints in your heart

806
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,590
and live once as the true Tang Lici.

807
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,440
Thank you, Master Shao.

808
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,280
Mr. Tang,

809
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,150
who is this statue of?

810
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,960
You've always been clever.

811
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,890
Can't you guess?

812
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,150
Fang Zhou.

813
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,310
You're going to die here today.

814
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,030
If one person's death

815
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,190
can save everyone,

816
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,750
then why not?

817
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,280
Fang Zhou,

818
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,710
if one person's death

819
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,060
can save everyone else,

820
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,880
does that person have to die?

821
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,630
Lici,

822
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,980
living is a right everyone deserves.

823
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,390
No matter who you are,

824
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:25,830
you shouldn't give up.

825
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,880
Looking back,

826
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,790
at that time, Fang Zhou

827
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,120
must have already known

828
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,760
that I am the key

829
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,690
to Yique Yinyang's resurrection.

830
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,610
I didn't understand back then.

831
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,400
Now,

832
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,740
I no longer have the chance to ask.

833
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:58,850
Mr. Tang,

834
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,350
why are you carving this puppet?

835
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,060
Because...

836
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,150
I finally understand

837
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,880
what he was thinking back then.

838
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,250
Rice cakes?

839
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,060
Chi kept saying he wanted some.

840
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,920
He said it wouldn't be New Year
without them.

841
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,030
So I made some.

842
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,410
He's quite good at making demands.

843
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:36,670
By the way,

844
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,190
I also prepared some

845
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,050
for Shui Duopo.

846
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,010
I'll take them to her
while they're still hot.

847
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,360
Mr. Tang,

848
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,870
I know you've always had your own ideas.

849
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,590
I

850
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,570
won't ask further.

851
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,480
But I hope

852
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,440
that at least one day,

853
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:00,130
you can let go
of the restraints in your heart

854
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,590
and live once as the true Tang Lici.

855
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,930
Then, before I do that,

856
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:08,350
I'll live one day as the real Tang Lici

857
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,190
and live for myself.

858
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:25,070
Senior.

859
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,730
What are you doing here?

860
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,300
I just made some rice cakes

861
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,760
and brought them for you.

862
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,010
Come inside.

863
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:38,550
Senior,

864
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,410
try some.

865
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:50,110
Your...

866
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,900
Your cooking
is better than the imperial chefs'.

867
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,090
If you'd like more,

868
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,470
I'll bring some again next time.

869
00:43:59,110 --> 00:43:59,800
Good.

870
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,330
Please bring more then.

871
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,360
I'll reward you.

872
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:03,910
No need.

873
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:05,690
I'm just glad you like it.

874
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:08,320
I'm not like Xue Xianzi,

875
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,320
that freeloader.

876
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,090
Give me your hand.

877
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:15,190
I'll take your pulse.

878
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,230
I'm not sick.

879
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,740
I'm not saying you are.

880
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,390
I just want to write you a prescription

881
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,150
to replenish your energy
and balance your body.

882
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:21,960
Besides,

883
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,070
I'm quite interested in the constitution

884
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,190
of medicine men.

885
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:26,360
Think of it

886
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,230
as me doing a bit of research.

887
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:28,590
Here.

888
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,250
It's just taking your pulse—

889
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,580
why are you being so shy?

890
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:39,510
Your constitution

891
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,800
really is unusual.

892
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,070
What's this?

893
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:54,920
Senior,

894
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,660
why don't we...

895
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,070
just forget it?

896
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,160
I'm sorry.

897
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:01,810
I didn't mean it that way.

898
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,590
I'm just a bit curious—

899
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:06,710
how have you managed to survive until now?
